1. Make sure all scripts are executable: chmod 755 *

***Feel free to run "run_pipeline.sh" by doing "source run_pipeline.sh" and then you might directly jump to step 12
Note: to run the codes in this step, you need to use 4 RTX 8000 GPUs, which will reproduce our results exactly. 
If the machine that runs this code does not have 4 GPUs, you need to run run_pipeline_1GPU.sh by doing "source run_pipeline_1GPU.sh"  

Detailed explanations about the code are given below, in case you want to read them.

2. Deactivate the current virtual environment "Litcoin":
  conda deactivate

3. Create a new virtual environment:
  conda create --name Litcoin2 python==3.8.8

4. Activate Litcoin2:
  conda activate Litcoin2

5. Install all the necessary packages:
  python -m pip install -r requirements_step2.5.txt

6. Data Splitting for consistency checking model:
  python generate_input.py
    This will do the following:
      a. Generate the final BIO format litcoin test set (100 asbstracts): Litcoin_testset.json
      b. Generate the final BIO format litcoin train set (362 asbstracts) and dev set (38 asbstracts): split1/litcoin_train_update_362.json, split1/litcoin_dev_update_38.json
  split_1.json includes the pre-defined split rulls for training and dev set

7. Run training script for consistency checking model:
  ./train_roberta.sh
  ***It is noted that this model was trained using 4 RTX 8000 GPUs. To reproduce our result, please use the exact same devices to train.

8. Run prediction on full text data which acquired in the previous steps.
  ./predict_roberta.sh

9. Rename "predictions.txt" and move it to the directory "pipeline_step5":
  cp output/predictions.txt output/predictions_ft.txt
  mv output/predictions_ft.txt ../pipeline_step5

10. Deactivate "Litcoin2":
  conda deactivate

11. Reactivate "Litcoin"
  conda activate Litcoin

12. You might move to 'pipeline_step4':
	cd ../pipeline_step4
