17384765	Chelating agents have been used to treat lead-exposed children since the 1950s, but the metric for gauging therapeutic efficacy has changed over time.	0	150
17384765	When these drugs were first implemented for clinical use, it was common for poor, inner-city children to be brought to emergency rooms with signs of Pb-induced encephalopathy.	151	326
17384765	The chelating agents used at that time, CaNa2EDTA (calcium disodium versenate) and BAL (dimer-caprol), are credited with dramatically reducing the mortality rate in such children, estimated to be 66% before the advent of chelating agents (Foreman 1961) relative to 1–2% thereafter (Chisholm 1968).	327	624
17384765	Fortunately, blood Pb levels of U.S. children have declined dramatically over the past 20 years [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2005], and Pb-induced encephalopathy is rare.	625	816
17384765	However, as evidence mounts that even slightly elevated Pb levels are associated with impaired cognitive functioning in children, there appears to be growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at very low exposure levels.	817	1058
17384765	The CDC (2005) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (2005) recommend chelation for blood Pb levels > 45 μg/dL, but surveillance data from 10 states indicate chelation therapy occurring at blood Pb levels well below this recommended level (CDC, unpublished data).	1059	1323
17384765	There are surprisingly little data upon which to gauge the benefits and possible risks of chelation therapy in children with subclinical Pb poisoning.	1324	1474
17384765	With respect to succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid), the most widely administered chelating agent, only one clinical trial conducted to date has included cognitive measures.	1475	1647
17384765	This study did not detect a benefit of chelation, relative to placebo, in children with blood Pb levels between 20 and 44 μg/dL.	1648	1776
17384765	However, several studies using animal models reported that succimer normalized various behaviors altered by Pb exposure, including forced-swim immobility, activity level, and habituation rate (Gong and Evans 1997).	1777	1991
17384765	Using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure, the present study was designed to a) determine whether treatment with a succimer regimen shown to produce significant reductions in blood and brain Pb levels also lessens the lasting cognitive and affective changes that are produced by a short period of early developmental Pb exposure; and b) determine whether succimer produces lasting cognitive and/or affective impairment when administered in the absence of Pb exposure.	1992	2469
17384765	Findings from the latter group are needed to gauge the safety of prolonged regimens when treating Pb-exposed children, as well as the safety of the drug for treating autistic children, as currently advocated on numerous websites by physicians, autism parent groups, and organizations such as the American College for Advancement in Medicine.	2470	2811
17384765	In this article, we describe a subset of the administered tests—namely, a series of visual attention tests designed to tap several functions reported to be affected in Pb-exposed children, including sustained and selective attention, inhibitory control, learning/associative ability, and regulation of arousal or emotion.	2812	3133
17384765	Two of these tasks, the sustained attention and selective attention tasks, are similar to ones commonly used to assess attention in human subjects, such as the Continuous Performance Test and Leonard’s 5-choice Serial Reaction Task (reviewed by Robbins 2002).	3134	3393
17384765	The study used a 3 × 2 factorial design, with three levels of Pb exposure and two levels of chelation (succimer or vehicle), described below.	3394	3535
17384765	The sample size for the behavioral testing was 120 animals, 20 per group.	3536	3609
17384765	These 120 animals were the female offspring of 60 litters, one succimer-treated and one vehicle-treated animal per litter.	3610	3732
17384765	All procedures were approved by the Cornell Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the housing facilities were accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.	3733	3957
17384765	Nulliparous Long-Evans rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were mated in the laboratory.	3958	4057
17384765	They were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering.	4058	4130
17384765	Twenty-four hours after birth, each litter was culled to 10 pups and assigned to one of three Pb-exposure conditions [no Pb, moderate Pb (Mod-Pb), or high Pb (High-Pb)].	4131	4300
17384765	The dams in the no-Pb group received drinking water (deionized distilled) adulterated with 300 ppm sodium acetate from postnatal day (PND)1 to PND30.	4301	4450
17384765	Both Pb-exposed groups received water adulterated with 300 ppm Pb acetate from PND1 to PND17.	4451	4544
17384765	On PND17, around the age when pups begin consuming water directly from the drinking water bottle, the water Pb concentration was lowered to 20 ppm for the Mod-Pb group for the remainder of the Pb exposure period (until PND30) in order to maintain the moderate level of Pb intake experienced prior to PND17 when milk provided the sole source of Pb.	4545	4892
17384765	The High-Pb group was maintained on the 300-ppm Pb acetate drinking water until PND30.	4893	4979
17384765	At PND30, the pups were weaned and Pb exposure was terminated.	4980	5042
17384765	The period of Pb exposure, PND1–30, corresponds roughly, in terms of neural development, to the period spanning the sixth month of pregnancy until late childhood/early adolescence in humans.	5043	5233
17384765	Additional information on the Pb exposure regimens is provided in the Supplemental Material available online (http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf).	5234	5395
17384765	On PND30, the pups in each Pb treatment group were divided into succimer (Chemet; McNeil Consumer Products Company, Fort Washington, PA) and vehicle (apple juice) subgroups.	5396	5569
17384765	This assignment was made at the level of each litter to provide littermate controls for the vehicle–succimer comparisons.	5570	5691
17384765	Succimer or apple juice (vehicle) was administered twice daily via oral gavage from PND31 to PND52.	5692	5791
17384765	The daily succimer dose was 50 mg/kg body weight/day during the first week of chelation, followed by 25 mg/kg/day for the second and third weeks, similar to the regimen used clinically.	5792	5977
17384765	On PND52 (end of chelation therapy) one animal from each litter was euthanized for analysis of blood and whole brain Pb levels by inductively coupled plasma-high resolution mass spectrometry, as previously described.	5978	6194
17384765	Behavioral testing was conducted in 12 automated Plexiglas chambers, each operated by a personal computer.	6195	6301
17384765	Briefly, each chamber consisted of a waiting area, and a small testing alcove recessed into one wall.	6302	6403
17384765	The alcove was separated from the waiting area by a metal guillotine-type door.	6404	6483
17384765	Each of the three walls of the alcove contained a funnel-shaped response port.	6484	6562
17384765	A light-emitting diode (LED) was mounted above each port; the illumination of one of these LEDs served as the discriminative cue in all of the tasks described here.	6563	6727
17384765	For the selective attention task, compressed, scented air (which served as the olfactory distractors) was projected into the response ports via polyethylene tubes.	6728	6891
17384765	Behavioral testing began on PND62.	6892	6926
17384765	All animals were weighed and tested 6 days/week.	6927	6975
17384765	For all tasks, a daily testing session consisted of 200 trials or 2 hr, whichever came first.	6976	7069
17384765	All behavioral testing was conducted by individuals blind to the treatment condition of the subjects.	7070	7171
17384765	Throughout behavioral testing, animals were maintained on a restricted food intake regimen (see Supplemental Material available online at http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf) with ad libitum access to water.	7172	7393
17384765	Testing on the four tasks described in this report was initiated, on average, at 9, 10, 13, and 15 weeks of age, respectively.	7394	7520
17384765	Each trial began with the opening of the alcove door.	7521	7574
17384765	Immediately after the animal broke the infrared beam at the alcove entrance, one of the three LEDs was illuminated.	7575	7690
17384765	The LED remained illuminated until the animal made a 1-sec nose-poke into one of the three ports or 60 sec elapsed, whichever came first.	7691	7828
17384765	A 1-sec nose-poke into the port under the illuminated LED constituted the correct response and was rewarded with delivery of a 45 mg food pellet into the alcove.	7829	7990
17384765	Each animal was tested on this task until it reached a performance criterion of at least 80% correct in a single session..	7991	8113
17384765	This task was a variation of the visual discrimination task with two modifications: a) a delay of varying duration (0, 3, 6, or 9 sec) was imposed between trial onset (entry into the alcove) and presentation of the cue (the illuminated LED); and b) the duration of cue illumination was shortened to 700 msec.	8114	8422
17384765	Animals were tested on this task for 20 sessions.	8423	8472
17384765	The sustained attention task was identical to the previous task, except that the duration of the cue illumination varied between 200, 400, and 700 msec.	8473	8625
17384765	Animals were tested for 10 sessions on this task.	8626	8675
17384765	The animals were then tested for 10 sessions on a selective attention task, similar to the preceding task but with modifications of the stimulus parameters and the addition of unpredictable olfactory distractors on one-third or the trials in each daily test session.	8676	8942
17384765	This task was preceded by three sessions on a baseline task, which had stimulus parameters identical to those in the selective attention task, but without olfactory distractors.	8943	9120
17384765	In both tasks, the stimulus delay varied between 2 and 3 sec, and the stimulus duration varied between 300 and 700 msec.	9121	9241
17384765	We analyzed the various performance measures using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), which correctly handled the repeated measures on each animal (Wolfinger and O’Connell 1993).	9242	9426
17384765	Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05; p-values between 0.05 and 0.10 were considered to be trends and are discussed if they aid in clarifying the nature of the Pb and succimer effects.	9427	9632
17384765	All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for Windows 2000.	9633	9730
17384765	Additional information on the various dependent measures and statistical analyses is provided in the Supplemental Material available online (http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf).	9731	9923
17384765	Because of space constraints, the results of behavioral testing presented here include only those instances where effects of Pb and/or succimer were seen.	9924	10078
17384765	Analysis of average percent errors for the first six sessions on the visual discrimination task revealed a significant main effect of treatment group [F(2, 78.1) = 8.54; p = 0.0004] and a significant interaction of treatment and session number [F(10, 151) = 3.29; p = 0.0007].	10079	10355
17384765	The controls (no lead exposure and no succimer treatment) performed significantly better than the High-Pb (p = 0.017) and High-Pb–succimer (p < 0.0001) groups.	10356	10515
17384765	Chelation offered no benefit; the performance of the High-Pb and High-Pb–succimer groups did not differ significantly.	10516	10634
17384765	The High-Pb and control groups did not differ significantly by the sixth session, indicating that their inferior performance earlier in testing reflected impaired learning ability.	10635	10815
17384765	Analysis of percent premature responses (responses made before cue onset) revealed a borderline main effect of treatment [F(2, 57.2) = 2.81; p = 0.068]; and significant interactions involving treatment and delay [F(4, 1925) = 3.64; p = 0.006], and treatment, session block, and trial block [F(12, 1926) = 2.13; p = 0.013].	10816	11138
17384765	Rats in the High-Pb group committed a significantly higher percentage of premature responses than controls for trials with the 3 and 6 sec pre-cue delays (averaged across the 20 sessions on the task) (Figure 1A), and for session blocks 3 and 4 (averaged across pre-cue delay) (Figure 1B).	11139	11427
17384765	Similar trends were seen for trials with a 9-sec pre-cue delay (Figure 1A) and for session block 2 (Figure 1B).	11428	11539
17384765	The extent to which succimer treatment improved performance varied across conditions.	11540	11625
17384765	Under some conditions (e.g., session blocks 2 and 3), the succimer treatment offered some benefit, as the performance of the High-Pb–succimer group was intermediate to the control and High-Pb groups, not differing from either one (Figure 1B).	11626	11868
17384765	In other conditions [e.g., pre-cue delays 3 and 6 (Figure 1A); session block 4 (Figure 1B)], no benefit was seen; that is, rats in the High-Pb–succimer group committed a significantly higher percentage of premature responses than the controls and did not differ from the High-Pb group.	11869	12154
17384765	Alcove latency (AL) is the time elapsed between the raising of the alcove door at trial onset and entry of the animal into the testing alcove.	12155	12297
17384765	Because the data were highly skewed, with a high proportion of identical values (the minimum latency), the dependent measures used for each animal were the percentages of ALs that fell into each of four bins of latency values: < 0.1, 0.1–0.5, 0.6–1.0, and > 1 sec.	12298	12562
17384765	A significant treatment × session block interaction was found in the analysis of very short ALS [F(6, 52.2) = 3.24; p = 0.009].	12563	12690
17384765	As seen in Figure 2A, the percentage of very short ALs (< 0.1 sec) was significantly lower for the High-Pb rats than for controls specifically during the first block of sessions (p = 0.001), suggesting some hesitation to enter the testing alcove during this early portion of the task when all groups were performing very poorly.	12691	13019
17384765	Succimer treatment was beneficial in that the High-Pb–succimer rats did not exhibit this hesitancy in the first block of sessions: they did not differ from controls (p = 0.38) and differed significantly from the High-Pb group (p = 0.01).	13020	13257
17384765	We defined response latency as the time between cue onset and a response.	13258	13331
17384765	The data were log-transformed before analysis.	13332	13378
17384765	Analysis of the High-Pb, High-Pb–succimer, and control groups revealed significant interactions of treatment and delay [F(6, 2700) = 2.70; p = 0.013], and treatment, delay, and session block [F(18, 2700) = 1.85; p = 0.016].	13379	13602
17384765	The increased response latency seen early in the task for all animals (when error rate was very high) was more pronounced for the High-Pb rats than for the control and High-Pb–succimer groups.	13603	13795
17384765	This Pb effect was normalized by succimer treatment: the High-Pb–succimer group was significantly faster than the High-Pb group during these early sessions and did not differ from controls (i.e., the same pattern seen for AL, described above).	13796	14039
17384765	Analysis of premature response rate for the High-Pb, High-Pb–succimer, and control groups revealed significant effects of treatment [F(2, 58.9) = 3.56; p = 0.035] and treatment × delay [F(4, 114) = 2.81; p = 0.029].	14040	14255
17384765	The High-Pb group committed a higher percentage of premature responses than the controls for trials with a 3-sec (p = 0.001) or 6-sec (p = 0.05) pre-cue delay (Figure 1C).	14256	14427
17384765	Succimer treatment did not improve this deficiency in inhibitory control; the High-Pb–succimer group was significantly different from controls for the 3-sec (p = 0.001) and 6-sec (p = 0.02) delays and was not different from the High-Pb group for either.	14428	14681
17384765	An omission error was tallied when a rat entered the testing alcove but failed to respond within 15 sec of trial onset, indicative of missing the cue.	14682	14832
17384765	The analysis of percent omission errors for the High-Pb, High-Pb–succimer, and control groups revealed the following significant treatment-related effects: treatment × trial block [F(4, 107) = 2.91; p = 0.025], treatment × trial block × cue duration [F(12, 872) = 1.75; p = 0.05], and treatment × trial block × previous trial outcome (Prev) [F(4, 892) = 6.63; p < 0.0001].	14833	15205
17384765	For all groups, we found an increase in percent omission errors across each session, an effect that was most pronounced for trials that followed an error.	15206	15360
17384765	As shown in Figure 2B, for trials following an error, the rate of increase in omission errors across each session was greater for the High-Pb rats than for controls.	15361	15526
17384765	This impairment was abolished by succimer treatment: The High-Pb–succimer group was significantly different from the High-Pb-group and did not differ from controls.	15527	15691
17384765	The significant interaction of treatment, trial block, and cue duration [F(12, 872) = 1.75; p = 0.05] reflected that a) the High-Pb rats committed a borderline greater percent omission errors than controls in the first block of trials in each session (p = 0.06), and b) during this first block of trials in each session (trials 1–66), the High-Pb group benefited less than controls by the lengthening of the cue from 200 to 700 msec (p = 0.009), such that group differences were greatest on trials with the longest cue duration (p = 0.01, for 700 msec cue; Figure 1D).	15692	16260
17384765	Succimer treatment provided some benefit, as the High-Pb–succimer group did not differ significantly from controls in this regard; however, they also did not differ significantly from the High-Pb group.	16261	16463
17384765	Additional details of the omission error analyses are provided in the Supplemental Material available online (http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf).	16464	16625
17384765	Analysis of average percent errors for the first six sessions on the task revealed a significant main effect of treatment group (F(2, 78.1) = 4.88; p = 0.01) and a significant interaction of treatment and session [F(10, 159) = 1.93; p = 0.04].	16626	16869
17384765	The Mod-Pb group learned significantly more slowly than controls (main effect contrast, p = 0.004).	16870	16969
17384765	Chelation offered a significant benefit in that the Mod-Pb–succimer group learned significantly faster than the Mod-Pb group (main effect contrast, p = 0.03) and did not differ from controls for any session.	16970	17177
17384765	The three groups performed similarly by the sixth session, indicating that the observed group differences in performance reflected variations in learning ability (Figure 3A).	17178	17352
17384765	The analysis of percent premature responses revealed a significant interaction of treatment and session block [F(6, 58.9) = 2.89; p = 0.016].	17353	17494
17384765	As depicted in Figure 3B, the Mod-Pb group mastered the new rule (i.e., that the light cue was presented after a delay on some trials) more slowly than controls (p = 0.05), and succimer treatment offered a significant benefit (Mod-Pb vs. Mod-Pb–succimer, session block 1, p = 0.006).	17495	17778
17384765	The Mod-Pb–succimer and control groups did not differ for any session.	17779	17849
17384765	The performance of the three groups did not differ during the final 10 sessions on the task (blocks 3 and 4), indicating that the observed performance differences reflected differing learning ability.	17850	18050
17384765	Analysis of average percent errors for the first six sessions on the task revealed that the succimer-only group (treated with succimer in the absence of lead exposure) learned significantly more slowly than the controls [Figure 4A; treatment (F(1, 57) = 4.21; p = 0.04); treatment × session (F(5, 99.4) = 2.20; p = 0.06)].	18051	18373
17384765	The percentage of inaccurate responses (responses made after cue onset, but to an incorrect port) was significantly higher for the succimer-only group than for controls during session blocks 2, 3, and 4 [Figure 4B; treatment, (F(1, 141) = 4.42; p = 0.042); treatment × session block (F(3, 1729) = 2.64; p = 0.048)].	18374	18689
17384765	The groups did not differ significantly for this type of error during session block 1 (sessions 1–5), an early point in the learning process when most responses were made before cue onset (premature responses).	18690	18900
17384765	The analysis of omission errors for the control and succimer-only groups revealed significant interactions of treatment and cue duration [F(2, 587) = 4.47; p = 0.012] and of treatment, cue duration, and trial block [F(8, 587) = 1.99; p = 0.045].	18901	19146
17384765	As shown in Figure 4C, the succimer-only group benefited less than controls by the lengthening of the cue from 200 to 700 msec (p = 0.004).	19147	19286
17384765	This pattern was seen only during the beginning and end of each daily session (contrasts for slopes across cue duration, p = 0.002 and 0.037 for first and third trial blocks, respectively).	19287	19476
17384765	The succimer-only group benefited less than controls from the lengthening of the cue, resulting in increasing group differences in percent inaccurate responses as the cue duration increased [F(2, 1292) = 15.95; p < 0.0001].	19477	19700
17384765	Because the timing of the distractor relative to cue onset (1 or 2 sec) did not alter the treatment-related effects, we used a two-level variable for distraction condition for the analyses: distractor or no distractor.	19701	19919
17384765	The analysis of percent inaccurate responses for the succimer-only and control groups revealed a main effect of treatment group [F(1, 38.1) = 6.18; p = 0.017], an interaction of treatment and cue duration [F(1, 216) = 11.25; p = 0.0009], and a trend toward a three-way interaction of treatment, distraction condition, and the outcome of the previous trial [F(1, 387) = 3.06, p = 0.08].	19920	20305
17384765	The succimer-only group benefited less by the lengthening of the cue than did controls (Figure 5C).	20306	20405
17384765	In addition, although the succimer-only group committed a higher percentage of inaccurate responses overall (p = 0.017), group differences were greatest for trials that both included a distractor and that followed an error (Figure 5A,B).	20406	20643
17384765	However, there was also a tendency for the groups to differ on non-distraction trials (p = 0.10; Figure 5A).	20644	20752
17384765	To assess whether the trend toward poorer performance of the succimer-only group on the nondistraction trials reflected generalized disruption caused by the unpredictable presentation of the olfactory distractors, an analysis was conducted to directly compare performance on the nondistraction trials with that of the preceding baseline task.	20753	21095
17384765	All trials in this latter task were identical to the nondistraction trials of the selective attention task (i.e., pre-cue delays, cue durations, etc.).	21096	21247
17384765	For the succimer-only group, the percentage of inaccurate responses was significantly higher for the non-distraction trials of the selective attention task than during the baseline task (p = 0.0001), whereas for controls, the rates were similar for these two conditions (p = 0.16; Figure 5D).	21248	21540
17384765	This analysis supports the inference that for the succimer-only group, the unpredictable presentation of the olfactory distractors produced a generalized disruption in performance that extended beyond the distraction trials.	21541	21765
17384765	Motivation was assessed by analyzing the average rate of response trials [number of response trials per session divided by session length (minutes)].	21766	21915
17384765	No significant group differences were detected (all p > 0.2), providing evidence that motivational differences did not account for the observed differences in performance (for further discussion, see Supplemental Material available online at http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf).	21916	22209
17384765	Analysis of mean blood Pb levels on PND52 revealed dose-dependent effects on both blood and brain Pb levels and a beneficial effect of succimer chelation for both Pb exposure conditions for both tissues (Table 1).	22210	22423
17384765	The High-Pb and High-Pb–succimer groups weighed ≈6% less than the control group (p < 0.05), measured on PND52 after cessation of succimer treatment.	22424	22572
17384765	None of the other groups differed from controls.	22573	22621
17384765	The slightly smaller size of the High-Pb rats likely reflects a decrease in growth hormone during the Pb exposure period.	22622	22743
17384765	Low-level Pb exposure in children has also been associated with small but statistically significant reductions in height, in the absence of any other signs of overt toxicity.	22744	22918
17384765	A short period of early Pb exposure produced impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in children with low to moderate elevations in blood Pb levels.	22919	23149
17384765	As in children, these impairments were lasting; that is, they were apparent long past the period of Pb exposure, indicative of lasting neurologic dysfunction as a result of the early exposure.	23150	23342
17384765	The pervasiveness of the impairment was related to the intensity of Pb exposure; for the Mod-Pb group, dysfunction was limited to learning ability, whereas the High-Pb group exhibited impairments in learning, inhibitory control, arousal regulation, and attention.	23343	23606
17384765	Importantly, succimer treatment significantly alleviated some Pb-induced neurobehavioral deficits, although the magnitude of the benefit varied as a function of both the level of the Pb exposure and the specific area of dysfunction.	23607	23839
17384765	In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting cognitive and affective dysfunction, similar in magnitude and pervasiveness to that produced by the High-Pb exposure regimen.	23840	24051
17384765	The basis for each of these conclusions is provided below and summarized in Table 2.	24052	24136
17384765	Both the High-Pb and Mod-Pb groups learned the basic rules of the visual discrimination task and attention task 1 more slowly than the controls, indicating lasting impairment in associative ability as a result of a short period of early Pb exposure, as previously reported.	24137	24410
17384765	Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed animals improved learning rate, although the degree of benefit was greater for the Mod-Pb group than for the High-Pb group.	24411	24571
17384765	Succimer treatment significantly improved the learning rate of the rats in the Mod-Pb group for both the initial visual discrimination task and attention task 1; in both tasks, the Mod-Pb–succimer group learned significantly faster than the Mod-Pb group and did not differ significantly from the controls.	24572	24877
17384765	For the High-Pb exposure regimen, succimer treatment did not improve learning rate in the visual discrimination task, but a small benefit was seen in attention task 1.	24878	25045
17384765	It is likely that more prolonged succimer treatment would have produced an even greater cognitive benefit for these more heavily exposed animals.	25046	25191
17384765	This suggestion is based on the facts that a) reductions in brain Pb levels lag significantly behind reductions in blood Pb following chelation or cessation of Pb exposure; b) blood and brain Pb levels were still quite elevated in the High-Pb group at the end of chelation (approximately equal to the nonchelated Mod-Pb rats); and c) in a previous study from our laboratory, a second 3-week succimer regimen offered significant benefit over one regimen in terms of both blood and brain Pb reductions.	25192	25692
17384765	Therefore, these results likely underestimate the potential benefit of succimer treatment for the more heavily Pb-exposed animals.	25693	25823
17384765	For the four tasks presented here, the rate of all types of errors was significantly greater on trials that followed an error than on trials following a correct response.	25824	25994
17384765	Similarly, the latency to enter the testing alcove at trial onset was significantly longer on trials following an error than on trials that followed a correct response, a pattern also seen for the latency to make a response after cue onset.	25995	26235
17384765	The disruption produced by committing an error was significantly greater for the High-Pb animals than for controls for several dependent measures: In the sustained attention task, the percentage of omission errors was significantly higher for the High-Pb group than for controls during mid- to late-session trials following an error—but not following a correct response—a pattern that indicates the combined influences of the disruptive effects of committing an error and the changing motivational and attentional state of the animals across each session.	26236	26791
17384765	Similarly, in attention task 1, the High-Pb rats took significantly longer to enter the testing alcove and to make a response than controls, but only early in the task when error rate was very high and the rats had not yet learned the task rules.	26792	27038
17384765	Finally, the drop in performance on trials following an error was also more pronounced for the High-Pb rats than for controls in a conditional olfactory discrimination task with periodic reward omission, an additional task administered subsequently to these rats.	27039	27302
17384765	The interpretation of the heightened sensitivity to errors of the High-Pb rats is informed by previous studies that examined performance changes as a function of an error on the previous trial, all involving human subjects.	27303	27526
17384765	In some of these studies, the error rate on post-error trials was exceptionally low, indicating the operation of an executive error-correction system localized to the anterior cingulate cortex.	27527	27720
17384765	However, the finding consistently seen in our rodent studies—increased error rate on trials following an error (reviewed by Strupp and Beaudin 2006)—has also been reported in some human studies and likely reflects an emotional response to the error.	27721	27970
17384765	This interpretation is supported by the finding that an electrophysiologic marker of error detection, termed error-related negativity, varies as a function of individual differences in negative affect and emotionality.	27971	28189
17384765	Importantly, this heightened disruption following an error was very responsive to succimer treatment: In all cases, the High-Pb–succimer group was indistinguishable from controls.	28190	28369
17384765	These results provide encouragement that Pb-induced dysfunction in the area of arousal or emotion regulation can be significantly alleviated by succimer treatment.	28370	28533
17384765	This type of dysfunction may be an important contributor of the behavioral problems and increased delinquency rates seen in Pb-exposed children and adolescents, based on evidence that individuals vulnerable to faulty regulation of negative emotion are at risk for violence and aggression.	28534	28822
17384765	The sustained attention task revealed two types of attentional dysfunction in the High-Pb group.	28823	28919
17384765	First, the early-session increase in omission errors (relative to mid-session), seen for all groups across all sessions on this task, was more pronounced for the High-Pb group than for the controls, with group differences being largest for trials with the longest cue duration (700 msec).	28920	29208
17384765	This pattern of results may indicate that lapses in attention were more common for the High-Pb rats than for controls during this early part of the session.	29209	29365
17384765	More frequent attentional lapses in the High-Pb group would have the consequence of flattening the slope across cue duration and making group differences largest on trials for which performance of the controls was best (i.e., those with the longest cues).	29366	29621
17384765	One interpretation of this pattern is that early Pb exposure may impair the ability to rapidly engage in a new task when transitioning between activities, manifested here as an increased tendency to miss the cue (an attentional deficit).	29622	29859
17384765	A second type of attentional dysfunction observed in the High-Pb rats was evident later in each testing session.	29860	29972
17384765	The incidence of omission errors increased for all groups across each daily testing session, the classic pattern seen when sustained attention is taxed (Parasuraman and Warm 1998).	29973	30153
17384765	However, as discussed above, the High-Pb rats committed a significantly higher percentage of omission errors than controls during mid- to late-session trials, specifically on trials that followed an error.	30154	30359
17384765	This pattern of effects, coupled with the similar pattern seen in the omission of reward task administered subsequently to these same animals, indicates that as attention and motivation waned across the session, the disruptive effect of an error on attention and persistence increased, and that this disruption was more pronounced for the Pb-exposed rats than for controls.	30360	30733
17384765	The effectiveness of succimer chelation varied for these different types of attentional deficits.	30734	30831
17384765	As discussed above, the heightened attentional disruption seen in the High-Pb rats following an error was completely normalized by succimer treatment, as the chelated High-Pb rats differed significantly from the High-Pb group and did not differ from controls.	30832	31091
17384765	In contrast, succimer treatment only partially alleviated the attentional lapses seen early in each test session; the High-Pb–succimer group was intermediate to the other two, not differing from either.	31092	31294
17384765	In the sustained attention task, the percentage of premature responses was significantly higher for the High-Pb rats than for controls, indicating deficient inhibitory control.	31295	31471
17384765	Converging evidence for this area of dysfunction was provided by the higher percentage of premature responses committed by the High-Pb rats in the final block of trials of attention task 1, a point at which the basic rules of the task had already been learned.	31472	31732
17384765	Succimer treatment was ineffective in alleviating this area of dysfunction: In both instances, the percentage of premature responses for the High-Pb–succimer rats was significantly greater than that of the control rats, and not different from the High-Pb group.	31733	31994
17384765	The efficacy of the succimer treatment varied as a function of both the level of Pb exposure and the specific functional domain tested.	31995	32130
17384765	Interestingly, the pattern seen for succimer efficacy parallels the apparent sensitivity of specific functional domains to the Pb exposure.	32131	32270
17384765	Learning was impaired by both Pb exposure regimens, whereas impaired regulation of arousal or emotion was seen only in the High-Pb group, suggesting that disruption in learning occurs at lower exposures than dysregulation of arousal or emotion.	32271	32515
17384765	The efficacy of succimer across these domains corresponded to the degree to which chelation reduced brain Pb levels in the two Pb exposure groups.	32516	32662
17384765	For the Mod-Pb group, succimer treatment almost completely removed Pb from the brain and effectively alleviated the learning dysfunction.	32663	32800
17384765	In contrast, brain Pb levels were still moderately elevated in the High-Pb group following chelation; these chelated High-Pb rats exhibited the same pattern of dysfunction as the unchelated Mod-Pb group, which also had moderately elevated brain Pb levels on PND52.	32801	33065
17384765	Both groups also exhibited impaired learning but not affective dysfunction.	33066	33141
17384765	This constellation of findings suggests that succimer treatment of the High-Pb rats reduced tissue (i.e., brain) Pb levels below that which produces lasting impairment in emotion regulation, but not enough to alleviate the learning dysfunction.	33142	33386
17384765	The mechanistic basis for this pattern of effects is unknown, but likely reflects complex interactions between the timing of the Pb exposure and succimer treatment relative to the ontogenetic stage of specific neural systems, the extent to which succimer treatment reduced Pb levels in specific neural systems, and the inherent sensitivity of those developmental processes and/or associated functional domains to Pb exposure.	33387	33812
17384765	The present study also revealed the unexpected finding that a single 3-week course of succimer treatment during early development produced lasting dysfunction in cognition and arousal regulation in rats not previously exposed to Pb.	33813	34045
17384765	Note that these four behavioral tests were administered across a 7-month period following cessation of succimer treatment, suggesting lasting brain changes.	34046	34202
17384765	These results corroborate preliminary results from a similar study in nonhuman primates (Laughlin 2001).	34203	34307
17384765	The succimer-only group learned the initial visual discrimination task more slowly than the controls.	34308	34409
17384765	They also committed a higher rate of inaccurate responses than controls in attention task 1, indicative of attentional dysfunction.	34410	34541
17384765	In both the sustained attention task and the selective attention task, their performance benefited less by the lengthening of the visual cue than did the controls, indicative of lapses in attention, as discussed above.	34542	34760
17384765	Additionally, in the selective attention task, the succimer-only group committed a higher rate of inaccurate responses than controls, an effect that was most pronounced for trials on which a distractor was presented and that followed an error, indicating impairments in both selective attention and arousal regulation.	34761	35079
17384765	Finally, a comparison of performance on trials without distractors (during the selective attention task) to performance on the baseline task revealed that the succimer-only rats experienced a generalized disruption of performance in the selective attention task that extended beyond the trials on which a distractor was presented.	35080	35410
17384765	This finding, too, implicates impaired arousal regulation in the succimer-only group.	35411	35496
17384765	These various impairments were similar in magnitude to those produced by the High-Pb exposure.	35497	35591
17384765	The mechanism(s) responsible for these adverse succimer effects is not known.	35592	35669
17384765	One possibility is that succimer, a metal-chelating agent, altered essential metal homeostasis and increased metal diuresis, as has been suggested by a number of clinical and nonhuman primate studies.	35670	35870
17384765	Both Pb-exposed groups exhibited low blood Pb levels (≈25–35 μg/dL) during the first 3 weeks of the 4-week exposure period.	35871	35994
17384765	During the fourth and final week of exposure, both groups experienced an increase in tissue Pb levels because of the direct ingestion of Pb-adulterated water.	35995	36153
17384765	Although the blood Pb levels produced during this final week of exposure were higher than commonly reported for children (see Supplemental materials available online at http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf), direct comparison of blood Pb levels across species should be cautioned.	36154	36447
17384765	The available evidence indicates that the blood Pb levels required to produce overt toxicity (i.e., malaise, coma, convulsions, death) or lasting neurobehavioral effects (i.e., effects that last beyond the period of exposure) are higher in both rats and nonhuman primates than in humans.	36448	36735
17384765	Consistent with these earlier studies, none of the animals in the present study exhibited any signs of overt toxicity throughout the study and could not be distinguished from controls throughout the 8 months of daily handling.	36736	36962
17384765	The Mod-Pb group exhibited very circumscribed and subtle behavioral/cognitive effects, and the High-Pb group exhibited subtle, although more widespread, neurobehavioral effects.	36963	37140
17384765	As such, the regimens used in the present study may be viewed as modeling subclinical or asymptomatic Pb exposure.	37141	37255
17384765	Similarly, although the succimer regimen used in the present study closely modeled the duration and dose (weight-normalized) of the regimens used clinically in children, it is possible that it was more “aggressive” than the clinical regimen, when allometrically scaled across species.	37256	37540
17384765	The present study provides clear evidence that administration of succimer, using a regimen sufficient to reduce brain Pb levels, can lessen Pb-induced impairments in learning ability, attention, and regulation of arousal and/or emotion.	37541	37777
17384765	These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits caused by Pb exposure.	37778	37925
17384765	The primary area of dysfunction seen in the Mod-Pb rats, impaired learning ability, was significantly alleviated by succimer treatment.	37926	38061
17384765	For the High-Pb group, treatment with succimer provided a robust benefit on measures indicative of impaired regulation of arousal or affect—one of the most pervasive areas of impairment seen in this group, and a major cause of their impaired performance overall.	38062	38324
17384765	However, for the High-Pb group, succimer produced only a slight improvement in learning ability and did not lessen the deficient inhibitory control.	38325	38473
17384765	The High-Pb rats treated with succimer performed similarly to non-chelated Mod-Pb rats—consistent with their comparable brain Pb levels—suggesting that a more prolonged treatment may have further improved performance in the High-Pb exposed animals.	38474	38722
17384765	These findings are consistent with previous animal studies but contrast with the results of the Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children (TLC) study, the one clinical trial in Pb-exposed children that included cognitive outcomes.	38723	38946
17384765	There are several possible reasons for this disparity in outcomes.	38947	39013
17384765	First, the succimer treatment protocol used in the TLC trial may not have achieved a sufficient reduction in brain Pb levels to improve cognitive functioning.	39014	39172
17384765	This suggestion is based on the evidence that a) succimer-induced reductions in blood Pb overestimate reductions in brain lead and b) the succimer treatment protocol used in the TLC study achieved relatively modest group differences in blood Pb levels (relative to placebo), averaging only 4.5 μg/dL over the 6 months following treatment.	39173	39511
17384765	In comparison, in the present study both blood and brain Pb levels were substantially reduced by succimer, relative to the vehicle treatment (Table 1).	39512	39663
17384765	Second, the disparate outcomes of the TLC trial and the present study may also reflect differences in the nature of the cognitive tasks that were used.	39664	39815
17384765	In particular, the tasks used here (relative to those in the TLC trial) may have provided more specific indices of the two functional domains most improved by succimer in the present study: associative learning ability and regulation of arousal and/or emotion (indexed by reactivity to errors).	39816	40110
17384765	In conclusion, this study demonstrates that it is possible for chelation therapy to alleviate certain types of Pb-induced behavioral/cognitive dysfunction in rats.	40111	40274
17384765	This is an important demonstration because Pb-induced behavioral dysfunction is generally considered to be irreversible.	40275	40395
17384765	The present findings thus suggest that if a succimer treatment protocol that produced a substantial removal of Pb from the brain could be identified for humans, a functional benefit might be derived.	40396	40595
17384765	In addition, the finding that succimer produced lasting adverse effects when administered to non-Pb–exposed rats highlights the potential risks of administering succimer or other metal chelating agents to children who do not have elevated tissue Pb levels.	40596	40852
17384765	It is of significant concern that this type of therapy is being widely advocated as safe and effective for treating autism.	40853	40976
17384765	In the original manuscript published online, the symbols for the control and succimer-only groups were reversed in Figure 4A.	40977	41102
17384765	They have been corrected here.	41103	41133
18487244	First described in 1991, mtDNA depletion is the central feature of a group of disorders, collectively termed mtDNA depletion syndromes (MDS) (1,2).	0	147
18487244	The characteristic mtDNA finding in these disorders is a quantitative reduction in the mtDNA content of affected tissues, but there may also be low levels of heteroplasmy for point mutations (3).	148	343
18487244	Defects in mtDNA maintenance have been hard to study as the mtDNA defects are only evident in primary fibroblast cultures (4) from a minority of patients and are rarely described in other primary lines (5).	344	550
18487244	Unlike mtDNA mutations, the pattern of inheritance of MDS is autosomal recessive.	551	632
18487244	Furthermore, mtDNA content and OXPHOS activity was restored in cybrids generated from the fusion of mtDNA-free (ρ°) cells with enucleated fibroblasts from MDS patients (6), implying an underlying nuclear defect.Previous investigators have classified MDS into two main groups, consisting of a hepatocerebral form and a myopathic form (7,8).	633	972
18487244	In both groups several tissues may be affected (9).	973	1024
18487244	Genes involved in the hepatocerebral form include POLG1 (10), deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) (11), the human ortholog of the mouse kidney disease gene MPV17 (12), the mitochondrial helicase/primase, TWINKLE (13) and the alpha subunit of Succinyl-CoA Synthase (SUCLG1) (14).	1025	1295
18487244	MDS without hepatic involvement is associated with myopathy and/or encephalopathy.	1296	1378
18487244	Mutations have been identified in genes encoding the mitochondrial thymidine kinase (TK2) (11), the beta subunit of ADP-Forming Succinyl-CoA Synthase (SUCLA2) (15), the P53 dependent subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2B) (16) and thymidine phosphorylase (or TP, associated with MyoNeuroGastroIntestinal Encephalomyopathy or MNGIE) (17).	1379	1721
18487244	Myopathic MDS may present as the so-called ‘benign’ later-onset mtDNA depletion (18).By far the commonest gene defects identified in autosomal recessive mtDNA depletion are POLG1 mutations.	1722	1911
18487244	POLG1 is the gene encoding the 195 kDa catalytic (alpha) subunit of the mitochondrial (gamma) DNA polymerase, located on chromosome 15q25.	1912	2050
18487244	Three polymerase domains (exons 17–22) are separated from 3 exonuclease domains (exons 2–8) by a linker region (residues 418–755) that interacts with the beta subunit.	2051	2218
18487244	Mutations in POLG1 are associated with a range of different phenotypes (19).	2219	2295
18487244	These include both dominant and recessive chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia, mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (20) and recessive, severe, early onset Alpers syndrome (10).	2296	2476
18487244	While some authors distinguish between Alpers syndrome, characterized by refractory seizures, deafness, cortical blindness, episodic psychomotor regression, and Alpers–Huttenlocher syndrome in which liver disease is also a major feature (21), such a subdivision requires detailed data.	2477	2762
18487244	Alpers syndrome is marked by a progressive deterioration, most patients dying in infancy but a few surviving into their teens (22).	2763	2894
18487244	POLG1 genotype:phenotype correlations in both Alpers and mtDNA depletion have been disappointing (19).	2895	2997
18487244	We sought to develop these using accurate quantitation of tissue mtDNA content and cellular depletion phenotype.We investigated 24 children in whom we had identified POLG gene mutation(s).	2998	3186
18487244	These patients were referred with childhood onset of symptoms that were suggestive of POLG1 mutations, such as Alpers syndrome, or because we had previously identified mtDNA depletion or multiple DNA deletions.	3187	3397
18487244	Features of the 24 patients with POLG1 mutations are summarized in Table 1.	3398	3473
18487244	Age ranged from 0 to 17 years and 9/10 patients with mtDNA depletion in liver or muscle were male.Sequence analysis of the POLG1 gene revealed two mutant alleles in all of the patients with Alpers disease consistent with recessive inheritance.	3474	3717
18487244	Three individuals had a largely neurological presentation that clearly fell outside the accepted criteria for Alpers disease, but the remainder all had encephalopathy.	3718	3885
18487244	Seventeen out of the remaining 23 (74%) had a variable degree of liver dysfunction, from mild to liver failure requiring transplant.	3886	4018
18487244	Of the 20 out of 21 individuals with probable Alpers syndrome where clinical information was available, all had epilepsy, which was intractable (epilepsia partialis continua) in four.	4019	4202
18487244	One teenage patient died only 2 years after presentation, ending with 5 months of continuous seizure activity.	4203	4313
18487244	Epilepsy was treated with sodium valproate in four out of the 11 where we had information about anticonvulsant therapy, and in one case this was followed by deterioration and death within 3 months.	4314	4511
18487244	Movement disorders (choreoathetosis, ataxia and ataxic nystagmus) and epilepsia partialias continua were common features.	4512	4633
18487244	None of the patients had survived to their 19th birthday, the median age at death being 1 year (7 months to 18 years).The mtDNA content of liver was low in all cases where it was available, but was variable in muscle (22–117%).	4634	4861
18487244	All of the patients with mtDNA depletion in liver and/or muscle had at least one missense or nonsense mutation in a catalytic domain, either at least one mutation in the polymerase domain or two mutations in the exonuclease domain.Fibroblast cultures were available for 10/24 of the patients for visualizing mtDNA using PicoGreen fluorescence microscopy.	4862	5216
18487244	PicoGreen can quantitatively stain mtDNA (23), which in vivo is arranged into punctate DNA/protein structures termed nucleoids, which consist of several mtDNA genomes complexed to nucleoid proteins like POLG.	5217	5425
18487244	In normal control cells, PicoGreen stains numerous nucleoids that are of comparable fluorescence intensity in different cells and between different individuals.	5426	5586
18487244	However, some of the patient fibroblast cultures, such as that from patient A (Fig.	5587	5670
18487244	1) showed mosaic depletion, in that many cells showed greatly reduced nucleoid staining, suggesting mtDNA depletion, which was most noticeable at later cell passages (approximately 2–3 months continuous culture).	5671	5883
18487244	This was evident in cultured cells derived from four individuals (patients A–D Fig.	5884	5967
18487244	1 and Table 1).	5968	5983
18487244	In all cases nuclear staining was unaffected, although cytoplasmic background fluorescence was often increased.	5984	6095
18487244	These patients with mosaic depletion within their cultured fibroblasts all had severe clinical phenotypes, all being dead by the age of 16 months.	6096	6242
18487244	Of these, patient A had much the highest proportion of depleted cells, and this was probably a later passage than cultures B–D.	6243	6370
18487244	The mosaic distribution of mtDNA depletion was also apparent at low cell passage number (Supplementary Material, Fig.	6371	6488
18487244	S1), where occasional mtDNA-free (rho zero) cells were present (Supplementary Material, Fig.	6489	6581
18487244	S1), interspersed with cells with apparently normal or near normal mtDNA levels.	6582	6662
18487244	Cultures A–C were grown until at least passage 20, and the proportion of depleted cells increased with successive passage (compare Fig.	6663	6798
18487244	1 with Supplementary Material, Fig.	6799	6834
18487244	S1), so that by 45 days the majority of cells were depleted (Fig.	6835	6900
18487244	2A).	6901	6905
18487244	This was reflected by a reduced minimum fibroblast mtDNA content by Q-PCR (Table 1) in cells from patients A–D (average 23%), but at baseline patient D had infrequent depleted cells and much higher mtDNA content (97%, relative to control fibroblast cultures 39–193%).	6906	7173
18487244	There was no consistent change in mtDNA content in any of the fibroblast cultures from controls (Fig.	7174	7275
18487244	2), from patients with other types of mitochondrial disease or from POLG1 patients who were not mosaic for depleted cells (patients G–J).	7276	7413
18487244	However, in two cell cultures (E and F), occasional depleted cells were apparent (24,25), particularly as the cultures became senescent, but this was not a consistent, progressive feature.	7414	7602
18487244	Thus the mosaic cellular distribution of mtDNA in fibroblast cultures A–D was characteristic, differing from all other fibroblasts examined and marking them out as a distinctive subgroup.The mtDNA content of liver was marginally lower in the mosaic patients A–D (average 5%, range 4–7%) than the other patients (average 19%, range 5–32%), but this was not significant (P = 0.09).	7603	7982
18487244	Muscle mtDNA content was also somewhat reduced (average 27%, range 22–32%) but this was not significantly less than the rest of the patients.	7983	8124
18487244	Muscle mtDNA was normal in the patients with only linker mutations (26), mtDNA content being significantly higher in these than the other patients (average 93 and 34% respectively, P = 0.001) with earlier onset Alpers disease (average age 16 and 1 year, respectively, P < 0.001).The reduction in mtDNA content was assessed by quantitative analysis of digital images, which showed that while the number of nucleoids detectable by PicoGreen significantly declined with time (Fig.	8125	8602
18487244	2B, P < 0.001 and <0.01 for early and late time points for patients B and C, respectively), the distribution of their intensities barely changing (Fig.	8603	8754
18487244	2C).	8755	8759
18487244	That is, nucleoid numbers were reduced (Fig.	8760	8804
18487244	2B) but no less intense (Fig.	8805	8834
18487244	2C) in depleted cells in the mosaic patients.We further studied the mosaic mtDNA depletion in cultured cells from patients A–C, using a battery of in situ approaches.Immuno-fluorescence with antibodies against anti-DNA, which detect mtDNA nucleoids as small cytoplasmic dots confirmed the presence of numerous cells within cultures A–C with mosaic and severe mtDNA depletion, which were not observed in any of the controls (Fig.	8835	9263
18487244	3A, top panels).	9264	9280
18487244	Mitotracker co-labelling indicated many of these depleted cells also exhibited reduced Mitotracker labelling.	9281	9390
18487244	As Mitotracker specifically labels mitochondria according to their membrane potential, a reduced Mitotracker labelling indicates these mtDNA depleted cells also manifested reduced membrane potential.	9391	9590
18487244	Similar results were observed with anti-bodies to mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a nucleoid protein reduced by loss of mtDNA, which showed that numerous cells within cultures A–C exhibited reduced TFAM expression (Fig.	9591	9823
18487244	3Af–h), unlike the homogenous labelling of controls (Fig.	9824	9881
18487244	3Ae and Supplementary Material, Fig.	9882	9918
18487244	S1A).	9919	9924
18487244	Mitotracker co-labelling showed many of the TFAM reduced cells also contained reduced Mitotracker labelling.	9925	10033
18487244	Interestingly, some mitochondria within anti-DNA/TFAM depleted cells retained Mitotracker labelling, and these invariably co-localized with residual anti-DNA/TFAM expression (arrowed, Fig.	10034	10222
18487244	3Ad and Supplementary Material, Fig.	10223	10259
18487244	S1).	10260	10264
18487244	Bromodeoxyurudine (BrdU) labelling of newly synthesized DNA within cultures A–C (Fig.	10265	10350
18487244	3Aj–l) showed markedly reduced mtDNA replication compared with controls (Fig.	10351	10428
18487244	3Ai), with fewer nucleoids incorporating BrdU and a weaker nucleoid labelling.	10429	10507
18487244	Nuclear BrdU labelling was unaffected.	10508	10546
18487244	Again, cells with profoundly reduced BrdU also often showed markedly reduced Mitotracker signals (data not shown).	10547	10661
18487244	A number of patient cells showed a near absence of mtDNA replication (see asterisks in Fig.	10662	10753
18487244	3Ak and l).We next examined the cellular expression of the mtDNA encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI, Fig.	10754	10869
18487244	3B).	10870	10874
18487244	COXI immunolabelling showed mosaic COXI expression in cultures A–C, with numerous cells exhibiting reduced COXI, unlike the homogenous expression of controls (Fig.	10875	11038
18487244	3Ba–d).	11039	11046
18487244	Global COXI expression was reduced in cultures A and B (data not shown).	11047	11119
18487244	COXI reduced cells again often showed substantially reduced Mitotracker labelling, although individual polarized mitochondria often co-localized with residual COXI expression (arrowed, Supplementary Material, Fig.	11120	11333
18487244	S3B).	11334	11339
18487244	A reduced cytochrome c oxidase (COX) relative to nuclear encoded succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was detected in many cells within cultures A–C (Fig.	11340	11496
18487244	3Be–l).Finally, to confirm that TFAM, anti-DNA, COXI, BrdU reduced cells within cultures A–D correlated to the PicoGreen reduced cells, we co-labelled these cells with PicoGreen and tetramethyl-rhodamine-methyl ester (TMRM), a dye similar to Mitotracker in that it is absorbed into mitochondria according to mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig.	11497	11843
18487244	3C).	11844	11848
18487244	Many PicoGreen depleted cells were found to have depolarized mitochondria (Fig.	11849	11928
18487244	3C, arrowed).We have found that mtDNA depletion of tissues and cultured fibroblasts from patients with POLG1 mutations is associated particularly with mutations in catalytic domains.	11929	12111
18487244	We have identified mosaic mtDNA depletion of mtDNA in primary fibroblast cultures from some patients with Alpers disease.	12112	12233
18487244	In patients A–C, mtDNA was depleted in cells with reduced COX activity.	12234	12305
18487244	These cells also had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting that the depletion and not the point mutations underlie the major part of the respiratory chain defect in fibroblasts from these POLG1 patients (Supplementary Material, Fig.	12306	12553
18487244	S4).	12554	12558
18487244	In all cases, cellular mosaic depletion was associated with two mutations in catalytic regions of POLG1, either in the polymerase or exonuclease domain or in one of each.	12559	12729
18487244	The mtDNA depletion manifested primarily as a reduced number of nucleoids in the depleted cells and reflected the severity of the clinical and tissue phenotypes.	12730	12891
18487244	The cellular mtDNA content may be an indicator of the underlying molecular mechanism that links genotype to phenotype.	12892	13010
18487244	These data from a human disease suggest that eukaryotic DNA polymerases require both polymerase and 3′–5′exonuclease activities within the same molecule.Previous studies of human POLG1 mutations have found little in the way of clear genotype–phenotype correlations, and these may have been more apparent in the present study as it has been possible to link a range of clinical phenotypes with laboratory data that included both tissue mtDNA content and cellular phenotypes.	13011	13484
18487244	Our clinical findings were similar to previous studies, confirming that epilepsy and movement disorders (27) are major features of POLG1 syndromes.	13485	13632
18487244	Relatively complete information was available for the four patients who manifested mosaic mtDNA depletion, whereas the clinical data available on the other patients was largely retrospective, hence dependent on the local neurologist.	13633	13866
18487244	We found that the cellular phenotype correlated better with the location of the mutation and the severity of the tissue depletion than with specific clinical features.	13867	14034
18487244	Nevertheless, mosaic mtDNA depletion was evident in fibroblast cultures from only the most severely affected children, all of whom had died before the age of 16 months.	14035	14203
18487244	Patient D had two mutations, R232G and T251I, in the exonuclease domain, the latter being in cis with the P587L linker mutation.	14204	14332
18487244	The P587L mutation usually co-segregates with T251I, but has occurred with 251T in a patient with a relatively mild phenotype (28).	14333	14464
18487244	While this suggests that P587L is mildly pathogenic, T251I may exacerbate its effect.	14465	14550
18487244	Patient M was homozygous for the L304R exonuclease mutation and had a relatively mild phenotype, but neither liver nor fibroblasts were available for study.	14551	14707
18487244	In contrast to the patients with two catalytic mutations, no patient who only had missense linker mutations was dead by 16 months or had mosaic cellular or tissue mtDNA depletion.Depletion of mtDNA was present in liver in all cases where it was available for measurement, but was much less consistent than in muscle.	14708	15024
18487244	All patients with hepatic mtDNA depletion had at least one catalytic mutation, whereas patients with purely linker mutations had little in the way of liver features.	15025	15190
18487244	These were usually missense mutations, but one patient had a nonsense mutation in the polymerase domain resulting in mono-allelic expression (21,24).	15191	15340
18487244	We found cellular mtDNA depletion only in individuals with clear tissue depletion (Table 2).	15341	15433
18487244	The severity of the depletion was commensurate with the severity of the defect in replication that we have seen, and this is supported by the published literature (29).	15434	15602
18487244	These genotype–phenotype correlations may not have been seen in some previous studies because the diagnosis of mtDNA depletion syndrome is frequently imprecise.	15603	15763
18487244	This is for both technical reasons (25) and because of the lack of established age-adjusted normal ranges, and may explain some of the inconsistencies in the published literature.	15764	15943
18487244	However, age-related changes in mtDNA content are undoubtedly also a feature of mtDNA depletion (18,25,30,31).	15944	16054
18487244	Furthermore, it is clear that the effect of specific mutations may be modulated by other missense mutations in cis (32,33).An important aspect of this study is the use of PicoGreen to visualize mtDNA packaged into nucleoids.	16055	16279
18487244	While PicoGreen is less sensitive that antiDNA antibodies and does not detect nucleoids containing the lowest levels of mtDNA, it can be used more quantitatively than antiDNA antibodies, being sensitive to the nucleoid DNA content (23).	16280	16516
18487244	With this method, it could be shown that both the number of nucleoids and the average mtDNA content in individual cells declined with time in fibroblast cultures from the patients with the mosaic cellular depletion phenotype (Fig.	16517	16747
18487244	2).	144	147
18487244	During this decline, the distribution of nucleoid intensities remained similar within the range where the PicoGreen signal is quantitative (23).	16752	16896
18487244	This might indicate that the balance between nucleoid fusion and division depends more on the mtDNA content of the nucleoid than the number of nucleoids in the cell.	16897	17062
18487244	It may also explain our observation that occasional mitochondria within TFAM depleted cells retained Mitotracker labelling (Supplementary Material, Fig.	17063	17215
18487244	S2).	17216	17220
18487244	Occasional nucleoids of relatively normal mtDNA content in cells that are profoundly depleted of mtDNA may underlie the co-localization of Mitotracker and residual TFAM signal.Like many replicases, POLG1 has a 3′ to 5′ nuclease activity that is used to excise incorrectly paired bases.	17221	17506
18487244	Mutations in this domain have been seen in both childhood and adult onset POLG1 disease.	17507	17595
18487244	In the mutator mouse model, POLG1 with deficient exonuclease activity impairs both polymerase fidelity and shortens lifespan (34,–36).	17596	17730
18487244	By analogy with other DNA polymerases, the enzyme probably alternates between polymerizing and editing modes, as determined by competition between the two active sites for the 3′ primer end of the DNA (37).	17731	17937
18487244	Once the correct base has been incorporated, the enzyme moves forward 1 bp further, ready for the next precursor nucleotide to enter.	17938	18071
18487244	Patient B, who is a compound heterozygote with one mutation in the polymerase and one in the exonuclease domain, has a severe cellular and clinical phenotype, comparable with patients A, C and D, who either have two polymerase (patients A and C) or two exonuclease mutations (patient D).	18072	18359
18487244	The apparent lack of complementation between the POLG1 mutations in patient B supports the molecular model, by suggesting that normal mtDNA replication requires both polymerase and exonuclease activity within the same alpha subunit.Previous studies of patients with POLG1 mutations have found limited correlation between phenotype and genotype (38–40).	18360	18712
18487244	Horvath et al. (38) reported that patients with Alpers disease generally had at least one catalytic mutation, most commonly in the polymerase domain, and that patients whose mutations both lay in the linker domain presented later.	18713	18943
18487244	Bindoff and coworkers (27) studied 26 individuals with two common linker mutations, A467T and W748S.	18944	19044
18487244	The A467T mutation influences the interaction of POLG1 with POLG2 and the W748S mutation reduces both processivity and DNA binding.	19045	19176
18487244	These authors found major differences in survival depending on genotype, with compound heterozygotes having a significantly shorter survival time than patients homozygous either for the A467T or W748S mutations.	19177	19388
18487244	As the active form of POLG is known to be a compound heterotrimer containing one alpha and two beta subunits, this suggests a quaternary interaction between catalytic subunits in different heterotrimers.	19389	19592
18487244	While our data set is much too small to draw parallel inferences, we saw nothing to suggest quaternary interactions between polymerase domains.	19593	19736
18487244	Patient C, who was homozygous for the R1096C mutation, had a comparable cellular and clinical phenotype to patient A, who was a compound heterozygote for this mutation and T914P.Six of the other POLG1 mutations we identified have not been reported previously.	19737	19996
18487244	These comprise one nonsense mutation (R374X), one 10 amino acid deletion (W347_L356del), three simple missense mutations (H277L, R417T, H569Q) and one allele with two missense mutations (P587L;P589L).	19997	20197
18487244	While P589L is novel, it is in cis with P587L which has been reported as a recessive mutation.	20198	20292
18487244	H277L, R417T and H569Q are all within nine amino acids of previously reported recessive mutations and alter residues that are highly conserved across mammalian species.	20293	20461
18487244	In addition, R417T may lead to aberrant splicing as the last nucleotide of exon 6 is mutated (1250G>C).Wanrooij et al. (41) used two dimensional DNA analysis to show that cells, over-expressing POLG1 or TWINKLE containing catalytic defects, have both cellular depletion of mtDNA and replisome stalling.	20462	20764
18487244	In some of their cell lines, the mtDNA depletion was apparent as reduced numbers of nucleoids.	20765	20859
18487244	We have previously shown that intra-mitochondrial nucleotide imbalance occurs in cells from patients with mutations in TK2, dGK, TWINKLE and, potentially, TP (24).	20860	21023
18487244	Nucleotide imbalance is another potential cause of replisome pausing and depletion, and cells that are deficient in dGK may also have mosaic mtDNA depletion (25,42).	21024	21189
18487244	Replisome pausing may thus underlie mtDNA depletion due to either POLG1 mutations (41) or to nucleotide imbalances (43).	21190	21310
18487244	The mosaic cellular depletion that we have demonstrated may thus be a manifestation of severe replication stalling.	21311	21426
18487244	As in the model proposed by Wanrooij et al., we found that each of the fibroblast cultures from patients A–D (that had the most severe cellular depletion) had at least two POLG1 mutations lying in catalytic domains.	21427	21642
18487244	The depletion in the patient cells was less pronounced than in the in vitro study, however, the progressive depletion observed with successive passages of patient cells may partly recapitulate the depletion observed on induction of the mutant POLG1 in the experimental study.The clinical findings in this group of patients are similar to those found in previous studies of POLG1 mutations in Alpers disease.	21643	22050
18487244	The prominence of epilepsy has been highlighted before, as well as the variability in pointers to mitochondrial disease.	22051	22171
18487244	Movement disorders appear to be very much more common than in maternally inherited mtDNA disease, especially if this feature is broadened to include epilepsia partialis continua.	22172	22350
18487244	Thus, epilepsia partialis continua and movement disorders may provide an important pointer to POLG1 mutations.	22351	22461
18487244	In one case, fatal deterioration followed valproate therapy and others have reported a clear improvement on stopping therapy with this anticonvulsant.	22462	22612
18487244	However, several other patients, with a generally milder phenotype, have been treated with this drug for short periods without apparent problem.	22613	22757
18487244	The relationship between the hepatic encephalopathy associated with valproate therapy and pre-existing POLG mutations (carrier frequency <1 in 150) is worthy of further study.Among a group of patients with POLG1 mutations, we have identified and characterized mosaic cellular depletion of mitochondrial DNA in four patients, each with two mutations affecting catalytic domains.	22758	23135
18487244	These mutations appear to have severe consequences, both for the clinical phenotype and the mtDNA content of affected tissues.	23136	23262
18487244	Patients with demonstrable tissue mtDNA depletion always had at least one catalytic domain or nonsense mutation.	23263	23375
18487244	Our findings add general support to the current model of the role of POLG1 in the replisome.Patients were referred to our diagnostic service with a variety of clinical presentations.	23376	23558
18487244	In two cases (we received fibroblasts, the patients having been diagnosed at other centres [patient D (37) and J (21,24)].	23559	23681
18487244	Alpers was diagnosed on the basis of the referring clinician's information, some of which was collected retrospectively (Table 1).	23682	23812
18487244	Case histories for patients A–C are in the Supplementary Material.All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd or Biomol International.	23813	23945
18487244	Antibodies to TFAM were raised in our own lab, anti-DNA was from ProGen Biotechnick GmbH.	23946	24035
18487244	Anti-BrdU antibody was from Roche.	24036	24070
18487244	Alexafluor secondary antibodies, mouse anti-COXI, PicoGreen and Mitotracker Red were from Invitrogen Corp.Fibroblast cultures were all free of mycoplasma by routine screening and were cultured in Dulbeco's modified essential medium, with 4.5 g/l glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PCL International UK Ltd), 20 mm pyruvate, 2 mm glutamate and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 50 µm uridine.Approximately 4 × 106 cells were re-suspended in 2 ml of DNA extraction buffer and incubated at 50°C for 1–3 h. The DNA was then precipitated with the addition of an equal volume of isopropanol at room temperature and the DNA pellet washed three times in 70% ethanol before air drying, and re-suspension Tris–EDTA buffer, pH 7.4.	24071	24813
18487244	In some experiments DNA was extracted by using a QIAamp DNA mini kit, as per manufacturer's instructions.Cells were grown overnight in six well plates.	24814	24965
18487244	MtDNA staining in live cells was achieved by diluting stock PicoGreen solution at 3 µl/ml (1–3 h).	24966	25064
18487244	The cells were rinsed three times in pre-warmed PBS and mounted with phenol red free DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g/l glucose and 25 mm HEPES buffer, and visualized using an epifluorescent microscope.	25065	25263
18487244	Cells were co-stained after PicoGreen labelling with TMRM by incubation for 30 min in medium containing 30 nM TMRM at 37°C.For immunocytochemical staining, cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% triton-X in PBS for 15 min.	25264	25536
18487244	The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h. Antibody dilutions were anti-TFAM antibody at 1:60, anti-COX subunit I at 10 µg/ml, anti-DNA 1:10.	25537	25698
18487244	After incubation, the cells were rinsed in PBS and primary antibodies were visualized using fluorescent-tagged secondary antibodies.	25699	25831
18487244	Antibody dilutions were: Anti-rabbit FITC (1:60), anti-mouse FITC (1:75), anti-rabbit TRITC (1:60).	25832	25931
18487244	After incubation, the cells were counterstained with 0.5 µg/ml DAPI, rinsed in PBS X3, and mounted using Hydromount.	25932	26048
18487244	For Mitotracker co-labelling cells were incubating with 100 nm Mitotracker for 30 min, with a further 25 min in dye-free medium, before fixation.For bromodeoxyuridine labelling of newly synthesized DNA (44), cells were incubated for 3–7 h in DMEM supplemented with 15 µm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and fixed in glycine fix (–20°C) for 40 min.	26049	26390
18487244	The cells were gently re-hydrated and the cells were incubated with anti-BrdU with nucleases, for 45 min at 37°C.	26391	26504
18487244	The primary was visualized with an anti-mouse secondary, and the cells mounted.Cells to be stained for cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity were grown on sterile glass cover slips overnight.	26505	26694
18487244	Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and once with 50% PBS in water, and all traces of fluid removed.	26695	26796
18487244	Cells were air-dried and then incubated at 37°C with freshly prepared modified staining buffer, consisting of 10% sucrose, 100 µm of fully reduced bovine cytochrome c, 8 units catalase, 1 mg/ml DAB and 0.25% DMSO, 10% sucrose in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7).	26797	27063
18487244	After incubations, a brown deposit of insoluble DAB polymer representing COX activity is generated by single electron reduction of DAB monomer.	27064	27207
18487244	The staining buffer was removed, and the cells rinsed once with 20 mm phosphate buffer, followed by post fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, and mounted in Hydromount.	27208	27372
18487244	An azide treated negative control was included with each experiment.SDH activity was measured as described (45), with modifications.	27373	27505
18487244	The cells were air-dried as above, and incubated in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 1.5 mm nitroblue tetrazolium, 130 mm sodium succinate, 0.2 mm phenazine methosulfate and 1.0 mm sodium azide, for 1–2 h at 37°C.Image capture was done using SimplePCI, and figures were constructed with Photoshop.	27506	27810
18487244	Quantitative image analysis was performed on unprocessed images using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html), and fluorescent intensities calculated using the sum of pixel grey scale values, corrected for mean local cellular background.Estimation of relative mtDNA to nDNA levels were performed as described previously (23), except the nuclear probe was labelled with Vic at the 5′ end and the amplification reactions were done simultaneously using a GeneAmp 7700 sequence detection system.t-tests were carried out using the SPSS package version 15.0.The entire coding region and flanking intronic regions (at least 10 nucleotides) of POLG were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and sequenced by fluorescent dideoxy sequencing (Applied Biosystems BigDye Terminator v1.1 kit) and capillary electrophoresis (Applied Biosystems 3730) (primers and conditions available on request).	27811	28699
18487244	Results were compared with GenBank reference sequences NT_033276.4 and NM_002693.1.	28700	28783
18487244	Nucleotide numbering was assigned using the A of the ATG translation initiation codon as nucleotide 1.	28784	28886
18487244	The POLG p.A467T, p.W748S and p.G848S mutations were also analysed by PCR and restriction enzyme digest (primers, restriction enzymes and conditions available on request).Supplementary Material is available at HMG Online.This work was supported by the Medical Research Council, the Wellcome Trust, the Royal Society and the National Commissioning Group.	28887	29240
20105280	Ras proteins have been shown to regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis and senescence.	0	146
20105280	Ras proteins are small GTP-binding proteins that switch between inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound and active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound conformations.	147	314
20105280	Active GTP-bound Ras recruits Raf to the cell membrane.	315	370
20105280	Raf then phosphorylates mitogen-activated and extracellular-signal regulated kinase kinases (MEKs) which in turn, phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks).	371	545
20105280	Erks activate cytoplasmic substrates and translocate to the nucleus to stimulate expression of immediate early genes such as c-jun and E26 transcription factors (ETS).	546	713
20105280	The Ras-Raf-Erk signaling pathway has been shown to be sufficient for transformation of murine cell lines.	714	820
20105280	Activating somatic missense mutations in Ras genes (predominantly in codons 12, 13 and 61) have been found in a number of human cancers.	821	957
20105280	Specific associations have been found between the three major Ras oncogenes, H-, K- and N-Ras, and specific types of malignancies.	958	1088
20105280	For instance, K-Ras mutations are frequent in pancreatic and colon carcinomas, H-Ras mutations in bladder cancers and N-Ras mutations in melanomas and small intestine malignancies.	1089	1269
20105280	In addition, germline mutations in Ras underlie several developmental disorders including cardio-facio cutaneous syndrome (K-Ras), Costello (H-Ras) and Noonan syndromes (K-Ras) that are characterized by sporadic tumors and skeletal, cardiac and visual abnormalities.	1270	1536
20105280	The reasons for the association of specific Ras genes with specific tumors or developmental disorders are not well understood.	1537	1663
20105280	Analysis of H-, K- and N-Ras null mice suggests that Ras proteins perform both unique and overlapping roles during development.	1664	1791
20105280	H-Ras and N-Ras single and double null mice are viable, fertile and develop normally.	1792	1877
20105280	Of the two K-Ras isoforms, 4A and 4B, 4B but not 4A is essential for embryogenesis.	1878	1961
20105280	K-Ras 4B null embryos die in utero due to anemia, liver and cardiac defects.	1962	2038
20105280	Replacement of K-Ras coding sequences with H-Ras results in viable mice suggesting that H-Ras protein can perform the functions of K-Ras in K-Ras-expressing tissues presumably by activating the same set of downstream targets.	2039	2264
20105280	Alterations in ocular development in K-Ras null mice have not been reported.	2265	2341
20105280	Lens differentiation is initiated when the neuroectoderm-derived optic vesicle induces the overlying surface ectoderm to upregulate the expression of transcription factors such as Pax6 and Sox2, leading to lens placode formation [reviewed in].	2342	2585
20105280	The lens placode then invaginates to form a distinctively shaped, symmetrical lens pit.	2586	2673
20105280	BMP receptor mediated signaling has recently been shown to be critical for this placodal invagination.	2674	2776
20105280	The lens cells subsequently detach from the overlying ectoderm to form the lens vesicle.	2777	2865
20105280	Lens detachment requires the transcription factors FoxE3 and Pitx3.	2866	2933
20105280	During vesicle closure, the posterior cells of the lens vesicle initiate fiber cell differentiation, forming the primary fiber cells.	2934	3067
20105280	Fiber cells exit from the cell cycle, undergo dramatic elongation, and express β- and γ-crystallins.	3068	3168
20105280	The anterior cells of the lens remain cuboidal and retain expression of Pax6 and E-Cadherin.	3169	3261
20105280	The anterior-posterior polarity of the lens is maintained throughout life by coordination of lens epithelial proliferation, cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation.	3262	3442
20105280	Upregulation of the transcription factor Prox1 at the transition zone near the equator has been shown to be essential for cell cycle exit.	3443	3581
20105280	The CDK inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 are upregulated at the transition zone and are necessary for proper cell cycle exit at the outset of fiber cell differentiation.	3582	3749
20105280	An inductive signal from the neural retina is critical for initiation of lens fiber differentiation.	3750	3850
20105280	Though the identity of this inductive signal is not known, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that this signal is an FGF or FGF-like molecule.	3851	3995
20105280	Expression of a secreted dominant negative version of the FGFR3 or targeted deletion of FGFR1, 2 and 3 in the lens results in the delay or loss of fiber cell differentiation.	3996	4170
20105280	These results suggest that FGF receptor mediated signaling is necessary for initiation of lens fiber differentiation.	4171	4288
20105280	After lens vesicle detachment, surface epithelial cells adjacent to the lens vesicle differentiate to form the corneal epithelium.	4289	4419
20105280	In mice, corneal epithelial differentiation is marked by Keratin 12 (K12) expression.	4420	4505
20105280	The corneal stroma and endothelium are formed by intraocular migration of neural crest and mesodermally-derived periocular mesenchymal cells.	4506	4647
20105280	Previous studies showed that activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway in the lens epithelial cells in transgenic mice leads to cell cycle exit and premature fiber differentiation.	4648	4853
20105280	In contrast, FGF signaling induces the corneal epithelial cells to first proliferate and later differentiate into lacrimal or Harderian glands.	4854	4997
20105280	The molecular mechanisms that regulate proliferative and differentiation responses of the cornea and lens respectively have not been defined.	4998	5139
20105280	Activation of Ras, a downstream effector of FGF signaling, in the lenses of transgenic mice is sufficient to induce lens epithelial hyperplasia.	5140	5284
20105280	In addition, H-, K- and N-Ras genes are expressed ubiquitously within the eye.	5285	5363
20105280	However, in previous studies, downstream targets of Ras activation in the lens were not analyzed.	5364	5461
20105280	In addition, the promoter used to drive Ras expression in the eye was lens-specific thereby precluding analysis of the effects of Ras activation in the cornea.	5462	5621
20105280	In order to test whether activation of Ras in the cornea can phenocopy the effects of FGF signaling, we generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active version of H-Ras (G12V) driven by a modified Pax6 promoter This promoter is active in the lens, corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells.	5622	5927
20105280	Our results suggest that, despite the common embryonic origin of the lens and the cornea, these two tissues possess distinct sets of downstream targets that regulate the cellular responses to Ras activation.	5928	6135
20105280	The human H-Ras (G12V) genomic clone, encoding a constitutively active version of H-Ras (from Dr. Michael Lieberman, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston), was digested with SpeI and inserted between the Pax6 promoter/enhancer and the SV40 intron and polyadenylation sequences.	6136	6412
20105280	The injection fragment was generated by SpeI and StuI digestion and was microinjected into individual pronuclei of 1-cell stage FVB/N mouse embryos.	6413	6561
20105280	Injected embryos were transferred into pseudopregnant ICR strain female mice.	6562	6639
20105280	Animals were handled following the guidelines provided in US Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.	6640	6775
20105280	The embryos were allowed to develop to term and potential Pax6-Ras transgenic mice were identified by isolating genomic DNA from tail biopsies and screening by PCR, using primers specific for the SV40 sequences.	6776	6987
20105280	Embryos were obtained by mating FVB/N females to heterozygous Ras transgenic males.	6988	7071
20105280	Pregnant females were sacrificed at appropriate time points and transgenic offspring were identified by PCR.	7072	7180
20105280	Heads of transgenic mice were removed, fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5-7 μm) and used for histological analyses, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.	7181	7379
20105280	To analyze patterns of gene expression, [35S] UTP-labeled riboprobes were generated.	7380	7464
20105280	The SV40 antisense riboprobe was synthesized using EcoRI-digested SV40 DNA and T3 RNA polymerase (Promega).	7465	7572
20105280	The FoxE3 antisense probe was synthesized using HindIII-digested mouse FoxE3 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase.	7573	7677
20105280	The Pitx3 antisense probe was synthesized using XhoI-digested mouse Pitx3 cDNA and SP6 RNA polymerase.	7678	7780
20105280	The Prox1 antisense probe was synthesized using SmaI-digested mouse Prox1 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase.	7781	7882
20105280	The p57Kip2 antisense probe was synthesized using BamHI-digested mouse p57Kip2 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase.	7883	7989
20105280	The Erm, Pea3, Spry1 and Spry4 antisense probes were synthesized using EcoRI-digested Erm, Pea3, Spry1 and Spry4 cDNAs and T7 RNA polymerase.	7990	8131
20105280	The Spry2 antisense probe was synthesized using SacI-digested mouse Spry2 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase.	8132	8233
20105280	The cyclin D1 antisense probe was synthesized using XhoI-digested mouse cyclin D1 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase.	8234	8343
20105280	The cyclin D2 antisense probe was synthesized using SphI-digested mouse cyclin D2 cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase.	8344	8453
20105280	The cyclin B1 antisense probe was synthesized using HincII-digested mouse cyclin B1 cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase.	8454	8565
20105280	The p21Cip1 antisense probe was synthesized using ApaI-digested mouse p21Cip1 cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase.	8566	8671
20105280	The Hes1 antisense probe was synthesized using HindIII-digested mouse Hes1 cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase.	8672	8774
20105280	In situ hybridizations were performed using the same hybridization and washing conditions as described previously.	8775	8889
20105280	The hybridized slides were soaked in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion, dried and exposed for 4-10 days at 4°C.	8890	8988
20105280	Following development and fixation, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.	8989	9073
20105280	Bright and dark-field images were captured separately using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope.	9074	9166
20105280	Silver grains in the dark field images were pseudo-colored red using ADOBE Photoshop CS and overlaid on corresponding bright field images.	9167	9305
20105280	Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed as follows.	9306	9389
20105280	Slides containing ocular sections were first deparaffinized and rehydrated.	9390	9465
20105280	Antigens were retrieved by microwave treatment in 10 mM Sodium Citrate buffer (pH 6.0).	9466	9553
20105280	Following antigen retrieval, the tissue sections were blocked with 10% normal horse serum for 30 minutes, at room temperature.	9554	9680
20105280	The slides were then incubated with anti-Pax6 (catalog number PRB-278P, 1:250; Covance, Berkeley, CA), anti-E-Cadherin (catalog number 610181, 1:1000; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), anti-Keratin 14 (Krt14) (catalog number PRB-155P, 1:2000; Covance), anti-Prox1 (catalog number ab5475, 1:1000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-α A crystallin (catalog number ab5595, 1:10,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-β crystallin (catalog number sc-22745, 1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Keratin 12 (Krt12) (catalog number KAL-KR074, 1:200; Cosmo Bio Company, Tokyo, Japan), anti-phospho Erk1/2 (catalog number 4370, 1:50; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-p57Kip2 (catalog number ab4058, 1:250; Abcam), anti-14-3-3σ (catalog number sc-7683, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Ki67 (catalog number M7249, 1:200, Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA) or anti-Trp63 (4A4) (catalog number sc-8431, 1:100; Santa Cruz) antibody overnight at 4°C.	9681	10653
20105280	Following brief washes in PBS, the slides were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated-secondary antibodies; anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number BA-1000, 1:200; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) for Pax6, Prox1, α A-crystallin, β-crystallin, phospho-Erk1/2, p57Kip2, Krt12 or Krt14, anti-mouse IgG (catalog number BA-2000, 1:200; Vector Labs) for E-Cadherin or Trp63, anti-goat IgG (catalog number BA-5000, 1:200; Vector Labs) for 14-3-3σ and anti-rat IgG (catalog number BA-4000, 1:200, Vector Labs) for Ki67 for 30 minutes at 37°C.	10654	11182
20105280	Antigen-antibody complexes were then detected using streptavidin-linked Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 1:1000 dilution.	11183	11311
20105280	Sections were mounted using ProLong Antifade media containing DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).	11312	11406
20105280	Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope.	11407	11466
20105280	DNA replication was examined by BrdU incorporation as described previously.	11467	11542
20105280	Cell proliferation was analyzed by counting the number of BrdU positive nuclei.	11543	11622
20105280	Quantification of cell proliferation (BrdU labeling index) was performed by determining the fraction of BrdU labeled nuclei over the total number of nuclei present on a given section.	11623	11806
20105280	Cells in the interior of the Pax6-Ras transgenic lenses that expressed markers such as FoxE3 and Prox1 were counted as lens cells.	11807	11937
20105280	A minimum of 3 different embryos were analyzed per genotype/time point.	11938	12009
20105280	The number of sections used for quantification is indicated in the graphs (Fig.	12010	12089
20105280	4I).	12090	12094
20105280	Analysis was performed by two-tailed Student's t-test at P ≤ 0.05.	12095	12161
20105280	In order to test whether activation of Ras, a downstream effector of FGF signaling, can mimic the effects of FGF stimulation on the lens and cornea in the murine eye, we generated transgenic mice with targeted expression of a constitutively active (and oncogenic) version of human H-Ras under the control of the Pax6 promoter (Fig.	12162	12493
20105280	1).	12494	12497
20105280	This promoter is active from embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) in the lens, corneal and conjunctival epithelial precursors.	12498	12612
20105280	The Pax6-Ras transgene was constructed by inserting the human H-Ras gene (G12V) between the Pax6 enhancer/promoter and SV40 intron and polyadenylation site.	12613	12769
20105280	The transgene was microinjected and two founders were generated.	12770	12834
20105280	Stable transgenic lines (OVE2043, OVE2044) were established from these founders.	12835	12915
20105280	Transgenic line OVE2043 did not show any ocular abnormalities.	12916	12978
20105280	OVE2044 mice showed microphthalmia and were born with open eyelids.	12979	13046
20105280	Transgene expression in the two Pax6-Ras transgenic lines was examined by in situ hybridizations (Fig.	13047	13149
20105280	2).	13150	13153
20105280	No transgene expression was seen in the OVE2043 line (data not shown).	13154	13224
20105280	In the OVE2044 line, at E11.5 and E13.5, transgene expression could be seen in the lens, corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells (Fig.	13225	13361
20105280	2B, D).	13362	13369
20105280	Low levels of Ras transgene expression were seen in a subset of neuroblasts in the retina at E13.5 (Fig.	13370	13474
20105280	2D) with stronger expression at E16.5 (Fig.	13475	13518
20105280	2F).	13519	13523
20105280	As transgene expression was seen only in the OVE2044 transgenic line, further studies were performed on this line and the results are presented here.	13524	13673
20105280	In this manuscript we study the initial changes in lens and corneal differentiation.	13674	13758
20105280	Later changes in retinal organization are not evaluated in this report.	13759	13830
20105280	In order to assess the alterations in ocular development and morphology, sections of Pax6-Ras transgenic mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Fig.	13831	13986
20105280	3).	13987	13990
20105280	Nontransgenic littermates were used as controls.	13991	14039
20105280	At E10.5, the lens placode had invaginated to form the lens pit (Fig.	14040	14109
20105280	3A, A').	14110	14118
20105280	In the Ras transgenic embryos, morphological changes at the anterior margin of the lens pit were visible (Fig.	14119	14229
20105280	3B, B').	14230	14238
20105280	The boundary between the surface and lens pit epithelial cells was well defined in the nontransgenic embryos (Fig.	14239	14353
20105280	3A, A').	14110	14118
20105280	In contrast, in the transgenic embryos, extra cells extending into the interior of the lens pit were seen (Fig.	14363	14474
20105280	3B, B', arrow).	14475	14490
20105280	At E11.5, Ras transgenic lenses and corneas displayed epithelial hyperplasia (Fig.	14491	14573
20105280	3D, D').	14574	14582
20105280	In addition, the extra cells seen in the lens pit were internalized within the lumen of the developing lens.	14583	14691
20105280	(Fig.	12084	12089
20105280	3D, D', arrow).	14698	14713
20105280	By E13.5, Ras transgenic lenses had become embedded in the cornea (Fig.	14714	14785
20105280	3F, F').	14786	14794
20105280	At E16.5, the eyelids had failed to close in the Ras transgenic embryos (Fig.	14795	14872
20105280	3H).	14873	14877
20105280	In addition, lenses remained attached to the cornea and the lens epithelial cells showed an elongated morphology (Fig.	14878	14996
20105280	3H', bracket) in contrast to the cuboidal morphology in the lens epithelial cells of nontransgenic embryos (Fig.	14997	15109
20105280	3G', bracket).	15110	15124
20105280	The corneal stroma was disorganized and a distinctive corneal endothelium was not seen (Fig.	15125	15217
20105280	3H').	15218	15223
20105280	At E18.5, vacuoles were present inside the defective lens (Fig.	15224	15287
20105280	3J, arrows) and the central cornea showed epithelial and stromal defects (Fig.	15288	15366
20105280	3J, J').	15367	15375
20105280	In order to assess apoptosis in Ras transgenic lens and corneal epithelial cells, we examined cleavage of caspase-3, a critical mediator of apoptosis, by immunohistochemistry (Fig.	15376	15556
20105280	3K, L).	15557	15564
20105280	Activated caspase 3 was detected in the transgenic epithelial cells within the lens that were not in contact with the basement membrane (Fig.	15565	15706
20105280	3L, arrows).	15707	15719
20105280	Positive staining was not seen in the lens epithelial cells that expressed the Ras transgene but retained contact with the basement membrane.	15720	15861
20105280	Similarly, activated caspase 3 staining, for the most part, was not seen in the Ras transgenic corneas (Fig.	15862	15970
20105280	3L).	15971	15975
20105280	In order to assess cell proliferation in the Ras transgenic embryos, BrdU incorporation assays and Ki67 immunohistochemistry were performed (Fig.	15976	16121
20105280	4).	16122	16125
20105280	The BrdU incorporation assay allows the identification of cells in S phase of the cell cycle.	16126	16219
20105280	Ki67 is expressed by cycling cells in G1, S, G2 and M phase but not G0 cells.	16220	16297
20105280	Ras transgenic lenticular and corneal epithelial cells show a significant increase in BrdU labeling at E11.5 (Fig.	16298	16412
20105280	4B, I).	16413	16420
20105280	The cells in the interior part of the lens vesicle that were not in contact with the basement membrane also incorporated BrdU (Fig.	16421	16552
20105280	4B, arrow).	16553	16564
20105280	At E13.5, a significant increase in the BrdU labeling index of corneal, but not lens, epithelial cells was seen (Fig.	16565	16682
20105280	4D, I).	16683	16690
20105280	Both BrdU (Fig.	16691	16706
20105280	4A-D) and Ki67 (Fig.	16707	16727
20105280	4E-H) assays showed consistent results.	16728	16767
20105280	Thus, Ras transgenic lenticular and corneal epithelial cells show a significant increase in proliferation initially but later, this increase is sustained in the corneal but not in the lens epithelial cells.	16768	16974
20105280	Alterations in conjunctival epithelial proliferation will be described elsewhere (DB, ES, RW, VG).	16975	17073
20105280	Alterations in the lens differentiation program were assessed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Fig.	17074	17191
20105280	5).	17192	17195
20105280	Pax6, FoxE3, Prox1 and Pitx3 are transcription factors that are critical for lens specification (Pax6), lens vesicle detachment (FoxE3, Pitx3) and cell cycle exit of lens epithelial cells (Prox1).	17196	17392
20105280	In nontransgenic lenses, Pax6, E-Cadherin and FoxE3 are expressed in the epithelial cells (Fig.	17393	17488
20105280	5A, C, E), β-crystallin in differentiated fiber cells (Fig.	17489	17548
20105280	5O, Q) and Prox1 and α-crystallin in both epithelial and fiber cells (Fig.	17549	17623
20105280	5G, I, M).	17624	17634
20105280	Expression of Pax6 (Fig.	17635	17659
20105280	5B), FoxE3 (Fig.	17660	17676
20105280	5F) and Pitx3 (Fig.	17677	17696
20105280	5L) in the transgenic lens epithelial cells was similar to nontransgenic lenses (Fig.	17697	17782
20105280	5A, E, K).	17783	17793
20105280	E-Cadherin expression in the transgenic lens epithelial cells was comparable, although perhaps not identical, to nontransgenic lenses (Fig.	17794	17933
20105280	5D, T).	17934	17941
20105280	Prox1 expression is normally upregulated near the equator of the lens where the fiber differentiation is initiated (Fig.	17942	18062
20105280	5G, I, white arrows).	18063	18084
20105280	In contrast, Prox1 was upregulated in the Ras transgenic lens epithelial cells (Fig.	18085	18169
20105280	5H, J, arrowheads) but expression in the fiber cells was similar to wild type controls (Fig.	18170	18262
20105280	5H, J).	18263	18270
20105280	Expression of α-crystallin in the transgenic lens epithelial cells (Fig.	18271	18343
20105280	5N) and β-crystallins in the transgenic lens fiber cells were similar to nontransgenic controls (Fig.	18344	18445
20105280	5O-R).	18446	18452
20105280	The extra cells in the interior part of the Ras transgenic lenses that were not in contact with the basement membrane expressed lens epithelial markers including FoxE3 (Fig.	18453	18626
20105280	5F), Pitx3 (Fig.	18627	18643
20105280	5L) and α-crystallin (Fig.	18644	18670
20105280	5N).	18671	18675
20105280	In addition, in a subset of these cells, expression of Prox1 (Fig.	18676	18742
20105280	5H, J) and β-crystallin (Fig.	18743	18772
20105280	5P, R, arrows) could be detected.	18773	18806
20105280	Double labeling with β-crystallin and E-Cadherin antibodies suggested co-localization of these two proteins in some of the abnormal epithelial cells (Fig.	18807	18961
20105280	5S, T).	18962	18969
20105280	These results show that some markers of lens fiber differentiation are induced in the anterior cells of the transgenic lenses.	18970	19096
20105280	Erk activation in the Ras transgenic lenses and corneas was assessed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-phospho Erk1/2 antibody (Fig.	19097	19233
20105280	6).	19234	19237
20105280	Erk1 and 2 are phosphorylated in response to Ras activation.	19238	19298
20105280	Phospho-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity could be detected in the lens fiber cells of E11.5 and E13.5 nontransgenic embryos (Fig.	19299	19419
20105280	6A, C).	19420	19427
20105280	Elevated levels of phospho-Erk1/2 were detected in the Ras transgenic lens but not in the corneal epithelial cells (Fig.	19428	19548
20105280	6B, D).	19549	19556
20105280	In addition, a modest reduction of phospho-Erk1/2 levels was seen in the Ras transgenic lens fiber cells at E13.5 (Fig.	19557	19676
20105280	6D, lf).	19677	19685
20105280	These results show that the lens and the corneal epithelial cells show differential Erk1/2 phosphorylation in response to Ras activation.	19686	19823
20105280	In order to test whether Ras activation can induce expression of ETS transcription factors (Erm and Pea3) or negative feedback regulators of Ras-Raf-Erk signaling (Spry1, 2 and 4), in the lens and corneas, in situ hybridizations were performed on E13.5 ocular sections of Ras transgenic embryos (Fig.	19824	20124
20105280	7).	20125	20128
20105280	Erm, Pea3, Spry1 and 2 were upregulated in the Ras transgenic corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells (Fig.	20129	20238
20105280	7B, D, F, H) in contrast to nontransgenic corneas (Fig.	20239	20294
20105280	7A, C, E, G).	20295	20308
20105280	Significant upregulation of Erm, but not Pea3, Spry1 or 2, expression was seen in the Ras transgenic lens epithelial cells (Fig.	20309	20437
20105280	7B, D, F, H).	20438	20451
20105280	Spry 4 was not induced in the transgenic lens or cornea (Fig.	20452	20513
20105280	7J).	20514	20518
20105280	Expression of Erm, Spry1 and 2 in the Ras transgenic lens fiber cells was similar to nontransgenic controls (Fig.	20519	20632
20105280	7B, F, H).	20633	20643
20105280	In summary, different sets of downstream targets were activated in the Ras transgenic lens and corneal epithelial cells.	20644	20764
20105280	Expression of genes that regulate the cell cycle was analyzed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Fig.	20765	20882
20105280	8).	20883	20886
20105280	D-type cyclins are often activated in response to growth factor and/or Ras stimulation and can promote entry into S phase.	20887	21009
20105280	p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 have been shown to regulate cell cycle exit during fiber cell induction.	21010	21102
20105280	Upregulation of cyclins D1 and D2 was seen in the Ras lens and corneal epithelial cells (Fig.	21103	21196
20105280	8B, D).	21197	21204
20105280	Cyclin B1 was upregulated in the transgenic corneal epithelial cells (Fig.	21205	21279
20105280	8F) but expression in the lenses was similar to nontransgenic controls (Fig.	21280	21356
20105280	8E).	21357	21361
20105280	No alterations in cyclin E expression were seen in Ras transgenic lenses and corneas (data not shown).	21362	21464
20105280	p21Cip1 expression was upregulated in both the lens and corneal epithelial cells (Fig.	21465	21551
20105280	8H).	21552	21556
20105280	Expression of p57Kip2 is normally upregulated near the equator where the lens epithelial cells exit the cell cycle and initiate fiber differentiation (Fig.	21557	21712
20105280	8I, K, white arrows).	21713	21734
20105280	p57Kip2 mRNA and p57Kip2 protein levels were upregulated in Ras transgenic lens epithelial cells (Fig.	21735	21837
20105280	8J, L, arrowheads).	21838	21857
20105280	Similarly, p27Kip1 mRNA levels were elevated in the transgenic lens but not corneal epithelial cells (Fig.	21858	21964
20105280	8M, N).	21965	21972
20105280	In summary, D-type cyclins were elevated in both the lens and corneal epithelial cells but B-type cyclins were elevated only in the corneal epithelial cells.	21973	22130
20105280	CDK inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 were preferentially upregulated in the lens but not in the corneal epithelial cells.	22131	22250
20105280	In contrast, p21Cip1 was upregulated in both epithelial cell types.	22251	22318
20105280	Alterations in corneal differentiation in the Ras transgenic corneas were assessed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Fig.	22319	22457
20105280	9).	22458	22461
20105280	Hes1, a transcription factor and a downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway, is modestly expressed in the corneal epithelial cells (Fig.	22462	22606
20105280	9A) and has been shown to be critical for maintenance of the corneal progenitor/stem cells.	22607	22698
20105280	Keratin 12 (Krt12) expression is restricted to the corneal epithelial cells within the eye (Fig.	22699	22795
20105280	9C) and has been shown to be essential for corneal differentiation.	22796	22863
20105280	Krt14, 14-3-3σ and Trp63 are expressed in the corneal, conjunctival and skin epithelia (Fig.	22864	22956
20105280	9E, G, I).	22957	22967
20105280	At E13.5, Hes1 expression was expanded in the Ras transgenic corneas but was unaltered in the Ras transgenic lenses (Fig.	22968	23089
20105280	9A, B).	23090	23097
20105280	At E16.5, Krt12 expression was significantly reduced in the Ras transgenic corneas (Fig.	23098	23186
20105280	9D) but Krt14, 14-3-3σ and Trp63 were still expressed (Fig.	23187	23246
20105280	9F, H, J).	23247	23257
20105280	Reduction in Krt12 expression indicates that terminal differentiation of corneal epithelial cells is inhibited by expression of activated Ras.	23258	23400
20105280	The Pax6-Ras transgenic mice were generated in order to test whether Ras activation in the corneal and lens epithelial cells can phenocopy the effects of FGF stimulation.	23401	23571
20105280	Similar studies performed on embryonic retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells in transgenic mice suggest that Ras activation can mimic the effects of FGF stimulation and is sufficient to induce the RPE cells to initiate a neuronal program of differentiation.	23572	23832
20105280	Lens-specific expression of FGF10 in transgenic mice stimulates corneal epithelial cells to first proliferate and later differentiate into lacrimal and Harderian glands.	23833	24002
20105280	Our results suggest that Ras activation is sufficient to induce proliferation but not glandular differentiation of corneal epithelial cells.	24003	24143
20105280	Ras transgenic lenticular and corneal epithelial cells show increased proliferation with concomitant increases in cyclin D1 and D2 expression.	24144	24286
20105280	The cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 was upregulated in both the lens and corneal epithelia.	24287	24375
20105280	The initial increase in lens epithelial proliferation was not sustained perhaps due to the upregulation of p27kip1 and p57kip2.	24376	24503
20105280	Phospho-Erk1 and Erk2 levels are elevated in the lens but not in the cornea.	24504	24580
20105280	Consistent with this result, expression of Sprys1 and 2, downstream targets of FGF signaling and negative feedback regulators of Ras-Raf-Erk pathway, was higher in the Ras transgenic corneal than in the lens epithelial cells.	24581	24806
20105280	Pea3, an ETS transcription factor, was elevated in the corneal but not in the lens epithelial cells.	24807	24907
20105280	In contrast, transcription of Erm, another ETS transcription factor, was elevated in both the lens and corneal epithelial cells.	24908	25036
20105280	Both lens and corneal differentiation programs were sensitive to Ras activation.	25037	25117
20105280	Ras transgenic lenses showed defects in morphogenesis at the lens pit stage.	25118	25194
20105280	Transgenic lens epithelial cells showed upregulation of Prox1, a transcription factor critical for cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation.	25195	25350
20105280	Keratin 12, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, was significantly reduced in the Ras transgenic corneas.	25351	25467
20105280	Collectively, these results show that a) lens and corneal epithelial growth and differentiation are sensitive to alterations in Ras activity and b) Ras activation can induce distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea.	25468	25701
20105280	In our transgenic model, the H-Ras protein is constitutively active and not subject to feedback regulation.	25702	25809
20105280	It is therefore, possible (and perhaps likely) that Ras activity is significantly higher than normal.	25810	25911
20105280	Upregulation of p21Cip1 (a gene that is not upregulated during normal development) in the Ras transgenic lenses and corneas would be consistent with this possibility.	25912	26078
20105280	Nonetheless, our results show that constitutive Ras signaling is not sufficient to induce glandular differentiation in the cornea.	26079	26209
20105280	As early molecular markers of lacrimal or Harderian gland differentiation are not currently known, initiation of glandular differentiation in the Ras corneal epithelial cells could not be analyzed.	26210	26407
20105280	Our results imply that other signaling pathways downstream of FGF receptor stimulation are necessary for ocular gland differentiation.	26408	26542
20105280	Ras activation, however, is sufficient to induce an increase in corneal epithelial proliferation.	26543	26640
20105280	Similarly, lens epithelial cells also respond to Ras activation by hyperproliferaton.	26641	26726
20105280	Ras activation in the lens and corneal epithelial cells induces transcriptional upregulation of cyclins D1 and D2.	26727	26841
20105280	As cyclin E was not induced in these tissues, it is likely that Ras-induced entry into S phase (assayed by BrdU incorporation) is due to the upregulation of cyclins D1 and D2.	26842	27017
20105280	Cdk inhibitors, p27Kip1 and p57Kip2, are normally upregulated in the transition zone of the lens where the fiber differentiation program is initiated.	27018	27168
20105280	Both p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 cooperatively regulate cell cycle exit at the onset of fiber cell differentiation.	27169	27276
20105280	Ras activation in the lenticular, but not the corneal, epithelial cells upregulated both p27Kip1 and p57Kip2.	27277	27386
20105280	In addition, the initial increase in proliferation seen at E11.5 in the lens epithelial cells was not sustained at E13.5 in contrast to corneal epithelial cells of the same age.	27387	27564
20105280	These results taken together suggest that the deceleration in lens epithelial proliferation at E13.5 could be due to induction of Cdk inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 in the lens.	27565	27742
20105280	The reasons for specific upregulation of these genes in the lens but not in the cornea are not clear.	27743	27844
20105280	However, expression of the transcription factor, Prox1, offers us a clue.	27845	27918
20105280	The transcription factor Prox1 has been shown to be necessary for transcriptional upregulation of p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 in the lens as expression of these two genes is not seen in Prox1 null lenses.	27919	28115
20105280	In lymphatic vascular endothelial cells Prox1 expression is sufficient to activate p57Kip2 expression and to promote cell cycle exit.	28116	28249
20105280	These studies considered together would suggest that transcriptional upregulation of p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 in Ras transgenic lenses could be due to Ras-induced upregulation of Prox1.	28250	28430
20105280	It is not clear why Ras-induced upregulation of Prox1 is specific to the lens but not the cornea.	28431	28528
20105280	Ras transgenic lenses also showed increased apoptosis.	28529	28583
20105280	Apoptosis, however, was not seen in all the lens cells that expressed the Ras transgene suggesting that apoptosis was not a non-specific consequence of Ras transgene expression.	28584	28761
20105280	Apoptosis in the lens was seen only in the abnormal cells in the interior of the lens.	28762	28848
20105280	These results are interesting as oncogenic Ras has been shown to block suspension induced apoptosis or anoikis in vitro.	28849	28969
20105280	Ras is able to protect cells from anoikis through the activation of Akt via PI3 kinase.	28970	29057
20105280	Whether the PI3 kinase-Akt pathway is inactive in the Ras transgenic lenses remain to be verified.	29058	29156
20105280	In the Ras transgenic mice, early events during lens differentiation including lens placode formation and lens invagination were not affected.	29157	29299
20105280	However, Ras transgenic lenses failed to form a normal lens pit resulting in architectural changes at the lens pit stage.	29300	29421
20105280	We considered the possibility that the altered lens pit architecture is caused by loss of FoxE3 or Pitx3 expression as FoxE3 and Pitx3 mutants show persistence of a lens stalk.	29422	29598
20105280	However, expression of both Foxe3 and Pitx3 were unaltered in Ras transgenic lenses.	29599	29683
20105280	We also analyzed the expression of E-Cadherin, a cell adhesion protein that plays a role in lens invagination.	29684	29794
20105280	E-Cadherin was still expressed in the Ras transgenic lenses.	29795	29855
20105280	It seems likely that the alterations in the architecture of the lens pit are a consequence of altered proliferation of cells in or around the lens placode in response to Ras stimulation.	29856	30042
20105280	If this is true, it suggests that cell proliferation and invagination have to be precisely coordinated during lens invagination.	30043	30171
20105280	Previous studies have shown that activation of the FGF signaling pathway in the lens epithelial cells in vivo is sufficient for induction of fiber differentiation.	30172	30335
20105280	In vitro experiments using rat lens epithelial explants have shown that FGFs at low concentration, can induce proliferation and at high concentration, can induce cell cycle exit and differentiation.	30336	30534
20105280	Our results suggest that Ras activation in the lens epithelial cells induces a modest increase in cell proliferation, at least transiently.	30535	30674
20105280	Concurrently, there is upregulation of expression of some of the early markers of lens differentiation such as Prox1, p27Kip1 and p57Kip2.	30675	30813
20105280	However, β-crystallin, a marker of terminal differentiation of lens fibers, was detected in only a small fraction of the Ras transgenic lens epithelial cells.	30814	30972
20105280	Some of these cells also expressed lens epithelial markers including Pax6 and E-Cadherin, suggesting an abnormal or ambiguous state of differentiation.	30973	31124
20105280	These results suggest that Ras activation is sufficient to initiate only limited aspects of the lens fiber differentiation program.	31125	31256
20105280	These results are consistent with previous reports that show Erk signaling, while necessary for FGF-induced lens fiber elongation, is not sufficient for β-crystallin expression.	31257	31434
20105280	Both corneal and lens epithelial cells originate from the surface ectoderm.	31435	31510
20105280	Interestingly, our results suggest that, in spite of their common embryonic origin, the lens and the cornea activate distinctive sets of downstream targets in response to Ras activation.	31511	31697
20105280	Phospho-Erk levels were elevated in the Ras transgenic lens but not in the cornea.	31698	31780
20105280	In addition, negative feedback regulators of Raf-Erk signaling such as Spry1 and Spry2 are elevated more in the cornea than in the lens epithelial cells.	31781	31934
20105280	These observations provide correlative evidence that Spry1 and 2 may be inhibiting Raf-Erk signaling in the corneal epithelial cells.	31935	32068
20105280	Alternatively, it is possible that signaling effectors downstream of Ras that are critical for Erk phosphorylation are expressed in the lens more than in the cornea.	32069	32234
20105280	This model would predict that Ras-induced expression of downstream targets in the cornea is independent of Erk activation and that Ras signals through other effectors.	32235	32402
20105280	Transcription factors that show tissue-specific expression such as Trp63 in the cornea or Prox1 in the lens may also dictate the response of these tissues to Ras signaling.	32403	32575
20105280	Nonetheless, the differential activation of downstream targets in these two related tissues is a novel discovery that warrants further analysis.	32576	32720
20105280	Our results suggest that corneal differentiation is sensitive to changes in Ras activity.	32721	32810
20105280	Interestingly, in contrast to the lens, Ras stimulation inhibits corneal epithelial differentiation.	32811	32911
20105280	Expression of Krt12, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, is significantly reduced.	32912	33006
20105280	Expansion of the expression domain of Hes1, a gene critical for maintenance of pleuripotency, is consistent with the block in differentiation.	33007	33149
20105280	Expression of other proteins such as 14-3-3σ, Krt14 and Trp63 that are normally expressed in, but not restricted to, the corneal epithelium was maintained.	33150	33305
20105280	Therefore, it is likely that the inhibition of Krt12 expression in the Ras transgenic corneas is a specific effect of Ras stimulation.	33306	33440
20105280	Collectively, our results suggest that Ras activation induces distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea resulting in distinct cellular responses.	33441	33603
20105280	These results support the model that responses to Ras signaling are tissue specific and dictated by the autonomous programming of the responding tissues.	33604	33757
20105280	These results also suggest the possibility that the associations seen between mutations in specific Ras genes and specific types of malignancies could be explained at least in part, by cell-specific activation of different signaling effectors and downstream targets.	33758	34024
20806042	Cataract, the opacification of all or part of the lens, is a common ocular disease that causes blindness in millions of people around the world.	0	144
20806042	The opaque lens, which frequently leads to eyesight reduction and even complete loss of sight, can be congenital or acquired.	145	270
20806042	Although congenital cataract is much less common than age-related cataract, it is still responsible for approximately 10% of childhood blindness worldwide.	271	426
20806042	Inheritance accounts for at least 50% of all congenital cataracts, compared with other factors.	427	522
20806042	From a genetic standpoint, congenital cataract is primarily an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive and X-linked patterns have also been reported.	523	690
20806042	Inherited cataract commonly presents in an isolated fashion, a component of other ocular disorders, or a part of systemic syndromes.	691	823
20806042	Cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC, OMIM 116150) is characterized by the association of congenital cataract and microcornea without any other systemic abnormality.	824	988
20806042	Microcornea is defined as a horizontal corneal diameter of less than 10.00 mm, and appears as a distinct phenotype affecting 12%–18% of congenital cataract cases.	989	1151
20806042	To date, more than seven genes have been reported in association with congenital cataract and microcornea.	1152	1258
20806042	These genes have been identified as coding for three crystallins (αA-crystallin [CRYAA], βB1-crystallin [CRYBB1], and γD-crystallin [CRYGD]), one gap junctional protein (gap junction protein, alpha 8 [GJA8]), and two transcription factors (Maf-like protein gene [MAF] and paired box gene 6 [PAX6]).	1259	1557
20806042	Several other loci have also been linked to CCMC, but the mutant genes have not yet been identified.	1558	1658
20806042	In the present study, a human inherited autosomal dominant CCMC was analyzed in a four-generation Chinese pedigree.	1659	1774
20806042	A missense mutation in GJA8 was detected, which was responsible for the disease in this family.	1775	1870
20806042	A four-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome was recruited from Heilongjiang province in the Northeast of China.	1871	2036
20806042	Three affected patients, four non-carrier relatives, and 100 healthy normal controls were involved in this study.	2037	2150
20806042	All participants underwent ophthalmologic examinations, including visual acuity tests, slit-lamp, corneal diameter and axial length measurements, and fundus examination of the dilated pupil.	2151	2341
20806042	Informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from all individuals.	2342	2440
20806042	Ethical approval for this study was received from the Heilongjiang Institutional Review Board.	2441	2535
20806042	Five milliliter peripheral blood from seven members (three affected and four non-carrier relatives) of the family and controls was collected and preserved at −20 °C in EDTA.	2536	2709
20806042	Genomic DNA was extracted by QIAamp DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen Science, Germantown, MD).	2710	2793
20806042	All exons of candidate genes related to CCMC were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using the primers listed in Table 1.	2794	2932
20806042	The PCR reaction mixture (50 µl) contained 2 µl 10× PCR Buffer, 10 pmol primer pairs, 200 µmol/l dNTP mix, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, and 80 ng genomic DNA.	2933	3088
20806042	PCR cycling conditions were as follows: pre-degeneration at 95 °C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of denaturation, annealing and extension, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min, and a last hold at 4 °C.	3089	3297
20806042	The PCR products were subsequently purified using a TIANgel Midi Purification Kit (Tiangen Biltech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China), and then sequenced with an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).	3298	3517
20806042	Sequencing results were analyzed using Chromas 2.22 software (Technelysium Pty.	3518	3597
20806042	Ltd., QLD, Australia) with reference sequences in the NCBI Gene Bank.	3598	3667
20806042	The PolyPhen program was used in the bioinformatics study to predict the possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of human proteins.	3668	3835
20806042	The prediction was based on the caculation of position-specific independent counts (PSIC) score deduced from multiple sequence alignments of observation.	3836	3989
20806042	PSIC scores of ≤0.5 represented that the polymorphism was benign to protein function; scores of 0.5–2.0 were possibly damaging; scores of 2.0 were propably damaging.	3990	4155
20806042	The secondary structures and hydrophobic properties of mutant and wild-type amino acid sequences were analyzed by Jpred 3 software and Misc Protein Analysis software, respectively.	4156	4336
20806042	There were five affected individuals in this Chinese family, and three of them (II:6, III:3, and III:5) participated in this study (Figure 1).	4337	4479
20806042	At the time of this study, all patients had undergone cataract extraction surgeries.	4480	4564
20806042	Therefore, the clinical findings (summarized in Table 2) were obtained from the medical records.	4565	4661
20806042	The proband (III:3), a 24-year-old man, was diagnosed with bilateral CCMC at five years of age.	4662	4757
20806042	The horizontal diameters of his corneas were less than 10 mm.	4758	4819
20806042	The axial length of his eyes was 25.2 mm oculus dexter (OD) and 24.8 mm oculus sinister (OS), respectively.	4820	4927
20806042	His mother and sister also showed similar clinical symptoms.	4928	4988
20806042	Apart from congenital cataract and microcornea, no other eye abnormalities such as microphthalmia, iris coloboma or nystagmus were detected in any of these patients.	4989	5154
20806042	In all affected individuals, bidirectional sequencing of the coding regions of the candidate genes revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, C→T, at nucleotide 592 in exon 2 of GJA8 (Figure 2A).	5155	5350
20806042	This mutation resulted in the replacement of a highly conserved arginine by tryptophan (Figure 2C).	5351	5450
20806042	This change co-segregated with the affected members of the family, but was not detected in either non-carrier relatives or 100 normal controls (Figure 2B).	5451	5606
20806042	No other mutations were found except for the non-pathogenic SNPs.	5607	5672
20806042	After input the amino acid sequences of the wild-type GJA8 protein and the mutant, the PSIC score from Polyphen analysis was 3.149, which meant that the variant (p.R198W) was predicted as being “probably damaging” with high confidence.	5673	5908
20806042	In comparison with the wild-type GJA8 protein, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was dramatically increased (Figure 3).	5909	6027
20806042	The secondary structure prediction suggested that the mutation R198W led to a turn replaced by a helix.	6028	6131
20806042	(Figure 4).	6132	6143
20806042	We identified a novel missense mutation, p.R198W, in gap junction alpha-8 protein (GJA8) for a four-generation Chinese pedigree with autosomal dominant congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC).	6144	6344
20806042	According to Polyphen analysis, the R198W was predicted to probably damage the structure and function of the protein, which emphasized the functional importance of this site.	6345	6519
20806042	The replacement of a hydrophilic arginine by a hydrophobic tryptophan at position 198 might increase the hydrophobicity of the protein, which was propitious to the formation of the helix.	6520	6707
20806042	The secondary structure prediction showed that the mutation led to a turn replaced by a helix, which was in accordance with the hydrophobicity prediction.	6708	6862
20806042	This suggested that the mutation may cause to the conformation change of the mutant protein.	6863	6955
20806042	Mutations in GJA8 have been considered as cataractogenesis in humans.	6956	7025
20806042	To date, 16 mutations in this gene have been identified to contribute to assorted phenotypic cataracts, five of which were associated with CCMC phenotype (Table 3).	7026	7190
20806042	In addition to the novel R198W mutation, another mutation (p.R198Q) of the same codon has been reported in an Indian family with CCMC.	7191	7325
20806042	However, the affected amino acid was different.	7326	7373
20806042	In our family, the c.592C>T change resulted in a R198W mutation, while the c.593G>A change led to a R198Q mutation in the Indian family.	7374	7510
20806042	Our finding further expands the mutation spectrum of GJA8 in associated with congenital cataract and microcornea.	7511	7624
20806042	GJA8 (NM_005267) is located on chromosome 1q21.1 and encodes a 50 kDa protein (connexin 50; Cx50).	7625	7723
20806042	Cx50, consisting of 433 amino acids, is a member of the connexin family of proteins that are important to the formation of gap junction channels.	7724	7869
20806042	These channels are responsible for direct intercellular transfer of ions and molecules up to 1,000 Da between adjacent cells.	7870	7995
20806042	Since the eye lens is an avascular structure, it relies heavily on an intercellular communication system constructed of gap junctions for preservation of tissue homeostasis and transparency.	7996	8186
20806042	Like other connexins, Cx50 contains four transmembrane domains (M1, M2, M3, and M4) linked by two extracellular loops (E1 and E2), as well as an intracellular loop (CL), and intracytoplasmic NH2- and COOH-termini.	8187	8400
20806042	The extracellular loop of the connexin protein is a highly conserved and functionally important domain in gap junction channels by multiple-sequence analysis among different species (Figure 2C).	8401	8595
20806042	The p.R198W substitution observed in the present study is located within the E2 loop of Cx50 and it results in the replacement of a highly conserved basic arginine by a neutral tryptophan at position 198.	8596	8800
20806042	The extracellular loops have been proven to be important for the docking of the two hemichannels to form a gap junction unit.	8801	8926
20806042	Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the second extracellular domain is a determinant of compatibility between connexins.	8927	9054
20806042	Therefore, the mutant protein (p.R198W) may disrupt the intercellular communication mediated by gap junction channels and subseqently affect the transparency of the lens.	9055	9225
20806042	Cataractogenesis has been detected by targeted gene disruption in mice.	9226	9297
20806042	In contrast to the connexin 46 knockout mice exhibiting nuclear cataracts, the target disruption of connexin 50 mice developed microphthalmia with small lenses and nuclear cataracts.	9298	9480
20806042	While connexin 46 was expressed in place of connexin 50, the len was clear, but the size was subnormal.	9481	9584
20806042	It was concluded that GJA8 played an important role in lens and eye growth, as well as in the lens fiber cell differentiation and maturation.	9585	9726
20806042	In summary, the study provides the first report of a heterozygous c.592 C→T mutation of GJA8 in a Chinese pedigree with congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC).	9727	9895
20806042	This broadens the mutation spectrum of GJA8.	9896	9940
20806042	The results of this study may help to further clarify the pathogenesis of congenital cataract and microcornea.	9941	10051
21799811	Folic acid metabolism is important for stability and integrity of the genome due to its role in maintaining a balance between deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) for error free DNA synthesis, DNA methylation pattern and repair.	0	220
21799811	Therefore, deficiency in folate intake or polymorphism(s) in the enzymes of folate pathway may result in aberrant DNA synthesis and methylation.	221	365
21799811	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme of folate and methionine metabolism, making it crucial for DNA synthesis and methylation.	366	522
21799811	MTHFR reduces methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate which then donates methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine.	523	656
21799811	Methionine is ultimately converted to S-adenosyl methionine which acts as a ‘methyl’ donor for DNA methylation.	657	768
21799811	Also, methylenetetrahydrofolate participates in DNA synthesis by converting uracil to thymine.	769	863
21799811	MTHFR activity is higher in adult testis than other organs in mouse, indicating its critical role in spermatogenesis,–.	864	983
21799811	Recent research has identified epigenetic regulation of several genes playing important role in spermatogenesis and fertility.	984	1110
21799811	Therefore, aberrations in the MTHFR gene could compromise the process of spermatogenesis and predispose the carriers to infertility–.	1111	1244
21799811	Four SNPs (203G>A, 677C>T, 1286A>C and 1793G>A) in the MTHFR gene have been described to affect activity of this enzyme,.	1245	1366
21799811	Of these, 677C>T resulting in the replacement of alanine with valine (A222V, rs1801133), has been studied most often–,–.	1367	1487
21799811	This substitution results in reduced MTHFR specific activity and increased thermolability.	1488	1578
21799811	Homozygous 677TT variant has ∼30% of residual activity and heterozygous 677CT variant has ∼70% of residual activity when compared to 677CC variant,,,–.	1579	1730
21799811	This substitution also results in enhanced level of homocysteine and low plasma folate level,–.	1731	1826
21799811	The frequency of 677C>T polymorphism varies with geographical location and the association status with infertility may vary due to ethnic differences–, [ 9]–.	1827	1985
21799811	It has been suggested that low level of folate associated with MTHFR polymorphism could be the cause of infertility due to alteration in the synthesis of DNA and RNA molecules,.	1986	2163
21799811	Increase in sperm concentration upon folic acid and zinc sulfate supplementation further suggests the importance of this pathway in spermatogenesis.	2164	2312
21799811	This is also supported by induction of hypo-methylation by 5-aza deoxy cytidine, which inhibits the differentiation of spermatogonia into spermatocytes in murine model.	2313	2481
21799811	Most of the studies till date have analyzed this polymorphism in small sample size, giving way to over-estimation of association.	2482	2611
21799811	We have, therefore, analyzed 677C>T polymorphism in a large sample size (N = 837) to elucidate the correlation between this polymorphic variant and male infertility in Indian population.	2612	2798
21799811	We also performed a meta-analysis on all eligible published case-control studies, including our data, which established MTHFR 677C>T substitution to be a strong risk factor for male infertility.	2799	2993
21799811	Genotyping by direct sequencing on the DNA samples of all infertile and fertile controls individuals was undertaken.	2994	3110
21799811	Genotype data for control population fitted well in the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium equation [p (Exact test)  = 0.246620].	3111	3232
21799811	Distribution of mutant allele and genotypes was significantly different between infertile individuals and controls (Figure 1).	3233	3359
21799811	Mutant allele (T) was more frequent in infertile men (16.5%) in comparison to fertile controls (11.1%) (Table 1) and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0025) with an odds ratio of 1.58 (CI, 1.17–2.13) (Table 1).	3360	3588
21799811	The frequency of ‘T’ allele in each infertile sub-group was significantly higher in comparison to fertile controls (11.1%) and was almost double (19.3%) in oligoasthenoteratozoospermic (OAT) group, making the difference statistically significant (p = 0.01).	3589	3846
21799811	Comparison of allele frequency between cases and controls suggested strong association of mutant allele with infertility and with OAT (Table 1).	3847	3991
21799811	Similarly, the frequency of homozygous mutant genotype (TT) in infertile individuals was almost three times (5.4%) to that of controls (1.9%), and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.009 at 99% level of confidence).	3992	4223
21799811	The frequency of heterozygous genotype was also higher in infertile group (22.2%) in comparison to control samples (18.4%); however, the difference was not statistically significant (Table 1).	4224	4416
21799811	In sub-group analysis, homozygous mutant genotype showed strong association with asthenozoospermia (p = 0.02) and uncategorized infertile (p = 0.003) groups.	4417	4574
21799811	Overall, the presence of all mutant genotypes (CT+TT) was higher in infertile individuals in comparison to controls, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0187) (Table 1).	4575	4764
21799811	Twenty nine studies were retrieved by our literature search strategy.	4765	4834
21799811	Out of these, only 15 had analyzed 677C>T substitution in correlation with male infertility.	4835	4927
21799811	Two studies were excluded from the analysis as one did not provide detailed information required for meta-analysis and the other was not directly relating the genotypes with infertility.	4928	5114
21799811	Hence, only 13 studies qualifying our strict selection criteria were included in the analysis.	5115	5209
21799811	Along with the present study from India, this meta-analysis included data on 3094 cases and 2877 controls.	5210	5316
21799811	Allele and genotypes data for all these studies were tabulated (Table 2).	5317	5390
21799811	A true heterogeneity existed between studies for allele (Pheterogeneity = 0.00, Q = 39.66, df(Q)  = 13, I2 = 67.221, var = 0.001, τ2 = 0.050, SE = 0.031,τ = 0.224) and genotype (Pheterogeneity = 0.00, Q = 44.44, df(Q)  = 13, I2 = 70.75, var = 0.004, τ2 = 0.109, SE = 0.064, τ = 0.330) comparisons.	5391	5688
21799811	The ‘I2’ value of more than 50% for between studies comparison in both allele and genotype analysis shows high level of true heterogeneity.	5689	5828
21799811	In allele meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis performed by exclusion of the studies involving small sample size–, decreased heterogeneity (Pheterogeneity = 0.016, I2 = 54.07, Q = 21.77, df(Q) = 10, var = 0.000, τ2 = 0.025, SE = 0.021, τ = 0.158) to a small extent but exclusion of studies with very high p values,,– decreased heterogeneity to a large extent (Pheterogeneity = 0.136, I2 = 33.98, Q = 13.63, df(Q)  = 9, var = 0.000, τ2 = 0.012, SE = 0.016, τ = 0.108).	5829	6295
21799811	Here, τ2 defines between studies variance and is used to asses heterogeneity; however, this is not commonly used for this purpose as it depends on the particular effect metric used in the analysis.	6296	6493
21799811	Var denotes variance and SE denotes standard error for heterogeneity test.	6494	6568
21799811	Similarly, in genotype analysis exclusion of the studies with small sample size– decreased heterogeneity to a small extent (Pheterogeneity = 0.001, I2 = 68.07, Q = 31.32, df(Q) = 10, var = 0.003, τ2 = 0.082, SE = 0.056, τ = 0.287).	6569	6800
21799811	As a result of this exclusion, there was no significant difference in the results of fixed effect (OR = 1.361, p = 0.000) and random effect (OR = 1.363, p = 0.004) models.	6801	6972
21799811	After exclusion of studies with high p values,,,–, heterogeneity decreased to a lesser extent (Pheterogeneity = 0.002, I2 = 67.13, Q = 24.343, df(Q) = 8, var = 0.005, τ2 = 0.091, SE = 0.071, τ = 0.301) and the results in random effect model (OR = 1.571, p = 0.000) were almost identical to that of fixed effect model (OR = 1.528, p = 0.000).	6973	7314
21799811	Sensitivity analysis thus showed that differences in the outcome between the two models (fixed and random effect) could be attributed to a few studies with very small sample size or very high p values.	7315	7516
21799811	Under the conditions of heterogeneity, random-effects model is more appropriate.	7517	7597
21799811	However, since there was no change in the inference adopting either model, we present results of both the models.	7598	7711
21799811	There is no difference in the overall inference except in genotype sub-group analysis for oligozoospermic cases, where we use fixed effect model for drawing inference since random effect model gives more weight to studies with smaller sample size.	7712	7959
21799811	Mutant allele showed significant association with infertility in both fixed effect (p = 0.000, OR = 1.304, 95% CI = 1.202-1.414) and random effect (p = 0.000, OR = 1.310, 95% CI = 1.129-1.520) models (Figure 2a).	7960	8172
21799811	In cumulative analysis using fixed and random effect models, the association of mutant ‘T’ allele with infertility turned statistically significant with the addition of study of Park et al (2005) and A et al (2007), respectively, and stayed significant thereafter (Figure 2b and c).	8173	8455
21799811	Sub-group analyses were done for azoospermia, oligozoospermia and OAT groups.	8456	8533
21799811	Few of the previous studies did not categorize infertile subjects into sub-groups; therefore, such studies had to be excluded from sub-group analysis.	8534	8684
21799811	Significant association of mutant allele with azoospermia was observed using both fixed (p = 0.000, OR = 1.522, 95% CI = 1.32-1.175) and random (p = 0.000, OR = 1.531, 95%CI = 1.25-1.87) effect models (Figure 3a).	8685	8898
21799811	Similarly, mutant allele showed positive correlation with oligozoospermia adopting both fixed (p = 0.000, OR = 1.426, 95% CI = 1.178-1.726) and random (p = 0.025, OR = 1.498, 95% CI = 1.052-2.134) effect models (Figure 3b).	8899	9122
21799811	However, mutant allele did not show association with OAT using either model (p = 0.056) (Figure 3c).	9123	9223
21799811	Similar to allele meta-analysis, pooled odds ratio for mutant genotypes (CT+TT) showed statistically significant association with infertility adopting both fixed (p = 0.000, OR = 1.310, 95% CI = 1.173-1.462) and random (p = 0.018, OR = 1.290, 95% CI = 1.044-1.595) effect models (Figure 4a).	9224	9515
21799811	The fixed effect model cumulative analysis showed that addition of the study of Paracchini et al (2006) turned the overall association significant (p = 0.023) (Figure 4b).	9516	9687
21799811	With introduction of another two studies, p value became highly significant (p = 0.00, significant at 99% level of confidence) and stayed significant thereafter (Figure 4b).	9688	9861
21799811	However, with random effect model, the overall association turned significant only after inclusion of the study of Gava et al, 2011 (p = 0.041) and further introduction of our study supported the inference (p = 0.018) (Figure 4c).	9862	10092
21799811	Sub-group analysis showed significant association of mutant genotypes with azoospermia using both fixed and random effect models (p = 0.000, OR = 1.648, 95% CI = 1.360-1.996) (Figure 5a).	10093	10280
21799811	Mutant genotypes also associated with oligozoospermia using fixed (p = 0.000) but not random (p = 0.054) effect models (Figure 5b).	10281	10412
21799811	However, mutant genotypes did not associate with OAT in any case (fixed model, p = 0.455, random model, p = 0.557) (Figure 5c).	10413	10540
21799811	We generated funnel plots using standard error and precision values for allele (Figure 6a–h) and genotypes (Figure 7a–h) using both fixed and random effect models.	10541	10704
21799811	Apart from observed sets of studies, the plots were also drawn after imputation.	10705	10785
21799811	Symmetrical distribution of studies in the funnel plots suggests absence of publication bias.	10786	10879
21799811	This is also supported by other tests described below.	10880	10934
21799811	In allele analysis, classic fail-safe ‘N’ value of 130 (p = 0.000, Z = 6.28) suggests that 130 null studies would have to be included to nullify the effect or convert the combined ‘p’ to a non-significant (>0.050) value.	10935	11155
21799811	Orwin's fail-safe ‘N’ to bring observed odds ratio of 1.30 to 1.1 is 25, indicating that at least 25 null studies would be required to bring the effect size to null.	11156	11321
21799811	Begg and Mazumdar Rank correlation test also showed no evidence of publication bias.	11322	11406
21799811	Egger's intercept (B0) was 0.422 with t value of 0.253 (one tailed p value = 0.40, two tailed p value = 0.81), further suggesting no publication bias.	11407	11557
21799811	No change in overall summary estimate (odds ratio) after ‘trim and fill’ procedure suggests absence of publication bias (Figure 6 b,d,f,h).	11558	11697
21799811	Similarly, in genotype analysis, no evidence of publication bias was seen.	11698	11772
21799811	Classic fail safe ‘N’ was 60 (p = 0.00001, z = 4.51), indicating that additional 60 null studies would be required to bring the p value in non-significant range.	11773	11934
21799811	In the same way, Orwin's fail safe ‘N’ to bring observed odds ratio of 1.31 to 1.1 was 26, indicating that additional 26 null studies would be required to bring effect size to null.	11935	12116
21799811	Similar to the allele analysis, Begg and Mazumdar Rank correlation test showed no evidence of publication bias.	12117	12228
21799811	Egger's intercept (B0) was -0.49 with t value of 0.25 (one tailed p = 0.40, two tailed p = 0.80), suggesting no publication bias.	12229	12358
21799811	No changes in the pooled odds ratio after ‘trim and fill’ procedure (Figure 7 b,d,f,h), confirmed absence of publication bias.	12359	12485
21799811	Symmetry of the funnel plots and all statistical tests described above showed no trace of publication bias.	12486	12593
21799811	Therefore, we are confident that there is no over-estimate of the infertility risk associated with this SNP.	12594	12702
21799811	Mutant allele and genotypes at 677C>T were strongly associated with male infertility in our population.	12703	12806
21799811	This was also supported by meta-analysis on previously published studies including our results.	12807	12902
21799811	The findings of our study become particularly interesting since two previous studies on Indian populations had reported contrasting observations to each other,.	12903	13063
21799811	Singh et al (2005) showed significant association of mutant genotypes with infertility while Dhillon et al (2007) showed no statistically significant difference of 677C>T variants between infertile and fertile males.	13064	13280
21799811	Dhillon et al, tried to explain the variation in results on the basis that their study included majority of OAT patients in comparison to the majority of azoospermic cases in the study by Singh et al.	13281	13481
21799811	In the present study, we included both azoospermic and OAT individuals, and had contrasting observations.	13482	13587
21799811	Our analysis has shown significant association of mutant allele and genotypes with infertility and with OAT in sub-group analysis.	13588	13718
21799811	Presence of mutant genotypes did not associate with azoospermia in our samples.	13719	13798
21799811	To the best of our knowledge, the three Indian populations studied so far are not ethnically different.	13799	13902
21799811	The differences in the results could therefore be attributed to other factors such as variations in recruitment of subjects.	13903	14027
21799811	677C>T substitution has been studied in different populations for its possible association with male infertility–, [ 9]–.	14028	14149
21799811	Bezold et al (2001) showed for the first time association of homozygous mutant genotype with male infertility.	14150	14260
21799811	Several studies later on showed significant association of homozygous mutant genotype with infertility in different populations–, [ 11]–, [ 15]–.	14261	14406
21799811	Two studies conducted on Korean population, showed significant increase of homozygous mutant genotype in infertile males than fertile controls.	14407	14550
21799811	Park et al showed that OAT and non obstructive azoospermic patients in unexplained infertile group had higher frequency of homozygous mutant genotype in comparison to explained infertile males.	14551	14744
21799811	Similarly, a study on Turkish population also inferred homozygous mutant genotype to be a risk factor for infertility characterized by oligozoospermia and non-obstructive azoospermia.	14745	14928
21799811	Other studies provided evidence for association of this polymorphism with male infertility in the Chinese and Brazilian populations.	14929	15061
21799811	In contrast to the above, a study on Dutch population revealed that mutant genotype was not a risk factor for male infertility.	15062	15189
21799811	Two studies on Italian populations reported contrasting observations,, one showing no significant association of heterozygous or homozygous mutant genotypes with male sub-fertility and the second reporting increased risk of infertility in individuals with homozygous mutant genotype in comparison to heterozygous and wild type genotypes.	15190	15527
21799811	Similarly, in a French population, no statistically significant correlation of mutant genotype with male sub-fertility was observed.	15528	15660
21799811	We found true heterogeneity between studies in both allele and genotype meta-analysis, which is also evident from slight variations in the results of fixed and random effect models.	15661	15842
21799811	The presence of heterogeneity would force us to use random effect model for further analysis.	15843	15936
21799811	However, after doing sensitivity analysis we chose to use fixed effect model on the basis that there were few small studies affecting the results of meta-analysis.	15937	16100
21799811	Since there was no significant difference in the results using either model, we present results of both; however, the inference is based on fixed effect model.	16101	16260
21799811	Meta-analysis showed significant association of mutant allele and mutant genotypes (CT+TT) with infertility.	16261	16369
21799811	Introduction of the studies of Park et al, 2005 and Paracchini et al, 2006 in the allele and genotype cumulative analysis, respectively, provided enough data to conclude that the mutant allele and genotypes are risk factors for infertility.	16370	16610
21799811	Addition of more studies later on strengthened the conclusion and now this substitution has been established as a risk factor.	16611	16737
21799811	The strength of our conclusion is also indicated by a very narrow confidence interval for odds ratio.	16738	16839
21799811	Subgroup analysis has shown significant association of mutant allele and genotypes (CT+TT) with infertility characterized by azoospermia and oligozoospermia but not OAT.	16840	17009
21799811	Analysis according to geographical distribution of populations could not be undertaken due to relatively lesser number of studies.	17010	17140
21799811	An earlier meta-analysis on this SNP included eight studies and reported a highly significant association between mutant genotypes and infertility (p = 0.002; OR- 1.23; 95% CI- 1.08-1.41).	17141	17329
21799811	A recent meta-analysis on this polymorphism included 10 studies and concluded no overall association between this polymorphism and male infertility.	17330	17478
21799811	Several observations in the latter study, such as association of this mutation with azoospermia and no association with OAT, are similar to us.	17479	17622
21799811	However, overall inference in Wu et al., differs from ours as well as from Tuttlemann et al..	17623	17716
21799811	Cumulative analysis in our study clearly states less likelihood of finding no overall association as reported by Wu et al.	17717	17839
21799811	However, inclusion in our meta-analysis of few recent studies and data from our case-control study could be responsible for differences in the overall inference.	17840	18001
21799811	It is apparent from our analysis that 677C>T substitution associates strongly with infertility in Indian population and meta-analysis establishes it as a risk factor for male infertility.	18002	18189
21799811	High fail safe ‘N’ and symmetrical distribution of studies in funnel plots ascertains absence of publication bias, further strengthening our conclusion.	18190	18342
21799811	The penetration of this SNP could be affected by dietary folate intake and geographical factors such that overall phenotype is an outcome of interaction between these factors.	18343	18518
21799811	Low dietary intake of folic acid could cause several health problems including but not limited to neural tube defects in developing embryos, homocysteine accumulation, and impaired DNA synthesis and repair.	18519	18725
21799811	Low folate level in the Indian and African populations in comparison to the Western and European populations, makes them more susceptible to infertility and other health problems listed above.	18726	18918
21799811	Inadequate folic acid intake and prevalence of vegetarian diet in India, in coupling with more than 10% overall frequency of this polymorphism, could justify folic acid supplementation for both men and women.	18919	19127
21799811	Though exact mechanism by which 677C>T substitution affects fertility is not yet clear, some possible mechanisms have been put forward.	19128	19263
21799811	Induction of hypo-methylation by 5-aza deoxy cytidine inhibited the differentiation of spermatogonia into spermatocytes in murine model, which could explain the association between this SNP and infertility.	19264	19470
21799811	Since several genes participating in spermatogenesis are regulated by DNA methylation, individuals with 677T allele are associated with decreased global genomic methylation.	19471	19644
21799811	Further, low levels of folate may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, resulting in oxidative stress.	19645	19739
21799811	Oxidative stress is well known to cause damage to sperm plasma membrane, and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.	19740	19847
21799811	Hyperhomocysteinemia leads to precocious atherosclerosis which results in lower blood flow in testicular arteries, resulting in alteration in spermatogenesis.	19848	20006
21799811	All the above taken into account partially explains the association between this polymorphism and male infertility.	20007	20122
21799811	In nutshell, it appears, we have now enough data to conclude that 677 C>T is a risk factor for infertility in general and azoospermia in particular.	20123	20271
21799811	The study was approved by the Institutional Human Ethics Committee of the Ajanta Hospitals and IVF Centre, Lucknow.	20272	20387
21799811	Before enrolment in the study, each subject's informed written consent was obtained in response to a fully written and verbal explanation of the nature of study.	20388	20549
21799811	In the case-control study, a total of 837 individuals from north India including 522 infertile and 315 fertile controls of Indo-Aryan ethnicity were recruited.	20550	20709
21799811	The patients and controls were recruited at the Ajanta Hospitals and IVF Centre Pvt.	20710	20794
21799811	Ltd. 765, ABC complex, Alambagh, Lucknow.	20795	20836
21799811	The inclusion criteria of the cases included infertility persisting longer than one year and absence of any obvious fertility problem in the partner.	20837	20986
21799811	Clinical observations on the female partners including menstruation and ovulation ruled out any problem on female side.	20987	21106
21799811	Patients having infection of accessory glands, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, and those on drugs known to influence fertility were excluded.	21107	21295
21799811	The patients were further categorized in sub-groups as per WHO 1999 criteria.	21296	21373
21799811	Normozoospermic infertile men (N = 141) had normal semen profile (defined as in the control group except fertility) and infertility of unknown etiology.	21374	21526
21799811	Asthenozoospermic infertile men (N = 135) had a sperm count >20×106/mL, motility <50%, and > = 30% normal morphology; OAT (N = 65) had a sperm count <20×106/mL, motility <50% and <30% normal morphology; non-obstructive azoospermic infertile men (N = 68) with no sperm in the ejaculate and 113 infertile patients who were not categorized due to lack of one or the other semen parameter.	21527	21912
21799811	The controls were recruited following the criteria of normal semen profile (WHO 1999) with confirmed paternity.	21913	22024
21799811	Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of patient and control samples using phenol-chloroform-isoamyl method.	22025	22147
21799811	The point mutation (677C>T) in the MTHFR gene was typed using direct DNA sequencing technique.	22148	22242
21799811	Briefly, primers around the polymorphic site were designed with the help of GENETOOL software.	22243	22337
21799811	PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 10 µl each in thin walled tubes consisting of 1.0 µl of PCR buffer (10X), 1.0 µl of MgCl2 (25 mM), 1.0 µl of dNTPs (10 mM), 2.0 pM of each of the forward (5′ CATCCCTATTGGCAGGTTACCC 3′) and reverse (5′ GGGAAGAACTCAGCGAACTCAG 3′) primers, 1.0 unit of Taq DNA polymerase enzyme (Applied Biosystems) and 40 ng of genomic DNA.	22338	22709
21799811	PCR cycling was carried out in ABI Veriti thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA).	22710	22793
21799811	PCR amplification conditions included denaturation at 95 °C for 10 minutes followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 seconds, annealing at 63°C for 30 seconds and polymerization at 72°C for 40 sec, and a final stage of polymerization at 72°C for 7 minutes.	22794	23062
21799811	The amplified products were directly sequenced using BigDye™ chain termination chemistry on ABI 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA).	23063	23203
21799811	Multiple alignment and sequence analysis was done using Auto Assembler Software (Applied Biosystems, USA).	23204	23310
21799811	Genotype data for control population was analyzed for fitness in the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium.	23311	23407
21799811	For this purpose, data was analyzed using calculator available at http://ihg.gsf.de/cgi-bin/hw/hwa1.pl.	23408	23511
21799811	Chi square analysis was used to compare the allele and genotype data between cases and controls.	23512	23608
21799811	In addition to the comparison of all the patients with the controls, each sub-group of infertile individuals was compared with controls.	23609	23745
21799811	Data was analyzed using the Vassar Stats Online Calculator (http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html).	23746	23856
21799811	P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.	23857	23930
21799811	677C>T has been explored in several studies in different ethnic groups, making it important to conduct meta-analysis.	23931	24048
21799811	We had used Comprehensive Meta-analysis Version 2 software for this purpose.	24049	24125
21799811	A systematic search was done on published literature using the keywords ‘MTHFR and male infertility’, ‘folate metabolism and male infertility’, ‘MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and male infertility’ through ‘Pubmed’ ‘Ovid’ and ‘Google Scholar’ up to march 2011.	24126	24381
21799811	Detailed information for each study on 677C>T polymorphism in male infertility such as the purpose and design of the study, presentation of the data, genotyping method used, inclusion and exclusion criteria of the cases and controls was collected.	24382	24629
21799811	Detailed information, wherever not available, was collected by contacting authors.	24630	24712
21799811	The following inclusion criteria were set for the meta-analysis: (i) each trial is an independent case-control study; (ii) the purpose of all the studies and statistical methods is similar; (iii) it supplied enough information to calculate the odds ratio; (iv) SNP typing was done at high resolution level and (v) inclusion of the patients was done according to the standard diagnosis parameter.	24713	25108
21799811	The exclusion criteria included: i) study not providing enough information (incomplete raw data) and ii) not well-described.	25109	25233
21799811	Genotype data for MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism related to male infertility was gathered.	25234	25319
21799811	Information regarding the first author, year of publication, ethnicity of study population, number of cases and controls and allele and genotype frequency was collected.	25320	25489
21799811	Chi-square analysis was performed and the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated using Vassar Stats online statistical calculators (http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html) for all the possible genotypes.	25490	25719
21799811	Association analysis was undertaken to compare the frequency of mutant allele and mutant genotypes between cases and controls.	25720	25846
21799811	For meta-analysis, major consideration is the type of ‘effect size’ chosen for statistical analysis.	25847	25947
21799811	In the present study, computed effect size in the form of ‘odds ratio’ and ‘confidence interval’ was chosen.	25948	26056
21799811	A Chi square based ‘Q’ test defined by Cochran was used to assess the heterogeneity (between study variability) in the meta-analysis.	26057	26190
21799811	A significance level of P<0.10 instead of traditional P<0.05 was used because of its low power and to avoid type II errors for statistical test of heterogeneity.	26191	26352
21799811	Since the ‘Q’ statistics is only useful for testing the existence of heterogeneity qualitatively but not quantitatively, another index ‘I2’, calculated as the percentage of the total variability in a set of effect sizes due to true heterogeneity, was used to quantify the degree of heterogeneity.	26353	26649
21799811	A tentative classification of ‘I2’ values proposed by Higgins and Thompson has been used to interpret the magnitude; viz.	26650	26771
21799811	25%, 50% and 75% which corresponds to low, medium and high heterogeneity, respectively.	26772	26859
21799811	In the absence of significant heterogeneity determined by the results of Q test, the Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model (Peto method) was used for the combination of data, while in the presence of significant heterogeneity, the Dersimonian Laird random effect model (DL method) was used for combining the data-.	26860	27171
21799811	Sensitivity analysis was also done to validate the assumptions and decisions made, and for the robustness of the method used in the analysis.	27172	27313
21799811	A comparison of results based on fixed and random effects models before and after exclusion of outlier studies or studies involving small sample size was used as a method for sensitivity analysis.	27314	27510
21799811	High resolution plots (forest plots) were generated to estimate the pooled odds ratio corresponding to 95% confidence interval and the p value.	27511	27654
21799811	Both fixed effect and random effect models were used to analyze the data.	27655	27728
21799811	Cumulative meta-analysis was also done to observe the effect of subsequent addition of each study.	27729	27827
21799811	Subgroup analysis according to infertility phenotype (azoospermia, oligozoospermia and OAT) was also carried out to estimate the specific odds ratio for a particular sub-group.	27828	28004
21799811	Publication bias was investigated by using the funnel plots; viz.	28005	28070
21799811	funnel plot of standard error by log odds ratio and funnel plot of precision by log odds ratio.	28071	28166
21799811	Different statistical tests such as Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation, Egger's regression intercept, Duvall and Tweedie's trim and fill procedure and Fail-safe ‘N’ were adopted to assess and quantify the publication bias and its impact on the analysis.	28167	28420
21799811	The classic fail-Safe N and the Orwin fail-safe ‘N’ assess if the entire observed effect is an artifact of bias.	28421	28533
21799811	Rank correlation and regression procedures are used for testing the presence of bias.	28534	28619
21799811	Duvall and Tweedie's trim and fill procedure tests how the effect size will shift, if the apparent bias were to be removed.	28620	28743
21810259	The risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients is significantly greater than that in the general population.	0	161
21810259	Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) appears to suppress viral replication, there is a high level of microglial activation in the central nervous system (CNS) of the post HAART-treated patients, indicating that eliminating virus may not stop the process of HIV-induced ongoing inflammation in the brain.	162	482
21810259	It has long been known that virus infected monocytes are able to invade the brain and induce a local inflammatory chain reaction that involves the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines by infected and non-infected macrophages and microglia.	483	736
21810259	In addition, infected cells can shed viral proteins such as gp120 and Tat which can activate glial cells by themselves and therefore contribute to the propagation of inflammation.	737	916
21810259	Although the production of inflammatory mediators by glial cells exposed to HIV-1 proteins has been mainly studied in the context of AIDS-related dementia, there is still limited evidence that HIV-1 proteins administered into the brain can induce depressive-like behavior in preclinical models with laboratory rodents.	917	1235
21810259	Rats injected with gp120 into the lateral ventricle of the brain present with signs of sickness associated with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines.	1236	1398
21810259	Some of these behavioral alterations, such as the decreased preference for a saccharin solution, mimic the anhedonia observed in depressed patients.	1399	1547
21810259	Intracerebral administration of HIV-1 Tat to mice induces depressive-like behavior in mice as measured by increased immobility in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, together with increased expression of brain proinflammatory cytokines.	1548	1791
21810259	We have already established that development of inflammation-associated depression is dependent on activation of the tryptophan degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) by proinflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ and TNFα.	1792	2022
21810259	IDO degrades tryptophan (Trp) into kynurenine (KYN) which can be further metabolized into neurotoxic metabolites such as 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid (QUIN).	2023	2191
21810259	In addition to developing depressive-like behaviors, Tat-treated mice also display increased IDO expression in their brains.	2192	2316
21810259	The occurrence of neuropsychiatric disorders in HIV-1 seropositive patients presenting with symptoms of neuro-AIDS is associated with activation of IDO in peripheral macrophages, as evidenced by decreased levels of circulating Trp and increased plasma levels of both KYN and the macrophage activation marker neopterin.	2317	2635
21810259	Confirmation that IDO activation also takes place in the brain of HIV-infected patients has been obtained since IDO enzymatic activity is increased in the brain of HIV-infected patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD).	2636	2857
21810259	IDO expression is up-regulated in monocytic cells in brain tissue of both patients with HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE) and monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (SIVE).	2858	3048
21810259	Furthermore increases in brain QUIN are associated with progression of HIV infection.	3049	3134
21810259	Brain expression of IDO during HIV infection certainly contributes to immunotolerance since administration of the IDO competitive inhibitor 1-methyl tryptophan enhances elimination of virus-infected macrophages in mice with HIVE.	3135	3364
21810259	There is evidence that HIV-1 Tat can induce IDO expression in various cell types.	3365	3446
21810259	This is particularly the case in macrophages but also in astrocytes exposed to HIV-1 clade B Tat.	3447	3544
21810259	We have demonstrated that organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) offer a reliable model for investigating neuroimmune interactions and for studying the mechanisms of IDO activation.	3545	3734
21810259	Here we have used this model to assess whether Tat alone or in conjunction with IFNγ can induce IDO expression.	3735	3846
21810259	We chose IFNγ since this cytokine is traditionally regarded as the primary inducer of IDO.	3847	3937
21810259	IFNγ is elevated in the brains of patients with HIVE and has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of HAD.	3938	4062
21810259	IFNγ synergizes with Tat to enhance chemokine expression, which in turn can amplify the inflammatory responses within the CNS of patients with AIDS-related neurological disorders.	4063	4242
21810259	However, IFNγ-independent activation pathway has also been reported in response to LPS in primary microglia and murine slices.	4243	4369
21810259	Additionally, the IFNγ-independent up-regulation of IDO expression was recently demonstrated in HIV-infected human macrophages.	4370	4497
21810259	It is unknown whether this property of IDO induction extends to OHSCs exposed to HIV proteins such as Tat.	4498	4604
21810259	Furthermore, the precise mechanisms responsible for IFNγ-independent induction of IDO following exposure to Tat are not clearly understood.	4605	4744
21810259	Activation of IDO is not the sole mechanism that could be responsible for inflammation-associated depression.	4745	4854
21810259	By reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) with high affinity in presynaptic neurons, the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SERT) contributes to the regulation of 5-HT neurotransmission.	4855	5036
21810259	Several cytokines, including IFNα, IFNγ, IL-1β and TNFα, are able to increase expression of SERT.	5037	5134
21810259	Additionally, a recent study reported that HIV-1 clade B and C Tat differentially induce SERT expression in dendritic cells.	5135	5259
21810259	For this reason, we included SERT in the possible targets of HIV-1 Tat in the in vitro model of OHSCs.	5260	5362
21810259	HIV-1 Tat mediates its biological functions by activating a variety of signaling pathways and transcription factors.	5363	5479
21810259	The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is activated by Tat in a variety of cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, astrocytes and the THP-1 cell line.	5480	5645
21810259	Since p38 MAPK is required for IDO expression in THP-1 cells, we investigated whether this signaling pathway also mediates Tat-induced expression of IDO in OHSCs.	5646	5808
21810259	In the present study, we show that Tat induces the expression of IDO and synergizes with exogenous IFNγ to increase IDO induction in OHSCs and the effect of Tat is mediated by p38 MAPK activation.	5809	6005

21810259	The guide cannulas were kept clean and covered using a screw on cannula dummy for mice (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA).	8620	8735
21810259	Coordinates for placement of the guide cannula were 1.5 mm lateral, 0.6 mm posterior, and 1.3 mm dorsal with respect to bregma.	8736	8863
21810259	These coordinates placed the guide cannula 1 mm dorsal to the lateral ventricle.	8864	8944
21810259	Mice were allowed to recover 2 weeks before treatment and initiation of behavioral tests.	8945	9034
21810259	After recovery, mice were slowly injected over 1 min i.c.v. with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Tat (40 ng) in a volume of 1 μl.	9035	9167
21810259	This dose of Tat was selected on its ability to reliably induce IDO expression in human astrocytes.	9168	9267

21810259	Briefly, 6- to 8-day-old C57BL/6J mice were decapitated.	9654	9710
21810259	The brains and meninges were removed, followed by separation of the hippocampus from both hemispheres.	9711	9813
21810259	Hippocampi were dissected and transverse slices (350 μm in thickness) were prepared using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Campden Instruments Ltd, UK).	9814	9960

21810259	Inserts were then placed into six-well culture plates.	10181	10235
21810259	Each well contained 1.2 ml of nutrient medium composed of 25% heat-inactivated horse serum, 25% HBSS and 50% MEM supplemented with 25 mM D-glucose.	10236	10383
21810259	Neither antibiotics nor anti-mycotics were used.	10384	10432
21810259	Plates were maintained in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% atmospheric air) at 37°C.	10433	10524
21810259	Medium was changed every 2-3 days.	10525	10559
21810259	The MEM medium was changed so that it contained only 5% horse serum and 25 mM D-glucose on the day that Tat or control medium was added.	10560	10696
21810259	At various times following addition of Tat, supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C for measurement of cytokines.	10697	10818

21810259	Total cellular RNA from the hippocampus and cultured slices was extracted in TRIzol reagent, as previously described.	11140	11257
21810259	Total mRNA (1-2 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit from Ambion.	11258	11377
21810259	Samples were analyzed in duplicate.	11378	11413
21810259	Data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle method, as described elsewhere (Applied Biosystems user bulletin no.2).	11414	11542
21810259	TNFα and IL-6 were measured in OHSCs supernatants with validated specific ELISA assays.	11543	11630
21810259	Briefly, 100 μl of each sample were added in duplicate to ELISA plates pre-coated with an anti-TNFα or IL-6 capture antibody.	11631	11756

21810259	Western blotting experiments were conducted as previously described, with minor modifications.	12009	12103
21810259	Briefly, slices were lysed in cold lysis buffer.	12104	12152
21810259	Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels.	12153	12228
21810259	Proteins were then transferred from the gel to PVDF membranes using a Bio-Rad Laboratories Mini Protein 3 system.	12229	12342
21810259	After treating PVDF membranes with blocking buffer (TBS/0.1% Tween20 (TBST) containing 2% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, they were incubated overnight at 4 C with blocking buffer containing primary antibodies specific for phosphorylated p38 or p38, (1:1000 dilution).	12343	12613
21810259	Membranes were washed extensively with TBST and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer.	12614	12857
21810259	Finally, membranes were washed extensively with TBST and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Western Blot Detection Reagent.	12858	12995
21810259	Blots were covered with transparency film and then inserted into a Fujifilm LAS-4000 System Configured for multifunctional analysis (Fujifilm, Life Science, Stamford, USA).	12996	13168
21810259	Densitometric analysis of autoradiograms was performed using publically available IMAGE-J software from the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD).	13169	13322
21810259	Densitometric summaries were expressed as ratios of phosphorylated p38 to total p38.	13323	13407
21810259	Data were analyzed using a one-way (treatment) or two-way (pretreatment × treatment) ANOVA, followed by a post hoc pairwise multiple comparison using Fischer's LSD test if the interaction was significant.	13408	13612
21810259	All data are presented as means ± SEM.	13613	13651
21810259	Differences were considered significant if the probability reached a level of 0.05 or less.	13652	13743
21810259	Mice were treated with i.c.v. PBS or Tat (40ng).	13744	13792
21810259	At 24 h post Tat, sickness and depressive-like behavior were assessed by body weight loss and FST, respectively.	13793	13905
21810259	Consistent with our previous findings, the 24 h changes in body weight did not differ according to treatment (Figure 1A, p >0.05).	13906	14036
21810259	Tat-treated mice displayed increased immobility in the FST at 24 h post-treatment compared to control mice (Figure 1B, p < 0.05).	14037	14166
21810259	We recently found that central injection of HIV-1 Tat (40 ng) increased brain IDO and cytokine steady-state transcripts at 4 h. Here we determined whether the expression of IDO and cytokines response to Tat occurs in murine OHSCs as it does in the CNS in vivo. Based on the in vivo response to central injection of Tat, the time point of 6 h was selected for carrying out dose-response experiments to determine the effect of Tat on cytokine and IDO expression.	14167	14627
21810259	Slices were exposed to 4, 40 and 400 ng/slice of Tat on day 10 in culture.	14628	14702
21810259	As shown in Figure 2, Tat significantly increased TNFα, IL-6 and iNOS at the mRNA level (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum at 400 ng/slice.	14703	14861
21810259	Tat-induced increases in TNFα and IL-6 mRNA expression were paralleled by a concomitant increase in protein production (Figure 2, p < 0.05).	14862	15002
21810259	Increased iNOS mRNA was not associated with any detectable increase in nitrite levels at the 6 h time point (data not shown).	15003	15128
21810259	Induction of SERT mRNA reached a maximum at 4 ng/slice (Figure 2, p < 0.05).	15129	15205
21810259	For kinetic studies, OHSCs were exposed to 40 ng/slice Tat for 2, 6 and 12 h on day 10 of culture.	15206	15304
21810259	As shown in Figure 3, the greatest expression of both mRNA and protein for TNFα occurred at 2 h (p < 0.05) and 6 h (p < 0.05), respectively.	15305	15445
21810259	IL-6 mRNA peaked at 6 h (p < 0.05) and gradually decreased at 12 h. IL-6 concentration in the culture medium increased after 6 h (p < 0.05) and reached a maximum at 12 h (p < 0.05).	15446	15627
21810259	iNOS and SERT mRNA increased at 6 h (p < 0.05) and peaked at 12 h (p < 0.05), but there was no concomitant increase in nitrite levels at any time point (data not shown).	15628	15797
21810259	We also used real-time RT-PCR to determine whether Tat induces IDO steady-state transcripts in OHSCs as it does in vivo. To determine an optimal dose for Tat-induced expression of IDO, OHSCs were treated with 4, 40 and 400 ng/slice of Tat for 6 h. As shown in Figure 4A, IDO mRNA expression could be detected at 4 ng/slice Tat and peaked at 40 ng/slice Tat (p < 0.05).	15798	16166
21810259	Kinetic studies were then carried out in which OHSCs were exposed to Tat (40 ng/slice) for 2, 6 and 12 h. As shown in Figure 4B, IDO mRNA could not be detected in OHSCs prior to addition of Tat (40 amplification cycles).	16167	16387
21810259	However, IDO expression was significantly induced by Tat at 6 h (p < 0.05) with no further increase at 12 h. This effect was similar in intensity to that of exogenous IFNγ (10 ng/ml, Figure 4C, p < 0.05).	16388	16592
21810259	Moreover, pretreatment of OHSCs with the same dose of IFNγ 24 h before Tat markedly amplified IDO responses to Tat (Figure 4C, p < 0.01).	16593	16730
21810259	However, the Tat-induced expression of IDO did not require endogenous synthesis of IFNγ because no IFNγ mRNA could be detected at 6 h in Tat-stimulated slices (40 amplification cycles, data not shown).	16731	16932
21810259	In accordance with the results of others on the effects of Tat on p38 MAPK in various cell types, we confirmed that HIV-1 Tat can activate p38 MAPK in OHSCs.	16933	17090
21810259	Slices were treated with Tat for 15, 30, 60 and 120 min respectively and the lysates were analyzed for phospho-p38 activity by Western blot analysis.	17091	17240
21810259	We found that Tat induced significant phosphorylation of p38 MAPK as early as 15 min (Figure 5A, p < 0.05) with a maximum at 60 min (Figure 5A, p < 0.05).	17241	17395
21810259	To determine whether p38 MAPK is involved in Tat-induced IDO expression, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190 was employed.	17396	17515
21810259	We previously established that 30 μM SB 202190 significantly suppresses cytokine expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in response to LPS stimulation (data not shown).	17516	17692
21810259	The dose of 30 uM was therefore selected for further experiments on Tat-induced IDO expression.	17693	17788
21810259	Slices were pretreated with SB 202190 (30 μM) for 30 min before stimulation with Tat for another 6 h. SB 202190 abrogated the Tat-induced expression of IDO, IL-6, iNOS and SERT transcripts, although this effect was only partial for TNFα mRNA (Figure 5B, p < 0.01).	17789	18053
21810259	SB 202190 also fully blocked the Tat-induced release of cytokine proteins in the slice supernatants (Figure 5B, p < 0.01).	18054	18176
21810259	Importantly, neither Tat nor SB 202190 affected viability of the cells, as determined by measuring both PI staining and release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium (data not shown).	18177	18371
21810259	These data clearly demonstrate that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is necessary for the Tat-induced expression of both proinflammatory cytokines and IDO.	18372	18525
21810259	Results of the present experiments establish that HIV-1 Tat induces depressive-like behavior in vivo and induces production of proinflammatory cytokine in vitro in murine OHSCs and increases expression of IDO and SERT.	18526	18744
21810259	These changes are dependent on activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.	18745	18821
21810259	Our in vivo data show that Tat increases the duration of immobility in the forced swim test in mice without inducing any sickness, as measured by the lack of body weight loss.	18822	18997
21810259	These data are in agreement with already published findings from our group on depressogenic activity of Tat.	18998	19106
21810259	The mechanisms of the depressogenic activity of Tat were further investigated in vitro.	19107	19194
21810259	Compared to primary cultures of brain cells, OHSCs have the advantage of preserving the cellular and connective organization as well as several fundamental in vivo-like characteristics such as glial-neuronal interactions.	19195	19416
21810259	Although this preparation has previously been used for studying the detrimental effects of proinflammatory cytokines on long-term potentiation in the rat system, OHSCs have rarely been used for the investigation of neuroimmune interactions.	19417	19657
21810259	Our previous experiments demonstrated that long term culture of OHSCs can be reliably used to study neuroimmune mechanisms of induction of IDO.	19658	19801
21810259	We therefore employed OHSCs in the present experiments to study the mechanisms involved in the expression of IDO by Tat.	19802	19922
21810259	Depression is an important comorbid condition of HIV infection.	19923	19986
21810259	We previously demonstrated that IDO, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of KYN from the precursor of Trp, is both sufficient and necessary to mediate depressive-like behavior in response to either acute or chronic activation of the immune system in mice.	19987	20258
21810259	Moreover, the increase in brain IDO activity is invariably preceded by enhanced expression of IDO mRNA, which can therefore be used as a surrogate marker of IDO activation.	20259	20431
21810259	Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of Tat on IDO mRNA in OHSCs.	20432	20517
21810259	As shown in Figure 2, HIV-1 Tat protein significantly up-regulates IDO mRNA expression in OHSCs.	20518	20614
21810259	These results are consistent with previous studies that describe Tat-mediated induction of the IDO expression in other types of cells.	20615	20749
21810259	These in vitro data are also in accordance with our in vivo results showing that Tat induced depressive-like behavior is associated with increased expression of IDO in the brain.	20750	20928
21810259	Taken together, these data provide the first evidence to indicate that activation of IDO in response to Tat stimulation in the brain could be a key event in the switch from sickness to depressive-like behavior.	20929	21139
21810259	IFNγ is considered to be the prototypical inducer of IDO in a variety of cells as well as in clinical situations in which inflammation-associated depression occurs.	21140	21304
21810259	Additionally, IFNγ is increased in the brain during HIV infection and synergizes with Tat to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAD.	21305	21446
21810259	It is well documented that monocytes/macrophages/microglia can produce IFNγ.	21447	21523
21810259	However, IDO expression appears to be up-regulated in an IFNγ-independent manner in HIV-infected human macrophages.	21524	21639
21810259	IFNγ protein remained undetectable in HIV-infected human macrophage supernatants while IDO expression increased.	21640	21752
21810259	Our data indicate that IDO induction by Tat does not necessarily require synthesis of IFNγ because no IFNγ transcripts could be detected at 6 h. These observations are in accordance with the results obtained by Boasso et al.. Boasso et al. reported that blockade of either type I or type II IFNs by antibodies was ineffective in preventing the induction of IDO in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to R5- or X4-trophic HIV.	21753	22191
21810259	Therefore, our data extend the developing concept that IDO can be induced by Tat in an IFNγ-independent mechanism.	22192	22306
21810259	Addition of Tat to OHSCs induced the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines.	22307	22395
21810259	These cytokines are well known to stimulate HIV-1 replication and contribute to HIV pathogenesis.	22396	22493
21810259	Increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain is observed in HIV-1 infected patients.	22494	22596
21810259	Tat also can up-regulate cytokine expression, such as IL-1β and TNFα, in peripheral blood macrophages, CNS-derived cell lines and primary astrocytes, microglia and human monocytes.	22597	22777
21810259	The large increase in proinflammatory cytokine expression could mediate IDO induction by Tat.	22778	22871
21810259	Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that IDO induction is associated to IL-1β.	22872	22959
21810259	For instance, pretreatment in vivo with the anti-inflammatory tetracycline derivative minocycline attenuates LPS-induced expression of brain IL-1β, indicating that IL-1β probably participates in LPS-induced expression of brain IDO.	22960	23191
21810259	A synergistic activation of IDO by IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 has been reported in human monocytic THP-1 cells exposed to LPS.	23192	23313
21810259	We observed that IL-1β mRNA can be induced by Tat in OHSCs (data not shown).	23314	23390
21810259	However, this induction does not lead to release of IL-1β protein if exogenous ATP is not added to the culture.	23391	23502
21810259	This is because ATP is necessary for processing and release of the mature IL-1β protein.	23503	23591
21810259	In the absence of IL-1β, the most likely mediators of IFNγ-independent IDO induction in OHSCs are TNF-α and IL-6.	23592	23705
21810259	IDO induction has been shown to be mediated mainly by TNF-α, but not by IL-6 in human monocytic THP-1 cell cultures exposed to immune stimulation.	23706	23852
21810259	However, IL-6 can synergize with TNF-α to increase IDO activity.	23853	23917
21810259	The exact cytokine signaling pathways that are predominantly involved in the production of IDO in response to Tat in OHSCs remain to be elucidated.	23918	24065
21810259	In addition to IDO induction by Tat, we observed a robust induction of SERT mRNA in response to Tat.	24066	24166
21810259	This finding indicates that OHSCs can serve as a reliable in vitro model for investigating the possible contribution of serotonin re-uptake mechanisms in comorbid depressive disorders in HIV-infected patients.	24167	24376
21810259	Whether this change at the mRNA level translates into functional changes in SERT remains to be established.	24377	24484
21810259	This is an important perspective since differences in the expression and function of SERT are well known to affect many human and mouse quantitative traits, including anxiety- and depression-related behaviors.	24485	24694
21810259	To elucidate the signaling pathways that mediate Tat-induced IDO expression, we examined whether Tat contributes to overexpression of IDO by activating p38 MAPK.	24695	24856
21810259	This signaling pathway has been shown to be required for IDO expression in THP-1 cells following LPS stimulation.	24857	24970
21810259	Moreover, HIV-1 Tat protein has been reported to activate p38 MAPK in a variety of cells, including monoctyes, macrophages, astrocytes and the human THP-1 cell line.	24971	25136
21810259	We therefore tested the possibility that Tat-induced p38 promotes expression of IDO in OHSCs.	25137	25230
21810259	SB 202190, a highly selective, potent and cell permeable inhibitor of p38 MAPK, was employed to inhibit p38 activation.	25231	25350
21810259	It binds within the ATP pocket of the active kinase with a Kd of 38 nM, as measured in recombinant human p38, and selectively inhibits both the p38α and β isoforms.	25351	25515
21810259	We observed that SB 202190 significantly inhibited Tat-induction of IDO in OHSCs, which is consistent with the possibility that p38 may be involved in the development of Tat-induced depressive-like behavior.	25516	25723
21810259	The demonstration of an inhibitory effect of SB 202190 on Tat-induced changes in OHSCs does not mean p38 MAPK signaling is directly responsible for these effects.	25724	25886
21810259	Activation of p38 MAPK could act indirectly via NFkB activation or AP-1 activity at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.	25887	26028
21810259	The human IDO promoter region contains multiple AP-1 and NFkB sites.	26029	26097
21810259	Therefore, the possibility that other transcription factors are involved in Tat-induced IDO expression cannot be dismissed.	26098	26221
21810259	However, our data clearly demonstrate that Tat-induced IDO expression in OHSCs is mediated, at least in part, through a p38-dependent mechanism.	26222	26366
21810259	In conclusion, results of the present studies demonstrate that p38 MAPK is potently involved in HIV-1 Tat-induced IDO expression.	26367	26496
21810259	These studies provide further evidence for targeting the brain IDO and p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the treatment of depressive disorders associated with HIV infection.	26497	26666
22729903	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the development of an immune response directed against any parts of the host body.	0	167
22729903	The course of SLE is unpredictable, with periods of remission and flare-ups.	168	244
22729903	Moreover, this autoimmune disorder is vastly heterogeneous, with various clinical manifestations including malar and discoid rash, photosensitivity, arthritis, serositis, as well as renal, neurologic, hematologic, immunologic and mucocutaneous manifestations, and biosynthesis of a broad array of autoantibodies.	245	557
22729903	The occurrence of SLE is nine times frequent in pre-menopausal women than in men.	558	639
22729903	It is accepted that environmental factors together with genetic components are involved in the abnormal immune responses and pathogenesis of SLE [2–6].	640	791
22729903	Flare-ups of SLE can be triggered by various environmental components, such as exposure to ultraviolet light, drugs, chemicals, and viral infections.	792	941
22729903	Candidate gene and genome wide association studies revealed numerous susceptibility genes of SLE, and the association of some of these genes have been confirmed among distinct populations.	942	1130
22729903	The immune cells from patients with SLE display many abnormalities, including reduced T cell cytotoxicity, abnormal function of CD4+ T cells, abnormal activation of B cells, and alterations in cytokine biosynthesis [7–9].	1131	1352
22729903	The STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) 4 gene is expressed in T and B cells, monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells.	1353	1517
22729903	STAT4 is a transcription factor and a member of the STAT family.	1518	1582
22729903	Its expression may support the differentiation of immune cells to inflammatory subsets, production of inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies, prevention of apoptosis, and presentation of autoantigens, which may promote the development of autoimmune diseases.	1583	1844
22729903	Several genome-wide association studies have identified STAT4 as an SLE susceptible gene in Caucasian and Asian populations [4, 5].	1845	1976
22729903	Recently, many studies have demonstrated the contribution of intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) and G > T (rs7574865) to the incidence of SLE and its clinical manifestations [11–19].	1977	2199
22729903	Both of these polymorphisms display complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Asian and Caucasian populations presented in HapMap CHB data (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).	2200	2371
22729903	We studied the STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) polymorphism distribution in SLE patients in a sample from a Polish cohort.	2372	2486
22729903	As SLE is a heterogeneous disorder, we also assessed the association of these polymorphisms with various clinical symptoms of SLE and the production of autoantibodies.	2487	2654
22729903	Data for two hundred and fifty-three women fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology Classification criteria for SLE [20, 21] were collected in a random manner for the study at the Institute of Rheumatology in Warsaw, Poland (Table 1).	2655	2896
22729903	Controls included five hundred and twenty-one unrelated healthy volunteers and healthy women selected during medical examination at the Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw.	2897	3071
22729903	Women with SLE and controls were of Polish and Caucasian origin and of a similar age.	3072	3157
22729903	The mean age of SLE patients at diagnosis was 34 ± 8 years, and of controls 33 ± 7 years.	3158	3247
22729903	All participating subjects provided written consent.	3248	3300
22729903	The study procedures were approved by the Local Ethical Committee of Poznań University of Medical Sciences.	3301	3408
22729903	DNA was isolated from peripheral leucocytes using a standard salting out procedure.	3409	3492
22729903	Identification of the STAT4 C > G (rs7582694) polymorphic variant was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP).	3493	3654
22729903	PCR was conducted employing primer pair 5′ ATCCAACTCTTCTCAGCCCTT 3′ and 5′ TCATAATCAGGAGAGAGGAGT 3′.	3655	3755
22729903	The PCR-amplified fragments of STAT4 that were 338 bp in length were isolated and digested with the endonuclease HpyCH4III (ACN/GT) NewEngland BioLabs, (Ipswich, USA).	3756	3923
22729903	The STAT4 C allele was cleaved into 258 and 80 bp fragments, whereas the STAT4 G allele remained uncut.	3924	4027
22729903	DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 3 % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.	4028	4139
22729903	The STAT4 C > G polymorphism was confirmed by repeated PCR–RFLP.	4140	4204
22729903	The genotyping quality was examined by direct sequencing of approximately 10 % of the all samples.	4205	4303
22729903	The distribution of genotypes in patients and controls was examined for deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium using exact and log likelihood ratio χ2 tests (http://ihg.gsf.de/cgi-bin/hw/hwa1.pl).	4304	4503
22729903	The polymorphism was tested for association with SLE incidence using the χ2 test for trend (p trend).	4504	4605
22729903	The χ2 test was employed to examine differences in genotypic and allelic distribution between patients and controls, and a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.	4606	4784
22729903	The Odds Ratio (OR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (95 % CI) were calculated.	4785	4861
22729903	Contribution of the STAT4 C > G polymorphism to clinical manifestations and the production of autoantibodies (Ab) was determined by χ2 test.	4862	5002
22729903	The Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used and both p values, before (p) and after correction (p corr), were determined.	5003	5140
22729903	Power analysis was performed using uncorrected χ2 test using Power and Sample Size Calculation program version 2.1.30.	5141	5259
22729903	Distribution of STAT4 G > C genotypes did not display significant deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium between patients and healthy individuals.	5260	5409
22729903	The prevalence of the STAT4 C/C genotype was 1.8-fold times higher in patients with SLE than in healthy individuals (Table 2).	5410	5536
22729903	The STAT4 C/G heterozygous frequency in patients was higher than in controls and amounted to 37 and 31 %, respectively (Table 2).	5537	5666
22729903	The OR for SLE patients with the C/C genotype as compared to the C/G and G/G genotypes was 1.967 (95 % CI = 1.152–3.358, p = 0.0119) and OR for the C/C and C/G genotypes as compared to the G/G genotype was 1.583 (95 % CI = 1.168–2.145, p = 0.0030) (Table 2; Figure 1S, online supplementary data).	5667	5963
22729903	To evaluate the effect of the minor allele as a risk factor in SLE incidence, we also assessed the minor allele’s distribution in patients and healthy individuals.	5964	6127
22729903	The frequency of the STAT4 C allele was higher in patients with SLE compared to healthy individuals, with frequencies of 30 and 22 %, respectively (Table 2).	6128	6285
22729903	The OR for the STAT4 C allele frequency showed a 1.539-fold increased risk of SLE (95 % CI = 1.209–1.959, p = 0.0004) (Table 2; Figure 1S, online supplementary data).	6286	6452
22729903	The p value of the χ2 test for the trend observed for the STAT4 G > C polymorphism was also statistically significant (p trend = 0.0008).	6453	6590
22729903	The statistical power of this study amounted to 84 % for the C/C or C/G genotypes and 69 % for the C/C genotype (Table 2).	6591	6713
22729903	We found an association between STAT4 C/C and C/G genotypes with renal OR = 2.259 (1.365–3.738, p = 0.0014), (p corr = 0.0238) and neurologic manifestations OR = 2.867 (1.467–5.604, p = 0.0016), (p corr = 0.0272) of the disease (Table 1; Figure 2S, online supplementary data).	6714	6990
22729903	Moreover, we observed a significant association between the STAT4 C/C and C/G genotypes and the presence of anti-snRNP Ab OR = 3.237 (1.667–6.288, p = 0.0003), (p corr = 0.0051).	6991	7169
22729903	There was also significant association between the C/C and C/G genotypes and the anti-Scl-70 Ab OR = 2.665 (1.380–5.147, p = 0.0028), (p corr = 0.0476) (Table 3; Figure 3S, online supplementary data).	7170	7370
22729903	STATs include DNA-interacting transcription factors that trigger the expression of the DNA’s target genes by recognizing specific DNA regulatory sequences.	7371	7526
22729903	The expression of STATs has been observed in a vast range of cell types, however the expression of STAT4 mainly takes place in immune cells and the testis.	7527	7682
22729903	STAT4 is essential for signal transduction by interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-23 (IL-23), and type 1 interferon (IFN) in T cells and monocytes.	7683	7830
22729903	IL-12 induces the STAT4-dependent NK cell activation and differentiation of naive CD4+ lymphocytes into Th1 effector cells and IFNγ production [23–25].	7831	7982
22729903	STAT4 also mediates the IL-23-dependent expansion of Th17 cells, contributing to autoimmune diseases.	7983	8084
22729903	It has been demonstrated that STAT4-deficient mice display reduced manifestation of T cell-linked experimental autoimmune diseases including encephalomyelitis, arthritis, myocarditis, colitis, and autoimmune diabetes.	8085	8302
22729903	Moreover, STAT4 deficiency results in a reduction of IFNγ biosynthesis in immune cells.	8303	8390
22729903	Accordingly, an association between disease activity in SLE patients and activation of the type 1 IFN system has been observed.	8391	8518
22729903	We observed that STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) intronic substitution may significantly increase the risk of SLE occurrence in a sample of the Polish population.	8519	8673
22729903	Recent studies carried out by Luan et al. demonstrated a statistically significant contribution of STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) to SLE incidence in the Mainland Chinese female population.	8674	8856
22729903	The association of the STAT4 G > T (rs7574865) polymorphism with SLE development was also previously observed in other Asian ethnic groups residing in Hong Kong, Northern Han of China, and Japan [14–19].	8857	9060
22729903	The contribution of the STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) or STAT4 G > T (rs7574865) polymorphisms to SLE incidence was also observed in large groups of patients of European origin, among them a Finnish family cohort as well as Spanish, Swedish and other populations [11–13, 29, 30].	9061	9334
22729903	The SNP rs7574865 has also been confirmed as a genetic risk factor in the incidence of SLE in Colombian, Mexican, and Argentinian cohorts [30, 31].	9335	9482
22729903	However, the rs7574865 polymorphism has not been found to be a risk factor for SLE in the Turkish population.	9483	9592
22729903	In our study, patients with the STAT4 C/C or G/C genotypes exhibited a significantly increased risk of developing either renal or neurologic manifestations of SLE.	9593	9756
22729903	An association between the STAT4 G > T (rs7574865) polymorphism and nepthritis has also been demonstrated in Americans of European descent.	9757	9896
22729903	Moreover, the contribution of STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) or STAT4 G > T (rs7574865) SNPs to the production of double-stranded DNA autoantibodies has been found in Swedish and American Europeans [11, 12, 33].	9897	10101
22729903	The STAT4 G > T (rs7574865) SNP has also been associated with antiphospholipid syndrome in Italian cohorts, as has the production of anti-Sm antibodies in a Northern Han Chinese population.	10102	10291
22729903	Additionally, other STAT4 SNPs were correlated with lupus nephritis, arthritis, and the production of anti-SSA/B autoantibodies in a Northern Han Chinese population.	10292	10457
22729903	The different effects of the STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) or STAT4 G > T (rs7574865) SNPs on clinical manifestations in various ethnicities may result from different sizes of the studied groups, genetic heterogeneity or patient interaction with disparate environmental factors.	10458	10730
22729903	STAT4 gene variants have also been found to be risk factors for other autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, asthma, systemic sclerosis, and Sjogren’s syndrome [35–39].	10731	10929
22729903	The role of STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) or STAT4 G > T (rs7574865) SNPs in the expression of STAT4 have been studied [12, 30].	10930	11052
22729903	Abelson et al. (2009) used quantitative PCR to demonstrate significantly higher levels of STAT4 mRNA in mononuclear cells bearing the SLE risk TT genotypes as compared to cells having the GG or GT genotypes of the rs7574865 SNP.	11053	11281
22729903	Moreover, Sigurdsson et al. indicated that gene variants having the rs8179673 SNP in almost perfect pair-wise LD with rs7582694 led to over-expression of STAT4 in pooled primary human osteoblasts.	11282	11478
22729903	Our genetic studies are consistent with other studies that have demonstrated the STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) intronic substitution as a significant risk factor of SLE incidence.	11479	11652
22729903	Moreover, we found that this SNP can be associated with renal and neurological symptoms of SLE.	11653	11748
22729903	Since this autoimmune disease is vastly heterogeneous, further studies of this polymorphism’s effects on clinical manifestations of SLE in other populations would be valuable.	11749	11924
24535067	Etomidate is a potent hypnotic agent with minimal cardiovascular and respiratory adverse effects, providing better hemodynamic stability compared with other induction agents and not triggering histamine release.	0	211
24535067	Previous studies reported that at 0.3 mg·kg−1 induction doses, etomidate does not cause significant alterations in heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures, right atrial pressure, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, stroke volume, cardiac index, systemic blood flow, and shunt flow in pediatric patients undergoing congenital cardiac shunt surgery and in adults [1–7].	212	608
24535067	Induction of anesthesia with etomidate results in dose-dependent myoclonus in 50–80% of patients without premedication.	609	728
24535067	In addition to increasing the risk of aspiration in patients with a full stomach, myoclonus may also increase intraocular pressures and cause problems in patients who will undergo open eye surgery.	729	926
24535067	The incidence of myoclonus is reduced by one-half when pretreatment with 100 μg fentanyl 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia is made, but the incidence of apnea is increased.	927	1106
24535067	It was shown that midazolam pretreatment decreased myoclonus induced by etomidate, and increasing the dose of midazolam from 0.015 mg·kg−1 to 0.05 mg·kg−1 did not further decrease the incidence of myoclonus.	1107	1314
24535067	There are no reported comparative studies that have investigated whether fentanyl or midazolam is a better option in the prevention of myoclonus due to etomidate.	1315	1477
24535067	The aim of this study was to compare the efficacies of fentanyl, midazolam, or their half-dose combinations in preventing myocloni when they were administered prior to induction of anesthesia with etomidate.	1478	1685
24535067	This retrospective comparative study was performed based on anesthesia records over a period of 6 months.	1686	1791
24535067	Eighty adult patients with ASA I–II physiologic score and who would undergo various operations under general anesthesia were included in the study.	1792	1939
24535067	Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate, the patients were separated into 4 groups: no pretreatment (Group NP), fentanyl 1 μg/kg (Group F), midazolam 0.03 mg/kg (Group M), and midazolam 0.015 mg/kg + fentanyl 0.5 μg/kg (Group FM).	1940	2223
24535067	The incidence of myoclonus in the no pretreatment group (Group NP) was estimated to be 80%, based on previous studies.	2224	2342
24535067	Power analysis with α=0.05 and β=0.2 for determining the myoclonus frequency under 50% revealed that each group required a minimum of 17 patients.	2343	2489
24535067	However, each group included 20 patients according to the admission date.	2490	2563
24535067	The patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected: 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs (fentanyl, midazolam or combination of both), anesthesia is induced with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate (Etomidate-Lipuro, B. Braun Melsungen AG, D-34209 Melsungen, Germany), injected intravenously over a period of 20–30 seconds.	2564	2918
24535067	Two minutes after the end of etomidate injection, muscle relaxation with 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium was achieved and endotracheal intubation was performed after another 2 minutes.	2919	3092
24535067	Following etomidate injection, mask ventilation with 100% O2 was carried out until intubation.	3093	3187
24535067	Anesthesia was maintained using 1.5–2.5% concentration of sevoflurane in a mixture of O2 and air that contained 50% O2.	3188	3307
24535067	Patients who took sedative and analgesic drugs within the 24 hours before the operation were excluded from the study.	3308	3425
24535067	Myoclonic movements were evaluated, which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection: 0=no myoclonus, 1=mild myoclonus (small movements in 1 body segment, such as finger or wrist), 2=moderate (slight movements in 2 or more muscle areas, such as face or shoulder), and 3=severe (intense movements in 2 or more muscle areas, sudden adduction of an extremity).	3426	3843
24535067	The severity of pain due to etomidate injection was evaluated using a 4-grade scale: 0=no pain, 1=mild (pain reported only when asked), 2=moderate (pain reported without being asked or reported when asked and there were associated behavioral symptoms), and 3=severe (verbal response, grimacing, pulling the arm, tearing in the eyes).	3844	4177
24535067	Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) recordings were evaluated during the time between entrance into the operating room and 5 minutes after intubation.	4178	4341
24535067	Decreases in peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2 <90%), arrhythmia, and other adverse effects were also evaluated.	4342	4455
24535067	The data were registered and analyzed using the SPSS 16.0 for Windows software.	4456	4535
24535067	Chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between the groups.	4536	4615
24535067	The distribution of group means was evaluated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and after they were found to have normal distribution, 1-way analysis of variance was used to compare the hemodynamic parameters between the groups.	4616	4840
24535067	Hemodynamic parameter changes in the groups relative to the baseline during each measurement period were evaluated using repeated measurements analysis of variance.	4841	5005
24535067	Tukey HSD and Dunnett tests were used post hoc to determine the groups showing a statistically significant difference.	5006	5124
24535067	Data are shown as mean ±s.d.	5125	5153
24535067	or the number of cases.	5154	5177
24535067	Statistical significance level was accepted as p<0.05.	5178	5232
24535067	There were no differences between the groups with respect to mean age, weight, height, ASA physiologic score, sex distribution, and injection pain (p>0.05, Table 1).	5233	5398
24535067	Pretreatment with either fentanyl or fentanyl-midazolam combination decreased the frequency and severity of myoclonic movements arising after anesthesia induction with etomidate (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively (Table 2).	5399	5621
24535067	During the study period, none of the patients had a decrease in peripheral oxygen saturation, arrhythmia, or any other adverse effects.	5622	5757
24535067	Mean arterial pressure measurements after induction were significantly lower in groups F and FM compared to the no pretreatment group (p<0.001).	5758	5902
24535067	Intragroup comparison showed that MAP had significant reductions to the basal values in Groups F and FM (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively).	5903	6042
24535067	All groups except group FM had significant increases in MAP 2 minutes after intubation (Table 3).	6043	6140
24535067	Intergroup comparisons showed that mean heart rate values after induction were significantly lower in Groups F and FM compared to Group NP.	6141	6280
24535067	Intragroup comparisons showed that Group NP had significant elevations which later returned to basal values 5 minutes after intubation (p<0.001).	6281	6426
24535067	Group F never had significant elevations compared to basal values, whereas group M had significant elevations at all periods (p<0.01 and p<0.001).	6427	6573
24535067	In group FM, only the HR measurements taken 2 minutes after intubation were significantly higher than basal values (p<0.01, Table 4).	6574	6707
24535067	The results of this study show that the incidence of myoclonus was 85% in the no pretreatment group after etomidate injection; this finding was similar to the others reported in the literature [8,11–19].	6708	6911
24535067	The incidence of myoclonus due to etomidate depends on the dosage and speed of injection.	6912	7001
24535067	In healthy volunteers, Doenicke et al. demonstrated that increased doses of etomidate were correlated with the frequency of myocloni, which was 83% with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate.	7002	7175
24535067	None of the patients had myocloni in doses under 0.05 mg/kg.	7176	7236
24535067	Do et al. investigated the effects of slow and rapid etomidate injection rates at 0.3 mg/kg doses on the frequency of myocloni, and observed that 84% of the patients developed myocloni when the drug was administered over a period of 10 seconds, whereas 28% of the patients developed myocloni when the injection was made slowly over a period of 2 minutes.	7237	7591
24535067	Nyman et al. showed that myocloni developed in 85% of children given 0.3 mg·kg−1 intravenous etomidate over a period of 5–10 seconds.	7592	7725
24535067	In our study, we found similar rates of myocloni when etomidate was given over a period of 20 seconds.	7726	7828
24535067	Doenicke showed that after 0.3 mg/kg etomidate, myocloni occurred 80–360 (mean 160) seconds after the injection, and lasted 40–400 (mean 160) seconds.	7829	7979
24535067	The duration of clinical observation in etomidate-induced myocloni range from 1 to 3 minutes according to various studies.	7980	8102
24535067	In these studies the incidence of myocloni decreased as the observation period was shortened.	8103	8196
24535067	Huter et al. applied cardioversion 1 minute after administration of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate, and found that the rate of myoclonus was 50%.	8197	8331
24535067	Satilmis et al. investigated the efficacy of magnesium sulphate in the prevention of etomidate-induced myoclonus and gave vecuronium to their patients 1 minute after injection of 0.2 mg/kg etomidate.	8332	8531
24535067	The frequency of myoclonus in patients who received premedication with isotonic saline was 55%.	8532	8627
24535067	Patients who did not receive premedication and were treated with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate followed by vecuronium 2 and 3 minutes later had 77% and 84% myoclonus rates, respectively.	8628	8804
24535067	In our study we gave the neuromuscular blocker 2 minutes after 0.3 mg/kg etomidate administration, and observed myoclonic movements during this time.	8805	8954
24535067	The results in our control group were in concordance with other studies having the same observation period length.	8955	9069
24535067	When the clinical observation period that aims to detect myoclonic movements is shortened, it may result in the suppression of a possibly delayed myoclonus by a neuromuscular blocker and thereby result in lower rates.	9070	9287
24535067	We believe further studies are necessary to determine the optimal length of observation needed to determine the incidence of myoclonus after etomidate injection.	9288	9449
24535067	A study that investigated EEG alterations in patients with etomidate-induced myoclonus stressed the correlation between myoclonus and the increase in delta waves in EEG recordings.	9450	9630
24535067	In this study, myoclonus was observed to be synchronized with slow and continuous waves on EEG, and it was not a typical seizure.	9631	9760
24535067	There were no changes except for delta waves in EEG recordings throughout the myoclonic episode.	9761	9857
24535067	The possible cause of myoclonus during anesthesia induction using etomidate is thought to be subcortical disinhibition.	9858	9977
24535067	The decreased incidence of myoclonus when using premedication with drugs such as benzodiazepines and fentanyl, which are known to inhibit subcortical neuronal activity, supports this hypothesis.	9978	10172
24535067	Fentanyl is a μ-opioid receptor antagonist that causes dose-dependent analgesia, respiratory depression, and sedation.	10173	10291
24535067	The inhibitory effects of midazolam on the central nervous system act through GABAA receptors.	10292	10386
24535067	The site of action where fentanyl and midazolam prevent the myoclonus occurring after etomidate injection is not clear.	10387	10506
24535067	However, the prevention of myoclonus by fentanyl and midazolam is a result of inhibition in the central nervous system, although their actions are mediated by different receptors.	10507	10686
24535067	In our study, fentanyl and midazolam combination was more effective in the prevention of myoclonus compared to use of either drug alone.	10687	10823
24535067	We observed that the myoclonus rate decreased to 40% (8/20) in the group that received 1 μg/kg fentanyl before anesthesia induction with etomidate, and to 25% (6/20) in the group that received both 0.5 μg/kg fentanyl and 0.015 mg/kg midazolam.	10824	11067
24535067	We also found that 0.03 mg/kg midazolam was inadequate for preventing myoclonus.	11068	11148
24535067	Although the frequency of myocloni was lower in the group in which fentanyl and midazolam were used together compared to the use of either drug alone, we found that they had no additive or synergistic effect.	11149	11357
24535067	It has been shown that midazolam and fentanyl display a synergy when used together.	11358	11441
24535067	However, in the fentanyl+midazolam combination, the use of half the dosage of the drugs compared to when either of them was applied alone can explain why we saw no additive or synergistic effect.	11442	11637
24535067	Stocham et al. reported that premedication with fentanyl decreased etomidate-induced myoclonus in a dose-dependent manner, but it increased the risk of apnea.	11638	11796
24535067	They observed that none of the patients who received premedication with 500 μg fentanyl 5 minutes before anesthesia induction using etomidate had a myoclonus, but all developed apnea.	11797	11980
24535067	Respiratory depression was less when 100 μg fentanyl was given, and the rate of myoclonus was 33%.	11981	12079
24535067	Giese et al. reported that premedication with 100 μg fentanyl significantly decreased the rate of etomidate-induced myoclonus; however, it introduced the risk of respiratory depression.	12080	12265
24535067	Similarly, the rate of myoclonus in our patients premedicated with 1 μg/kg fentanyl was 40%, but none of our patients sustained any episodes of apnea or desaturation.	12266	12432
24535067	The mean fentanyl dose in our study was 72±16 μg.	12433	12482
24535067	Myoclonus rates in studies using 100 μg fentanyl and in our study were not different, and we believe that lower doses of fentanyl in our study prevented apneic episodes.	12483	12652
24535067	Our results show that 0.03 mg/kg midazolam was not effective in preventing myocloni.	12653	12737
24535067	The rate of myoclonus was 60% in patients who were treated with midazolam.	12738	12812
24535067	Huter et al. reported that in patients undergoing elective cardioversion, 0.015 mg/kg midazolam pretreatment 90 seconds prior to anesthesia induction with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate provided significant reduction in the frequency of myocloni compared to the control group (10% vs. 50%).	12813	13092
24535067	Huter et al. used a shorter observation period (1 minute) than our study, and most of their patients were under magnesium treatment, which account for the difference.	13093	13259
24535067	Schwarzkopf et al. showed that 0.015 mg/kg midazolam significantly reduced the rate of myoclonus compared to the control group (20% vs. 90%).	13260	13401
24535067	Premedication with oral midazolam and shorter observation period (1 minute) for myoclonus, in contrast to our study, may be the causes for lower incidence.	13402	13557
24535067	Hwang et al. found that 0.05 mg/kg midazolam pretreatment given 60 seconds prior to induction with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate reduced the rate of myoclonus to 17%, which was 77% in the control group using placebo.	13558	13764
24535067	The higher dose used in our study may be one of the causes.	13765	13824
24535067	We therefore conclude that the efficacy of midazolam in prevention of etomidate-induced myoclonus may be correlated with dose, and studies that are better standardized in that aspect are needed.	13825	14019
24535067	High osmotic pressure in the etomidate formulation is thought to cause injection pain.	14020	14106
24535067	The injection pain is reported to be significantly less in lipid-emulsified etomidate compared to etomidate dissolved in propylene glycol.	14107	14245
24535067	We found the injection pain rate of the lipid solution was 0–10%, which is similar in results in the literature.	14246	14358
24535067	During evaluation of the hemodynamic effects of etomidate, the control group was also analyzed to exclude the influences of study drugs used in premedication.	14359	14517
24535067	The results show that etomidate did not cause a significant difference in hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction.	14518	14642
24535067	Although the increase in HR was statistically significant, the difference was less than 15% compared to basal values.	14643	14760
24535067	These findings correlate with those of previous studies [1–7].	14761	14823
24535067	The absence of any recording of the onset time of myoclonus within the 2-minute observation period and of its duration was a limiting factor for our study.	14824	14979
24535067	Studies that will enable investigation of the onset time and duration of myoclonus after etomidate injection may provide us with useful information on the optimal pretreatment time.	14980	15161
24535067	We found that both the combination of 0.5 μg/kg fentanyl with 0.015 mg/kg midazolam and 1 μg/kg fentanyl alone were effective in the prevention of myocloni caused by anesthesia induction with etomidate and observed in high rates in patients without premedication.	15162	15425
24535067	Premedication with 0.03 mg/kg midazolam alone was insufficient for the prevention of myoclonus.	15426	15521
24768818	The discoidin domain receptors (DDRs), DDR1 and DDR2, are unique among the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in being activated by interaction with the extracellular matrix.	0	172
24768818	Binding to triple-helical collagen is mediated by the receptor extracellular domains that include an N-terminal discoidin (DS) domain, a DS-like domain and a short juxtamembrane (JM) region [3–5].	173	369
24768818	A single transmembrane helix links to the cytoplasmic domain, where a larger JM region precedes the catalytic C-terminal kinase domain.	370	505
24768818	Both DDRs form constitutive dimers making them unusual among RTKs, which typically dimerize only upon activation [6–8].	506	625
24768818	DDRs regulate extracellular matrix remodeling, as well as cell adhesion, proliferation and migration.	626	727
24768818	DDR1 is expressed mainly in epithelial cells where it plays an important role in mammary gland development, whereas mesenchymal expression of DDR2 promotes bone growth, as suggested by dwarfism in DDR2 knockout mice.	728	944
24768818	DDR kinases are linked to the progression of various human diseases, including fibrotic disorders, atherosclerosis and cancer.	945	1071
24768818	Significantly, they are identified as indicators of poor prognosis in ovarian, breast and lung cancer [14–16].	1072	1182
24768818	DDR1 overexpression is associated with increased cell survival and invasion in hepatocellular carcinomas, pituitary adenoma and prostate cancer [17–19], whereas DDR2 is mutated in squamous cell lung cancers and contributes to breast cancer metastasis.	1183	1434
24768818	The promise of DDR kinases as a therapeutic target has been demonstrated by DDR1 knockdown that has been shown to reduce metastatic activity in lung cancer models, slow the development of atherosclerosis and impede the development of fibrotic disorders [23–25].	1435	1696
24768818	Imatinib (STI-571) is a first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted at breakpoint cluster region-Abelson kinase (ABL) for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).	1697	1875
24768818	As a type II inhibitor, imatinib achieves significant selectivity by binding to an inactive DFG-out conformation (DFG, Asp-Phe-Gly) of the kinase domain.	1876	2029
24768818	A chemical proteomics study recently identified DDR1 as a secondary target of imatinib, leading to the suggestion that DDR1 inhibition may also contribute to the effectiveness of the treatment, particularly as activation of DDR1 is known to block p53-mediated apoptosis.	2030	2300
24768818	Further characterization of this interaction revealed imatinib to be a potent inhibitor of DDR1, as were the second-generation TKIs nilotinib and dasatinib.	2301	2457
24768818	Moreover, dasatinib may have potential to treat squamous cell lung cancer in patients harboring oncogenic mutations in DDR2.	2458	2582
24768818	Imatinib also rescues mouse models of fibrosis similarly to DDR1 deficiency, although a connection between these effects has yet to be proven.	2583	2725
24768818	Ponatinib is a third-generation TKI developed for the treatment of CML patients with resistance to imatinib.	2726	2834
24768818	It was selected primarily to circumvent the steric hindrance introduced by the ABL T315I “gatekeeper” mutation and has proven to be a more potent but considerably less selective inhibitor than imatinib.	2835	3037
24768818	Finally, the inhibitor DDR1-IN-1 was designed to a similar pharmacophore model as these multi-targeted type II kinase inhibitors but has been recently reported as a highly selective pharmacological probe for DDR1-dependent signal transduction.	3038	3281
24768818	Such inhibitors will be highly valuable to investigate further the complex roles of DDR1 in both normal and pathobiology.	3282	3403
24768818	In addition, more selective compounds are likely to offer improved safety profiles for potential clinical indications outside oncology.	3404	3539
24768818	While crystal structures of DDR1 and DDR2 have revealed the molecular basis for extracellular collagen interaction, a structural description of the kinase domain fold is lacking.	3540	3718
24768818	Here, we present the crystal structures of the kinase domain of human DDR1 in complexes with the inhibitors imatinib and ponatinib, as well as structural comparisons to the selective inhibitor DDR1-IN-1.	3719	3922
24768818	The structures reveal differences to ABL in both the shape and the sequence of the ATP pocket that can be exploited for the design of DDR1-specific inhibitors.	3923	4082
24768818	The kinase domain of human DDR1 (residues 601–913; Fig.	4083	4138
24768818	1a) was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified using nickel affinity and size-exclusion chromatography.	4139	4246
24768818	Crystal structures (Fig.	4247	4271
24768818	1b) were determined in separate complexes with the kinase inhibitors imatinib and ponatinib, respectively (Fig.	4272	4383
24768818	1c).	4384	4388
24768818	The ponatinib co-structure was solved by molecular replacement using tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) (PDB ID: 4AT5) as a search model and refined at 1.9 Å resolution (see Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics).	4389	4619
24768818	The complete main chain was traceable, except for residues 721–731, which were not visible in the electron density map.	4620	4739
24768818	This site, corresponding to a small kinase insert domain (KID), was one of several sequence insertions identified relative to the comparable kinase domain structure of ABL (Fig.	4740	4917
24768818	1d).	4918	4922
24768818	The DDR1–imatinib complex structure was solved subsequently using data collected from crystals improved by microseeding procedures (see Materials and Methods).	4923	5082
24768818	The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 1.7 Å resolution.	5083	5165
24768818	Disordered regions in the imatinib co-structure were identified in both the KID region and a portion of the activation segment spanning residues 799–803.	5166	5319
24768818	The two inhibitor complexes exhibited distinct crystal packing leading to small differences in their respective structures (Fig.	5320	5448
24768818	2).	5449	5452
24768818	DDR1 was monomeric in the imatinib complex, consistent with its size-exclusion profile, whereas the ponatinib complex formed a crystallographic dimer with an additional ponatinib molecule bound at the dimer interface (Fig.	5453	5675
24768818	2).	5449	5452
24768818	Overall, DDR1 displays the classical bilobal architecture of a tyrosine kinase (Fig.	5680	5764
24768818	1b).	5765	5769
24768818	An N-terminal extension folds across the top of the smaller N-terminal lobe, which comprises β1–β5 strands and the αC helix.	5770	5894
24768818	In the α-helical C-terminal lobe, the activation segment includes an additional β-hairpin motif formed by strands β8 and β9 (Fig.	5895	6024
24768818	1b and d).	6025	6035
24768818	As observed for ABL, both type II inhibitors induce an inactive conformation of DDR1 characterized by a “DFG-Asp out, αC-Glu in” configuration.	6036	6179
24768818	In this conformation, the catalytically relevant salt bridge is observed between DDR1 residues Glu672 (αC) and Lys655 (β3), but the remaining catalytic site is disrupted by an inverted conformation of the DFG motif in the activation loop (A-loop).	6180	6427
24768818	Comparable inhibitor-bound structures of DDR1 and ABL show a global root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.6 Å over 248 Cα atoms (Fig.	6428	6562
24768818	3a), with identical values for the respective imatinib and ponatinib complexes.	6563	6642
24768818	DDR1 contains a notable insertion between the β2 and β3 strands, where amino acids 629–650 form a structured loop of 22 residues that is double the length of the same region in the closely related kinases insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), MUSK (muscle, skeletal receptor tyrosine protein kinase) and TrkB.	6643	6961
24768818	These residues fold across the top of the N-lobe forming hydrophobic interactions with the N-terminal extension and β5 strand.	6962	7088
24768818	The N-lobes also differ in the P-loop, which in DDR1 remains bound to β3 as a β-hairpin in contrast to the cage-like structure of ABL that dissociates to envelope the bound imatinib (Fig.	7089	7276
24768818	3a).	7277	7281
24768818	Two additional sequence insertions are identified in the C-lobe.	7282	7346
24768818	Firstly, DDR1 contains a small KID located between helices αD and αE, although 12 of these 23 residues are disordered (Fig.	7347	7470
24768818	3a).	7277	7281
24768818	Secondly, an insert of 7 residues follows the DDR1 αG helix leading to a difference of 6.8 Å in the positions of the DDR1 and ABL chains at this site (Fig.	7476	7631
24768818	3a).	7277	7281
24768818	Similar insertions are predicted in DDR2, although the KID region appears 9 residues shorter in this protein (Fig.	7637	7751
24768818	1d).	4918	4922
24768818	The two DDR family members share 68% sequence identity within their kinase domains, with the highest conservation as expected in the catalytic core and activation segments.	7757	7929
24768818	In particular, the P-loop and ATP pocket residues of DDR1 and DDR2 are strictly conserved suggesting that their inhibitor binding preferences will be similar.	7930	8088
24768818	Both kinases contain three potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in their A-loops corresponding to DDR1 Tyr792, Tyr796 and Tyr797.	8089	8225
24768818	Their packing closely matches that of the conserved residues in the inactive structures of IGF1R, MUSK and TrkB (Fig.	8226	8343
24768818	3b).	8344	8348
24768818	In particular, DDR1 Tyr796 adopts a conserved position as a pseudosubstrate, as observed also for the single tyrosine in ABL (Fig.	8349	8479
24768818	3b).	8344	8348
24768818	Mass spectrometry confirmed that the DDR1 kinase domain was expressed and purified in a non-phosphorylated state.	8485	8598
24768818	Perhaps the most important sequence changes in the DDR family occur in the P-loop, where ABL mutations conferring imatinib resistance (Gly250Glu and Tyr253Phe) match the native DDR sequence (DDR1 Glu618 and Phe621, respectively).	8599	8828
24768818	In ABL, Tyr253 forms a hydrogen bond with Asn322 to stabilize the cage-like structure of the P-loop, while Gly250 likely contributes to the flexibility required for this fold (Fig.	8829	9009
24768818	4).	9010	9013
24768818	This P-loop conformation also affords additional van der Waals interactions with the inhibitor.	9014	9109
24768818	As a result of its phenylalanine substitution, the same hydrogen bond cannot be formed in DDR1 and its P-loop retains the common β-hairpin conformation.	9110	9262
24768818	Interestingly, the missing P-loop interactions are replaced by the A-loop, which inserts DDR1 Arg789 into the ATP pocket to hydrogen bond with the Asn322-equivalent residue Asp708 (Fig.	9263	9448
24768818	4).	9010	9013
24768818	This conformation is further stabilized by main-chain hydrogen bonding between the P-loop and A-loop (data not shown).	9453	9571
24768818	Thus, the alternative structure of DDR1 removes Glu618 and Phe621 from the binding site into solvent while maintaining suitable ATP pocket interactions for inhibitor binding.	9572	9746
24768818	As anticipated, the binding of both type II inhibitors is facilitated by an inverted conformation of the DFG motif that exposes an additional binding pocket below the αC for the inhibitor tail, while the head groups bind to the hinge.	9747	9981
24768818	In total, imatinib forms six hydrogen bonds in the ATP pocket of DDR1 (Fig.	9982	10057
24768818	5a).	10058	10062
24768818	Two target the hinge region, including one between the pyridine head group and the backbone amide of Met704 and one between the aminopyrimidine and the gatekeeper residue Thr701.	10063	10241
24768818	Two more are made by the linker: the amide binds to Glu672 in the αC, while the carbonyl contacts the backbone amide of Asp784 in the DFG motif.	10242	10386
24768818	Finally, the methylpiperazine group occupies a hydrophobic pocket between the αC and HRD (His-Arg-Asp) motif and hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of Val763 and His764.	10387	10564
24768818	The DFG motif further stabilizes the binding with a π–π stacking interaction between Phe785 and the aminopyrimidine group (Fig.	10565	10692
24768818	5a).	10058	10062
24768818	The strong binding of DDR1 to imatinib was revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which indicated a dissociation constant (KD) of 1.9 nM (Fig.	10698	10853
24768818	5b).	10854	10858
24768818	To confirm the ability of imatinib to inhibit DDR1 kinase activity in cells, we measured its ability to block collagen-induced DDR1 autophosphorylation in U2OS cells.	10859	11025
24768818	Again, imatinib demonstrated significant potency against DDR1 yielding an EC50 of 21 nM.	11026	11114
24768818	By design, ponatinib binds at the same site with the loss of one hydrogen bond owing to the ethynyl linker, which removes any polar interaction with the gatekeeper residue Thr701 (Fig.	11115	11299
24768818	6a).	11300	11304
24768818	Hinge interactions are made instead by an imidazo[1,2b]pyridazine head group, which establishes the hydrogen bond with Met704.	11305	11431
24768818	In addition to the remaining four hydrogen bonds, there are extensive hydrophobic interactions across the DDR1 pocket, although the π–π interaction with Phe785 is broken (Fig.	11432	11607
24768818	6a).	11300	11304
24768818	The added trifluoromethyl group occupies the pocket vacated by the inverted DFG motif and forms favorable hydrophobic contacts with Leu679, Ile684, Ile685, Leu757 and Ile782 (Fig.	11613	11792
24768818	6a).	11300	11304
24768818	ITC measurements suggested that the ponatinib interaction was slightly stronger than imatinib, with a calculated KD of 1.3 nM (Fig.	11798	11929
24768818	6b).	11930	11934
24768818	Similar potency was observed in U2OS cells, where ponatinib inhibited collagen-induced DDR1 autophosphorylation with an EC50 of 2.5 nM (Fig.	11935	12075
24768818	6d).	12076	12080
24768818	The tight binding of both inhibitors can be understood from the similar inhibitor binding modes of DDR1 and ABL, which share a conserved threonine gatekeeper in their hinge regions (Supplementary Fig.	12081	12281
24768818	S1).	12282	12286
24768818	Importantly for inhibitor design, the ATP pocket of DDR1 also shows a number of sequence changes.	12287	12384
24768818	Several substitutions cluster around the inhibitor tail region, where DDR1 Ile675 (αC), Leu679 (αC), Ile684 (αC-β4 loop) and Ile685 (αC-β4 loop) replace ABL Val289, Ile293, Leu298 and Val299, respectively.	12385	12590
24768818	Other changes include Tyr703 (ABL Phe317) in the hinge and Met699 (ABL Ile313, β5), which packs above the methylphenyl linker.	12591	12717
24768818	Recently we reported the discovery of a type II kinase inhibitor, DDR1-IN-1, with striking selectivity for DDR1 (Fig.	12718	12835
24768818	7a; PDB ID: 4CKR).	12836	12854
24768818	This inhibitor binds the DFG-out conformation of DDR1 in a similar fashion to imatinib.	12855	12942
24768818	The carbonyl of its indolin-2-one head group forms a hydrogen bond with Met704 in the hinge, similar to the interactions of imatinib and ponatinib (Fig.	12943	13095
24768818	7b).	13096	13100
24768818	However, the ether bridge of DDR1-IN-1 eliminates the hydrogen bond to the gatekeeper residue Thr701.	13101	13202
24768818	Similar binding interactions are also observed across the tail region of DDR1-IN-1 (Fig.	13203	13291
24768818	7c), where the trifluoromethyl groups of both DDR1-IN-1 and ponatinib occupy the same hydrophobic pocket created by the flip of the DFG motif.	13292	13434
24768818	To rationalize why DDR1-IN-1 is selective for DDR1 (IC50 = 105 nM) relative to ABL (IC50 = 1.8 μM), we modeled the DDR1 co-crystal structure (PDB ID: 4CKR) onto the ABL–imatinib complex (PDB ID: 2HYY).	13435	13636
24768818	While the overall binding modes of the two inhibitors are predicted to be similar, one notable difference is that the ether bridge of DDR1-IN-1 adopts a different dihedral angle relative to the aniline NH of imatinib (Fig.	13637	13859
24768818	7b).	13096	13100
24768818	As a result, the indolin-2-one head group of DDR1-IN-1 is orientated away from the ABL P-loop disrupting critical hydrophobic interactions with ABL Tyr253 and the hydrogen bond to the gatekeeper threonine (Fig.	13865	14075
24768818	7d).	14076	14080
24768818	In addition, the hydrogen bond between Met318 in the ABL hinge and the lactam carbonyl of DDR-IN-1 is predicted to be approximately 3.0 Å, which is longer than the 2.6 Å hydrogen bond observed in the DDR1 complex.	14081	14294
24768818	These predictions require examination of an experimental ABL structure with DDR1-IN-1.	14295	14381
24768818	Finally, to investigate the chemical features required in the linker and tail moieties of DDR1-IN-1, we prepared seven analogs and tested their ability alongside imatinib and ponatinib to inhibit DDR1 and DDR2 kinase activity (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig.	14382	14639
24768818	S2).	14640	14644
24768818	Ponatinib potently inhibited both DDR kinases with an IC50 of 9 nM.	14645	14712
24768818	Inhibition by imatinib was slightly weaker with DDR1 and DDR2 exhibiting IC50 values of 41 and 71 nM, respectively.	14713	14828
24768818	DDR1-IN-1 also retained significant activity against DDR1 (IC50 = 105 nM) despite the loss of the hydrogen bond to Thr701 and a reduction in the π–π stacking interaction that is observed between Phe785 and imatinib.	14829	15044
24768818	We found that potency against the DDR kinases was decreased slightly when the amide between the linker and tail moieties was replaced with urea (1).	15045	15193
24768818	Replacement of the methylpiperazine with an ether-linked methylpiperidine (2) resulted in a compound that retained the potency of DDR1-IN-1.	15194	15334
24768818	Switching to a 3,5-substitution pattern (3,4) resulted in a slight decrease in potency relative to the 3,4-substitution pattern of DDR1-IN-1.	15335	15476
24768818	Deletion of the methylpiperazine was tolerated when a hydrophobic 3-position substituent was maintained (5).	15477	15585
24768818	Removal of the trifluoromethyl group resulted in analogs (6,7) that were inactive suggesting that a hydrophobic interaction near the DFG motif is likely essential for DDR1-IN-1.	15586	15763
24768818	The structures presented here were solved at high resolution and show in detail how DDR1 achieves high affinity for imatinib and ponatinib, respectively.	15764	15917
24768818	Both type II inhibitors bind in their more potent extended conformations to the inactive DFG-out conformation of the kinase domain.	15918	16049
24768818	Differences to ABL are observed primarily in the P-loop, where DDR1 adopts the active conformation common to the KIT–imatinib complex (KIT, mast/stem cell growth factor receptor).	16050	16229
24768818	As a result, residues in the DDR1 P-loop that confer drug resistance when introduced in ABL are solvent exposed and tolerated.	16230	16356
24768818	DDR1 also assembles a cage-like structure around the inhibitor pocket by tethering the activation segment to the αD helix.	16357	16479
24768818	This alternative loop arrangement stabilizes the DFG-out conformation of DDR1 and establishes a distinct packing from other structures.	16480	16615
24768818	This conformation is exploited by the first DDR1-selective type II inhibitors that carry variant head and linker moieties that restrict interaction with the gatekeeper residue.	16616	16792
24768818	Interestingly, the ether bridge of DDR1-IN-1 is also found in the MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) inhibitor LY2801653, which has entered clinical trials for advanced cancer and inhibits DDR1 with IC50 and EC50 values of less than 1 nM.	16793	17036
24768818	Imatinib-mediated inhibition of breakpoint cluster region-ABL has shown remarkable safety and efficacy against CML.	17037	17152
24768818	Perhaps more significantly, the recognition of imatinib activity against other kinases, notably KIT and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), has led to its effective use in other oncology indications and ongoing clinical trials in fibrosis.	17153	17405
24768818	Collagen-induced activation of the RTKs DDR1 and DDR2 is similarly observed in fibrotic diseases and neoplastic tissue suggesting that DDR inhibition may be a beneficial off-target effect.	17406	17594
24768818	Furthermore, ponatinib and dasatinib show potent activity against mutant DDR2 in models of squamous cell lung cancer and indeed dasatinib has entered clinical trials for this indication.	17595	17781
24768818	DDR kinases share a conserved threonine gatekeeper residue with ABL and are therefore likely to remain susceptible to drug resistance mutations at this site.	17782	17939
24768818	The aminopyrimidine head group of imatinib is hydrogen bonded to the gatekeeper Thr701 in DDR1 analogous to its interaction with the gatekeeper Thr315 in ABL.	17940	18098
24768818	In CML, mutation of the gatekeeper Thr315 to Ile confers drug resistance, suggesting that an analogous mutation in DDR1 and DDR2 would also confer resistance to imatinib.	18099	18269
24768818	Ponatinib overcomes drug resistance arising from the gatekeeper position but acquires reduced selectivity and increased off-target effects.	18270	18409
24768818	Interesting in this respect is the ponatinib molecule that stabilizes the crystallographic dimer in the kinase–inhibitor complex.	18410	18539
24768818	While we have not investigated this effect in solution, it may be of relevance for the full-length DDR1 and DDR2 receptors, which form constitutive homodimers at the cell surface.	18540	18719
24768818	It may therefore be of interest in the future to screen this allosteric site against a library of ponatinib derivatives to identify compounds that stabilize this inactive kinase conformation.	18720	18911
24768818	In summary, we report the crystal structures of the human DDR1 kinase domain in complex with two clinically relevant kinase inhibitors and identify structural features that determine the binding of DDR-selective inhibitors.	18912	19135
24768818	The high affinity of these interactions supports the potential use of these molecules to control excessive DDR signaling in diseases such as inflammation, fibrosis and lung cancer.	19136	19316

24853300	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive decline of cognition and memory.	0	122
24853300	The major hallmarks of AD include senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.1 The amyloid hypothesis suggests that amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) accumulation is neurotoxic to the cells in the brain regions that have critical roles in learning and memory, including the hippocampus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex and basal forebrain.2 In addition to the accumulation of Aβ and tau, several neurodegenerative processes of AD in the early stage are accompanied by calcium dysregulation, neuronal death, and mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction.2, 3 Specifically, disrupted calcium homeostasis has been reported in the brains of AD patients and normal aged subjects.4, 5 Altered levels of calcium (Ca2+)-binding proteins could result in impaired Ca2+ homeostasis in pathological conditions and disrupted Ca2+ signaling, thereby leading to loss of synapses and then dysfunctions of the neural network.6 We hypothesized that altered expression of a specific Ca2+-binding protein may affect a variety of AD-like pathologies in 5 familial AD mutations (5XFAD) mouse (Tg) brains, in an animal model of AD.	123	1214
24853300	Ca2+-binding proteins maintain calcium homeostasis by buffering excessive intracellular levels of free calcium.	1215	1326
24853300	Calbindin-D28k (CB) is one of the major calcium-binding proteins that buffer the Ca2+ level and transport Ca2+.7 CB is abundant throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and has been used extensively as a marker of neuronal sub-populations for anatomical and developmental studies.	1327	1610
24853300	Moreover, CB has been shown to block multiple pro-apoptotic pathways.	1611	1680
24853300	For example, overexpression of CB inhibited apoptotic activities induced by Aβ and mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) in glial and neuronal cells8, 9 and bax or caspase-3-related apoptotic signaling was increased in uteri of CB knock-out (CBKO) mice.10 It has been reported that the deficits of learning in mice expressing the familial AD-mutant hAPP correlated strongly with decreased levels of CB in the dentate gyrus of the brain.11 Furthermore, homozygous CBKO mice displayed impairments in motor coordination and activity.12, 13 However, whether reduced CB levels in animal models of AD could influence AD pathologies has not been extensively investigated.	1681	2333
24853300	To obtain better insights into the pathological significance of these alterations in vivo, we generated CB-deficient AD transgenic mice (CBKOTg) and profiled the changes in abundance of proteins and levels of phosphorylation of hundreds of signaling proteins using antibody microarray and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.	2334	2655
24853300	From these protein and phosphorylation profiles, we found that the depletion of CB in Tg mice brain elicited significant alterations in cell death pathways, synaptic transmission, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and cytoskeleton organization.	2656	2916
24853300	These results revealed that the removal of CB in Tg mice caused apoptotic features, alteration of mitochondrial dynamic proteins, impaired N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA)-dependent signaling and decreased synaptic proteins levels at 6 months of age.	2917	3171
24853300	To summarize, we have first shown, in vivo, that the removal of CB in Tg mice may be responsible for aggravating the apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic alteration on the pathogenesis of AD.	3172	3373
24853300	In order to examine the effect of CBKO on AD pathology, we first crossed homozygous CBKO mice with hemizygous Tg and validated production of Tg and homozygous CBKOTg by crossing F1 generation of heterozygous CBKOTg mice.	3374	3594
24853300	To verify each individual, genomic DNA was then isolated and PCR was performed using primers that span targeted regions of APP, PS1 and CB genes (Figure 1a).	3595	3752
24853300	Based on these results, Tg and CBKOTg mice were identified.	3753	3812
24853300	In young mice, plaques first appeared and amyloid deposits spread to fill much of the subiculum.14 CB is widely distributed in the mammalian CNS, including human brains.7 To confirm the effects of CBKO in the subiculum, we isolated the subiculum (white dotted line) of Tg and CBKOTg mice by an optical microscope (Figure 1b).	3813	4138
24853300	To determine the protein level of APP, PS1 and CB expression, the offspring of Tg and CBKOTg mice were analyzed and the subiculum homogenates were prepared for immunoblot analysis with anti-APP (6E10), anti-PS1NT and anti-CB antibodies (Figure 1c).	4139	4387
24853300	We also confirmed the presence of CB and plaque formation in the subiculum of Tg mice, but the absence of CB and the presence of plaque formation in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1d).	4388	4602
24853300	Taken together, these data showed that all transgenic mice have a number of plaques and mice lacking CB showed a complete depletion of CB in the subiculum with no apparent difference in phenotype.	4603	4799
24853300	Several studies have shown that the density of CB-expressing cells correlates inversely with plaque burden in AD brains.15, 16 To assess whether CB depletion in Tg brains affects Aβ generation, we performed western analysis, ELISA and immunohistochemistry in the subiculum of each individual.	4800	5092
24853300	Western blot using anti-Aβ antibody (6E10) showed that ∼4 kDa bands (monomer form of Aβ) were not significantly altered in CBKOTg mice by CB deletion compared with Tg mice (Figures 2a and b).	5093	5284
24853300	Moreover, ELISA of insoluble subiculum fractions showed no difference in the amounts of Aβ42 between Tg and CBKOTg mice (Figure 2c).	5285	5417
24853300	Immunohistochemistry for senile plaque in the subiculum, in which the plaque burden was visualized in brain sections using anti-Aβ-specific antibody (4G8), showed that the subiculum lacking CB expression failed to increase total Aβ plaque burden in Tg mice (Figures 2d and e).	5418	5694
24853300	Consistent with these results, plaque burden did not change in cortical area in both Tg and CBKOTg mice (Supplementary Figure S1).	5695	5825
24853300	These findings are consistent with the results of ELISA using insoluble fractions between Tg and CBKOTg, indicating that the effect of CB depletion on amyloid pathology was independent of both generation and deposition of Aβ.	5826	6051
24853300	To examine proteins affected by CB deficiency, we used antibody microarrays to measure abundances of 244 proteins and then to compare their abundances between 6-month-old Tg and CBKOTg subiculum.	6052	6247
24853300	Among 244 proteins, 31 were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the Tg and CBKOTg subiculum (Supplementary Materials and methods; Supplementary Table S1).	6248	6429
24853300	Of the 31 DEPs, 13 increased in their abundances in the CBKOTg subiculum, whereas 18 decreased.	6430	6525
24853300	In particular, p35, PKB/AKT and caspase-3, which are involved in the induction of apoptosis, increased in CBKOTg mice, compared with Tg mice, while anti-apoptosis-related NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light chain-enhancer of activated B cells) decreased (Table 1).	6526	6788
24853300	Moreover, neurofilament 200 and dystrophin, which are involved in organization of cell projection and cytoskeleton, decreased, indicating alteration of cytoskeleton in CBKOTg.	6789	6964
24853300	These results were also supported by western analysis (Supplementary Figure S2).	6965	7045
24853300	To further globally investigate the proteome affected by CB deficiency, liquid-chromatography-MS (LC-MS)/MS analysis was performed for the subiculum tissues of Tg and CBKOTg mice.	7046	7225
24853300	From the samples of Tg and CBKOTg, 3840 and 3970 proteins (a total 4546 proteins) were identified, respectively (Figure 3a).	7226	7350
24853300	Among them, 3264 were shared.	7351	7380
24853300	Among the total 4546 proteins, 269 were selected as DEPs (5.92%, Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Materials and methods).	7381	7507
24853300	The enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology biological processes (GOBPs) shows that the DEPs are mainly involved in the regulation of apoptosis, synaptic transmission, negative regulation of MAPK activity and mitochondrial fragmentation (Figure 3b; Supplementary Table S3; Supplementary Materials and methods).	7508	7815
24853300	In addition, cytoskeleton organization, synaptic plasticity, cell cycle and small GTPase-mediated signal transduction also are perturbed in CBKOTg mice compared with Tg mice.	7816	7990
24853300	Although there has been little demonstration of neuronal loss in APP transgenic mouse models,17, 18 a recent study showed that 5XFAD mice exhibited extensive neuronal loss by increasing Aβ42 accumulation in cortical layer 5 and the subiculum.14 Therefore, the role of CB in the neuronal loss was examined in CBKOTg mice using immunohistochemistry of brain sections among nontransgenic littermates, Tg and CBKOTg mice at 6-month-old age with anti-NeuN antibody, a neuronal marker protein.	7991	8478
24853300	We observed that NeuN-positive cells in the subiculum were visibly reduced in Tg mice compared with littermates (Figure 4a), in agreement with the previous finding.14 NeuN-positive cells in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice were significantly far fewer and scarcer, compared with both littermate and Tg mice (Figure 4b).	8479	8794
24853300	To confirm whether the neuronal loss in CBKOTg mice is worse than in Tg mice, we examined NeuN-positive cells at 1.5, 3 and 6-month-old age, respectively.	8795	8949
24853300	Although NeuN-positive cells did not differ between Tg and CBKOTg mice at 1.5-month-old age, NeuN-positive cells of CBKOTg mice from 3 months were seen significantly less than that of CBKOTg mice from 1.5-month-old age (Figures 4c and d).	8950	9188
24853300	Together, these findings suggest that CB expression could have an important role in preventing the Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and also in maintaining neuronal survival.	9189	9355
24853300	It was previously shown that mRNA and protein levels of CB were decreased in brains of AD patients and AD mice, respectively.11, 19 CB overexpression has been reported to block apoptotic cell death in lymphocytes, glial cells and the uteri.9, 10, 20 However, there is no direct evidence that CB has a role in neuronal apoptosis in AD.	9356	9690
24853300	To address this question, CBKOTg is one of the best models to show the role of CB in neuronal apoptosis in the brains of Tg mice.	9691	9820
24853300	The proteomic analyses above revealed that CB deficiency in CBKOTg mice increased significantly the expression of the proteins involved in induction of apoptosis (Figure 3b; Table 1).	9821	10004
24853300	We investigated whether the expression of apoptosis-related genes is affected by CB depletion in Tg.	10005	10105
24853300	Interestingly, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression levels were reduced in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice compared with Tg mice (Figures 5a and b).	10106	10242
24853300	There was no significant change in Bax level.	10243	10288
24853300	The release of cytochrome c (CytC) is tightly controlled by proteins of the Bcl-2 family in the apoptosis pathway.21 Thus, the release of CytC was then measured by ELISA.	10289	10459
24853300	We detected a significant increase of CytC in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice (Figure 5c).	10460	10547
24853300	In addition, significantly higher levels of activated caspase 9 and 3 proteins were detected in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice (Figures 5d and e).	10548	10692
24853300	To examine quantitatively whether apoptosis occurs in subiculum cells of both Tg and CBKOTg mice, apoptotic cells were assessed by FACS analysis after FITC-annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining.	10693	10890
24853300	Both early (annexin V-positive, PI-negative) and late (annexin/PI-double positive) apoptotic cells were increased in CBKOTg mice than Tg mice, suggesting that CB may have a critical role in cells vulnerable to apoptosis in Tg mice (Figure 5f).	10891	11134
24853300	These results indicate that apoptotic features increased in response to CB depletion in Tg mice.	11135	11231
24853300	Several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to AD pathogenesis in the brains of transgenic animal models and patients,22, 23 during apoptosis, mitochondria are key organelles that sense and amplify damage24 and are vital for Ca2+ buffering and signal transduction, as well as stress-induced cell death.25 Also, our proteomic analysis revealed that CB deficiency changed the expression of the proteins involved in mitochondrial fragmentation (Figure 3b).	11232	11718
24853300	Thus, the structure of mitochondria in the brains of AD mouse models was revealed by EM in previous studies.26 An EM study to examine the morphological changes of mitochondria in the subiculum of both Tg and CBKOTg mice showed severe cristae disruption like a hole as one of the apoptotic features in CBKOTg mice (Figure 6a).	11719	12044
24853300	The percentage of elongated and round mitochondria was identified and calculated in each mouse group, and CBKOTg mice showed significantly lower percentage of elongated mitochondria, compared with Tg mice (Figure 6b).	12045	12262
24853300	Moreover, the length of cristae in CBKOTg mice appeared to be significantly shorter than that in Tg mice (Figure 6c), suggesting that CB may have a role in mitochondrial morphology in CBKOTg mice.	12263	12459
24853300	Alzheimer's pathology is accompanied by an expression change of the proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics.27, 28 Expression of mitochondrial proteins (dynamin-1-like protein (Drp1), mitochondrial fission 1 protein (Fis1), mitofusin-1 (Mfn1) and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1)) was detected by western blot analysis (Figure 6d).	12460	12839
24853300	Drp-1 protein expression was significantly higher in CBKOTg mice than Tg mice.	12840	12918
24853300	The level of Fis1 also tended to increase in the CBKOTg mice although this difference was statistically marginal (Figure 6e).	12919	13044
24853300	The level of Mfn1 did not differ between Tg and CBKOTg mice.	13045	13105
24853300	Opa-1 was less in CBKOTg mice than in Tg mice (Figure 6f).	13106	13164
24853300	These results suggest that CB depletion from Tg mice contributes to the alteration of mitochondrial structure by damaging the mitochondrial cristae and disturbing mitochondrial dynamic remodeling.	13165	13361
24853300	Our proteomic analysis revealed that CB deficiency changed the expression of the proteins involved in regulation of Ca2+ transport and calcium-mediated signaling (Figure 3b).	13362	13536
24853300	Regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration is crucial for synaptic plasticity and long-term memory function.29 Aβ1–42 accumulation in brain regions may exacerbate age-related declines in Ca2+ regulation that can lead to neuronal dysfunction and subsequent neurodegeneration.30 The induction of LTP in hippocampal slices requires the activation of NMDA receptors and mice with reduced CB expression show declines in memory and hippocampal LTP.31, 32 To determine whether the effects of changes in NMDA activity on learning and memory may be mediated by CB depletion, we measured the levels of NMDA receptors, synaptic molecules, in the subiculum of both Tg and CBKOTg mice.	13537	14213
24853300	The levels of NMDA receptor 1 (NR1) and NMDA receptor 2A (NR2A) decreased in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice (Figures 7a and b).	14214	14339
24853300	We also examined whether reductions of NR1 and NR2A, secondary to CB depletion from Tg mice, would affect NMDA receptor-mediated signaling pathways.	14340	14488
24853300	In particular, the activation/phosphorylation of ERK is regarded as a key biochemical event in cognition.	14489	14594
24853300	Our proteomic analysis also showed that CB deficiency changed the expression of the proteins involved in regulation of MAPK pathway (Figure 3b).	14595	14739
24853300	The ERK activation leads to activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor linked to the formation of long-term memory.33 Especially, NMDA receptors enhance learning and memory through the activation of CREB by phosphorylation at serine 133.34 The levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and CREB at serine 133 significantly decreased in CBKOTg mice, compared with Tg mice (Figures 7a and c), whereas the levels of total ERK1/2 and CREB showed no change.	14740	15222
24853300	We found that the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated CREB decreased in neurons of CBKOTg subiculum, compared with those in Tg mice (Figure 7d).	15223	15366
24853300	Merged images of anti-NeuN and anti-pCREB stainings showed decreased yellow fluorescence in CBKOTg mice, and these images were quantified based on the fluorescence intensity (Figure 7e), suggesting that CREB inactivation is enhanced by CB depletion.	15367	15616
24853300	To investigate whether CB depletion has any additive effects on the levels of synaptic proteins, we measured the levels of PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the subiculum of both CBKOTg and Tg mice.	15617	15809
24853300	PSD-95 levels were reduced by 15% in CBKOTg mice and synaptophysin levels also decreased in the subiculum of CBKOTg by 24%, compared with Tg mice (Figures 7f and g).	15810	15975
24853300	These data provide evidence that CB depletion has an important role in regulating of synaptic transmission and plasticity in Tg mice.	15976	16109
24853300	The pathological features of AD have been reported to include Aβ deposition, disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis, cell death and reduction of synaptic proteins.	16110	16261
24853300	In this study, we have demonstrated that CB depletion contributes to Aβ-induced apoptosis and neurodegenerative changes in the brains of AD animal model.	16262	16415
24853300	These results are consistent with earlier report that CB protein levels were markedly reduced in human AD brains and rodent AD model brains.11 To test the hypothesis that the removal of CB from 5XFAD mice may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, we generated CBKO AD transgenic mice (CBKOTg) as an in vivo experimental model with depleted CB expression (Figure 1).	16416	16781
24853300	Pasti et al.35 demonstrated that inhibition of CB expression lead to prolonged increase of intraneuronal Ca2+ after NMDA or potassium stimulation of hippocampal slices.35 Greene et al.36 showed that CB-expressing cells in the brain of AD patients were unaffected by and resistant to degeneration.36 As a consequence of CB deficiency in the brains of Tg mice, we first demonstrated significant alterations in cell death pathways, synaptic transmission and MAPK signaling pathways from our initial antibody array analysis (Table 1).	16782	17312
24853300	By MS, functional enrichment analysis also showed that the DEPs between both Tg and CBKOTg mice were significantly involved in apoptosis induction, synaptic transmission, MAPK activity and mitochondrial dysfunction (Figure 3).	17313	17539
24853300	Based on these analyses, we have provided compelling evidence that CB depletion could alter pathological features of AD, independent of Aβ generation, evidenced from both biochemical experiments and immunohistochemistry.	17540	17760
24853300	Although there was no difference in Aβ accumulation between Tg and CBKOTg mice, severe neuronal loss was found in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice, compared with that of Tg mice.	17761	17935
24853300	Greater atrophy in the subiculum is associated with increased risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD.37 We also found that anti-apoptotic proteins, such as bcl-2 and bcl-xL, significantly decreased and the release of CytC with activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 increased in the brains of CBKOTg mice.	17936	18257
24853300	In addition, FACS analysis showed that both early (annexin V-positive, PI-negative) and late (annexin/PI-double positive) apoptotic cells increased in CBKOTg mice, compared with Tg mice (Figure 5).	18258	18455
24853300	These findings are consistent to earlier reports that CB protects against apoptotic cell death brought on by Aβ in both neuronal and glial cells, and that bax and caspase-3 proteins are upregulated by CBKO in the murine uterus.8, 9, 10 Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that CB expression may contribute to neuronal survival in Tg mice.	18456	18797
24853300	During apoptosis, remodeling of the mitochondrial cristae is accompanied by fragmentation of the mitochondria network.21, 38 The EM images showed that mitochondria of CBKOTg mice represent fragmentation and cristae disruption compared with Tg mice.	18798	19046
24853300	Currently, it is believed that the overall shape of mitochondria is controlled by the balance between fusion and fission events that are mediated by specific proteins.39 Defects in mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins are associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.40 Interestingly, protein levels of both Drp1 and OPA1, one of the fission and fusion proteins, were significantly altered in CBKOTg mice compared with Tg mice (Figures 3 and 6), suggesting that the altered mitochondrial dynamics affects mitochondrial morphology as well as their functions, which lead to neuronal apoptosis in CBKOTg mice.	19047	19672
24853300	The integrity of mitochondrial cristae during apoptosis is maintained not only by Opa1, but also by the genetic inhibition of Drp1.41 Thus, the altered Drp1 and Opa1 protein levels of CBKOTg mice support cristae disruption.	19673	19896
24853300	Although the inhibition of CB expression impaired water maze learning in antisense for CB transgenic mice,32 whether CB depletion affects the mechanism associated with memory function has not been determined.	19897	20105
24853300	The NMDA receptors consisting of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits are well-known key molecules for regulating memory function and synaptic plasticity.42 Protein levels of NR1 and NR2A are reduced in the brains of CBKOTg mice, compared with Tg mice.	20106	20350
24853300	ERK1 and ERK2 are highly expressed in the adult mammalian CNS, and their activation relies on Ca2+ influx via the NMDA receptor, which is regarded as a key biochemical event in cognition through activation of CREB.33, 43, 44 Activation of both ERK1/2 and CREB was decreased by the removal of CB in the brains of Tg mice (Figures 7a and c).	20351	20690
24853300	We also confirmed that immunohistochemical staining of brain sections for phosphorylated CREB revealed a decrease in subiculum neurons of CBKOTg mice, compared with those in Tg mice (Figures 7d and e).	20691	20892
24853300	These results raise the possibility that CB depletion contributes to neuronal deficits and cognitive dysfunction in Tg mouse models, and persistent mitochondrial fission could lead to synaptic damage, bioenergetic failure and subsequent neurodegeneration.45, 46 Another interesting finding in this study is the influence of CB on synaptic protein levels.	20893	21247
24853300	Loss of synaptic function is a key characteristic of AD progression, because it is directly linked with cognitive impairment.47 A growing body of evidence that CB is an important regulator of synapses has been reported.	21248	21467
24853300	First, CB is expressed in distinct cell types throughout the CNS, buffers intracellular Ca2+ and modifies synaptic functions in neurons.7 Second, overexpression of CB has been shown to increase neuronal differentiation and neurite growth.48 Finally, recent evidence suggests that CB binds directly to caspase-3 and inhibits its activity in osteoblasts, and caspase-3 then triggers early synaptic dysfunction in a Tg2576 AD mouse model.49, 50 We have found decreased protein levels of PSD95 and synaptophysin, the presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins (Figures 7f and g).	21468	22038
24853300	Therefore, the alterations in both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins imply that CB depletion may be important in the regulation of synapse formation.	22039	22192
24853300	In summary, we have revealed for the first time that CB has a critical role in vivo in the apoptotic features, including mitochondria alteration as well as loss of synaptic proteins, in a AD mouse model.	22193	22396
24853300	Our findings suggest that the CB depletion may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of AD by exacerbating neuronal loss, apoptotic cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic loss.	22397	22595
24853300	Female transgenic mice with 5XFAD were purchased from Jackson Lab (Bar harbor, ME, USA).	22596	22684
24853300	These mice co-express and co-inherit FAD mutant forms of human APP (Swedish mutation: K670N, M671L; Florida mutation: I716V and London mutation: V717I) and PS1 (M146L; L286V) transgenes under transcriptional control of the neuron-specific mouse Thy1 promoter.14, 51 Heterozygous Tg transgenic mice (B6/SJL hybrid background) were cross-bred with CB homozygous knockout (CBKO) mice.12 The resultant F1 heterozygous CB+/− Tg mice were further intercrossed, yielding animals with four different genotypes (wild-type, Tg, CBKO·WT and CBKOTg) in the F2 progeny.	22685	23241
24853300	All experiments were done with these mice at 6 months of age.	23242	23303
24853300	Subiculum tissues were rapidly excised from the brains of the killed mice by using optical microscopy for protein isolation.	23304	23428
24853300	Some subiculum tissues were fixed in cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy (EM).	23429	23520
24853300	Animal treatment and maintenance were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication No.85-23, 1985 edition) and the Animal Care and Use Guidelines of Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.	23521	23766
24853300	All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of mice used.	23767	23856
24853300	CBKO mice were provided by Professor Sukho Lee (Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea).	23857	23967
24853300	Genomic DNA was obtained from the ears by digestion buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 20 mg/ml Proteinase K) at 55 °C for 2 h, followed by phenol and isopropanol.	23968	24159
24853300	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with a separate set of primers designed for each allele to distinguish the CB WT from CB mutant alleles.	24160	24310
24853300	The oligonucleotide primers designed for the CB WT allele were as follows: upstream, 5′-TCCCTCACCTAGAGATAGAAGCAGCGCAG-3′ downstream, 5′-AGACAGCAGAATCGAGGAGTCTGCTGCTC-3′.	24311	24480
24853300	The oligonucleotide primers designed for the CB mutant allele were as follows: upstream, 5′-TCCCTCACCTAGAGATAGAAGCAGCGCAG-3′ downstream, 5′-GCTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACTGCCTTGG-3′.	24481	24654
24853300	The size of the WT PCR product was 254 bp and the mutant PCR product was 192 bp.	24655	24735
24853300	For immunohistochemistry, WT, Tg, CBKO·WT and CBKOTg (n=4 each) mice were killed at 6 months of age.	24736	24836
24853300	Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of Zoletil 50 (Virbac, Carros, France) and Rompun (Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea) solution (3 : 1 ratio, 1 ml/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with a freshly prepared solution of 4% PFA in PBS.	24837	25069
24853300	After the mice were decapitated, brains were dissected from the skull.	25070	25140
24853300	Serial 30-μm thick coronal tissue sections were cut using a freezing microtome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany).	25141	25247
24853300	Free-floating sections were incubated with the following the primary antibodies; biotin-labeled 4G8 (1 : 700; Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA), rabbit anti-CB (1 : 3000; Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland), mouse anti-neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) antibody (1 : 2000; Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) and rabbit anti-phospho-CREB Ser 133 antibody (1 : 800; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) overnight at 4 °C.	25248	25668
24853300	After washes in PBS, the sections were incubated with the following secondary antibodies; Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (1 : 1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (1 : 1000; Invitrogen and donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 antibody (1 : 1000; Invitrogen) for 2 h. All sections were counterstained with DAPI (4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) before mounting and analyzed on a confocal laser scanning microscopy (FluoView FV 10i; OLYMPUS, Center Valley, PA, USA).	25669	26159
24853300	Subiculum extracts of 6-month-old Tg and CBKOTg mice (n=3 each) were subjected to Panorama Antibody Microarray Cell Signaling (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) analysis consisting of 224 different antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions.	26160	26415
24853300	Briefly, Cy3 and Cy5 dye (Amersham, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) were attached to proteins extracted from Tg and CBKOTg mice.	26416	26550
24853300	Next, equal amounts of labeled proteins from Tg and CBKOTg subiculum were mixed together and hybridized to antibody microarrays.	26551	26679
24853300	After washing, the microarrays were scanned at wavelengths of 532 nm (Cy3) and 635 nm (Cy5) to detect signals using a GenePix4008B Scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and data were analyzed by GenePix software (Molecular Devices).	26680	26923
24853300	Lowess normalization was performed for four signals of each protein.52 Normalized signals for four replicates of one protein between CBKOTg and Tg mice were compared to identify DEPs using an integrative statistical testing method53 in which adjusted P-values for each protein were calculated using both Student's t-tests and median fold-change test and then combined to compute overall P-values using Stouffer's method.54 Proteins with overall P-values <0.1, P-values of t-test <0.05 and P-values of median fold test <0.05 were selected as DEPs by the depletion of CB.	26924	27493
24853300	Hippocampal subiculum tissue lysates were prepared by sonication followed by solubilization in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).	27494	27776
24853300	Protein concentrations were measured using a Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).	27777	27889
24853300	Solubilized proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), fractionated by SDS-PAGE (4–12% Bis-Tris Gel, Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma-Aldrich).	27890	28074
24853300	Protein gel regions were cut and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion following the general protocol.55 Briefly, protein gels were excised, destained and washed.	28075	28237
24853300	Proteins were reduced with 20 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide.	28238	28325
24853300	After dehydration with acetonitrile, the proteins were digested with 13 ng/μl sequencing grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C.	28326	28523
24853300	Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 5% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid.	28524	28674
24853300	The eluates were dried under vacuum and stored at −20 °C until used.	28675	28743
24853300	Peptides isolated from the in-gel digestion were resuspended in 50 μl of solvent A (2% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) and 2 μl of sample was injected into nano-HPLC system (Easy nLC; Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) and LTQ-Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).	28744	29034
24853300	The sample was loaded onto an in-house packed 75 μm (inner diameter) × 10 cm C18 column and separated with a linear gradient of 2–38% solvent B (98% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) for 90 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min.	29035	29258
24853300	Standard mass spectrometric condition of the spray voltage was set to 1.9 kV and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 325 °C.	29259	29398
24853300	The LTQ was operated in data-dependent mode with one survey MS scan at the mass range 400–1400 m/z and followed by five MS/MS scans.	29399	29531
24853300	Precursor ions were dynamically excluded for a period of 30 s. LC-MS/MS raw data were searched by SEQUEST algorithm against forward–reverse ipi.MOUSE.v3.87 using the following parameters: 1.5 Da precursor mass tolerance; 1.0 Da product ion mass tolerance; semitryptic digestion; up to two missed cleavages; variable modifications: oxidation of methionine (+15.99); fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.02).	29532	29960
24853300	The SEQUEST search results were evaluated by computing the probability for each identified peptide using TPP v.4.5b.56 Peptides with false discovery rate <0.005 were regarded as reliably identified peptides and matched to proteins using the ProteinProphet software.57 Proteins with the protein probability ≥0.9 were regarded as reliably identified proteins and quantified using a spectral count-based method proposed by Fu et al.58 For each protein, the spectral counts between CBKOTg and Tg mice were compared to compute a spectral index (SPI), a measure of fold-change of the spectral counts, as described in Fu et al.58 To assess the statistical significance of a SPI value for each protein, an empirical distribution of SPI was estimated by performing 1000 random permutation experiments.	29961	30753
24853300	For a SPI value for each protein, P-value was computed by a two- tailed test using the empirical distribution.	30754	30864
24853300	Proteins with (1) SPI P-value <0.05 and (2) the number of identified unique peptides ≥2 in one of Tg and CBKOTg mice were identified as DEPs.	30865	31006

25983002	Although great advances in medical management and screening, prostate cancer (PC) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in men.	0	140
25983002	About 15 % of prostates contain islands of cancer at the age of 50 and nearly 100 % by 80.	141	231
25983002	Nowadays, the chief treatment for PC is androgen deprivation therapy; however, patients on this regime eventually relapse into hormone-refractory prostate cancer.	232	394
25983002	An enhanced tumor microenvironment that favors tumor progression is formed during the critical switch of PC to androgen independence and distant metastasis.	395	551
25983002	Therefore, it is urgent to identify key signaling events driving the tumor microenvironment to find novel therapeutic targets for PC.	552	685
25983002	Cancer cells take up glucose and transform it to lactate even under aerobic conditions, known as the Warburg effect.	686	802
25983002	Sufficient amounts of nucleotides, proteins, and lipids derived from this type of glucose metabolism are required for cancer cell rapid growth and division.	803	959
25983002	Critical to this highly glycolytic phenotype is lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which catalyses the last step of anaerobic glycolysis.	960	1094
25983002	Abnormally expression of LDHA has been observed in many human cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer.	1095	1237
25983002	Inhibition of LDHA reduced cell malignant transformation and remarkably delayed tumor formation, indicating that the underlying role of LDHA in tumor initiation or maintenance.	1238	1414
25983002	Several mechanisms by which LDHA suppression induces inhibition of tumor progression are revealed.	1415	1513
25983002	In lymphoma, reduction of LDHA induces oxidative stress and alters cellular energy metabolism, which ultimately contributes to cell death.	1514	1652
25983002	In breast cancer, LDHA knockdown suppresses tumorigenicity through induction of oxidative stress mediated mitochondrial pathway apoptosis.	1653	1791
25983002	In PC, overexpressed lactate dehydrogenase 5 isoenzyme has been reported and confers prostate cancer with resistance of to radiotherapy.	1792	1928
25983002	However, little is known the expression pattern of LDHA and its underlying roles in PC.	1929	2016

25983002	Migrated and invaded were fixed and stained by 0.1 % (w/v) crystal violet.	6018	6092
25983002	Each experiment was performed in triplicate.	6093	6137
25983002	Cell viability was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo, Japan) following the manufacturer’s protocols.	6138	6253
25983002	Briefly, 3000 cells were resuspended and seeded into a 96-well plate supplemented in the presence of 10 % FBS and cultured overnight.	6254	6387
25983002	The next day, the LDHA knockdown cells or FX11-treated cells was incubated with CCK8 for 1 h and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a multifunctional microplate reader (Tecan).	6388	6573
25983002	This experiment was done in quadruplicate cells.	6574	6622
25983002	Cells under apoptotic condition were analyzed by Annexin V/PI staining.	6623	6694

Then, cells were harvested and labeled with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (BD Pharmingen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.	6695	7001
25983002	The apoptotic cells were measured by flow cytometry.	7002	7054
25983002	The caspase-3/7 activity assay was performed at 48 h after serum deprivation according to manufacturer’s instructions (Promega) Cells were cultured in fresh phenol red-free media and the culture media were collected in the first 24 h after siRNA or FX11 treatment.	7055	7319

25983002	The lactate and glucose levels were measured by using lactate assay kits (Biovision) or glucose assay kits (Life Technologies), respectively.	7411	7552
25983002	Data were presented as the means ± standard error of the mean (SEM).	7553	7621
25983002	Statistical analyses and graphical representations were performed with SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5 (San Diego, CA) software.	7622	7775
25983002	Cell viability assay was analyzed by one-way ANOVA.	7776	7827
25983002	And, the Student’s t test was used for comparison between groups in other data.	7828	7907
25983002	Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.	7908	7969
25983002	To identify the expression pattern of LDHA in PC, a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 64 cases of PC specimens and 11 cases of BPH samples was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining.	7970	8158
25983002	Higher LDHA expression was observed in 75 % (48/64) of PC cases, while 18.2 % (2/11) in BPH cases, the difference was significant (Fig.	8159	8294
25983002	1a, b).	8295	8302
25983002	In addition, 20 cases of PC tissues and 12 cases of BPH tissues were collected to detect messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of LDHA using real-time quantitative PCR.	8303	8465
25983002	We observed that LDHA mRNA expression was significantly elevated in PC tissues in relative to BPH samples (Fig.	8466	8577
25983002	1c).	8578	8582
25983002	And, data from Oncomine database further confirmed this phenomenon.	8583	8650
25983002	As shown in Fig.	8651	8667
25983002	1d, e, although without significant alternations in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, overexpressed LDHA was more commonly observed in prostate cancer.	8668	8822
25983002	Furthermore, the expression level of LDHA in four PC cell lines was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.	8823	8925
25983002	1f).	8926	8930
25983002	To further analyze the possible functions of LDHA in PC, we selected the cell line with higher LDHA expression, PC-3 and DU145 cells, for further investigation.	8931	9091
25983002	The level of endogenous LDHA expression in PC-3 and DU145 cells after targeted siRNA treatment was examined by Western blotting (Fig.	9092	9225
25983002	2a).	9226	9230
25983002	Given that LDHA expression was significantly decreased by siRNA-3 oligos treatment, we chose the siRNA-3 oligos for the next investigation.	9231	9370
25983002	The CCK8 analysis showed that LDHA knockdown cells exhibited significantly reduced cell viability compared with the negative control cells (Fig.	9371	9515
25983002	2b).	9516	9520
25983002	The apoptosis assay showed that cell apoptosis ratio was significantly increased after LDHA was knocked down (Fig.	9521	9635
25983002	2c).	9636	9640
25983002	And, consistent with this, the caspase-3/7 activity was increased by LDHA siRNA treatment (Fig.	9641	9736
25983002	2d).	9737	9741
25983002	Next, to detect whether LDHA has an implication for cancer progression, cell migration and invasion assays were performed.	9742	9864
25983002	Migration assay showed that migrated cells in siRNA-treated group was dramatically decreased in relative to the negative control group (Fig.	9865	10005
25983002	2e).	10006	10010
25983002	In the invasion assay, the invaded cells were also decreased significantly after LDHA knockdown (Fig.	10011	10112
25983002	2f).	10113	10117
25983002	Collectively, these data above demonstrated that LDHA favors tumor growth and metastasis in PC.	10118	10213
25983002	A small-molecule inhibitor, FX11 [3-dihydroxy-6-methyl-7-(phenylmethyl)-4-propylnaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid]), is a competitive inhibitor of LDHA.	10214	10362
25983002	As tumor progression was inhibited by siRNA-mediated LDHA reduction, here, we evaluated the effect of FX11 in PC-3 cells.	10363	10484
25983002	As shown in Fig.	8651	8667
25983002	3a, LDHA expression was not affected by FX11 treatment, indicating that FX11 mainly affect the activities of LDHA.	10502	10616
25983002	Consistent with the results in siRNA-mediated reduction of LDHA, attenuation of LDHA activities by FX11 also resulted in decreased cell viability (Fig.	10617	10768
25983002	3b), increased cell apoptosis (Fig.	10769	10804
25983002	3c), increased caspase-3/7 activity (Fig.	10805	10846
25983002	3d), inhibition of cell migration (Fig.	10847	10886
25983002	3e), and invasion (Fig.	10887	10910
25983002	3f).	10911	10915
25983002	Taken together, these results indicate that decreased LDHA enzyme activity is also involved in the antitumor effect of FX11.	10916	11040
25983002	Since LDHA executes the final step of aerobic glycolysis, we postulated that LDHA-mediated functions in PC may associate with glucose metabolism.	11041	11186
25983002	Expectedly, the lactate level in the culture media was pronounced decreased after siRNA-mediated LDHA knockdown (Fig.	11187	11304
25983002	4a) or FX11 treatment (Fig.	11305	11332
25983002	4b).	11333	11337
25983002	Besides, PC-3 cells also showed decreased glucose consumption after whether siRNA-mediated LDHA knockdown (Fig.	11338	11449
25983002	4c) or FX11 treatment (Fig.	11450	11477
25983002	4d).	11478	11482
25983002	This data indicate that enhanced glycolysis may account for the tumor-suppressive effect of LDHA in PC.	11483	11586
25983002	A critical consequence of altered lactate production and secretion is the acidification of tumor microenvironment, which favors the activation of a series of proteases, including MMP-9, urokinase type plasminogen activator (PLAU), and cathepsin B.	11587	11834
25983002	And, this activation ultimately induces extracellular matrix degradation and facilitates tumor cells to metastasis.	11835	11950
25983002	In our study, expression level of MMP-9, PLAU, and cathepsin B was evaluated after siRNA or FX11 treatment.	11951	12058
25983002	Indeed, MMP-9, PLAU, and cathepsin B expression were remarkably decreased after LDHA knockdown (Fig.	12059	12159
25983002	5a) or FX11 treatment (Fig.	12160	12187
25983002	5b).	12188	12192
25983002	In conclusion, these results support that enhanced acidified microenvironment mediated by LDHA promotes tumor cell metastasis, while increased utilization of glucose facilitates tumor cell proliferation (Fig.	12193	12401
25983002	5c).	12402	12406
25983002	In the present study, we observed overexpressed LDHA in PC tissues compared with BPH tissues.	12407	12500
25983002	By using two PC cell lines, PC-3 and DU145, we asked whether the elevated LDHA was essential for tumor progression and whether LDHA altered tumor microenvironment that favors tumor growth or metastasis.	12501	12703
25983002	To this end, we utilized siRNA to suppress the expression of LDHA and FX11 to inhibit LDHA enzyme activity.	12704	12811
25983002	Our findings demonstrated that enhanced glycolysis and acidified microenvironment induced by LDHA had a drastic implication on tumor physiology.	12812	12956
25983002	Given that the accelerated glucose metabolism distinguishes cancer cells from their normal counterparts, it is reasonable to speculate that certain glycolytic enzymes are suitable to target for cancer therapy.	12957	13166
25983002	Many studies in tumors aimed at LDHA confirm this point view [6, 13, 14].	13167	13240
25983002	Consistent with previous reports, our results showed that knockdown of LDHA or limiting the LDHA activity of PC cells is sufficient to inhibit cell growth and metastasis [6, 9].	13241	13418
25983002	It is important to emphasize here that although tumor biology was altered by FX11 treatment, the LDHA enzyme activity was not measured in our study.	13419	13567
25983002	Whether alternations induced by FX11 were due to decreased LDHA enzyme activity requires further confirmation.	13568	13678
25983002	It was known that although Warburg effect produces reduced ATP compared with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), it provides a constant supply of metabolites that are essential for rapid macromolecule biosynthesis and necessary for cell growth and division [15, 16].	13679	13945
25983002	Our results showed that inhibition of LDHA significantly compromised cell viability of PC-3 and DU145 cells and accompanied by a decrease in glucose consumption and lactate production.	13946	14130
25983002	These results, as a proof of principle, suggest a driver role of LDHA in glycolytic activity in PC.	14131	14230
25983002	A critical consequence of Warburg effect is increased lactate production by tumor cells.	14231	14319
25983002	In cancer cells, lactate was exported by monocarboxylate transporters resulting in the acidification of microenvironment, whereas this alternations leads to cell death in normal cells.	14320	14504
25983002	In our study, LDHA deficiency led to a reduction in lactate production accompanied by decreased cellular migration and invasion.	14505	14633
25983002	Consistent with this theory, our results confirmed that the expression of proteases involved in extracellular matrix degradation including MMP9, PLAU, and cathepsin B was reduced by inhibition of LDHA.	14634	14835
25983002	However, mechanism of this type of alternation in proteases expression induced by LDHA inhibition remains further demonstration.	14836	14964
25983002	In conclusion, our results from both clinical specimens and in vitro cell experiments demonstrated that LDHA expression is upregulated in PC, and it induces a favorable tumor microenvironment for tumor progression.	14965	15179
25983002	We proposed that inhibition of LDHA may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling metastasis as well as tumor growth in prostate cancer.	15180	15329
26110643	Skin conditions generate between 12% to 43% of medical visits [1, 2].	0	69
26110643	In the United States, skin disorders are estimated to affect one third of the population at any time, with an estimated total annual cost of nearly US$100 billion.	70	233
26110643	Patients with skin disease frequently suffer physical discomfort and pain, and often experience diminished quality of life and psychological distress [4–6].	234	390
26110643	Medically, skin conditions are challenging to treat: skin is an exposed, physically vulnerable external barrier whose continuous turnover can impede long-lasting healing.	391	561
26110643	Because there is a limited variety of clinical treatment methods, many of which are non-specific immune modulators such as steroids, new therapeutic targets for skin conditions could have important health and economic benefits.	562	789
26110643	Strategies for identifying novel integument genes and expanding our understanding of incompletely characterized integument loci offer avenues for subsequent interventional approaches.	790	973
26110643	The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent vertebrate model for understanding development and disease.	974	1077
26110643	Zebrafish not only share significant genomic similarity with humans [9, 10], they also generate numerous transparent, externally fertilized embryos ideal for in vivo imaging and for phenotype-based gene discovery (“forward genetics”) [11, 12].	1078	1321
26110643	In addition to traditional chemical mutagenesis [13, 14], forward genetic screening uses insertional mutagenesis methods, including retroviruses [15, 16] and the more recently developed gene-breaking transposon (GBT) technology (Fig 1A).	1322	1559
26110643	GBT mutagenesis generates mRFP-tagged, Cre recombinase-revertible insertional alleles with ≥ 97% knockdown of endogenous transcript levels.	1560	1699
26110643	Zebrafish GBT insertional mutagenesis has already identified and characterized new genes, expression patterns, and phenotypes in the heart [18, 19], vasculature, and muscle.	1700	1873
26110643	GBT insertional mutagenesis has also been used to dissect genetic links between brain and behavior.	1874	1973
26110643	However, it had not previously been applied to studying skin biology.	1974	2043
26110643	Zebrafish larval skin and mammalian fetal skin share many features integral to both epidermal biology and disease.	2044	2158
26110643	In both cases, the developing epidermis is a bilayered epithelium.	2159	2225
26110643	The outer enveloping layer (EVL) of zebrafish embryos and larvae corresponds to mammalian embryonic periderm [23, 24], while the inner layer consists of basal keratinocytes that will eventually generate the multi-layered mature epidermis [25–27].	2226	2472
26110643	In both mammals and zebrafish, the transcription factor DeltaNp63 (ΔNp63) is crucial for epidermal specification and promotes basal keratinocyte proliferation and stemness [28–34].	2473	2653
26110643	Fin fold development is an important event in larval epidermal development.	2654	2729
26110643	Zebrafish larvae have an unpaired median fin fold (MFF) and a pair of pectoral fin folds (PFFs).	2730	2826
26110643	The MFF is an ancient structure whose origins predate the evolution of paired pectoral fins [35, 36].	2827	2928
26110643	MFF development begins at 18 hours post-fertilization (hpf) when midline basal keratinocytes undergo profound cell shape changes that drive median epidermal ridge (MER) formation along the ventral and dorsal caudal midlines.	2929	3153
26110643	Midline basal keratinocytes adopt a wedge-shaped cross-sectional profile by reducing their basal surfaces and expanding their apical surfaces.	3154	3296
26110643	Those shape changes, in conjunction with loss of contact with the underlying mesoderm, push up the midline basal keratinocytes (ridge cells) to create the MER [37, 38].	3297	3465
26110643	Additional keratinocytes are then recruited to the proximal base of the MER.	3466	3542
26110643	There they initiate MFF formation by elevating the MER perpendicularly to the larval mediolateral body axis.	3543	3651
26110643	As the MFF extends further from the larval body, a sub-epidermal (dermal) space forms between the resulting apposed epidermal sheets.	3652	3785
26110643	During MFF extension, the ridge cells of the initial MER remain at the tip of the MFF.	3786	3872
26110643	As we show here, ridge cells’ basal surfaces have re-expanded by 30 hpf during a second phase of cell shape changes.	3873	3989
26110643	The single cells at the tip of the apical MFF (cleft cells) maintain an overall wedge shape while the growing basal surface invaginates, forming an intracellular cleft as a distal extension of the dermal space.	3990	4200
26110643	In contrast, progressive apical and basal surface growth leads the two to three ridge cells on either side of the cleft cell to elongate, adopting a flattened, epithelial morphology with a rectangular cross-sectional profile.	4201	4426
26110643	Little is known about the genetic control of the processes that direct MER formation [38, 39], but studies indicate that MER cells play crucial roles during MFF development and maintenance.	4427	4616
26110643	As MFF development proceeds, MFF basal keratinocytes, including MER cells, secrete extracellular components into the dermal space.	4617	4747
26110643	Those components then assemble into specialized extracellular structures, including cross-fibers [37, 40] and collagenous actinotrichia [41, 42], which provide the MFF with structural support against mechanical stresses.	4748	4968
26110643	While basal keratinocytes along the entire proximo-distal length of the MFF secrete actinotrichia components, MER cleft and ridge cells are the predominant producers of basement membrane (BM) components such as Laminin [43, 44] (see below) and BM-dermal anchorage proteins such as Fras1 [44, 45] (see below).	4969	5277
26110643	By 48 hpf, fin mesenchymal cells (FMCs), a type of dermal fibroblast, have finished invading the MFF to further support and organize the dermal space and its ECM [40, 46].	5278	5449
26110643	Genetic evidence increasingly demonstrates that zebrafish MFF development models multiple processes affected in human skin diseases.	5450	5582
26110643	Two prominent examples are fraser syndrome 1 (fras1) and fraser-related extracellular matrix 2a (frem2a), encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) components mutated in human Fraser Syndrome patients.	5583	5778
26110643	During human and mouse development, correct BM-dermal junction formation requires FRAS1 and FREM2, especially in limb buds and craniofacial regions.	5779	5927
26110643	FRAS1 and FREM2 mutations cause transient, locally restricted fetal skin blistering and later lead to characteristic malformations such as cryptopthalmos and syndactyly [47–49].	5928	6105
26110643	Likewise, mutations in the corresponding zebrafish homologs fras1 and frem2a lead to transient skin blistering in developing larval fins.	6106	6243
26110643	Additional examples are the zebrafish mutants in the BM component laminin α5 (lama5) and its transmembrane receptor integrin α3 (itga3), as well as in the intracellular integrin modulator kindlin-1 (fermt1).	6244	6451
26110643	All of these mutants are characterized by impaired MFF epidermal integrity, and they model the corresponding epidermal defects characteristic of human epidermolysis bullosa (lama5, itga3) and Kindler Syndrome (fermt1).	6452	6670
26110643	Our study used GBT technology to identify eleven zebrafish integument loci expressed in either larval epidermis or FMCs.	6671	6791
26110643	Three of those loci (fras1, hmcn1, grip1) are novel revertible alleles of known disease-related genes that will provide new, Cre-regulatable molecular tools for skin biology studies.	6792	6974
26110643	We also identified neuregulin 2a (nrg2a) as a novel essential regulator of apical MFF development and MFF ridge cell polarity.	6975	7101
26110643	nrg2a is a zebrafish homolog of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) superfamily member NEUREGULIN 2 (NRG2).	7102	7207
26110643	Although an earlier morpholino (MO) knockdown study indicates that nrg2a participates in dorsal root ganglion development, nrg2a has not been investigated in conjunction with skin or MFF development.	7208	7407
26110643	We show here that zebrafish nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt insertional mutants display specific defects in MFF ridge cell organization, leading to aberrant apical MFF morphology reminiscent of ErbB2 (erbb2 -/-) mutants.	7408	7620
26110643	ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) mediate signaling by EGF superfamily ligands, such as the Neuregulins (NRGs), through several different signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK, and/or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT.	7621	7904
26110643	Our pharmacological inhibition, erbb expression, and activated ERK (pERK) and AKT (pAKT) immunofluorescence studies were consistent with this novel Nrg2a-dependent MFF pathway operating through ErbB2/3 and the PI3K –AKT signal transduction cascade.	7905	8153
26110643	Furthermore, the nrg2a phenotype led us to discover an early role for the epithelial cell polarity regulator and tumor suppressor lethal giant larvae 2 (lgl2) in MFF development.	8154	8332
26110643	Previous mutant studies established that lgl2 promotes epidermal integrity by attenuating ErbB signaling during late larval development (96–120 hpf), but did not find an earlier developmental role for lgl2 despite having documented its expression from 24 hpf onwards [52, 54].	8333	8609
26110643	We show here that MO-directed knockdown of lgl2 in nrg2a-deficient larvae rescues the MFF defects caused by loss of functional Nrg2a two days before lgl2’s tumor suppressor role.	8610	8788
26110643	Therefore, we have identified a previously undocumented negative impact of lgl2 on ErbB signaling that regulates epithelial polarity and keratinocyte biology during epidermal morphogenesis in the apical fin fold.	8789	9001
26110643	Locating expression within a tissue of interest is a key step toward identifying new genes involved in tissue-specific biology.	9002	9129
26110643	Using the online GBT database and image catalog zfishbook.org (http://www.zfishbook.org) as an initial selection tool, we screened 350 GBT insertional alleles for mRFP expression within the skin of the MFF (Fig 1B–1E; Fig 2B, 2D, 2F, 2H, 2J, 2L, and 2N) and/or covering the larval body (Fig 2A, 2C, 2E, 2G, 2I and 2K) [37, 38, 56].	9130	9461
26110643	That expression prioritization screen identified eleven gene-break alleles (GBT lines) with mRFP localization in the integument (Fig 1B–1E; Fig 2).	9462	9609
26110643	We refer to these as the initial Zebrafish Integument Project (ZIP) GBT lines.	9610	9688
26110643	The ZIP lines’ RFP localization patterns fell into three broad categories.	9689	9763
26110643	The first was expression in MFF edges (Fig 1B–1E); the second was expression throughout some or all of the epidermis (Fig 2A–2N); and the third was expression in FMCs (Fig 2I–2N; Fig 3).	9764	9950
26110643	Because we identified these eleven ZIP lines among the initial cohort of GBT insertional alleles, the GBT-disrupted genes in several ZIP lines had been identified during our initial GBT mutagenesis study.	9951	10155
26110643	We completed sequence-based identification of ZIP genes not identified in the previous study (Table 1).	10156	10259
26110643	Four ZIP lines displayed restricted mRFP localization in epidermal cells along MFF edges at 24 hpf: GBT0078/glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (grip1 mn0078Gt; Fig 1C and 1C’), GBT0156/fraser syndrome 1 (fras1 mn0156Gt; Fig 1D and 1D’), GBT0263/hemicentin 1 (hmcn1 mn0263Gt; Fig 1E and 1E’), and GBT0325/multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 6a (megf6a mn0325Gt; Fig 1B and 1B’).	10260	10653
26110643	As we had expected, the grip1 mn0078Gt, fras1 mn0156Gt, and hmcn1 mn0263Gt alleles’ respective mRFP localization patterns, as well as their respective mRFP fusion transcript expression data from whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) [57, 58] (Fig 1F–1H), corresponded to previous in situ transcript expression data [17, 44, 45].	10654	10985
26110643	Thus our data affirmed that these gene-break alleles reliably recapitulated endogenous expression of the trapped loci.	10986	11104
26110643	Seven lines displayed global epidermal localization throughout the entire integument: GBT0237/neuregulin 2a (nrg2a mn0237Gt; Fig 2A and 2B), GBT0275/collagen 4a4 (col4a4 mn0275Gt; Fig 2C and 2D), GBT0175/arhgef25b (arhgef25b mn0175Gt; Fig 2E and 2F), GBT0196/ahnak (ahnak mn0196Gt; Fig 2G and 2H), GBT0261/calpain 12 (capn12 mn0261Gt; Fig 2I and 2J), GBT0316/fk 506 binding protein 10b (fkbp10b mn0316Gt; Fig 2K and 2L), and GBT0245/muscle segment homeobox C (msxc mn0245Gt; Fig 2M and 2N).	11105	11595
26110643	Several expression patterns emphasized external topology, especially where the larval epidermis covered the head and eye (Fig 2A, 2C, 2I, 2J and 2K), the yolk and yolk extension (Fig 2A, 2C, 2E, 2G, 2I, 2K and 2M), the pectoral fin folds (Fig 2A, 2E, 2G, 2I, 2K and 2M), and the median fin fold (Fig 2B, 2D, 2F, 2H and 2L).	11596	11919
26110643	In contrast, mRFP expression was excluded from neuromasts embedded within the basal layer (nrg2a mn0237Gt, Fig 2B; col4a4 mn0275Gt, Fig 2D; capn12 mn0261Gt, Fig 2I and 2J; and fkbp10b mn0316Gt, Fig 2K).	11920	12122
26110643	We observed irregularly shaped mRFP+ cells within the fin folds of lines msxc mn0245Gt (Fig 2M and 2N), capn12 mn0261Gt (Fig 2I and 2J), and fkbp10b mn0316Gt (Fig 2K and 2L), and the endogenous transcript patterns revealed via WISH analyses supported those observations (S1D’ and S1F’ Fig).	12123	12413
26110643	Hypothesizing that those mRFP+ cells were FMCs, we crossed capn12 mn0261Gt and msxc mn0245Gt into ET37, a transgenic marker line expressing EGFP in FMCs (among other cell types, such as cleft cells) [40, 60].	12414	12622
26110643	Both Capn12mn0261Gt-mRFP and Msxcmn0245Gt-mRFP fusion proteins co-localized with ET37 EGFP expression in FMCs (Fig 3A, 3D, 3E and 3H).	12623	12757
26110643	Capn12mn0261Gt-mRFP was expressed in FMCs throughout the fin fold (Fig 3C and 3D), but localized to the periphery of FMC cell bodies (Fig 3C and 3D), whereas ET37 EGFP appeared uniformly distributed (Fig 3F and 3H).	12758	12973
26110643	In contrast, Msxcmn0245Gt-mRFP was predominately expressed in FMCs within the distal fin fold (Fig 3B–3D) and was uniformly distributed within individual cells (Fig 3B–3D).	12974	13146
26110643	Those results confirmed msxc mn0245Gt mesenchymal expression and established capn12 mn0261Gt as a new FMC marker for future studies of that migratory cell population.	13147	13313
26110643	Several alleles also displayed non-epidermal mRFP localization.	13314	13377
26110643	Col4a4mn0275Gt-mRFP was expressed in the caudal vascular plexus (Fig 2D) and in some somitic myotomes (Fig 2C and 2D).	13378	13496
26110643	fkbp10b mn0316Gt was expressed in the notochord (Fig 2K and 2L; S1D’ Fig).	13497	13571
26110643	And consistent with previous reports and with our own WISH analyses of the endogenous msxc transcript (S1F Fig), Msxcmn0245Gt-mRFP was expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), the sensory maculae of the inner ears, and the pectoral fin buds (Fig 2M and 2N).	13572	13835
26110643	Of the eleven genes identified (Table 1; Fig 1B–1D’; Fig 2), three have established roles in skin development and epidermal-dermal junction formation: fras1, grip1, and hmcn1 [44, 62].	13836	14020
26110643	As described above, FRAS1 is a large basement membrane (BM)-associated ECM protein connecting BM with underlying dermal connective tissue.	14021	14159
26110643	The cytoplasmic protein GRIP1 is required for properly localizing FRAS1 to the basal side of epithelial cells.	14160	14270
26110643	In human and mouse, recessive mutations in FRAS1 [47, 48] and GRIP1 [63–65] are characterized by malformations resulting from epidermal/epithelial blistering during fetal development.	14271	14454
26110643	Zebrafish fras1 mutants are characterized by corresponding blistering in the developing fin folds, though zebrafish grip1 mutants have no overt morphological phenotype.	14455	14623
26110643	Hmcn1/Fibulin 6 is a highly conserved member of the Fibulin ECM protein family, with epithelial cell-anchoring roles in C. elegans.	14624	14755
26110643	Zebrafish genetic studies have shown Hmcn1 is essential for epithelial-dermal anchorage in developing fin folds.	14756	14868
26110643	To varying degrees, five other ZIP alleles have reported zebrafish or mammalian integument expression: col4a4, ahnak, capn12, nrg2a, and msxc.	14869	15011
26110643	Col4a4 encodes one of the six subunits of type IV collagen, a major BM structural component [8, 62, 67].	15012	15116
26110643	Originally isolated from bovine muzzle epidermis as Desmoyokin, AHNAK shuttles between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane in keratinocytes and other epithelial cells.	15117	15286
26110643	Ahnakmn0196Gt–mRFP shows similar membrane localization (Fig 2G and 2H).	15287	15358
26110643	CALPAIN12, a member of the Calpain family of calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal cysteine proteases, is expressed in murine skin.	15359	15485
26110643	Calpain activity has also been implicated in wound healing.	15486	15545
26110643	Transcriptional profiling data indicate that NEUREGULIN 2 (NRG2) is expressed in the epidermal basal layer.	15546	15653
26110643	msxc encodes the transcription factor MsxC and is expressed in zebrafish FMCs [39, 61].	15654	15741
26110643	Finally, ZIP lines arhgef25b, fkbp10b, and megf6a did not have documented integument expression.	15742	15838
26110643	arhgef25b mn0175Gt, fkbp10b mn0316Gt, and megf6a mn0325Gt therefore represent novel skin genes—and are novel revertible alleles suitable for future genetic studies.	15839	16003
26110643	To determine which ZIP loci were required for early zebrafish skin or fin fold development, we bred each expressing insertion to homozygosity through a standard inbreeding scheme.	16004	16183
26110643	For each line, we screened offspring of intercrossed heterozygous parents during the first five days of development (120 hpf) for abnormal skin or fin fold morphology present only in mRFP-positive (GBT-expressing) larvae and absent from their wild-type siblings (an “mRFP-linked” phenotype).	16184	16475
26110643	Of the eleven lines screened, three displayed recessive, mRFP-linked phenotypes: fras1 mn0156Gt (Fig 4B), hmcn1 mn0263Gt (Fig 4C), and nrg2a mn0237Gt (Fig 5B).	16476	16635
26110643	Comparisons to published phenotypes of ENU-derived alleles indicated that fras1 mn0156Gt and hmcn1 mn0263Gt represented novel alleles of known skin blistering mutants pinfin (pif) and nagel (nel) [44, 56], respectively (Table 1, Fig 4A–4C).	16636	16876
26110643	GBT-tagged loci are revertible due to loxP sites within the RP2 vector (Fig 1A).	16877	16957
26110643	Cre-mediated recombination permanently excises the mutagenic cassettes, restoring wild-type splicing to the endogenous locus.	16958	17083
26110643	To verify that fras1 mn0156Gt/mn0156Gt and hmcn1 mn0263Gt/mn0263Gt insertional mutants were revertible, we tested whether Cre recombinase activity rescued the phenotypes (Fig 1A) [17, 19].	17084	17272
26110643	We injected Cre mRNA into 1-cell-stage offspring of fras1 +/mn0156Gt or hmcn1 +/mn0263Gt heterozygote intercrosses, respectively, and scored injected larvae for blistered fins at 48 hpf.	17273	17459
26110643	The frequency of phenotypic larvae in both fras1 mn0156Gt/mn0156Gt (27%, n = 156, Fig 4D) and hmcn1 mn0263Gt/mn0263Gt (25%, n = 146, Fig 4E) uninjected controls were within expected Mendelian proportions.	17460	17664
26110643	However, phenotypic frequencies were significantly reduced in their Cre-injected siblings (fras1 mn0156Gt/mn0156Gt: 5%, n = 140, Fig 4D; hmcn1 mn0263Gt/mn0263Gt: 8%, n = 223, Fig 4E).	17665	17848
26110643	To confirm that our GBT alleles and ENU-induced point mutation alleles of the same locus were functionally equivalent, we conducted complementation testing between fras1 +/mn0156Gt and pif +/tm95b [44, 56] heterozygotes.	17849	18069
26110643	fras1 +/mn0156Gt x pif +/tm95b offspring (fras1 +/mn0156Gt; pif +/tm95b trans-heterozygotes) showed typical fras1 fin blistering (Fig 4F) in a Mendelian proportion (28%, n = 445), indicating that the fras1 mn0156Gt and pif tm95b alleles failed to complement each other.	18070	18339
26110643	Failure to complement demonstrated that fras1 mn0156Gt was a novel, mutagenic allele of the fras1 locus.	18340	18444
26110643	Together, the Cre reversion and non-complementation results demonstrated that GBT alleles of known skin mutants phenocopied established ENU mutants.	18445	18593
26110643	nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt homozygotes presented the third recessive phenotype, which was characterized by morphological defects along MFF edges.	18594	18736
26110643	(Fig 5A and 5B).	18737	18753
26110643	Whereas wild-type MFF edges are thin and flat (Fig 5A), nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutant MFF edges were thick and were often accompanied by one or more pointed protrusions along the posterior curvature (Fig 5B).	18754	18963
26110643	In live embryos, phenotypic changes to MFF edge morphology were visible as early as 48 hpf (Fig 5B).	18964	19064
26110643	Immunostaining for Collagen II (Col II), an MFF dermal space collagen, showed increased Col II accumulation and thick, bent actinotrichia within nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutant apical MFFs (Fig 5D), whereas actinotrichia in the corresponding distal regions of wild-type MFFs were much thinner or even absent (Fig 5C).	19065	19381
26110643	In addition, nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants’ pectoral fins were often bent or crumpled, or had altered edges similar to those of mutant MFFs (S3A and S3B Fig).	19382	19542
26110643	Mutant larvae also failed to inflate their swim bladders (S3C and S3D Fig), and died between 8 and 12 days post fertilization (dpf) (S3E Fig).	19543	19685
26110643	Unlike other published zebrafish skin mutants, however, nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants did not display epidermal phenotypes such as cellular aggregates, blistering, or fin fold degeneration during the first 120 hpf [43, 44, 50, 54, 56, 73–76] To confirm that the GBT insertion caused the MFF phenotype, we conducted Cre rescue experiments on offspring of nrg2a +/mn0237Gt intercrosses.	19686	20072
26110643	Cre-mediated excision significantly reduced the frequency of phenotypic siblings in injected (7%, n = 322) versus uninjected (25%, n = 358) embryos (p < 0.002) (data not shown).	20073	20250
26110643	Successful Cre-mediated phenotype rescue confirmed that homozygosity for the mn0237Gt allele caused the MFF phenotype.	20251	20369
26110643	Because the previously reported zebrafish nrg2a sequence contained a putative non-coding first exon but did not contain an N-terminal signal sequence, we investigated whether additional nrg2a N-terminal exons were present.	20370	20592
26110643	Through 5’RACE and zebrafish genome database searches, we identified two alternative N-terminal exons, exons 1B and 1C.	20593	20712
26110643	While the putative exon 1A contains only non-coding sequence and is used for the previously reported N-terminally truncated Nrg2a isoforms, the newly annotated exons 1B and 1C give rise to alterative N-termini of 145 (1B) or 37 (1C) amino acid residues, respectively (Fig 6A; S2 Fig).	20713	20997
26110643	Exon 1B has homology to N-termini of NRG2 homologs in other species, whereas exon 1C shows no homology to any other species.	20998	21122
26110643	SignalP4 software analysis (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) indicated that only the exon 1B-encoded isoform contains an N-terminal signal sequence.	21123	21279
26110643	In addition, NucPred software analysis (http://www.sbc.su.se/~maccallr/nucpred/) predicted that the exon 1C-encoded isoform would be capable of nuclear localization (S2 Fig).	21280	21454
26110643	The gene-breaking cassette that generates the mn0237Gt allele is located in the intron between exon 1C and exon 2 (Fig 6A).	21455	21578
26110643	According to RT-PCR analyses, endogenous 1B and 1C transcripts were present in both wild-type (nrg2a +/+) and heterozygous (nrg2a +/mn0237Gt) siblings, but absent in homozygous mutant (nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt) siblings (Fig 6B and 6C).	21579	21814
26110643	Conversely, 1B-mRFP and 1C-mRFP fusion transcripts were present in mutant and heterozygous siblings, but absent from wild-type siblings (Fig 6B and 6C).	21815	21967
26110643	We note that we were unable to amplify the sequence corresponding to non-coding exon 1A.	21968	22056
26110643	Together, these transcript data indicate that mn0237Gt is a null or near-null loss-of-function allele (see also Discussion).	22057	22181
26110643	Both nrg2a-mRFP fusion transcripts (Fig 5G) and Nrg2amn0237Gt–mRFP fusion protein (Fig 5E and 5H) were epidermally localized in 24 hpf nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygotes.	22182	22348
26110643	WISH analyses using a probe for mRFP revealed that the fusion transcript was prominently expressed along the MFF edges (Fig 5E and 5F)—that is, within the apical MFF—and was weakly expressed throughout the entire epidermis (Fig 5G).	22349	22581
26110643	WISH analyses of endogenous nrg2a transcripts in wild-type embryos showed the same pattern (24 hpf; Fig 5H and 5I), thus demonstrating that the mn0237Gt insertional allele recapitulates endogenous nrg2a expression.	22582	22796
26110643	Co-labeled MFF transverse sections further revealed that the Nrg2amn0237Gt–mRFP fusion protein was present in the basal layer of keratinocytes, together with the nuclearly localized basal keratinocyte marker ΔNp63.	22797	23011
26110643	In contrast, the EVL, characterized by expression of the krt4:EGFP transgene, lacked Nrg2amn0237Gt–mRFP fusion protein (Fig 5J–5N).	23012	23143
26110643	Higher magnification analyses confirmed that the punctate distribution of Nrg2amn0237Gt–mRFP fusion protein (Fig 2B; Fig 5E) reflected nuclear localization of the fusion protein (Fig 6C–6F).	23144	23334
26110643	In addition, Nrg2amn0237Gt–mRFP fusion protein could be detected in the cytoplasm of basal keratinocytes (Fig 5J–5N; Fig 6C–6F).	23335	23463
26110643	Both of those findings regarding Nrg2amn0237Gt–mRFP subcellular localization were initially surprising because Nrg2a is a growth factor (but see Discussion).	23464	23621
26110643	However, wild-type embryos injected with synthetic mRNA encoding the exon 1C version of the Nrg2a-mRFP fusion protein showed similar cytoplasmic localization.	23622	23780
26110643	Exogenous exon 1C-mRFP fusion protein was present in both keratinocyte nuclei and cytoplasm (Fig 6K–6N), mimicking the distribution of the transgene-encoded fusion protein in nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygous embryos (Fig 6C–6F).	23781	24006
26110643	Exogenous exon 1B-mRFP fusion protein also showed some cytoplasmic localization (Fig 6G–6J).	24007	24099
26110643	These results were consistent with the presence of one or more putative nuclear localization sequences (NLS) in the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by nrg2a exon 1C (S2B Fig), and suggest that the complex subcellular localization of the Nrg2a-mRFP fusion protein is caused by differential distributions of the different N-terminal isoforms.	24100	24446
26110643	To further characterize the MFF defect in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants, we compared transverse sections of median epidermal ridges (MER) from nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutant larvae with those of wild-type siblings.	24447	24663
26110643	As described above, the MER consists of a central cleft cell, characterized by a cleft-like invagination of the dermal space, and ridge cells to either side of the cleft cell.	24664	24839
26110643	To visualize the shapes of individual cleft and ridge cells, we crossed nrg2a mn0237Gt into a Tg(Ola.Actb:Hsa.hras-egfp) vu119 (hras-egfp) ubiquitously expressed membrane-bound EGFP background (Fig 7A–7C).	24840	25045
26110643	Furthermore, to specifically label cleft cells, we crossed nrg2a mn0237Gt into an ET37 background, in which EGFP is specifically expressed in FMCs and cleft cells (Fig 7D and 7E).	25046	25225
26110643	We also performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig 8; S4 Fig) to examine the cleft and ridge cells in finer detail.	25226	25351
26110643	Because the gross morphological changes characterizing nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutant MFFs were visible by the second day of development (Fig 5B), we conducted our analyses between 30 and 52 hpf.	25352	25547
26110643	During normal MFF morphogenesis, MER cells undergo characteristic consecutive cell shape changes, accompanied by changes in the organization of the developing dermal space between the two apposed epidermal sheets.	25548	25761
26110643	During the initial steps of fin fold elevation along the body midline, MER ridge cells acquire wedge-like shapes by expanding their lateral and/or apical domains at the expense of the basal domain.	25762	25959
26110643	But at 30 hpf, re-enlargement of ridge cell basal domains had partially reversed the earlier shape changes.	25960	26067
26110643	Ridge cells acquired an intermediate shape, more cuboidal than wedge-like, while the dermal space was curved (Fig 7A).	26068	26186
26110643	MER morphogenesis continued through 36 hpf (Fig 8A, 8E, and 8F; S4A Fig).	26187	26260
26110643	By 52 hpf, the dermal space had straightened and ridge cells had elongated, acquiring a flattened shape with large, equally-sized apical and basal domains, but small lateral domains (Fig 7B and 7D; Fig 8C).	26261	26467
26110643	Cleft cells in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants were only mildly affected.	26468	26541
26110643	They expressed the ET37 marker (Fig 7E) and retained a typical cleft shape (Fig 7E; S4B Fig), though they often shared an atypically elongated lateral border with a neighboring ridge cell (S4B Fig).	26542	26740
26110643	Ridge cells in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants, however, displayed far more dramatic alterations (Fig 7C and 7E; Fig 8B, 8D, 8G, and 8H; S4C and S4D Fig).	26741	26895
26110643	Ridge cells’ lateral domains, and especially their basal domains, were much enlarged, while their apical domains were smaller (Fig 8G and 8H; S4C and S4D Fig), so that they bulged into the dermal space, giving it a serpentine-like appearance (Fig 7C and 7E; Fig 8B, 8D–8G).	26896	27169
26110643	The bulges consisted either of two ridge cells sharing an extended lateral border (Fig 8G and 8H), or of a single ridge cell with an extended basal domain (S4C and S4D Fig).	27170	27343
26110643	In both cases, the extent of apical domains was reduced.	27344	27400
26110643	These findings suggest that Nrg2a regulates ridge cells’ apicobasal organization during apical MFF morphogenesis, thereby promoting or maintaining apical domain identity at the expense of basolateral identity.	27401	27610
26110643	To determine whether Nrg2a might have a corresponding function in more proximal (non-MER) epidermal cells of the MFF, we compared 52 hpf and 96 hpf mutant and wild-type siblings via TEM.	27611	27797
26110643	However, we did not observe consistent epidermal differences, malformations, or cell-cell junction defects in these regions of nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants compared to wild-type siblings (data not shown).	27798	28005
26110643	Because Nrg2 is a ligand for ErbB family tyrosine kinase receptors [80–82], we hypothesized that the lack of Nrg2a-mediated ErbB signaling in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants caused the ridge cell phenotype.	28006	28212
26110643	We tested whether pharmacological ErbB inhibition in wild-type embryos would phenocopy nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants.	28213	28332
26110643	Because serpentined distal dermal spaces were observed as early as 36 hpf (Fig 8A), we incubated wild-type embryos in either a low dose (1μM) or high dose (20μM) of the small-molecule EGFR/pan-ErbB inhibitor PD168393 [52, 83] from 24 hpf through 52 hpf.	28333	28586
26110643	We examined MFF morphology in live embryos at 52 hpf (Fig 9C–9G) and 96 hpf (Fig 9A), and via TEM at 52 hpf (Fig 7I and 7J).	28587	28711
26110643	At 52 hpf and 96 hpf, PD168393-treated wild-type larvae displayed thickened MFF edges (Fig 9A, 9E, and 9G), similar to those observed in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants (Fig 5B).	28712	28890
26110643	The response was dose-dependent (Fig 9A, 9E, and 9G).	28891	28944
26110643	TEM analyses of randomly selected 20μM PD168393-treated embryos (n = 21) showed serpentine-like MFF distal dermal spaces (Fig 9J) indistinguishable from distal dermal spaces in nrg2a insertional mutants (compare with Fig 8D).	28945	29170
26110643	These data indicate that inhibiting ErbB receptor signaling in wild-type embryos recapitulates the nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt phenotype.	29171	29304
26110643	Because our data point to a functional connection between Nrg2a and ErbB signaling, we conducted a genetic interaction analysis to test whether partial loss of both Nrg2a and ErbB signaling had synergistic effects on MFF morphogenesis.	29305	29540
26110643	Specifically, we tested whether nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygous larvae were more sensitive to moderate ErbB inhibition than were their wild-type siblings.	29541	29693
26110643	In fact, significantly more nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygotes (64%, n = 152, p < 0.0001) phenocopied nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants at the low PD168393 dose (1 μM) than did sibling (23%, n = 116) or non-sibling (28%, n = 120) wild-type embryos (Fig 9B; compare also Fig 9E with Fig 9F).	29694	29978
26110643	In contrast, nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygosity did not further enhance the phenotype caused by the high (20 μM) PD168393 dose (compare Fig 9G with Fig 9H).	29979	30132
26110643	Together with our earlier inhibitor data, these studies indicate that the nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt MFF phenotype results from a loss of Nrg2a-mediated ErbB signaling.	30133	30298
26110643	Vertebrates have four different Neuregulins (NRG1-4) and four different members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1, ErbB2/Neu/HER2, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4).	30299	30528
26110643	The combinatorial possibilities of those ligands and receptors permit diversity and specificity in signaling.	30529	30638
26110643	Just as EGF binds to and signals through ErbB1/ErbB1 homodimers or ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers, NRG1 and NRG2 preferentially signal via ErbB3/ErbB2 heterodimers, while NRG3 and NRG4 do so via ErbB4 [53, 80–82, 84].	30639	30850
26110643	Intracellular signal transduction of all ErbB receptors can occur through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, although p85-mediated activation of the PI3K –AKT pathway has been described as the major signal transduction route for ErbB3 in particular [53, 85–88].	30851	31127
26110643	Consistent with the requirement for Nrg2a during zebrafish apical MFF morphogenesis, we observed strong epidermal expression of its potential co-receptor erbb3a during the 30 to 36 hpf developmental window (Fig 9L; 34 hpf).	31128	31351
26110643	However, we failed to detect epidermal expression of the zebrafish EGF receptor gene egfra (erbb1a) during the same timeframe (Fig 9K; 34 hpf).	31352	31495
26110643	Furthermore, and consistent with possible ErbB3 involvement, immunofluoresence analyses revealed phosphorylated (activated) AKT (pAKT) in MFF ridge cells at 34 hpf (Fig 9M and 9N).	31496	31676
26110643	Strikingly, pAKT levels were strongly reduced in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants’ MFF ridge cells, but not at other sites (Fig 9O and 9P).	31677	31815
26110643	Unlike the dramatic changes in pAKT levels, activated ERK (pERK) levels in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants did not change relative to pERK levels in wild-type siblings (S5 Fig).	31816	31993
26110643	Together, these data suggest that Nrg2a regulates MFF ridge cell apicobasal organization and morphogenesis via ErbB3-mediated PI3K –AKT signaling.	31994	32140
26110643	To date, ErbB activity in zebrafish epidermis has only been described in the context of the tumor suppressor lethal giant larvae 2 (lgl2), which blocks ErbB signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) to safeguard epidermal integrity during late larval stages (120 hpf).	32141	32425
26110643	Yet even though lgl2 is epidermally expressed by 24 hpf, it has no identified developmental role during that early time frame.	32426	32552
26110643	However, previous characterizations of Lgl2 as an epithelial polarity regulator that promotes basal fate [54, 89, 90], along with the basolateral domain expansion observed in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants’ MFF ridge cells and the temporal overlap among lgl2, nrg2a (Fig 5H and 5I), and erbb3a expression patterns (Fig 9L), led us to speculate that Lgl2 might play an earlier role in epidermal development.	32553	32960
26110643	We hypothesized that that earlier Lgl2 role involved opposing Nrg2 –ErbB3 signaling during MFF morphogenesis.	32961	33070
26110643	To test that hypothesis, we suppressed lgl2 in the nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt background.	33071	33157
26110643	Morpholino (MO) knockdown of lgl2 significantly restored nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants’ MFF morphology at 52 hpf (Fig 10A–10H) relative to both uninjected controls and tp53 MO-injected controls (Fig 10A).	33158	33364
26110643	Indeed, lgl2 MO-injected and genotyped nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt embryos displayed external MFF morphology indistinguishable from that of wild-type siblings (compare Fig 10H with Fig 10D).	33365	33551
26110643	Furthermore, MFF internal organization was also ameliorated in lgl2 MO-injected nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt embryos.	33552	33664
26110643	Dermal actinotrichia organization, (Fig 10I and 10J; 48 hpf), ridge cells’ apicobasal organization, and MFF dermal space bending (Fig 10K and 10L; 52 hpf) were all dramatically normalized, leading to embryos indistinguishable from wild-type (compare Fig 10J with Fig 5C, and Fig 10L with Fig 7D).	33665	33961
26110643	These results indicated that loss of Lgl2 activity suppressed the nrg2a phenotype, revealing a new and significantly earlier role for lgl2 in fin fold development, distinct from its established tumor-suppressing and hemidesomosome (basal)-promoting functions in the later body epidermis [52, 54].	33962	34258
26110643	By selecting for skin- and MFF-localized mRFP, we identified four genes with little or no previously appreciated connection to skin biology: megf6a, nrg2a, arhgef25b, and fkbp10b (Fig 1B and 1B’; Fig 2A, 2B, 2E, 2F, 2K and 2L).	34259	34486
26110643	In addition, we isolated GBT alleles of several known skin-related genes (Table 1; Fig 1C–1E’; Fig 2).	34487	34589
26110643	In zebrafish embryos, apical MFF basal keratinocytes express fras1, grip1, and hmcn1 [44, 45], and MFF mesenchymal cells (FMCs) express msxc.	34590	34731
26110643	ahnak and capn12 have not yet been investigated in zebrafish, but have been detected in mammalian stratified squamous epithelia [70, 91].	34732	34869
26110643	col4a4 encodes one (A4) of the six possible constituents (A1-A6) of collagen IV, which forms large networks integral to BMs.	34870	34994
26110643	Zebrafish col4a4 expression has thus far only been analyzed via RT-PCR of whole-body RNA extracts, without corresponding spatial resolution.	34995	35135
26110643	However, in humans, cutaneous collagen IV largely employs subunits other than COL4A4, and COL4A4 loss-of-function mutations, such as Alport Sydrome, largely affect epithelia other than the skin.	35136	35330
26110643	Thus, zebrafish col4a4 mn0275Gt cutaneous expression offers a new tool for investigating evolutionary changes in tissue-specific expression of these important BM components and the impact of those changes on the biology of specific organs.	35331	35570
26110643	With fras1, grip1, and hmcn1, we identified GBT alleles of loci with documented functions in zebrafish MFF development and connections to human skin disease.	35571	35728
26110643	In humans and mice, recessive loss-of-function mutations in FRAS1 and GRIP1 cause the rare, clinically overlapping congenital disorders Fraser Syndrome and Ablepharon Macrostomia Syndrome [47, 48, 64, 65].	35729	35934
26110643	Both are characterized by malformations resulting from epidermal or epithelial blistering during fetal development due to compromised anchorage of epidermal and other epithelial basement membranes to underlying connective tissues such as the dermis.	35935	36184
26110643	hmcn1 has recently been proposed as an additional Fraser Syndrome gene, though that hypothesis awaits confirmation.	36185	36300
26110643	fras1 mn0156Gt/mn0156Gt and hmcn1 mn0263Gt/mn0263Gt homozygotes fully phenocopied the respective ENU-induced mutants (Fig 4A–4C).	36301	36430
26110643	Consistent with previous MO knockdown results, grip1 mn0078Gt/mn0078Gt homozygotes lacked an overt skin phenotype, likely due to partial functional redundancy with zebrafish grip2.	36431	36611
26110643	In contrast with the ENU-induced alleles, however, the fras1 mn0156Gt and hmcn1 mn0263Gt GBT alleles are revertible in a Cre-dependent manner (Fig 4D and 4E).	36612	36770
26110643	That reversion capability offers important experimental advantages.	36771	36838
26110643	For instance, coupling transgenic methods for temporally and/or spatially restricted Cre expression with GBT reversion would allow investigators to parse more finely the spatiotemporal requirements for Fras1 and Hmcn1 in MFF development.	36839	37076
26110643	Similarly, tissue-specific Cre expression could be used to rescue the lethal craniofacial defects of fras1 mutants, thereby permitting investigations into possible later defects in fras1 mutants, including possible later consequences of the (non-lethal) epidermal blistering.	37077	37352
26110643	In mammals, transient epidermal blistering in Fras1 mutant embryos is thought to abrogate crucial epithelial—mesenchymal interactions, leading to characteristic later defects such as syndactyly (fused digits) or cryptophthalmos (fused eye lids) [47–49].	37353	37606
26110643	Thus far, it has not been possible to investigate possible later consequences of embryonic epidermal blistering in the zebrafish model due to the lethal craniofacial defects.	37607	37781
26110643	But as outlined above, such studies could now be carried out with the new revertible GBT allele.	37782	37878
26110643	The 11 ZIP lines described here (Table 1; Fig 1B–1E’; Fig 2) comprise 3% of the original 350 GBT lines.	37879	37982
26110643	Continued expression cataloging and gene identification will build a comprehensive, in vivo spatiotemporal anatomical expression atlas for integument development and diseases, revealing relationships among anatomy, gene expression, and protein localization.	37983	38240
26110643	That unique resource would be a valuable supplement to standard anatomical atlases [94, 95] as well as a comparative resource for mammalian skin biology studies.	38241	38402
26110643	Of the 11 identified loci, 3 gave a morphologically visible larval skin phenotype when their respective gene-breaking alleles were bred to homozygosity (fras1, hmcn1, nrg2a).	38403	38577
26110643	The question of whether any of the other identified loci are required during later stages of skin biology requires further investigation since our analyses only extended through 120 hpf.	38578	38764
26110643	Because the fras1 and hmcn1 mutant phenotypes had already been characterized, we focused on the nrg2a mutants, which displayed specific defects during MFF morphogenesis.	38765	38934
26110643	As with the other Neuregulin family members, zebrafish nrg2a exists in multiple isoforms due to differential promoter usage and alternative splicing.	38935	39084
26110643	Previously reported isoforms would have lacked the N-terminal sequences described here because exon 1A is a non-coding exon.	39085	39209
26110643	Such 1A isoforms would therefore lack the first 145 amino acid residues of the 1B isoform and the first 37 N-terminal amino acid residues of the 1C isoform that we describe here (S2 Fig).	39210	39397
26110643	We successfully amplified 1B and 1C transcripts from 5’ RACE and RT-PCR analyses, but were unable to successfully amplify the 1A isoform.	39398	39535
26110643	Those results suggest that the 1B and 1C versions are the predominant nrg2a transcripts generated during the stages relevant to MFF development.	39536	39680
26110643	It should also be noted that Honjo et al. used MOs targeting an internal splice site present in all isoforms, rather than the 1A-specific translational start region, leaving open the question of which isoform(s) are required for dorsal root ganglia development.	39681	39942
26110643	Most important for our present work, however, is the fact that all three nrg2a alternative first exons, 1A-C, are located upstream of the GBT insertion site that generates the nrg2a mn0237Gt allele.	39943	40141
26110643	Consequently, nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants have truncated nrg2a transcripts which lack the sequences encoded by exon 2 onwards due to the GBT cassette’s transcription termination sequence (Fig 1A).	40142	40342
26110643	Accordingly, the 1B and 1C transcripts give rise to Nrg2a-mRFP fusion proteins in which the N-terminal 138 or 29 amino acids encoded by exons 1B or 1C, respectively, are directly fused to mRFP.	40343	40536
26110643	1A transcripts are not translated at all because the endogenous translational start codon is localized in exon 2.	40537	40650
26110643	Therefore, nrg2a mn0237Gt is most likely a null or near-null loss of function allele.	40651	40736
26110643	It is also noteworthy that out of all three N-terminal isoforms, only the longer and phylogenetically conserved 1B isoforms contain an N-terminal signal sequence involved in co-translational protein translocation to the endoplasmatic reticulum and subsequent secretion.	40737	41006
26110643	However, all endogenous isoforms share an internal transmembrane domain which can target the proteins to the cell membrane from where their biologically active ectodomains can be released via proteolytic processing.	41007	41222
26110643	Nrg2amn0237Gt-mRFP fusion proteins lack that internal transmembrane domain because they only contain exon 1-encoded Nrg2 sequences.	41223	41354
26110643	The absence of that domain in Nrg2amn0237Gt-mRFP fusion proteins may contribute to the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of the 1C fusion protein, which also lacks an N-terminal signal sequence, but instead contains at least one nuclear localization sequence (S2 Fig).	41355	41626
26110643	This suggests that the unexpected distribution of the fusion proteins might be a special feature of the targeted locus and a consequence of the lack of crucial internal domains in the encoded proteins, thus demonstrating an expected limitation (loss of protein trafficking signals due to truncation) of GBT technology to recapitulate the subcellular distribution of the endogeneous protein counterparts.	41627	42030
26110643	On the other hand, we cannot rule out that the RFP localization observed in nrg2a mn0237Gt embryos does reflect the actual subcellular distribution of the endogenous Nrg2 proteins.	42031	42211
26110643	Indeed, nuclear localization has also been reported for several other RTK ligands, such as different Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and the Neuregulin relative EGF, as well as their receptors [99–103].	42212	42415
26110643	Studies with isoform-specific Nrg2a antibodies or full-length Nrg2-RFP fusion constructs will be needed to give more definitive answers.	42416	42552
26110643	In mice, loss of Nrg2 leads to growth retardation and reduced reproductive capacity.	42553	42637
26110643	We were unable to address whether the loss of Nrg2a in zebrafish has similar consequences because nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants die during larval stages, well before the onset of significant somatic growth and sex differentiation.	42638	42870
26110643	The reason for this larval death is currently unknown.	42871	42925
26110643	However, the defects during MFF morphogenesis described here are most likely not the primary cause, because other mutants can survive in the complete absense of median fins (M.H., unpublished observations).	42926	43132
26110643	Altered MFF morphology similar to that of nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants has only been reported for one other mutant to date—erbb2 -/-, which harbors a loss-of-function mutation in EGF/NRG co-receptor ErbB2.	43133	43341
26110643	However, the MFF morphological defects of erbb2 -/- mutants have not yet been analyzed in additional detail.	43342	43450
26110643	The initial steps of MFF formation and elevation involve basal detachment of midline keratinocytes and their transition from a cuboidal to a wedged morphology, which is marked by shrinkage of their basal domains [37, 38].	43451	43672
26110643	The distal-most basal keratinocyte in the tip of the elevating fold becomes the cleft cell; the two to three basal keratinocytes adjacent to each cleft cell become ridge cells.	43673	43849
26110643	As we have documented here, ridge cells then transition a second time, re-elongating their basal domains at the expense of their apical domains to reverse their wedged morphology and return to their initial rectangular/cuboidal morphology (Fig 6A).	43850	44098
26110643	Finally, ridge cells then become progressively flatter by extending their basal and apical sides at the expense of their lateral domains (Fig 6F and 6H).	44099	44252
26110643	This second phase of cell shape changes is affected in nrg2a mutants: nrg2a mutant ridge cells display disproportionately expanded basolateral domains and bulge basally, deforming the dermal space into serpentine shapes (Fig 6C, 6E, 6G and 6I; S3C–S3F Fig).	44253	44510
26110643	In addition, ectopic and enlarged actinotrichia in the distal-most regions of the MFF (Fig 5H) suggested increased basal activity such as secreting ECM components into the dermal space.	44511	44696
26110643	Together, these findings suggest that coordinating apical and basal extension during ridge cells’ second shape change requires active Nrg2a –ErbB signaling which plays a “pro-apical” role during that transition by promoting maintenance of the apical domain and/or antagonizing basolateral epithelial domains to counterbalance the “basalization” of ridge cells that occurs during their transition from a wedged back to a rectangular shape.	44697	45135
26110643	These shape changes during the second phase of MFF morphogenesis mainly occur in the distal-most MFF cells (ridge and cleft cells), whereas more proximal MFF basal keratinocytes remain rectangular during their initial recruitment into the MFF.	45136	45379
26110643	Accordingly, later MFF morphogenetic steps require less- pronounced shape changes by those proximal basal keratinocytes, which could explain why they are not affected in nrg2a mutants.	45380	45564
26110643	Consistent with the spatially restricted defects in the mutant, distal MFFs in wild-type embryos show stronger endogenous nrg2a expression (Fig 5H and 5I).	45565	45720
26110643	Ridge cells’ higher pAKT levels (Fig 9M–9P) also suggest that the apical MFF receives stronger Nrg2a signaling than do proximal MFF cells.	45721	45859
26110643	In contrast, expression of the likely Nrg2a receptor gene erbb3a is fairly homogeneous throughout all basal epidermal cells (Fig 9K).	45860	45993
26110643	In conclusion, we have good evidence that the distal restriction of the defects in the mutants is due to spatially restricted signaling in wild type embryos.	45994	46151
26110643	Nevertheless, it remains unclear why only the ridge cells, but not the cleft cells, are affected in nrg2a mutants.	46152	46266
26110643	Identifying the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pro-apical and/or anti-basal effects of Nrg2a-ErbB signaling will require additional investigation.	46267	46431
26110643	The expression of erbb3a, but not egfra/erbb1, at the appropriate locations (Fig 9), together with previously reported erbb2 epidermal expression in zebrafish embryos and the requirement of erbb2-/- for proper MFF morphogenesis, suggests that Nrg2a may signal via Erbb2/3 receptor heterodimers, which would be consistent with biochemical findings.	46432	46779
26110643	In addition, reduced pAKT levels, but normal pERK levels in nrg2a mutant MFF keratinocytes (Fig 9; S5 Fig) points to Nrg2a –ErbB signaling via the PI3K –AKT signal transduction pathway, rather than the MAPK/ERK pathway, as has also found for Neuregulin signaling in other instances [53, 85, 87, 88].	46780	47079
26110643	Our finding that concurrent loss of Lgl2 activity significantly alleviated MFF defects in nrg2a mutants suggests that Nrg2a’s pro-apical effects extend to antagonizing Lgl2 pro-basal activity.	47080	47272
26110643	As a homolog of the Drosophila cell polarity gene lethal giant larvae (lgl), lgl2 is a cell polarity regulator required for maintaining the basolateral domain in epithelial cells [89, 90].	47273	47461
26110643	Likewise, the epidermal defects of zebrafish lgl2 mutants can also be interpreted in terms of loss of basolateral identity.	47462	47585
26110643	Basal keratinocytes in lgl2 mutants not only lack hemidesomomes, basal domain junctions involved in attachment to underlying BM, but also display an even more pronounced loss of basal characteristics by undergoing EMT.	47586	47804
26110643	Such events point to a tumor-suppressor role for Lgl2.	47805	47859
26110643	Overactive ErbB signaling and its PI3K –AKT signal transduction branch, on the other hand, have well-known oncogenic effects, promoting EMT and hyperproliferation [105–107].	47860	48033
26110643	Thus, the roles of the Nrg2a –ErbB3 –AKT axis and Lgl2 during MFF morphogenesis identified in this study suggest that in addition to the established antagonistic relationship between ErbB signaling and Lgl2 during later phases of epidermal homeostasis and carcinogenesis, the Nrg2a –ErbB3 –AKT signaling axis and Lgl2 have as-yet unappreciated antagonistic, and more moderate anti- or pro-basal effects, respectively, on keratinocytes during earlier steps of epidermal morphogenesis.	48034	48517
26110643	To our knowledge, our data also provide the first indication that AKT/pAKT is involved in regulating apicobasal organization and epithelial cell polarity during the development of any species.	48518	48710
26110643	Strikingly however, despite their early and late antagonisms, Lgl2 and Nrg2a per se are uniquely required during different stages of epidermal morphogenesis and homeostasis.	48711	48884
26110643	Lgl2 is required during late stages: epidermal defects in lgl2 mutants only become apparent between 108 and 120 hpf, and MFF formation is unaffected.	48885	49034
26110643	In contrast, Nrg2a is only required early: mutants develop MFF defects between 30 and 36 hpf (Fig 6), and we did not detect any later-stage body epidermis defects corresponding to those of lgl2 mutants (data not shown).	49035	49254
26110643	Yet concomitant loss of Lgl2 rescues the early MFF defects of nrg2 mutants (Fig 10), while concomitant loss of ErbB2 signaling rescues the late defects of lgl2 mutants.	49255	49423
26110643	Genetically, these findings argue that Lgl2 is epistatic to Nrg2a –ErbB signaling during early MFF morphogenesis: in double-deficient zebrafish embryos, the Lgl2 phenotype (no MFF defects) was dominant over the nrg2a phenotype.	49424	49651
26110643	This suggests that Nrg2a –ErbB acts at least partly by blocking Lgl2 activity, and that the MFF phenotype of Nrg2a-deficient embryos is at least partially caused by Lgl2 overactivity.	49652	49835
26110643	That proposition fits with previous findings that EGF treatment suppresses LGL2 transcription in human cell culture systems, but confirming it will require analyzing Lgl2 protein levels in nrg2a mutant embryos.	49836	50046
26110643	ErbB signaling, on the other hand, appears to be epistatic to Lgl2 during later epidermal homeostasis and carcinogenesis: in ErbB2/Lgl2-double deficient zebrafish larvae, the erbb2 phenotype (no EMT, no keratinocyte hyperproliferation) was dominant over the lgl2 phenotype.	50047	50320
26110643	Those findings, together with increased levels of ErbB signaling mediator pERK in lgl2 mutants, had led to the conclusion that Lgl2 acts by blocking ErbB signaling, and that the MFF phenotype of Lgl2-deficient embryos is at least partially caused by ErbB overactivity.	50321	50589
26110643	Together, our data and those of Reischauer et al. suggest the existence of a mutual negative feedback mechanism in which Lgl2 blocks ErbB signaling and vice versa.	50590	50753
26110643	However, these opposing interactions occur at different developmental stages, and may involve different ErbB signaling molecules.	50754	50883
26110643	Thus, early MFF ridge cell morphogenesis involves Nrg2a, most likely acting through ErbB2/3 and the PI3K –AKT signal transduction pathway (Fig 9), whereas later carcinogenesis involves the ERK MAPK signal transduction pathway, most likely activated by EGF and ErbB1/2.	50884	51152
26110643	Although studies of Neuregulins have primarily addressed their roles during neuronal or neural crest development [109, 110], expression of the NRG ligand family has also been described in epithelial contexts, most notably in mammary gland epithelium.	51153	51403
26110643	Neuregulins and their ErbB receptors are expressed in murine embryonic mammary gland epithelium.	51404	51500
26110643	Expression of Neuregulins 1, 2, 3, and 4 has also been reported in breast cancer cell lines and ductal carcinomas.	51501	51615
26110643	There is also some evidence that NRG2 has an epidermal role.	51616	51676
26110643	A transcriptional profiling study of differential gene expression during human epidermal differentiation found that NRG2 was expressed in basal keratinocytes, while suprabasal cells expressed the known NRG2 receptor ERBB3 and its likely co-receptor ERBB2.	51677	51932
26110643	In light of these findings, our data regarding the role of Nrg2a during zebrafish MFF development may also provide new insights into regulation of epithelial polarity and morphogenesis during mammalian epithelial development and carcinogenesis.	51933	52177
26110643	Overall, GBT technology provides a valuable leap forward in using the vertebrate zebrafish model to identify important molecular players and to gain new insights into the genetic control of skin biology and disease.	52178	52393
26110643	Adult fish and embryo care was performed according to standard protocols approved by the on-site Institutional and Public Animal Care and Use Committees.	52394	52547
26110643	Wild-type stocks were derived from the offspring of adult zebrafish obtained from Segrest Farms (Segrest Farms, Florida, USA).	52548	52674
26110643	Non-GBT transgenic marker lines used were enhancer trap ET37 [46, 60], ubiquitously expressed membrane-bound EGFP Tg(Ola.Actb:Hsa.hras-egfp) vu119 [75, 114] and Tg(krt4:GFP) gz7.	52675	52853
26110643	Live larvae were imaged for mRFP fluorescence on an Axio ImagerZ.1 ApoTome microscope (Zeiss) with AxioVision software (Zeiss).	52854	52981
26110643	Z-stack images were flattened using the AxioVision Multi-Image Projection (MIP) tool.	52982	53067
26110643	SCORE imaging techniques were used to hold live larvae and optimized for high-quality fluorescent imaging as follows: live larvae were transferred into 2.5–2.6% methylcellulose and drawn into borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments WPI #1B120-3).	53068	53334
26110643	80% glycerol was used as the imaging medium between capillary and cover slip.	53335	53412
26110643	Brightfield images of live larvae were obtained either by mounting the specimen in 1.5% methylcellulose and imaging with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using the Zeiss AxionCam HRc camera and Axiovision software, or by SCORE imaging on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope using a Canon PowerShot A640 camera with Remote Capture Task and Canon Image Browser software.	53413	53769
26110643	Cre-mediated excision of GBT mutagenic cassettes was performed as previously described.	53770	53857
26110643	fras1 and hmcn1 reversion experiments were scored at 48 hpf; nrg2a reversion experiments were scored at 96 hpf.	53858	53969
26110643	Results were graphed with PRISM software (Graphpad); p-value and significance were calculated with t-tests.	53970	54077
26110643	Candidate loci for ZIP GBT insertions were identified from fusion transcripts using 5’RACE on race-ready cDNA (RR-cDNA) as previously described or from genomic DNA (gDNA) using TAIL PCR [116, 117].	54078	54275
26110643	Candidate insertion loci were confirmed or rejected by genotyping 8 individual sibling larvae, 4 mRFP+ and 4 mRFP-, for a correctly oriented RP2 insertion within the candidate locus.	54276	54458
26110643	Individual genotyping reactions were designed to identify the genomic-transposon junction (“junction product”) within a specific locus of interest using one transposon-specific primer and one gene-specific (GS) primer.	54459	54677
26110643	A candidate insertion locus was confirmed if all mRFP+ siblings were positive for the junction product within that locus of interest and all mRFP- siblings were negative for that same junction product.	54678	54879
26110643	The transposon-specific primers were 5R-mRFP-P2 (5’-CCTTGAAGCGCATGAACTCCTTGAT-3’) (used with all forward (“F”) GS primers) and 3R-GM-P2 (5’-TGGGATTACACATGGCATGGATGAAC-3’) (used with all reverse (“R”) GS primers).	54880	55092
26110643	GS primers were as follows: GNT-SEC0078-F3 (5’-CAAGGCACAGCAAGGCTGGTGTA-3’), GNT-SEC0078-R0 (5’-CGGACAGATTTTCACTCATACATTGCCT-3’), RT-SEC0156-F1 (5’-CTGCTCAAAGGCTCTGATCTTGAACC-3’), RT-SEC0156-R1 (5’-ccacacagaccctacaggacgaatg-3’), RT-SEC0175-F1 (5’-GCTGTTCACCCTTCTGTTGGAAGGTT-3’), RT-GBT0175-R1 (5’-AGTGGAGACAGAGGCTGAAGGAGGAT-3’), GNT-GBT0196-F1 (5’-GACTGAAGTCTGAGGACCTTGC-3’), GNT-nrg2a-F1 (5’-gcagggaacagttaattgcttgacag-3’), GNT-nrg2a-R4 (5’- ggctgaatcttggcaacaatgcaac -3’), GNT-GBT0245-F1 (5’-CTTCTCAAATGGCTCCTTGCCTC-3’), GNT-GBT0263-R1 (5’-TCCAACACCCTCCAACACC-3’), GNT-GBT0261-F1 (5’-TATGGCTGTATATCATCACTGGTTGG-3’), GNT-GBT0275-F2 (5’-TTAGAAACGGCAGGAAACCGAG-3’), GNT-GBT0316-F1 (5’-TTGGTTACGTCCAGTGCGTC-3’), GNT-SEC0325-F1 (5’-CCAGTCCGCCGCTGAGGG-3’), GNT-SEC0325-R1 (5’-CGAATTGCTGTGAGATAGCGTTGAATAG-3’).	55093	55897
26110643	Transcripts from nrg2a alternate first exons, currently designated 1B and 1C, were manually identified and/or confirmed as follows.	55898	56029
26110643	The presence of endogenous exon 1B transcript was confirmed using forward GS primer RT-nrg2a-F3 (5’-ACACTTATCCATGCTGCTCATCGG-3’) with reverse GS primer in nrg2a exon 4 RT-nrg2a-R3 (5’-CGTTGCATCTTCTGGCATGGC-3’) in 2 dpf wild-type cDNA.	56030	56264
26110643	Exon 1C was identified via 5’RACE on wild-type RR-cDNA as previously described.	56265	56344
26110643	The presence of endogenous 1C transcript was confirmed using forward GS primer RT-nrg2a-F3.1 (5’-AGGCGTAAGGACAGCCAAACTC-3’) with RT-nrg2a-R3 in cDNA from nrg2a +/+ and nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygous (nrg2a +/-) siblings.	56345	56564
26110643	The presence of nrg2a 1B-mRFP and 1C-mRFP fusion transcripts were confirmed using either GS primer RT-nrg2a-F3 or RT-nrg2a-F3.1, respectively, with mRFP reverse primer 5R-mRFP-P2 in cDNA from nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygous (nrg2a +/-) and nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt (nrg2a -/-) homozygous mutant siblings.	56565	56866
26110643	We were unable to confirm the presence of an endogenous transcript containing the predicted exon 1A.	56867	56967
26110643	Embryos obtained from nrg2a +/- intercrosses were genotyped using three primers (GNT-nrg2a-F1, GNT-nrg2a-R4, and 5R-mRFP-P2) in a single reaction, yielding either an 800 bp fragment for homozygous wild-types or a 1091 bp fragment for homozygous mutants, and both fragments for heterozygous siblings.	56968	57267
26110643	The isoform 1A sequence corresponds to predicted Nrg2a isoforms X7 –X9 (GenBank accession numbers XM_005161329, XM_005161330, XM_005161331) in Zv10 and to the sequence reported by Honjo et al. (GenBank accession number NM_001099254).	57268	57501
26110643	The isoform 1B sequence corresponds to those of predicted Nrg2a isoforms X1 –X4 (GenBank accession numbers NM_001099254, XM_009295459, XM_00929546, XM_005161327) in Zv10, and the isoform 1C sequence to that of predicted Nrg2a isoform X5 (GenBank accession number XM_009295461) in Zv10.	57502	57787
26110643	Larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and dehydrated/rehydrated through an ethanol/PBST series.	57788	57892
26110643	Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) was performed as previously described [57, 58, 118].	57893	57986
26110643	DIG-labeled probes were generated from cDNA clones as described in for fras1, hmcn1, and grip1, in for msxc, and in for mRFP.	57987	58112
26110643	cDNA clones for ahrgef25b, fkbp10b, and erbb3a were obtained from SourceBioScience, the cDNA clone for egfra was a gift from M. Sonawane.	58113	58250
26110643	Probes for endogenous nrg2a were obtained with DIG-labeled nrg2a antisense riboprobe generated with primers RT-nrg2a-F4 (5’-TCCAGTGTTGGCAGACGAAGG-3’) and RT-nrg2a-R2 (5’-TTGGGCATGTATAACCGCAGGG-3’).	58251	58448
26110643	For nrg2a, the in situ protocol was slightly modified from.	58449	58508
26110643	Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked with either blocking buffer (2% lamb serum (vol/vol), 2 mg/ml BSA) or 2% Boehringer Blocking Reagent (11096176001, Roche) in maleic acid buffer containing 0.1% Tween20 (MABT) for 4 h at room temperature prior to immunoreaction with anti-DIG-AP Fab fragments antibody (11093274910, Roche, 1:500).	58509	58845
26110643	Fixed, stained WISH larvae were rehydrated through an ethanol/PBST series into 80% glycerol or into benzylbenzoate/benzylalcohol (2:1).	58846	58981
26110643	Single images were obtained on a SteREO Lumar.V12 stereomicroscope (Zeiss) using AxioVision software (Zeiss).	58982	59091
26110643	Single focal plane images for creating multi-image extended depth of field projections from brightfield images (“manual Z-stack”) were obtained using SCORE imaging techniques on an Axioplan2 microscope (Zeiss) with a PowerShot A640 camera (Canon) and ZoomBrowser EX software (Canon).	59092	59375
26110643	Extended depth of field projections were generated in Image J (NIH) from multiple single focal plane images using StackReg and Extended Depth of Field plugins.	59376	59535
26110643	To generate expression vectors pT3Ts-nrg2a-1B-mRFP and pT3Ts-nrg2a-1C-mRFP, the AUG-free mRFP coding sequence was amplified from pGBT-RP2 using primers CDS-GBT_mRFP-F1 (5’- AGATCTCGCTAGCAATTATGGTTCAGCCGGAATTCACCC-3’) and CDS-GBT_mRFP-R1 (5’-aaactagtcttaggctccggtggag-3’) and subcloned into a Strataclone vector backbone (Agilent).	59536	59866
26110643	mRFP was then subcloned into the SpeI and BglII sites of pT3Ts-Cre to create pT3Ts-mRFP.	59867	59955
26110643	The nrg2a-mRFP isoforms were amplified from cDNA obtained from nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt (nrg2a -/-) homozygous mutant embryos using either forward primer rob-nrg2a-1A (5’-ATACTAGTATGCTGCTCATCGGGGT-3’) or rob-nrg2a-1B (5’-ATACTAGTATGTCAGAGGGTAAGAAGAAGGAAC-3’), respectively, with reverse primer rob-nrg2a-R1 (5’-CCTCATCTTGATCTCGCCCTT-3’) and subcloned into the pT3Ts-mRFP backbone.	59956	60335
26110643	The pT3TS-EGFPCAAX expression vector was created as follows: EGFPCAAX was amplified from 384.pME-EGFPCAAX plasmid using primers CDS_EGFP_CAAX-F1 (5’-GAAGGATCCATCATGGTGAGCAAGGG-3’) and CDS-EGFP_CAAX-R1 (5’-CAAACTAGTCAGGAGAGCACACACTT-3’) and ligated into the SpeI and BglII site of pT3TS-Cre.	60336	60626
26110643	To generate pT3TS_nlsTagBFP, a synthetic SV-40 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was added to the N-terminus of Tag-BFP (pTagBFP-N, Evrogen, FP172), which was then cloned into the SpeI and BglII site of pT3TS-Cre.	60627	60842

26110643	1 dpf injected embryos were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope.	61118	61192
26110643	Larvae for cryosections were fixed in either 4% PFA or EAF (40% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, 4% formaldehyde in PBS) for 3h at RT, washed several times with PBST, embedded in 15% sucrose/1% agarose in PBS, incubated in 30% sucrose/PBS overnight and mounted in tissue freezing medium (Leica).	61193	61480
26110643	10 or 20 μm sections of tails were obtained using a Leica CM1850 cryostat.	61481	61555
26110643	Larval heads were used for genotyping.	61556	61594
26110643	Immunostaining was performed essentially as previously described using the following primary antibodies: anti-collagen II (DSHB II-II6B3-c, 1:200), rabbit anti-RFP (Abcam; ab62341, 1:200), chicken anti-GFP (Invitrogen; A10262, 1:300), mouse anti-p63 BC4A4 (Zytomend, 1:200), and mouse anti-MAP Kinase, activated (Sigma, M9692, 1:50).	61595	61928
26110643	For pAkt staining, cryosections of EAF-fixed embryos were washed with PBS-TritonX, followed by an antigen retrieval in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 9.0 for 5 min at 98°C, blocking in 5% sheep serum and antibody incubation with rabbit anti-pAkt (S473) (Cell signaling #4060, 1:50) (modified after).	61929	62223
26110643	Secondary antibodies were anti-rabbitAlexa555, anti-mouseAlexa488, anti-mouseAlexa647, and anti-chickenAlexa488 (all Invitrogen, 1:200).	62224	62360

26110643	Images were taken using a Zeiss Confocal (LSM710 META).	62592	62647
26110643	A 10 mM stock of PD168393 (EMD Millipore Calbiochem #513033) was prepared with DMSO and diluted in embryo water to concentrations of 1 and 20 μM.	62648	62793
26110643	30 to 40 embryos were randomly selected for each treatment group and placed into Petri dishes (35–1007, BD Falcon).	62794	62909
26110643	To examine the effect of inhibitor on the earliest stages of documented MFF phenotype through early pectoral fin fold development, PD168393 treatment and control groups were incubated from 24 hpf through 52 hpf.	62910	63121

26110643	Blinded treatment and control groups were and scored at 96 hpf with a Stemi 2000-C (Zeiss) dissecting microscope.	63195	63308
26110643	Scoring was performed at 96 hpf to verify that inhibitor-induced morphological changes persisted beyond the end of the treatment window itself.	63309	63452
26110643	Results were graphed with PRISM software (Graphpad); p-value and significance were calculated with Chi-square analysis.	63453	63572

26110643	Larvae 48 hpf or older were sorted by MFF phenotype and fluorescence.	63822	63891
26110643	Sorted or selected embryos were transferred into glass Petri dishes for all subsequent processing (Corning) and fixed in Trump’s fixative (4% formaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2)) for a minimum of 24 hr.	63892	64124
26110643	Following fixation, zebrafish were secondarily fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated through an ethanol series and embedded into Embed 812/Araldite resin.	64125	64306

26516699	Cancer is a compendium of perturbed genome functions and is characterized by the deregulation of several genes and their regulatory molecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs) [1, 2].	0	179
26516699	In general, miRNAs are 19–24 nucleotides long, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate the expression of 30% of protein-coding genes at the posttranscriptional level [3, 4].	180	351
26516699	These miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as pre-miRNAs, which are processed by Drosha, to form hairpin-like intermediates called pre-miRNAs, which are approximately 70–100 nucleotides long and have two nucleotide overhangs at their 3′ ends [5–8].	352	607
26516699	Exportin-5 transports pre-miRNAs out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm for further processing by dicer [9, 10], which converts the pre-miRNA into a 19–24 nucleotide long, double-stranded, mature miRNA.	608	813
26516699	The guide strand of mature miRNA gets incorporated into a complex to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes the specific target mRNA through complementary base pairing, and consequently, either degrades or inhibits translation of the target mRNA [6, 12].	814	1093
26516699	Recent reports have shown that miRNAs can play an important role in diverse biological functions such as development, normal cell physiology and pathological conditions like abnormal cell proliferation [13–15] and cancer [16, 17] including pancreatic cancer (PC).	1094	1357
26516699	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the 10th leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States [18–21].	1358	1525
26516699	PC has a five-year survival rate of less than 6%.	1526	1575
26516699	This high mortality rate among PC patients is due to the lack of early symptoms, diagnostic and prognostic markers, metastatic disease at the time of clinical diagnosis, poor response to therapy, and a high rate of recurrence.	1576	1802
26516699	Thus, in order to identify suitable early diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets to combat this disease, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of PC.	1803	1972
26516699	Several studies have shown the abnormal expression of miRNAs including miR-21, Let-7b, miR-100, miR-217, and miR-216 in PC and have proposed them as candidates for early diagnosis and potential molecular targets [23, 24].	1973	2194
26516699	However, due to unavailability of early stage PC biopsies from humans, the stage-specific deregulation of miRNA during PC progression is largely unknown.	2195	2348
26516699	In this study, we investigated the expression profile of miRNAs at various stages of PC progression using the KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre mouse model.	2349	2489
26516699	This model is histopathologically recapitulates human PC and enables one to monitor the progression of PC from the onset of precursor lesions to cancer development.	2490	2654
26516699	Hence, understanding the role of miRNA in PC pathogenesis using this model will subsequently help to develop early detection markers, as well as therapeutic and preventive strategies for PC.	2655	2845
26516699	Further, this study examined the expression of various components of the miRNA biosynthetic machinery and some of their selected target genes for differentially expressed miRNAs.	2846	3024
26516699	Findings were extrapolated to human PC tissues and cell lines by investigating the expression of differentially expressed miRNAs as observed in the KrasG12D mouse model.	3025	3194
26516699	The overall objective of this study was to establish a global differential expression profile of miRNAs during the course of initiation and progression of PC.	3195	3353
26516699	Moving forward, the identified miRNAs can be used to create novel biomarker(s) for validation studies and therapeutic targets to combat this lethal disease.	3354	3510
26516699	Our previous study using the KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC/floxed KrasG12D) PC mouse model showed the presence of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions as early as 10 weeks of age; these lesions progressed to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and metastasized to the liver, lungs, and intestines by 50 weeks of age.	3511	3839
26516699	We observed PanIN-I lesions at 10 weeks of age that progressed to PanIN I, II, III lesions at 25 weeks of age, replacing larger portions of the pancreatic parenchyma.	3840	4006
26516699	At 40 weeks of age, the majority of the parenchyma was replaced by PanIN III and extensive desmoplasia, whereas at 50 weeks of age, animals replaced the pancreatic parenchyma with full-blown PDAC, and metastatic spread involving the colon, liver, and lungs in 60–70% of the animals.	4007	4289
26516699	In order to identify the deregulated miRNAs during PC progression, we used affymetrix miRNA microarray to analyze the global miRNA expression in the pancreas of 25-week old KC animals (KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre) and its age-matched littermate control mice (LSL KrasG12D).	4290	4553
26516699	We chose 25-week old mice as the base line because, at this time point, the mice had only developed PanIN I, II, and III lesions but not PDAC.	4554	4696
26516699	Hence, this age represented the stage prior to the onset of PC.	4697	4760
26516699	Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using QC tool software.	4761	4832
26516699	The miRNA microarray analysis for the KC animals compared to controls revealed that miR-150, miR-494, miR-138, miR-148a*, miR-216a, and miR-217 (p-value = 0.01) were significantly downregulated (Table 1), whereas, miR-146b, miR-205, miR-31, miR-192, and miR-21 (p-value = 0.01) were significantly upregulated (Table 2).	4833	5152
26516699	A majority of the miRNAs were downregulated compared to the number of miRNAs that were upregulated in the KC animals (Supplementary table S1).	5153	5295
26516699	The panel of differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by real-time PCR using TaqMan assays, and the results were consistent with the miRNA microarray data that showed up-regulation of miR-21, miR-221, miR-100 and miR-26a and down-regulation of miR-26b, miR-141, miR-96, miR483-3p, miR-216, and miR-217 in the KC compared to control mice (Figure 1A).	5296	5651
26516699	The downregulation of the majority of miRNAs led us to investigate the expression status of the miRNA biosynthetic machinery during the progression of PC using the KC mouse model.	5652	5831
26516699	Real-time PCR analysis revealed that expression of Dicer, Drosha, Exportin-5, TRKRA, and TARBP2 were downregulated, while expression of DGCR8 and Ago2 were upregulated in KC mice compared to control littermates (Figure 1B).	5832	6055
26516699	The top differentially deregulated miRNAs were further analyzed at 10, 30, 40, and 50 weeks of PC progression.	6056	6166
26516699	At 10 weeks of age, expression of miR-141 and Let-7b were upregulated, but their expression was not statistically significant.	6167	6293
26516699	On the other hand, miR-146b, miR-34c, miR-223, miR-195 (p-value = 0.031) and miR-216 (p-value = 0.063) were downregulated in KC mice compared to control littermates.	6294	6459
26516699	However, no significant difference was observed in the expression of pancreas-specific miR-217 (Figure 2A).	6460	6567
26516699	At 30 weeks of age, the expression of miR-216 (p-value = 0.016), miR-217 (p-value = 0.0078), miR-150 (p-value =0.023), Let-7b (p-value = 0.031,) and miR-96 were significantly downregulated, whereas the expression of miR-146b (p-value = 0.0078), miR-205, (p-value - 0.0078), miR-21, miR-195 (p-value = 0.031), and miR-34c (p-value = 0.063) were significantly upregulated in KC animals compared to control animals (Figure 2B).	6568	6992
26516699	At 40 weeks of age, the expression of miR-216, miR-217, miR-223, miR-141, miR-483-3p (p-value = 0.031), miR-195, Let-7b (p-value = 0.063) and miR-96 were significantly downregulated; on the other hand, the expression of miR-21, miR-205, miR-146b (p-value = 0.031), and miR-34c (p-value = 0.063) were upregulated in KC mice compared to the control animals (Figure 2C).	6993	7360
26516699	Further, at 50 weeks of age, the expression of miR-216, miR-217, miR-345, miR-141, miR-483-3p, miR-26b, miR-96, Let-7b (p-value = 0.01), miR-100, miR-26a and miR-150 (p-value = 0.094) were further downregulated in KC animals compared to control mice (Figure 2D).	7361	7623
26516699	The expressions of miR-216 and miR-217 were also progressively reduced in KC mice, but the expressions of miR-21, miR-205, miR-146b, miR-34c, and miR-223 progressively increased (Figure 1A, 2A–2D).	7624	7821
26516699	At 50 weeks of age, variation in expression of miR-221 was not statistically significant between the KC and control animals (Figure 2D).	7822	7958
26516699	The overall trends of miRNA expression during the mouse PC progression model are shown in Figures 2E and 2F.	7959	8067
26516699	In order to confirm the expression of genes targeted by the differentially expressed miRNAs in PC, first we performed in silico analysis using an online bioinformatics program, mirecords/miRDB, which utilizes miRanda, Target scan, Pic Tar, etc., to predict several potential targets genes (Table 1 and Table 2).	8068	8379
26516699	A few of these target genes, that are important in PC development, were analyzed by Real time PCR at 50 weeks of age.	8380	8497
26516699	The expression of Kras (5-fold), Galectin-3 (5-fold), EGFR (3.5-fold), TGFβ1 (3.5-fold), cMyc (2.8-fold), Fut8 (2.5-fold), and Bcl2 (2-fold) were significantly upregulated, while the expression of PTEN was significantly downregulated in KC animals compared to controls (Figure 2G).	8498	8779
26516699	In order to extrapolate the mouse miRNA microarray data to human PC, we next checked the expressions of a few differentially expressed miRNAs in eight human PC cell lines, as well as in the immortalized normal pancreatic ductal cell line (HPDE).	8780	9025
26516699	Results showed the downregulation of miR-345, miR-96, and Let-7b in the majority of the PC cell lines compared to the HPDE cells (Figure 3A), indicating that these miRNAs were expressed in ductal cells rather than in tumor stroma.	9026	9256
26516699	Also, the expression analysis of miRNA biosynthetic machinery in PC cell lines showed significant downregulation of Drosha, Dicer, and Exportin-5 compared to the HPDE cell line (Figure 3B).	9257	9446
26516699	The differentially expressed miRNAs that were identified from mouse miRNA array data were further analyzed in eight samples of human PC tissues (Figure 3C) and their corresponding eight adjacent normal tissue (Figure 3D).	9447	9668
26516699	The expression of miR-223, miR-483-3p (p-value = 0.01), 146b, 205 (p-value = 0.001), 221, 21 (p-value = 0.023), 195, 34c and miR-26a (p-value = 0.0078) were significantly upregulated, whereas the expression of miR-216, miR-141, miR-217, Let-7b (p-value = 0.001), and Let-150 (p-value = 0.01) were significantly downregulated in human PC tissues as compared to the cancer-adjacent normal tissues (Figure 3E).	9669	10076
26516699	Additionally, the expression of proteins involved in miRNA biosynthesis, such as Drosha, Dicer, and Exportin-5, were analyzed and found to be significantly downregulated in human PC tissues as compared to the cancer-adjacent normal tissues (Figure 3F).	10077	10329
26516699	The role of Let-7 family members and their target genes are well known in various cancer.	10330	10419
26516699	Previous studies have shown that restoration of Let-7 results in downregulation of oncogenic Kras, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase.	10420	10618
26516699	Similarly, HMGA2 is a direct target of Let-7 family members [29–31].	10619	10687
26516699	Our results in the KC mouse model also showed downregulation of Let-7b during PC progression.	10688	10781
26516699	Further, our in silico analysis of Let-7b revealed several target genes like MUC4, NCOA3, KRAS, HMGA2, which are critical in PC pathogenesis.	10782	10923
26516699	Herein, we overexpressed Let-7b and its scramble vectors in two PC cell lines, CD18/HPAF and Capan1, by infection with a lenti-viral supernatant (collected after 48 and 72 hours post transfection of 293FT cells) after mixing with 4 μg/ml of polybrene and analyzing its effect on downstream targets.	10924	11222
26516699	The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells were sorted by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) (Figure 4A); Let-7b overexpression was confirmed by TaqMan assays using real-time PCR (Figure 4B).	11223	11430
26516699	We observed eight-fold and four-fold increase in the expression of Let-7b in Capan 1 and CD18/HPAF cells, respectively, compared to vector control cells (Figure 4B).	11431	11596
26516699	Our results from western blot analysis revealed downregulation of MUC4, KRAS, MSST1, and Cyclin D1, and upregulation of caspase-9 in Let-7b overexpressing CD18/HPAF and Capan1 PC cells compared to vector transfected control cells (Figure 4C); β-actin was used as a loading control.	11597	11878
26516699	These findings suggest that downregulation of Let-7b plays an important role in PC progression.	11879	11974
26516699	Due to unavailability of early stage samples from human PC patients, we utilized the well-characterized spontaneous mouse model (KC) of PC [32–36] to analyze the global miRNA expression profile.	11975	12169
26516699	Notably, this model histopathologically recapitulates human PC.	12170	12233
26516699	Using this PC model, we and others have observed PanIN lesions at as early as 10 weeks of age, as well as PDAC with metastasis (in 60–70% of KC animals) to distant organs by 50 weeks of age [26, 35].	12234	12433
26516699	Although high-grade PanINs (PanIN III) were rarely observed before 20 weeks of age, their frequency increased progressively with age (25–50 weeks); however, low- and high-grade PanINs were observed starting at 25 weeks of age.	12434	12660
26516699	Therefore, the present study analyzed the global miRNA expression profile at 25 weeks of age, when the majority of acinar cells were replaced by high-grade PanINs and marked desmoplasia.	12661	12847
26516699	Using miRNA microarray analysis, we identified several differentially expressed miRNAs in KC animals compared to control mice, with most of the miRNAs having tumor suppressive functions (Tables 1 and 2).	12848	13051
26516699	The microRNA microarray revealed significant downregulation of miR-494 at 25 weeks of PC progression in the KC mouse model.	13052	13175
26516699	A recent study has also shown significant downregulation of miR-494 in human PC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, correlating with PC metastasis and decrease free survival in patients.	13176	13365
26516699	Furthermore, decreased expression of miR-494 is due to loss of SMAD4 in PC.	13366	13441
26516699	Ectopic expression of miR-494 in PDAC cells resulted in downregulation of FOXM1, inhibition of β-catenin nuclear translocation, decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and greater sensitivity to gemcitabine.	13442	13660
26516699	The expression of pancreas-specific tumor suppressors miR-217 and miR-216 were unaltered at 10 weeks of age (presence of PanIN-Ia and Ib), but progressively decreased from 25 – 50 weeks of age as PanIN lesions progressed to PDAC.	13661	13890
26516699	(Figure 1A, 2A–2D).	7802	7821
26516699	In addition to KC mice, we also observed a significant downregulation of miR-216 and miR-217 in human PC tissue (Figure 3E); these results are in agreement with earlier studies on human PC [38–43] that show downregulation of miR-217 in 76.2% (16/21) of PC tissue as well as cell lines.	13911	14196
26516699	Similarly, the expression of miR-216 is significantly downregulated in PC.	14197	14271
26516699	Our in silico analysis revealed that miR-216 and miR-217 potentially target many important genes that play critical roles during the pathogenesis of PC (Table 1); and the downregulation of miR-217 and miR-216 suggests their potential as tumor suppressors in PC by targeting downstream targets, particularly the Kras oncogene and Janus kinase 2.	14272	14616
26516699	In addition to pancreas-specific miRNAs, we observed significant downregulation of miR-141 and Let-7b in human PDAC and in KC mice from 25–50 weeks of age compared to controls (Figure 1A, 2B–2D, 3E).	14617	14816
26516699	Our human PDAC results were in agreement with earlier reports showing loss of Let-7b and miR-141 expression in PC samples compared to cancer-adjacent normal tissue [46, 47].	14817	14990
26516699	In vitro analysis of Let-7b overexpressed HPAF/CD18, and Capan1 PC cell lines showed significant downregulation of MUC4, Kras, MSST1, and Cyclin D1, and upregulation of cleaved caspase-9 (Figure 4C).	14991	15190
26516699	Although the functional analysis of this Let-7b overexpression remains to be determined using our in vitro system, however previous studies have shown that overexpression of Let-7b in Capan1 cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation by downregulating Kras, Myc, and HMGA2, and activating mitogen-activated protein kinase [28–31, 46, 47].	15191	15533
26516699	In addition to affecting proliferation, the increased expression of cleaved caspase-9 in both HPAF/CD18 and Capan1 cells suggests it has a pro-apoptotic role that remains to be determined.	15534	15722
26516699	Further, Kent et al. (2009) reported downregulation of miRNA-200 family members, including miRNA-141, in PC cell lines and observed a positive correlation between the expression of miR-200 family members and E-cadherin expression, as well as a negative correlation with the zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) [48, 49].	15723	16050
26516699	The transcription of miR-200 family members (miR-141 and miR-200c) is suppressed by ZEB1, which activates epithelial differentiation in PC, colorectal, and breast cancer cells.	16051	16227
26516699	Epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) activators, such as transforming growth factor beta 2 and ZEB1, have 3′ UTR binding sites for miR-200 family members.	16228	16389
26516699	Therefore, existence of a feedback loop between ZEB1 and miR-141 serves to stabilize the EMT process and regulate the invasion of cancer cells.	16390	16533
26516699	The present study also revealed significant downregulation of miR-150 during the progression of PC in both mice and humans (Figure 2A–2D, 3E).	16534	16676
26516699	These results contradict a previous study on human PC, possibly attributable to species and/or PC stage variation.	16677	16791
26516699	Similarly, the expression of miR-345 and miR-96 were significantly downregulated during the progression of PC in the mouse model (Figure 2D), which is consistent with previous reports [39, 40, 50].	16792	16989
26516699	However, a recent report in colorectal cancer patient tissues has shown significantly methylated mir-345 promoter region compared to the non-cancerous, adenoma, and normal colon tissues; further, ectopic over-expression of mir-345 in colorectal cancer cells significantly reduced cell proliferation by inhibiting the translation of anti-apoptotic BAG3 gene.	16990	17347
26516699	These studies suggest a pro-apoptotic function of miR-345; its downregulation during PC progression may be associated with promoter methylation.	17348	17492
26516699	The miR-26a miRNA inhibits the expression of c-myc, Cyclin D3 and E2, and cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK4 and CDK6.	17493	17614
26516699	Also, it stimulates CDK-inhibitors p14(ARF) and p21(CIP1) expression in an EZH2-dependent manner, suggesting an anti-proliferative role.	17615	17751
26516699	Accordingly, we observed significant downregulation of miR-26a in KC mice at 50 weeks of age, although it was upregulated at 25 weeks in KC mice and in human PC tissues compared to normal tissues (Figure 2B, 2D and 3E).	17752	17971
26516699	Recently, significant downregulation of miR-26a was also reported in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and cell lines (53); its ectopic expression has been shown to downregulate EZH2 expression, thereby inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest to decrease cell proliferation and colony formation (53).	17972	18267
26516699	A decreased expression of miR-483-3p was observed during the progression of mouse PC, whereas it is overexpressed in human PC (Figure 2A–2D and 3E).	18268	18416
26516699	These results are in agreement with previous reports that show miR-483-3p upregulation in PC tissue compared to the cancer adjacent normal tissue [53, 54].	18417	18572
26516699	Furthermore, they showed that ectopic expression of miR-483-3p significantly inhibited the expression of DPC4/Smad4 protein in PC cell lines, leading to increased cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro [53, 54].	18573	18794
26516699	The miRNA microarray also revealed decreased expression of miR-148a and miR-451 in mouse PC, an observation consistent with other reports [40, 41, 55–58].	18795	18949
26516699	Similarly, another study showed that the expression of miR-148a/b and miR-375 were significantly downregulated in the PC developed from p48Cre;KrasG12D transgenic animals compared to the normal controls.	18950	19153
26516699	Several studies have demonstrated the upregulation and importance of miR-21 in PC patients.	19154	19245
26516699	Although the expression of miR-21 expression does not correlate with tumor size, differentiation, nodal status, or T stage, its overexpression was associated with poor patient outcomes and overall survival compared to patients without miR-21 or patients with faint/focal expression in node-negative disease [60, 61].	19246	19562
26516699	Overexpression of miR-21 is associated with both high Ki67 proliferation index and liver metastasis, whereas inhibition of miR-21 expression in MiaPaCa-2 PC cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation, increased cell death, and increased expression of the tumor suppressor gene like programmed cell death 4 (PCD4) gene.	19563	19885
26516699	In addition, miR-21 has been shown to suppress the activity of the tumor suppressor gene tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), thereby promoting tumorigenesis.	19886	20029
26516699	In line with these reports, our study also indicates the progressive increase in miR-21 and miR-205 from 10 to 50 weeks of age in KC mice compared to the control animals (Figure 1A and 2A–2D).	20030	20222
26516699	Similarly, we also observed upregulation of miR-21 and miR-205 in human PC samples compared to cancer- adjacent normal tissue (Figure 3E).	20223	20361
26516699	Several reports have also shown elevated expression of miR-21 and miR-205 in a panel of PC cell lines and tissues compared to the normal controls [40–42, 50, 55, 60, 65–68].	20362	20535
26516699	Rieu et al. also reported in the KC animals, progressive increases in miR-21 and miR-205 expression from PanIN lesions to full-blown PDAC, with strongest expression of miR-21 in precursor lesions with phenotypic changes in the ducts.	20536	20769
26516699	Further, Rieu et al. have shown that expression of miR-21, miR-221, miR-222, and Let-7a increases with PanIN grade, with the strongest expression in the hyperplastic ducts with PanIN 2/3 lesions.	20770	20965
26516699	Similarly, the expression of miR-10, miR-21, miR-100 and miR-155 was shown to increase in p48-Cre/KrasG12D mice when compared to control animals.	20966	21111
26516699	We observed downregulation of miR-146b, miR-34c, and miR-223 at 10 weeks of age; however, their expression increased with the progression of PC in KC animals compared to control animals (Figure 2A–2D).	21112	21313
26516699	We also observed upregulation of these miRNAs in the human PC samples (Figure 3E).	21314	21396
26516699	Notably, the expression of miR-34c is activated by p53 following DNA damage and serves as an important regulator of c-Myc expression, acting downstream to the p38 MAPK/MK2 pathway.	21397	21577
26516699	Deregulation of the miRNA biosynthetic machinery results in differential expression of miRNAs and downstream target genes.	21578	21700
26516699	Abnormal expression of this machinery is associated with hematological malignancies, ovarian cancer, and neuroblastoma.	21701	21820
26516699	In conjunction with these reports, our results also revealed significant downregulation of many miRNA biosynthetic pathway components, such as dicer, TARBP2, and exportin-5, both during the progression of PC in KC animals (Figure 1B) and in PC cell lines and tissues compared to normal tissues (Figure 3B and 3F).	21821	22134
26516699	The predicted target genes for differentially expressed miRNAs (Table 1 and Table 2) such as Kras (5-fold), Galectin-3 (5-fold), EGFR (3.5-fold), TGFβ1 (3.5-fold), cMyc (2.8-fold), Fut8 (2.5-fold), and Bcl2 (2-fold) were upregulated.	22135	22368
26516699	On the other hand, PTEN was observed to be downregulated in KC mice, which highlights the importance of deregulated miRNA expression in the pathology of PC (Figure 2G).	22369	22537
26516699	Both miR-216 and miR-217 act as potential tumor suppressors for PC by targeting the Kras oncogene.	22538	22636
26516699	In conclusion, the present study reveals the stage-specific (PanIN to PC) unique expression patterns for miRNAs, as well as miRNA biosynthetic machinery, during progression of PC.	22637	22816
26516699	We have shown that in tumor samples compared to normal samples, the majority of miRNAs (miR-216, miR-217, miR-100, miR-345, miR-141, miR-483-3p, miR-26b, miR-150, Let-7b, Let-195 and miR-96) were downregulated, and few were upregulated (miR-146b, miR-205, miR-31, miR-192, miR-194 21, miR-379, miR-431, miR-541, and miR-199b).	22817	23143
26516699	Future studies will focus on the analysis of stage-specific miRNA expression in the sera of mice collected during PC progression, as this is expected to provide the unique opportunity to develop early detection biomarkers for PC.	23144	23373
26516699	Furthermore, restoring the expression of downregulated miRNAs in cancer cells may be performed to promote their de-differentiation and induce their reversion into a benign or normal cell.	23374	23561
26516699	Overall, the current study offers the unique opportunity to develop early biomarkers for the diagnostic, prognostic and preventive management of PC.	23562	23710
26516699	The B6.129-Krastm4Tyj (01XJ6) and B6.	23711	23748
26516699	FVB-Tg (Ipf1-cre) 1Tuv (01XL5) mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium (MMHCC, Frederick, MD, USA).	23749	23909
26516699	In order to decipher miRNAs in early PC lesions, we obtained the PC progression model by crossing LSL-KrasG12D animals with Pdx-1-Cre.	23910	24044
26516699	The animals positive for both Kras and Pdx Cre (Floxed KrasG12D) and their contemporary littermates unfloxed Kras (LSL KrasG12D) from the F1 litter were sacrificed at 10, 25, 30, 40, and 50 weeks of age (eight animals for each group at each time point).	24045	24298
26516699	The pancreas was resected, and half of the pancreas was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen (total RNA and miRNA isolation); the other half was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin.	24299	24495
26516699	Serial tissue sections were cut (4 μM) and stained with hematoxalin and eosin.	24496	24574
26516699	Throughout the study, the animals were subjected to a 12 hours of dark/light cycle with food and water ad libitum.	24575	24689
26516699	Animal studies were performed in accordance with the United States Public Health Service “Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” under an approved protocol by the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).	24690	24961
26516699	Total RNA and miRNA were isolated from the pancreas of floxed KrasG12D mice positive for Kras;Pdx-1-Cre and unfloxed LSLKrasG12D mice, human PC cell lines, tissues and their cancer-adjacent normal tissues (eight tissues each) using mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).	24962	25268
26516699	The RNA concentration was measured by Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), and the quality was analyzed using bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies, Waldbronn, Germany).	25269	25475
26516699	Samples with good integrity were used for miRNA array, real-time PCR, and TaqMan assays.	25476	25564
26516699	GeneChip® miRNA Array (Cat.	25565	25592
26516699	No: 901325) was used to study the global expression profile of miRNAs at 25-week of KrasG12D;Pdx-1-Cre mice and LSLKrasG12D mice.	25593	25722
26516699	Two micrograms of total RNA from two floxed KrasG12D (KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre) and two unfloxed LSL-KrasG12D (LSL KrasG12D) animals were labeled with the FlashTag Biotin RNA Labeling Kit for Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA arrays (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA, USA) and hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).	25723	26061
26516699	Hybridization, washing, and scanning of the slides were done according to Affymetrix's recommendations (Fluidics Protocol FS450_0003).	26062	26196
26516699	Data was extracted from the images, quintile normalized, summarized (median polish) and log2-transformed with the miRNA QC tool software from Affymetrix.	26197	26350
26516699	The TaqMan miRNA assay kits purchased from Applied Biosystems were used for expression and validation analysis of miRNAs during the progression of PC in both mice as well as human tumor samples.	26351	26545
26516699	In order to analyze the expression patterns, first, reverse transcription reactions for each miRNA was performed using 1.5 μl of 10X reverse transcription buffer, 1.0 μl of MultiScribe™reverse transcriptase (50 U/μl), 0.15 μl of 100 mM dNTPs (with dTTP), 0.19 μl of RNase inhibitor (20 U/μl) and 4.16 μl of nuclease-free water.	26546	26873
26516699	Subsequently, 500 ng of miRNA and 3μl of 1X looped-primers were added (specific for each microRNA), mixed well and incubated for 30 min at 16°C followed by 30 min at 42°C and 5 minutes at 85°C.	26874	27067
26516699	The resultant cDNA was diluted to a minimum of 1:15 with nuclease free water and 1.33 μl was used in real-time PCR.	27068	27183
26516699	Real-time PCR was performed on Light cycler 480 II PCR System (PCR System, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA).	27184	27305
26516699	During the target amplification step, the AmpliTaq® Gold DNA polymerase amplifies target cDNA synthesized from the RNA samples using sequence-specific primers from the TaqMan Assay.	27306	27487
26516699	Real-time PCR reactions based on TaqMan® reagent chemistry were performed in triplicate, and template controls were run for each assay under the same conditions.	27488	27649
26516699	End-point PCR was performed in 20 μl reaction that contained 10 μl TaqMan 2X Universal PCR Master Mix No AmpErase UNG, 7.67 μl of nuclease free water, 1.33 μl diluted RT product (Minimum1:15) and 1 μl miRNA-specific PCR probe.	27650	27876
26516699	The cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95°C for 15 seconds followed by 60°C for 60 seconds.	27877	28025
26516699	The miRNA expression levels were normalized to the level of RNU6B for human samples and U6 snRNA for mouse samples to correct for differential cDNA content.	28026	28182
26516699	Total RNA was isolated, and the cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription as previously described.	28183	28285
26516699	Briefly, reverse transcription of RNA was performed by adding 10 μl of (2 μg) total RNA, 1 μl of Oligo (dT)12–18 (500 μg/ml), and 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), incubating at 65°C for 5 minutes and immediately chilling on ice.	28286	28528
26516699	Then, the master mix containing 4 μl of (5X) first strand RT buffer, 1 μl of 0.1 M DTT, and 1 μl of RNaseOUT (RNase Inhibitor) was incubated at 42°C for 2 min.	28529	28688
26516699	Finally, 1 μl (50 units) of SuperScript II RT was added to each tube and incubated at 42°C for 50 minutes followed by 70°C for 15 minutes in order to destroy the superscript II RT.	28689	28869
26516699	The real-time primers for all the genes (human and mouse) were designed using Primer 3 software (Supplementary table S2).	28870	28991
26516699	Real-time PCR was performed on Light cycler 480 II PCR System, (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA).	28992	29102
26516699	Real-time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate; non-template controls (NTCs) and a standard curve was run for each assay under similar conditions.	29103	29255
26516699	Real-time PCR was performed in a 10 μl reaction containing 5 μl 2X SBYR green Master mix, 3.6 μl of nuclease free water, 1 μl diluted RT product (1:10), and 0.2 μl each of forward and reverse primer (5 pmol/μl).	29256	29467
26516699	The cycling conditions used were as follows: 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute.	29468	29601
26516699	Gene expression levels were normalized to the level of β-actin expression and were reported relative to the expression level in RNA from corresponding normal controls.	29602	29769
26516699	The 293FT cells were transfected with (2 μg) either with Let-7b over-expressing lentiviral pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP-Let-7b vector or with vector control and along with 10 μg of pPACKH1 Packaging Plasmid Mix (System Bioscience, CA, USA) using lipofectamine-2000 plus reagents (Invitrogen).	29770	30057
26516699	The viral supernatant, collected after 48 and 72 hours post-transfection, was filtered and used to infect human PC cells (CD18/HPAF and Capan1) after mixing with 4 μg/ml of polybrene.	30058	30241
26516699	The GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS, and Let-7b overexpression was analyzed by TaqMan assay.	30242	30333
26516699	Protein lysates were prepared from Let-7b-overexpressing and vector-transfected GFP positive cells, followed by Western blot analysis.	30334	30468
26516699	Briefly, the cells from 70% confluency cultures were washed twice with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0.25% Na-deoxycholate; 1 mM EDTA ;150 mM NaCl; 1% NP-40), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, 5 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM NaF, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride.	30469	30762
26516699	Protein lysates were quantified and resolved using 10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels (2% agarose gel for MUC4) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane.	30763	30911
26516699	The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for at least 1 hour and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-Kras, anti-MSST1, anti-MUC4, anti-caspase 9 anti-cyclin D1 and anti-β-actin) overnight at 4°C.	30912	31131
26516699	Then, the membrane was washed (4X 10 min) with phosphate buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and probed with 1:5000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.	31132	31373
26516699	After washing the blots, the signal was detected with an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Bioscience, UK).	31374	31483
26516699	The fold change in the miRNA expression was calculated by ΔΔCt method as a 2−ΔΔCt.	31484	31566
26516699	U6 and RNU6B were used for normalization in mouse and human samples, respectively.	31567	31649
26516699	A change of two-fold or more (on a log scale of ≥ 0.3) was considered statistically significant.	31650	31746
26516699	The miRNA ratios of experimental samples to controls were compared to one using the one-sample non-parametric Wilcoxon sign rank test.	31747	31881
26516699	The p-value was not adjusted for multiple comparisons.	31882	31936
26516699	SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for data analysis.	31937	32008
26731607	Significance StatementSince there have been a lot of controversies about the function of the DNA‐damage induced tumor suppressor gene Growth arrest and DNA‐damage‐inducible 45 alpha (GADD45A) in hematopoiesis, we revisited the role of GADD45A in hematopoietic stem cell fate choice control at single cell resolution.	0	316
26731607	We show here that neither cell cycle arrest nor cell death was induced by GADD45A in HSCs, but a strong differentiation program via the initiation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.	317	498
26731607	Forcing terminal differentiation of damaged hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) might be a prominent function of GADD45A in the hematopoietic system, besides providing DNA repair and genomic stability.	499	712
26731607	Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) serve for the life‐long production of all blood cell lineages 1, 2.	713	812
26731607	Their unique ability of renewing themselves maintains the HSC pool.	813	880
26731607	Since HSCs are long‐lived they might be susceptible for acquiring genomic alterations leading to blood disorders.	881	994
26731607	The genomic integrity of HSCs is instrumental to avoid detrimental mutations that may cause clonal dominance and leukemia initiation 3, 4.	995	1133
26731607	GADD45A belongs to the growth arrest and DNA damage‐inducible 45 family consisting of three genes Gadd45a, Gadd45b, and Gadd45g 5, 6, 7.	1134	1270
26731607	Various cell fate decisions and functions are regulated by individual GADD45 family members including cell cycle progression and arrest, survival and death, DNA repair and epigenetic modifications 8.	1271	1470
26731607	Because of their pleiotropic action, GADD45 proteins regulate basic cell biological mechanisms with wide implications in development, regeneration, aging, and disease 8, 9.	1471	1643
26731607	We previously elucidated the function of the family member GADD45 Gamma as a hematopoietic cytokine‐induced mediator of differentiation and lineage choice control in HSCs 10.	1644	1818
26731607	Different stimuli activate the expression of individual GADD45 family members which execute distinct and redundant functions in a cell type and context‐dependent manner 8, therefore, their individual functional contribution needs further attention.	1819	2067
26731607	The importance of GADD45A in DNA excision repair through the interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 11, 12 becomes apparent in mice lacking Gadd45a (Gadd45a −/−) that show increased genome instability, reduced nucleotide excision repair, a higher rate of mutations, and consequently, a higher incidence of carcinogenesis 13.	2068	2412
26731607	The absence of GADD45A in long‐term repopulating HSCs (LT‐HSCs) resulted in a delayed DNA repair and increased leukemogenesis in aged animals 14.	2413	2558
26731607	GADD45A expression is initiated by ultra violet irradiation (UV), X‐rays, γ‐irradiation, multiple DNA toxins, among other cellular stressors 8.	2559	2702
26731607	These environmental stressors and DNA damaging agents endanger the integrity of the HSC genome.	2703	2798
26731607	GADD45A is specifically involved in DNA repair, and thus, delays the cell cycle when DNA damage is detected.	2799	2907
26731607	Thereby Gadd45a is a tumor suppressor under the transcriptional control of p53 and the homologs p63 and p73 15.	2908	3019
26731607	However, p53‐dependent and ‐independent pathways are involved that regulate Gadd45a induction by genotoxic stress; the later may use BRCA1‐related or MAPK‐mediated signals 16, 17.	3020	3199
26731607	The role of GADD45A in inducing a cell cycle arrest as a direct consequence of DNA damage is well‐established.	3200	3310
26731607	GADD45A expression arrests the cell cycle progression at G2/M phase in normal and cancer cells by the interaction with the protein kinase cell division cycle 2, cyclin B1, and p53‐inducing proteins such as PCNA and p21 18, 19, 20.	3311	3541
26731607	Also cellular senescence in human fibroblasts is associated with a p53‐dependent induction of GADD45A 21.	3542	3647
26731607	Along the same line, mouse embryonal fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and bone marrow (BM) myeloid cells from Gadd45a −/− mice showed an increased proliferation with an accelerated mitotic index upon methylmethane sulfonate or UV‐induced stress 13.	3648	3889
26731607	GADD45A plays a dual function in cell survival and death control in a cell type‐specific manner.	3890	3986
26731607	Ectopic expression of GADD45A in leukemia cells and solid cancer cells triggers apoptosis via the Transforming growth factor, beta (TGFb)/MAP3K4/p38/c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) pathway 20, 22.	3987	4181
26731607	Conversely, GADD45A acts antiapoptotic and increases hematopoietic cell survival under UV‐irradiation or treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs 23.	4182	4328
26731607	While thymocytes from Gadd45a −/− mice had no change in gamma irradiation (γ‐IR)‐ or UV‐induced apoptosis 13, GADD45A‐deficient BM hematopoietic cells were more sensitive to UV‐radiation and chemotherapy‐induced apoptosis compared to wild‐type cells 23, 24, 25.	4329	4590
26731607	GADD45A induces the Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B‐cells (NFκB)‐mediated prosurvival pathway via p38 in myeloid cells 24.	4591	4742
26731607	In contrast, HSCs from Gadd45a −/− mice were more resistant to γ‐IR than their wild‐type counterparts, suggesting a specific proapoptotic function of GADD45A in HSCs but not in myeloid‐committed progenitors 14.	4743	4953
26731607	These controversies on the functional consequences of GADD45A expression motivated us to elucidate the changes in cell fate decision and function of long‐term repopulating HSCs (LT‐HSCs) after GADD45A expression at single cell resolution.	4954	5192
26731607	GADD45A is higher expressed in LT‐HSCs than in more differentiated progenitor populations in steady‐state hematopoiesis 14, albeit at low levels in general, and is strongly induced by genotoxic noxins.	5193	5394
26731607	We hypothesized that the induction of GADD45A in LT‐HSCs would cause alterations in cell survival and a delay in cell cycle progression in murine LT‐HSCs.	5395	5549
26731607	Surprisingly, ectopic GADD45A expression did not change cell expansion, cell cycle progression or survival in murine LT‐HSCs, neither in vitro nor in vivo. GADD45A expression caused an immediate and accelerated differentiation of LT‐HSCs allowing all cell lineages to emerge.	5550	5825
26731607	The differentiation induction is mediated by the activation of the MAP3K4‐p38 axis via GADD45A, and may provide a mechanism to circumvent the long‐term existence of damaged HSCs to avoid fatal transformation and leukemogenesis.	5826	6053
26731607	C57BL/6J and B6.SJL‐Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ were used at 10–14 weeks of age.	6054	6124

26731607	The generation time of an individual cell was defined as the time span from cytokinesis of its mother cell division to its own division.	12601	12737
26731607	The first entry into mitosis of the purified LT‐HSCs was defined as time of first division.	12738	12829
26731607	Dead cells are easily depicted by their shrunk, nonrefracting appearance with immobility.	12830	12919
26731607	All cell tracking was done by scientists; the current analysis does not rely on data generated by an unsupervised computer algorithm for automated tracking.	12920	13076
26731607	350 FACS‐sorted LT‐HSCs from C57.BL/6J mice (CD45.2), which were lentivirally transduced (MOI 100) 24 hours prior transplantation were tail vein injected into lethally irradiated B6.SJL‐Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (CD45.1) recipients together with 2 × 105 BM competitor recipient cells from B6.SJL‐Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ.	13077	13383

26731607	Mice were sacrificed 21 days after injection and analyzed for donor reconstitution in BM and spleen.	14308	14408
26731607	For cell proliferation analyses 1.5 mg Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (BD) were injected intraperitoneally 4 hours before sacrificing the mice.	14409	14546
26731607	Dead cells were determined by fixable Viability Dye staining (eBioscience).	14547	14622

26731607	The open reading frame (ORF) of the fluorescent reporter protein VENUS‐hImportin subunit α1 (AA2‐67) was cloned into the third generation self‐inactivating lentiviral vector pRRL.PPT.SFFV.IRES.eGFP.wPRE by replacing the ORF of green fluorescent protein 28.	14835	15091
26731607	A multiple cloning site (MCS) was inserted after the SFFV promoter.	15092	15159
26731607	The ORF of murine Gadd45a was amplified by RT‐PCR (forward 5′‐TTGGCCGGCCGAGGGACTCGCACTTGCAATATG‐3′, reverse 5′‐TTACTAGTGAACTCGGCCCCTTGACAT‐3′) from murine cDNA and cloned into the MCS.	15160	15344
26731607	The ORF of GFP in the TET‐responsive vector pRRL.PPT.TetT11‐GFP‐PGK‐M2‐pre 29 was replaced by the cassette containing Gadd45a‐IRES‐VENUS‐hImportin subunit α1 (AA2‐67) of the above described plasmid pRRL.PPT.SFFV.Gadd45a‐IRES‐VENUS‐hImportin.wPRE via BsrGI and SalI.	15345	15610
26731607	Vesicular Stomatitis Virus‐G‐pseudotyped lentiviral particles were produced in a split genome approach by calcium‐phosphate‐mediated transient transfection of human embryonic kidney HEK293T producer cells as recently described 10, 30.	15611	15845
26731607	After 48 hours, supernatant was collected, filtered (45 µm), and enriched by ultracentrifugation (50,000g, 2 hours).	15846	15962
26731607	Viral titers were determined by transduction of NIH3T3 cells with different concentrations of virus supernatant and FACS.	15963	16084
26731607	FACS‐sorted LT‐HSCs were transduced with indicated lentiviral particles (MOI 100) and cultured for 4 days.	16085	16191
26731607	After staining cells with Fixable Viability Dye (eBioscience) for live/dead cell exclusion, the cells were fixed with Fix Buffer I (BD) at 37 °C for 10 minutes and permeabilized with ice‐cold Perm Buffer III (BD) for 30 minutes on ice.	16192	16427
26731607	Permeabilized cells were subsequently stained with antibodies against P‐p38‐Phycoerythrin (PE) (BD) to analyze the phosphorylation status of the cells by FACS.	16428	16587
26731607	Four‐day cultured LT‐HSCs or MPPs were stimulated with 10 µg/ml Anisomycin (Sigma) for 30 minutes prior to fixation as positive control.	16588	16724
26731607	Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPadPrism‐6.0 software.	16725	16792
26731607	Statistical significance was determined by a Student's t test (two‐tailed, unpaired, equal variances) if not otherwise mentioned.	16793	16922
26731607	The significance level for all tests was set to α = 5%.	16923	16978
26731607	In order to assess the influence of GADD45A expression on the expansion of LT‐HSCs and their progeny, we lentivirally transduced FACS‐sorted LT‐HSCs (CD150+ CD48− CD34low CD117+ Sca1+ Lin−) with GADD45A or a control vector (Fig.	16979	17207
26731607	1A; Supporting Information Fig.	17208	17239
26731607	S1A, S1B).	17240	17250
26731607	The ectopic GADD45A expression enhanced GADD45A protein levels about twofold in lentivirally transduced cells (Fig.	17251	17366
26731607	1A).	8359	8363
26731607	The number of transduced cells, that coexpressed a fluorescent VENUS reporter protein, was assessed at 5, 8, and 10 days in culture.	17372	17504
26731607	There was no influence on the expansion of the cells by the expression of GADD45A (Fig.	17505	17592
26731607	1B).	17246	17250
26731607	This unexpected result indicated that there might be no gross changes in proliferation and cell death caused by GADD45A.	17598	17718
26731607	However, to confirm that these fate decisions were not skewed we investigated individual LT‐HSCs during differentiation via time‐lapse‐microscopy‐based cell tracking (Fig.	17719	17890
26731607	1C).	17891	17895
26731607	This technology allows following individual LT‐HSCs and their progeny during their differentiation process over weeks in culture without losing cell identity.	17896	18054
26731607	FACS‐sorted LT‐HSCs were subjected to time‐lapse microscopy while lentivirally transduced with GADD45A.	18055	18158
26731607	The induction of transgene expression (VENUS+) could be followed in real time at a single cell level.	18159	18260
26731607	We compared the time of first LT‐HSC division and the cell cycle lengths of subsequent progeny of LT‐HSCs transduced with GADD45A or control for several generations (Fig.	18261	18431
26731607	1D, 1E; Supporting Information Fig.	18432	18467
26731607	S2).	18468	18472
26731607	Neither did we determine any delay of the first entry into LT‐HSC division nor any increase in the cell cycle length in GADD45A‐expressing cells as originally expected by the expression of a protein normally involved in growth arrest.	18473	18707
26731607	To the contrary, in later generations, the cell cycle was even shorter in GADD45A‐expressing cells, which might be a consequence of a further advanced differentiation stage rather than a direct influence of GADD45A on the cell cycle (Fig.	18708	18946
26731607	1E).	18947	18951
26731607	Next, we assessed the cell cycle of hematopoietic cells after GADD45A expression in vivo (Fig.	18952	19046
26731607	1F).	19047	19051
26731607	Since we sought to determine the influence of GADD45A on HSPC proliferation shortly after transplantation, a sufficient number of donor cells were required.	19052	19208
26731607	Therefore, we transplanted KSL cells transduced with GADD45A or control and assessed the cell cycle status of GADD45A‐expressing progeny in the recipient BM 3 weeks after transplantation via a short BrdU pulse of 4 hours (Fig.	19209	19435
26731607	1F; Supporting Information Fig.	19436	19467
26731607	S1C).	19468	19473
26731607	When we analyzed the cell cycle phases of all cells, lineage− cKIT+ progenitor cells or immature HSPCs (KSL cells), neither of these subpopulations showed any signs of alterations upon GADD45A expression determined via FACS.	19474	19698
26731607	The cell cycle distribution was unchanged in the presence of GADD45A, indicating that GADD45A does not alter the proliferation of HSPCs (Fig.	19699	19840
26731607	1G).	19841	19845
26731607	GADD45A has been implicated in the decision of cells to either survive or to go into apoptosis upon cell damage.	19846	19958
26731607	Both scenarios have been reported as a consequence of the absence of GADD45A in hematopoietic cells 14, 23, 24.	19959	20070
26731607	We measured the rate of dying cells at a single cell level by observing GADD45A‐expressing LT‐HSCs and their progeny by time‐lapse‐microscopy‐based cell tracking (Fig.	20071	20238
26731607	2A).	20239	20243
26731607	There was no increase in apoptosis in HSPCs upon GADD45A expression for several cell generations (Fig.	20244	20346
26731607	2A).	20239	20243
26731607	Also in vivo, 3 weeks after transplanting GADD45A‐expressing KSL, there was no increase in apoptosis in BM cells originating from GADD45A‐expressing KSL cells (Fig.	20352	20516
26731607	2B).	20517	20521
26731607	In order to investigate consequences of GADD45A on HSC differentiation and self‐renewal, we assessed the differentiation kinetics of LT‐HSCs that were lentivirally transduced with GADD45A by the analyses of surface marker expression via FACS (Fig.	20522	20769
26731607	3A).	20770	20774
26731607	Already 5 days after transduction, almost 40% of the GADD45A‐expressing LT‐HSCs have differentiated into granulocyte‐macrophage progenitor (GMP)‐like cells, whereas only 4% of the control‐transduced LT‐HSCs have developed into this stage and the majority of cells were still considered immature (Fig.	20775	21075
26731607	3A, 3B).	21076	21084
26731607	Along the same line, after 8 days of differentiation, 66% of GADD45A expressing cells developed into mature cells of the granulocyte/monocyte (GM) lineage.	21085	21240
26731607	Only 12% of control‐transduced cells reached this stage of differentiation after 8 days (Fig.	21241	21334
26731607	3B).	21080	21084
26731607	Since the level of GADD45A expression by a lentiviral vector may influence the true physiological cell fate decision of LT‐HSCs upon induced endogenous GADD45A expression, we additionally used an inducible and scalable TET‐regulated lentiviral system (Supporting Information Fig.	21340	21619
26731607	S3A).	21620	21625
26731607	The expression of Gadd45a‐IRES‐VENUS was under the control of a TET‐inducible promoter, and limiting concentrations of Doxycycline induced a linear range of GADD45A expression (Fig.	21626	21807
26731607	3C).	21808	21812
26731607	Even at maximal induction, the GADD45A expression level was only 22% of the expression level of the SFFV promoter‐driven lentiviral vector and could be scaled down to 6% (Fig.	21813	21988
26731607	3C).	21808	21812
26731607	Only 22% of the previously ectopically expressed GADD45A was required to efficiently induce and accelerate the differentiation in LT‐HSCs to the same extend as shown with the SFFV‐driven GADD45A expression (Fig.	21994	22205
26731607	3D; Supporting Information Fig.	22206	22237
26731607	S3B).	22238	22243
26731607	The stepwise reduction of ectopic GADD45A expression below 22% of the original level decreased the impact on differentiation in a linear way.	22244	22385
26731607	Strikingly, even as little as 6% was sufficient to induce differentiation in LT‐HSCs, although not to the same extent (Fig.	22386	22509
26731607	3D; Supporting Information Fig.	22206	22237
26731607	S3B).	22238	22243
26731607	This result clearly showed that even low levels of GADD45A, once expressed in LT‐HSCs, initiate the differentiation program in these cells and accelerate the differentiation.	22548	22722
26731607	To test whether LT‐HSCs would start to differentiate after GADD45A expression, or whether they are able to remain self‐renewing in their in vivo niche, we transplanted LT‐HSCs after transduction of GADD45A or control in lethally irradiated recipients (Fig.	22723	22979
26731607	3E).	22980	22984
26731607	We assessed donor blood cell reconstitution in PB up to 18 weeks after transplantation.	22985	23072
26731607	After 2 weeks, GADD45A‐expressing LT‐HSCs cells initially contributed almost equally to donor blood cell production, suggesting a successful homing to the recipient BM.	23073	23241
26731607	Thereafter, the donor cell chimerism did not increase and completely disappeared after 8 weeks, and there was no contribution of GADD45A‐expressing cells at 18 weeks after transplantation, whereas a robust reconstitution was detectable using control‐transduced cells (Fig.	23242	23514
26731607	3E).	22980	22984
26731607	As a consequence, the serial transplantation of GADD45A‐expressing cells into secondary recipients was obsolete.	23520	23632
26731607	When we analyzed the BM and spleen of GADD45A‐expressing KSL recipient mice, it became apparent that already 3 weeks after transplantation, the donor blood cells were markedly reduced (Supporting Information Fig.	23633	23845
26731607	S3C, S3D).	23846	23856
26731607	These in vivo transplantations demonstrated that LT‐HSC differentiate upon GADD45A expression and were unable to maintain their self‐renewal program even in their natural niche environment.	23857	24046
26731607	In order to measure the kinetics of differentiation induction in individual LT‐HSCs in real time, we investigated the onset of the differentiation marker CD16/32 expression that indicates GM‐committed cells, in the presence or absence of GADD45A.	24047	24293
26731607	We transduced LT‐HSCs with GADD45A and control and subjected the cells to time‐lapse microscopy.	24294	24390
26731607	The expression of the surface marker CD16/32 was determined by the binding of a fluorescently labeled antibody during differentiation in culture.	24391	24536
26731607	In average, the time gap between the first GADD45A expression and the onset of CD16/32 was only 29 hours (±19 SD).	24537	24651
26731607	However, almost no cells expressed detectable CD16/32 after 6 days of cell observation and tracking under control conditions.	24652	24777
26731607	So far we only provided evidence that ectopic GADD45A rapidly induces and accelerates differentiation in LT‐HSCs.	24778	24891
26731607	Next we assessed whether conditions that cause DNA‐damage in cells, such as γ‐IR, UV, or cisplatin treatment induce endogenous GADD45A expression in stem and progenitor cells.	24892	25067
26731607	We therefore FACS‐sorted KSL cells and treated them with IR, UV, or cisplatin and compared the levels of Gadd45a mRNA to untreated control KSL.	25068	25211
26731607	As previously shown 14, 24, all these regimens triggered the expression of GADD45A (Fig.	25212	25300
26731607	4A).	25301	25305
26731607	To test whether these DNA‐damage causing conditions also lead to an induction and acceleration of differentiation in LT‐HSCs, as seen with the ectopic expression (Fig.	25306	25473
26731607	3), we cultured γ‐IR‐treated LT‐HSCs for 5 days and determined the level of differentiation by FACS.	25474	25574
26731607	Indeed, a significant lower proportion of immature HSPCs remained in the population of γ‐IR‐treated LT‐HSCs in comparison to untreated LT‐HSCs, and the reduction was similar to the effects caused by ectopic GADD45A expression (Fig.	25575	25806
26731607	4B).	25807	25811
26731607	The additional ectopic expression of GADD45A in γ‐IR‐treated LT‐HSCs further enhanced their differentiation, probably by further increasing the levels of GADD45A (Fig.	25812	25979
26731607	4B).	25807	25811
26731607	These results suggest that DNA‐damage causing conditions can indeed trigger the differentiation in LT‐HSCs, most likely caused by the upregulation of GADD45A.	25985	26143
26731607	To elaborate whether GADD45A expression influences the lineage choice of LT‐HSCs and their progeny, we lentivirally transduced LT‐HSCs with either GADD45A or control and analyzed their colony‐forming ability in methylcellulose‐based medium (Fig.	26144	26389
26731607	5A).	26390	26394
26731607	Mature cells of all myeloid lineages arose from LT‐HSCs transduced with GADD45A without major shifts in the lineage distribution in comparison to control‐transduced LT‐HSCs (Fig.	26395	26573
26731607	5A).	26390	26394
26731607	Neither the colony size nor the lineage contribution was changed upon GADD45A expression.	26579	26668
26731607	The video‐microscopy‐based tracking of GADD45A‐transduced LT‐HSCs elucidated their differentiation into megakaryocytes in culture (Supporting Information Fig.	26669	26827
26731607	S4A; Video 1).	26828	26842
26731607	Also in in vivo transplantations, PB B, T, and myeloid cell lineages were generated from LT‐HSCs transduced with GADD45A (Fig.	26843	26969
26731607	5B).	26970	26974
26731607	The increased ratio of long‐lived lymphoid cells versus short lived myeloid cells upon GADD45A expression further suggest an advanced differentiation of immature HSPCs 8 weeks after transplantation.	26975	27173
26731607	Later on, almost no GADD45A‐expressing cells were detectable for multilineage analyses.	27174	27261
26731607	Furthermore, progenitor cells for GMPs and MEPs were unchanged in the BM 3 weeks after transplantation indicating that GADD45A‐expressing KSL give rise to all myeloid lineages (Supporting Information Fig.	27262	27466
26731607	S4B).	27467	27472
26731607	Since the other family member GADD45G induced a lineage selection against megakaryocyte‐erythroid cell fate, and MEPs could not handle the GADD45G‐induced program and died 10, we wanted to confirm that the program of GADD45A is not inhibiting cells of this lineage.	27473	27738
26731607	In contrast to GADD45G, however, GADD45A‐transduced MEPs (CD150+ CD117+ Sca1− Lin−, Supporting Information Fig.	27739	27850
26731607	S1A, FACS‐sorting according to 31, 32) were largely unaffected in their ability to form mature erythroid/megakaryocytic colonies (Fig.	27851	27985
26731607	5C).	27986	27990
26731607	Taken together, GADD45A expression did not lead to a skewing of the generated lineages as GADD45G expression does by selecting against megakaryocyte‐erythroid lineage choice 10.	27991	28168
26731607	Therefore, we assessed the expression of endogenous GADD45 Beta and Gamma upon ectopic GADD45A expression in LT‐HSCs (Fig.	28169	28291
26731607	5D).	28292	28296
26731607	While the GADD45B mRNA levels remained constant, the ectopic expression of GADD45A by lentiviral transduction of LT‐HSCs caused a sharp downregulation of endogenous GADD45G, thereby allowing the development of megakaryocytes and erythrocytes (Fig.	28297	28544
26731607	5D).	28292	28296
26731607	To enlighten the molecular mechanism how GADD45A activates the differentiation program in LT‐HSCs, we focused on the recently unraveled mechanism of GADD45G‐mediated differentiation induction in LT‐HSCs 10.	28550	28756
26731607	GADD45 proteins bind to mitogen‐activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP3K4) and release its autoinhibitory domain, leading to its activation and phosphorylation of downstream MAPK kinases (such as MKK3 and MKK6).	28757	28975
26731607	Thereby, the binding of GADD45A to MAP3K4 initiates a MAPK cascade resulting in p38 and JNK activation 33.	28976	29082
26731607	We showed that GADD45G specifically leads to p38 phosphorylation, and that the inhibition of p38, but not of JNK, resulted in a block in differentiation initiation of GADD45G 10.	29083	29261
26731607	In order to see whether GADD45A also uses the same pathway we tested the induction of p38 phosphorylation by GADD45A via phosphoflow cytometry (Fig.	29262	29410
26731607	5A).	26390	26394
26731607	As hypothesized, GADD45A‐expressing LT‐HSCs showed a stronger p38 phosphorylation than control‐transduced LT‐HSCs, indicating that the differentiation induction pathway is shared between GADD45G and GADD45A (Fig.	29416	29628
26731607	6A).	29629	29633
26731607	To further corroborate that activated p38 is necessary for the GADD45A‐induced differentiation, we tested the differentiation kinetics of LT‐HSCs in the presence of p38 inhibitors (Fig.	29634	29819
26731607	6B).	29820	29824
26731607	We lentivirally transduced LT‐HSCs with GADD45A or control and cultured them for 5 days in the presence or absence of two p38 inhibitors Vx702 and Ly2228820.	29825	29982
26731607	In the presence of any p38 inhibitor, the differentiation induction and acceleration mediated by GADD45A was blocked, and the cells behaved like the control transduced cells (Fig.	29983	30162
26731607	6B).	29820	29824
26731607	This clearly indicates that GADD45A induces its differentiation program by activation of the MAP3K4‐MKK6‐ p38 pathway.	30168	30286
26731607	The function of GADD45A in hematopoiesis long remained controversial.	30287	30356
26731607	Here we revisited the functional consequences of GADD45A on HSC fate decisions at single cell resolution.	30357	30462
26731607	Constitutive GADD45A expression did not inhibit the cell cycle progression or forced HSCs into apoptosis but rapidly induced and accelerated multilineage differentiation by activating the p38 MAPK pathway.	30463	30668
26731607	The absence of Gadd45a in HSCs has little effect on steady state hematopoiesis 14.	30669	30751
26731607	In contrast, once genotoxic stress was applied to LT‐HSCs by γ‐IR, the absence of GADD45A provided increased radioprotection and survival in HSCs at the expense of DNA integrity that resulted in a higher incidence of B cell leukemia 14.	30752	30988
26731607	Additionally, ATM−/− Gadd45a −/− mice showed an increased incidence of hematopoietic malignancies as well as an increased rate of metastasis compared with ATM−/− mice 34.	30989	31159
26731607	Gadd45a deletion aggravated the DNA damage accumulation, which subsequently resulted in a further impaired self‐renewal capacity and an increased malignant transformation in ATM−/− HSCs 34.	31160	31349
26731607	Since GADD45A is obviously required for the genomic stability in HSPCs by allowing proper DNA repair, we expected to observe a cell cycle arrest upon GADD45A expression in LT‐HSCs.	31350	31530
26731607	Surprisingly, GADD45A expression did not slow the cell cycle of HSCs and their progeny, neither in vitro nor in vivo, but rather shortened the cell cycle lengths in subsequent generations.	31531	31719
26731607	Since GADD45A strongly accelerates the differentiation in HSCs, this might be a consequence of further differentiated progenitor stages with shorter generation times rather than a directly permitted effect by GADD45A on cell cycle progression.	31720	31963
26731607	We cannot exclude that the absence of GADD45A may have an influence on the cell cycle progression 14, or that there are potential effects of GADD45A expression on the cell cycle of largely quiescent LT‐HSCs in steady‐state hematopoiesis.	31964	32201
26731607	However, despite the fact that the GADD45 family members acquired their name as growth arrest genes it seems unlikely that cell cycle inhibition is of high relevance in the hematopoietic system.	32202	32396
26731607	In contrast to a report that GADD45A expression resulted in increased apoptosis in LT‐HSCs 14 we did not observe increased cell death upon GADD45A expression, neither determined at the single cell level by continuous cell tracking nor after transplantation in vivo.	32397	32662
26731607	This is in line with reports that propose a prosurvival function of GADD45A in hematopoietic cells 23, 24.	32663	32769
26731607	Since ectopic GADD45A expression did not alter cell survival under normal conditions, it needs to be tested whether GADD45A expression increases HSC resistance to various noxins.	32770	32948
26731607	We rather observed that LT‐HSCs were rapidly differentiating upon GADD45A expression with a loss of their self‐renewal ability.	32949	33076
26731607	The differentiation‐promoting function of GADD45A is supported by the notion that GADD45A‐deficient LT‐HSCs exhibited increased self‐renewal 14 and colony‐replating abilities 25 albeit with a higher incidence of mutations.	33077	33299
26731607	Similar to what we have previously reported for GADD45G, a GADD45 member that is under differentiation‐promoting cytokine control 10, GADD45A works as a toggle switch in inducing differentiation in LT‐HSCs.	33300	33506
26731607	The trigger for GADD45A expression is mediated by DNA‐damaging events.	33507	33577
26731607	We showed that GADD45G selectively activates the p38 pathway, most likely by the activation of MAP3K4 and MKK6, but not of JNK 10.	33578	33708
26731607	Again, here we could reveal that GADD45A, albeit not induced by hematopoietic cytokines, uses a common pathway shared with GADD45G to induce p38‐mediated differentiation.	33709	33879
26731607	However, the lineage selection against megakaryocyte‐erythroid fate by GADD45G expression 10 is not mirrored by GADD45A.	33880	34000
26731607	As a possible explanation for this difference, we showed that GADD45A expression caused a sharp downregulation of GADD45G, thereby allowing all lineages to develop.	34001	34165
26731607	Nevertheless, the exact molecular machinery that is initiated by different GADD45 family members to control lineage choice in HSPCs needs further clarification.	34166	34326
26731607	It will be intriguing to unravel the downstream effectors that might be common or unique for individual GADD45 family members in HSC differentiation induction.	34327	34486
26731607	The role of GADD45A in preserving the genomic integrity of HSCs is vital, but its mode of action as tumor suppressor for hematologic malignancies, especially the cell cycle inhibition and proapoptotic function, has been unclear so far.	34487	34722
26731607	We showed that the differentiation induction might be the major antileukemia effect of GADD45A in the hematopoietic system, besides providing DNA repair and genomic stability.	34723	34898
26731607	Importantly, we provide strong evidence that various DNA‐damaging conditions such as γ‐IR and UV upregulate GADD45A expression in stem and progenitor cells and that these conditions ultimately lead to a differentiation induction and acceleration in LT‐HSCs.	34899	35156
26731607	Damaged cells are forced to terminally differentiate and thereby cleared from the system.	35157	35246
26731607	The hypothesis of differentiation check‐points for DNA‐damage response has been previously postulated 35, 36, 37.	35247	35360
26731607	As one prominent example, the induction of the transcription factor BATF upon hematopoietic stress instructs terminal lymphoid differentiation 36.	35361	35507
26731607	Our data supports the notion that also GADD45A exerts its important function in response to DNA damage at least partly in this respect.	35508	35643
26731607	GADD45A and GADD45G are epigenetically silenced in many leukemias and solid cancers 9.	35644	35730
26731607	Furthermore, GADD45A is frequently deleted in breast cancer 38.	35731	35794
26731607	The reactivation of GADD45A by, for example, the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin promoted terminal differentiation and death of human carcinoma cells 39, 40.	35795	35963
26731607	Enhanced p38 activation induces cell survival in many cancer cell types but obviously promotes a strong differentiation signal in HSCs, maybe by the phosphorylation of GATA3 41.	35964	36141
26731607	Our data suggest that anticancer strategies using inhibiting agents against p38 MAPK should be carefully evaluated in blood cell malignancies, and reactivation of GADD45 might be of benefit for leukemia treatment.	36142	36355
26731607	The long‐disputed functional consequences of genotoxic stress‐induced GADD45A expression in hematopoietic cells were revisited in this study, elucidating the role of GADD45A expression in murine LT‐HSCs at single cell resolution.	36356	36585
26731607	We showed here that neither cell cycle arrest nor cell death was induced by GADD45A, but a strong differentiation program via the initiation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.	36586	36761
26731607	Forcing terminal differentiation of damaged HSPCs might be a prominent function of GADD45A in the hematopoietic system, besides providing DNA repair and genomic stability.	36762	36933

26731607	The authors indicate no potential conflicts of interest.	37348	37404
27134166	Judah Folkman’s vision of targeting the tumor neovasculature as a new modality of cancer therapeutics has inspired a series of drugs that either exclusively (e.g., bevacizumab) or primarily (e.g., sunitinib, axitinib, and sorafenib) inhibit VEGF signaling (McIntyre and Harris, 2015, Vasudev and Reynolds, 2014; and references therein) with associated beneficial responses, representing proof of principle and new additions to the armamentarium of anti-cancer drugs.	0	466
27134166	However, as with many targeted therapies, clinical responses to angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) are typically limited, manifested as increased, but limited progression-free survival and variable (or no) overall survival (Vasudev and Reynolds, 2014; and references therein).	467	737
27134166	Concurrent with such clinical investigations, a number of preclinical studies of AI in various mouse models of human cancer have revealed multiple forms of adaptive resistance that enable tumors to evade the effects of AI therapy (Bergers and Hanahan, 2008, Clarke and Hurwitz, 2013, Welti et al., 2013, McIntyre and Harris, 2015, Rigamonti et al., 2014, Rivera et al., 2015).	738	1114
27134166	One such model—RIP1Tag2 transgenic mice, which develop de novo pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET) via a multistage pathway—has been particularly instructive: tumorigenesis involves a discrete angiogenic switch (Folkman et al., 1989), which is necessary for initial tumor formation.	1115	1403
27134166	AIs, in particular ones targeting the VEGF signaling pathway, show demonstrable efficacy in this model (Bergers et al., 2003), the results of which motivated clinical trials that led to the approval of one such agent, sunitinib, in human PanNET (Raymond et al., 2011).	1404	1672
27134166	Importantly, however, AIs are not curative in this mouse model, much as in human cancer patients.	1673	1770
27134166	The basis for treatment failure lies in part in the development of multiple forms of adaptive resistance to AIs, including revascularization mediated by alternative pro-angiogenic signaling circuits (Casanovas et al., 2005), recruitment of vascular-protective myeloid cells (Shojaei and Ferrara, 2008), and cooption of normal tissue vessels via increased invasion and metastasis (Sennino et al., 2012, Ebos and Kerbel, 2011, Ebos et al., 2009, Pàez-Ribes et al., 2009).	1771	2240
27134166	The RIP1Tag2 model has also been used to investigate other cancer hallmarks, including resistance to apoptosis and induction of invasiveness, which are variously regulated by signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, IGFR, IR, and ALK (Chun et al., 2010, Nolan-Stevaux et al., 2010, Ulanet et al., 2010); these signals converge in part on the mTOR kinase, which orchestrates a broad program affecting cell survival and metabolism (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012, Cornu et al., 2013).	2241	2737
27134166	Notably, both preclinical (Chiu et al., 2010) and clinical studies (Yao et al., 2011) have demonstrated the efficacy of targeting mTOR in PanNET.	2738	2883
27134166	We have continued to assess the effects on AI therapy in this PanNET model, including a comparative analysis of two multi-kinase inhibitors, sunitinib and axitinib, both of which target the VEGFR/PDGFR signaling pathways to inhibit new blood vessel growth and disrupt endothelial cells and pericytes of the preexisting tumor vasculature (Bergers et al., 2003), reducing vascular density and functionality rather than producing the vascularization characteristic of less potent AI such as bevacizumab.	2884	3384
27134166	Although both compounds have a similar target profile, axitinib exhibits fewer off target effects and toxicity (Gunnarsson et al., 2015) (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov).	3385	3554
27134166	In the course of further characterizing cellular and histologic responses to the two drugs, in particular their effects on the aforementioned mTOR signaling pathway, we observed an intriguing switch in the pattern of mTOR activity, reflected by phosphorylation of its downstream effector S6.	3555	3846
27134166	Specifically, the diffuse pattern seen in untreated tumors was replaced by one of focal clusters.	3847	3944
27134166	This focal reorganization of mTOR signaling motivated the investigation reported below, where we implicate metabolic symbiosis as another mode of adaptive resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.	3945	4138
27134166	Given that mTOR signaling is prominently involved in the PanNET phenotype (see above), we had asked whether it was affected by disruption of the tumor vasculature with sunitinib.	4139	4317
27134166	Indeed, mTOR signaling was found to be elevated in a set of sunitinib-treated tumors, as reflected in the heightened levels of phospho-S6 kinase (p-S6).	4318	4470
27134166	In contrast, sunitinib treatment of cultured mouse PanNET cells did not elicit this upregulation (data not shown).	4471	4585
27134166	To substantiate this observation, molecular efficacy trials were performed with sunitinib, in which mice with late stage tumors were treated for 7 days followed by analysis of tumor lysates by western blotting.	4586	4796
27134166	Sunitinib elicited an increase in p-S6 (Figure 1A, left), which was blocked by concomitant administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Figure 1A, right), demonstrating that its upregulation is mTOR dependent.	4797	5009
27134166	Axitinib-treated tumors produced a similar trend (data not shown).	5010	5076
27134166	The elevated mTOR signaling was surprising in that sunitinib- and axitinib-treated tumors become hypoxic in response to collapse of the tumor vasculature (Pàez-Ribes et al., 2009, Sennino et al., 2012), and observations presented below), and mTOR is typically downregulated in hypoxic conditions (Brugarolas et al., 2004).	5077	5399
27134166	Indeed, a derivative PanNET cancer cell line (βTC4) downregulated p-S6 in hypoxic versus normoxic conditions (Figure 1B).	5400	5521
27134166	Intrigued by this apparent dichotomy, we further investigated mTOR signaling in tumors treated for 4 weeks using immunohistochemistry.	5522	5656
27134166	As shown in Figure 1C, p-S6 was elevated in sunitinib-treated tumors, but its expression was relocalized from the diffuse pattern seen in control tumors into focal clusters.	5657	5830
27134166	The specificity of the p-S6 staining in control and sunitinib-treated tumors was confirmed by treatment with rapamycin, which ablated p-S6 expression, even when dosed in combination with sunitinib.	5831	6028
27134166	Next, we assessed the relationship between p-S6 expression and hypoxia in treated tumors.	6029	6118
27134166	Co-staining of sunitinib- and axitinib-treated tumors with antibodies to p-S6 and pimonidazole—to reveal regions of hypoxia—revealed an anti-correlation: p-S6 was predominantly expressed in the normoxic, and not hypoxic, regions of the treated tumors (Figure 1D).	6119	6382
27134166	Eventually, as the vascular regression and inhibition of new growth continues, the normoxic regions seen in Figure 1D can coalesce into the focal clusters seen in Figure 1C.	6383	6556
27134166	This is further illustrated in Figure 1E, which shows a highly necrotic/hypoxic tumor (left); within the regions of fibrosis/necrosis, focal clusters of viable cancer cells can be seen (H&E, middle left).	6557	6761
27134166	These clusters are highly proliferative (Ki-67, middle right) and are cuffing blood vessels (CD31, right).	6762	6868
27134166	The clustering of viable cancer cells around the few remaining blood vessels inside long-term treated tumors is consistent with their need for oxygen, but also for blood-borne nutrients, in particular glucose.	6869	7078
27134166	We performed short-term trials using sunitinib alone or in combination with rapamycin and then performed RNA-sequencing (seq) analysis on the treated and control tumors.	7079	7248
27134166	We conducted enrichment analysis on the top 2,500 unregulated genes in the control versus treated tumors, and the top ten enriched hallmark pathways for sunitinib monotherapy are depicted in Figure 2A, including hypoxia and glycolysis.	7249	7484
27134166	The enrichment plot for the hallmark glycolysis signature (Figure 2A) includes Slc16a3 (MCT 4) and Ldha (lactate dehydrogenase A; Figure 2B), along with (to a lesser degree) Slc2a1 (GLUT1, data not shown).	7485	7690
27134166	Both sunitinib and axitinib produced marked reductions in tumor vasculature (Figure S1A) with widespread hypoxia, consistent with the hypoxia signature.	7691	7843
27134166	Motivated by the glycolysis signature and the known induction of glycolysis by hypoxia, we assessed expression by immunostaining for the lactate transporter MCT4 and the glucose transporter GLUT1, whose elevated co-expression is diagnostic of glycolysis (Ullah et al., 2006).	7844	8119
27134166	Concordantly, the striking upregulation of Slc16a3/MCT4 revealed by the RNA profiling of sunitinib-treated tumors was detected by immunohistochemistry in tissue sections from the majority of sunitinib- and axitinib-treated tumors and was very low/absent in control or rapamycin-treated tumors (Figure 2C).	8120	8425
27134166	In treated tumors, GLUT1 and MCT4 were upregulated in the hypoxic regions, as revealed by co-staining with pimonidazole (Figure 2D).	8426	8558
27134166	Such upregulation in hypoxic conditions is consistent with previous reports that GLUT1 and MCT4 are regulated by the HIF hypoxia response system (Ebert et al., 1995, Ullah et al., 2006, Seagroves et al., 2001).	8559	8769
27134166	To confirm this interpretation, we evaluated compound mice carrying a tissue-specific gene knock out of HIF1α in the oncogene-expressing cancer cells.	8770	8920
27134166	Indeed, sunitinib treatment failed to upregulate GLUT1 and MCT4 in the Hif1α-knockout (KO) tumors (Figure 2E), supporting the expectation that HIF1α drives their upregulation.	8921	9096
27134166	The compartmental expression of GLUT1/MCT4 was reminiscent of a phenomenon—observed in certain tumors—known as metabolic symbiosis, wherein hypoxic regions import and metabolize glucose (Ebert et al., 1995) and secrete lactate, while normoxic regions import and metabolize the lactate (Sonveaux et al., 2008, Kennedy et al., 2013).	9097	9428
27134166	We therefore assessed expression of the lactate transporter MCT1 and found that it was upregulated in a distinct compartment from the hypoxic, MCT4 positive region (Figure 2F), although a small minority of cells are MCT1+/MCT4+ double positive (Figure S1B).	9429	9686
27134166	The hypothesis of metabolic symbiosis demands that the secreted lactate is not merely “toxic acidic waste”, but rather a source of fuel that is imported and metabolized by the normoxic cancer cells.	9687	9885
27134166	We assessed whether cultured βTC3 cells could recapitulate key aspects of the hypoxic response in culture and found that GLUT1 and MCT4 were upregulated under hypoxic conditions (Figure 3A).	9886	10076
27134166	We further assessed lactate utilization in cultured cancer cells and in tumor-bearing mice, by supplying isotopically labeled lactate or glucose, and assessing their catabolism into metabolites by NMR spectroscopy (Figures 3B and 3C).	10077	10311
27134166	Thus, βTC3 cancer cells were cultured in hypoxic and normoxic conditions, in which they were supplied with 1–13C-glucose or with 3–13C-lactate in glucose-free media, in both cases similarly supplemented with glutamine and fetal calf serum (FCS); after 20 hr, the cells were harvested for NMR analysis.	10312	10613
27134166	At this time point, cells cultured in 1–13C-glucose increased the levels of lactate in conditioned media both in hypoxia and normoxia, whereas cells cultured in 3–13C-lactate reduced the levels of lactate in conditioned media under normoxia and slightly increased lactate in hypoxic conditions (Figure 3B, legend).	10614	10928
27134166	The 13C NMR analysis revealed that in aerobic conditions 3–13C-lactate was catabolized to C4-glutamate, C2- and C3-aspartate (Asp), and C3-alanine (Figure 3B), consistent with previous studies on lactate metabolism by cancer cells and neurons (Kennedy et al., 2013, Waagepetersen et al., 1998, Yang et al., 2014).	10929	11242
27134166	In contrast, lactate was imported, but not catabolized in hypoxic conditions (Figure 3B).	11243	11332
27134166	Notably, the lactate catabolites coincide with those produced by 1–13C-glucose, indicating that both sets are likely produced through the same intermediate, pyruvate.	11333	11499
27134166	Next, tumor-bearing mice treated for 10 days with sunitinib, rapamycin+sunitinib, or vehicle control were infused with 3–13C-lactate and the tumors excised and evaluated by NMR.	11500	11677
27134166	Both treated and control tumors metabolized lactate (Figure 3C).	11678	11742
27134166	Additionally, the branched metabolic pathways involved in lactate catabolism may be altered in activity.	11743	11847
27134166	The prominent 3–13C-alanine band produced from 3–13C-lactate → 3–13C-pyruvate + glutamate → 3–13C-Ala + α-ketoglutarate is relatively undiminished versus the glutamate and Asp species in the sunitinib-treated tumors; notably, the pathway producing 3–13C-Ala + α-ketoglutarate is involved in sustaining tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates important both for energy production and biosynthesis of cellular building blocks, a process referred to as anaplerosis.	11848	12315
27134166	Intriguingly, RNaseq and RT-quantitative (q)PCR analysis (Table S1) of sunitinib versus control tumors revealed upregulation of Gpt2, an aminotransferase catalyzing the transamination that produces alanine + α-ketoglutarate from pyruvate and glutamate.	12316	12568
27134166	In addition, Gls2, which converts glutamine to glutamate in the first step of its metabolism, is also upregulated (Table S1).	12569	12694
27134166	In contrast, the rapamycin+sunitinib-treated tumors did not produce 3–13C-Ala. Rather, lactate-derived pyruvate evidently was converted to acetyl-CoA to enter the TCA cycle, producing C2- and C4-glutamate and C2- and C3-Asp (Figure 3C).	12695	12931
27134166	Thus, the data suggest that glutamine-associated catabolism of lactate to alanine becomes favored in the context of sunitinib therapy, which in the combination-treated tumors is repressed—directly or indirectly—by mTOR inhibition.	12932	13162
27134166	Collectively, these observations, along with previous studies indicating the link between glutamine metabolism and mTOR signaling (Csibi et al., 2014, Durán et al., 2012), led us to consider the possible involvement of glutamine and the observed metabolism of lactate in the induction of mTOR signaling.	13163	13466
27134166	Motivated by the observation that expression of Gls2 was increased in sunitinib-treated tumors (Table S1), we asked whether it was expressed in the hypoxic or normoxic compartment.	13467	13647
27134166	Analysis of sunitinib-treated and control untreated tumors by fluorescent staining with anti-glutaminase 2 (GLS2) and pimonidazole demonstrated elevated expression of glutaminase 2 in both cases, and it could be found in both normoxic and hypoxic compartments in sunitinib-treated tumors (Figure 4A), a result that was substantiated via RT-qPCR analysis of βTC3s cultured under normoxic and hypoxic growth conditions (Table S2); we also analyzed additional metabolic genes for differential expression and found significant upregulation of Slc2a1, Slc16a3, and Ldha in hypoxic conditions, whereas Slc2a2, Ldhb, and Gpt2 were elevated in normoxic growth conditions (Table S2).	13648	14322
27134166	Next, we investigated possible links between glutamine, lactate metabolism, and mTOR signaling.	14323	14418
27134166	First, we assessed the importance of glutamine for cell proliferation of βTC3 cells by EdU incorporation, which revealed minimal difference between the various culture conditions containing glutamine, with or without glucose and/or lactate; there was, however, a block in cell-cycle progression under glucose without glutamine conditions (w/wo lactate) (Figure S2A), highlighting the dependence of these cells on glutamine.	14419	14842
27134166	Then, we evaluated mTOR signaling in βTC3 cells (Figure 4B) cultured in different combinations of lactate and glutamine.	14843	14963
27134166	Cells were cultured in FCS and glutamine-supplemented, glucose-free media, with or without lactate.	14964	15063
27134166	Net changes in lactate levels in conditioned media (CM) were assessed.	15064	15134
27134166	Lactate levels in glutamine-supplemented, glucose-free cell media decreased reproducibly under aerobic conditions, consistent with its uptake by βTC3 cells (Figures 4B and S2B).	15135	15312
27134166	Moreover, there was significant upregulation of p-S6 levels in cells cultured in lactate + glutamine versus glutamine alone (Figure 4B, top and bottom), correlating with a net reduction of lactate in CM.	15313	15516
27134166	As expected, upregulation of p-S6 could be reversed by rapamycin.	15517	15582
27134166	Notably, p-S6 upregulation could also be reversed by inhibiting lactate uptake with CHC or 7ACC2, two distinctive inhibitors of the MCT1 lactate transporter (Sonveaux et al., 2008, Draoui et al., 2014) (Figure 4B, top and bottom).	15583	15813
27134166	In addition, a glutaminase inhibitor, DON (Durán et al., 2012) (Figure 4B, top and bottom), and an alanine aminotransferase inhibitor, AOA (Lamonte et al., 2013) (Figure 4B, top), also reversed p-S6 upregulation, whereas a glutaminase 1-specific inhibitor, BPTES, did not (Figure 4B, bottom).	15814	16106
27134166	We observed similar effects of lactate and glutamine on mTOR signaling in lactate-avid SiHa ovarian cancer cells (Figure S2C), which have been extensively used to study metabolic symbiosis (Sonveaux et al., 2008).	16107	16320
27134166	Collectively, the data support a mechanism whereby cancer cells take up and metabolize lactate in the context of bioavailable glutamine in normoxic, but not hypoxic conditions (Figures 3B and 3C), thereby upregulating mTOR signaling (Figure 4B).	16321	16566
27134166	A schematic depicting the branched metabolic pathways involved in lactate catabolism in control and treated Rip1Tag2 PanNET tumors is depicted in Figure S2D.	16567	16724
27134166	In addition, we found that βTC3 cells cultured in lactate + glutamine upregulated α-ketoglutarate compared to cells cultured in glutamine only (Figure 4C).	16725	16880
27134166	Concordantly, Sonveaux and colleagues recently reported a link between lactate and glutamine metabolism in cultured SiHa and HeLa cancer cells under oxidative conditions (Pérez-Escuredo et al., 2016).	16881	17081
27134166	In light of the proposition that potent AIs were inducing tumors to adapt a strategy of metabolic symbiosis, and the observed relocalization of mTOR signaling into the normoxic compartment of putative symbiotic clusters, we investigated the impact of blocking mTOR signaling on the AI-induced symbiosis and consequent tumor phenotypes.	17082	17417
27134166	Regression trials (depicted in Figure 5A) were initiated at 13 weeks, when the mice already had appreciable tumor burden, and continued to a defined endpoint 2 weeks later (15 weeks), when most untreated animals have succumbed to hypoglycemia attributable to increased insulin secretion from the multiple pancreatic tumors that develop.	17418	17754
27134166	Reasoning that vascular collapse might affect the bioavailability of rapamycin in the tumor microenvironment, we tested a trial regimen in which R+S and R+A arms were dosed for an initial 2D with rapamycin alone, followed by continuous dosing in combination with the AI (called “stagger” or “St”).	17755	18052
27134166	Another cohort of R+S was dosed simultaneously with both drugs from the beginning (“simultaneous” or “Sim”).	18053	18161
27134166	All three monotherapies (Mono-S, red triangles; Mono-R, yellow triangles; and Mono-A, green circles) showed anti-tumor activity, blocking further growth to produce tumor stasis compared to 13 week controls (Figure 5B, blue circles).	18162	18394
27134166	In marked contrast, each of the combinations of rapamycin plus an AI (R+S-St, purple diamonds; R+S-Sim, purple triangles; and R+A-St, rose squares) produced significant tumor regression versus the 13 week starting time point (Figure 5B, blue circles).	18395	18646
27134166	An additional 4-week-long intervention trial was performed with sunitinib, starting at 11 weeks, when the tumors were smaller, until the same defined 15 week endpoint (Figure 5C).	18647	18826
27134166	Again, while Mono-S (red triangles) and Mono-R (yellow triangles) produced significantly smaller tumors than vehicle-treated controls (blue circles), their combination (R+S-St, purple diamonds and R+S-Sim, purple triangles) produced significantly lower tumor burden than either efficacious monotherapy.	18827	19129
27134166	Other dosing strategies were also assessed, including a shift from Mono-R to Mono-S (Figure 5C, R->S, green circles), which appeared indistinguishable from each monotherapy in regard to tumor burden (TB).	19130	19334
27134166	There was also an efficacious response to the combination R+S when sunitinib was reduced by half (Figure 5C, R+1/2S, blue-gray circles).	19335	19471
27134166	Thus, both experimental therapeutic trials demonstrated anti-tumoral efficacy for the combination of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and a potent AI.	19472	19618
27134166	In order to further characterize the therapeutic response, open endpoint survival trials were performed with the combinations, in comparison to monotherapy- and vehicle-treated controls.	19619	19805
27134166	Cohorts of mice were treated starting at 13 weeks until they became moribund and were sacrificed (Figure 5D).	19806	19915
27134166	All treatments, including the monotherapy arms, led to a significant survival advantage versus vehicle-treated mice.	19916	20032
27134166	End stage tumors had progressed to a considerable size on rapamycin monotherapy, larger on average than untreated controls, indicating an adaptive resistance involving enhanced growth rates (Figure S3A), as reported previously (Chiu et al., 2010).	20033	20280
27134166	Overall, TB at end stage was higher in regimens involving axitinib versus sunitinib (Figure S3A).	20281	20378
27134166	Interestingly, both AIs produced tumors that never revascularized (data not shown).	20379	20462
27134166	Additionally, the combination therapies reduced the frequency of metastasis compared to both AI monotherapies, despite the significantly longer survival of mice in the dual therapy arms (Figure S3B).	20463	20662
27134166	It is unclear why the mice with only residual TB were dying, which is a topic worthy of future investigation.	20663	20772
27134166	The combination of rapamycin plus sunitinib treatment for 1–2 weeks reproducibly elicited tumor regression, characterized by widespread necrosis and fibrosis, and markedly reduced proliferation, particularly in large tumors (Figures S4A, S4B, and S6).	20773	21024
27134166	In contrast, while 8 weeks of Mono-S also produced tumors with pronounced necrosis and fibrosis, the remaining tumor cells were highly proliferative (Figure 1E).	21025	21186
27134166	When 13- to 15-week-treated tumors were analyzed comparatively for proliferation rates via Ki-67 staining, there was a significant reduction in proliferation in R+S-treated tumors versus controls and both monotherapies (Figure S4B).	21187	21419
27134166	Tumors treated with Mono-R had limited necrosis (data not shown), consistent with this and our previous study indicating it elicited heighted rates of apoptosis without appreciable necrosis (Chiu et al., 2010) (Figure S4C).	21420	21643
27134166	Seeking to understand the basis for this heightened necrosis, and having identified putative symbiotic clusters of cancer cells associated with remaining blood vessels in the Mono-S-treated tumors, we asked whether rapamycin was affecting symbiosis in the R+S-treated tumors.	21644	21919
27134166	The clusters could still be detected, as revealed by co-staining with MCT1 and MCT4, but their morphology was altered.	21920	22038
27134166	Surprisingly, we observed that cancer cells in the hypoxic GLUT1high, MCT4high, and mTORlow compartment were selectively depleted compared to those cells in the normoxic GLUT1low, MCT1high, and mTORhigh regions where rapamycin was acting to suppress mTOR signaling.	22039	22304
27134166	Only a rim of MCT4 cells could be detected, flanking regions of necrosis, in contrast to the multiple layers of such cells seen in the Mono-S-treated tumors (Figure 6A).	22305	22474
27134166	In contrast, rapamycin did not obviously disrupt the (previously p-S6high) MCT1high compartment (Figure 6A).	22475	22583
27134166	Thus, inhibition of mTOR signaling in the normoxic compartment was disrupting the symbiosis, but via an unexpected paracrine mechanism.	22584	22719
27134166	A tenant of the symbiosis hypothesis is that the normoxic cancer cells have not upregulated glucose transporters, in contrast to the hypoxic cells (Figure 2D), thereby sparing limited bioavailable glucose to diffuse from the nearest blood vessel to distal, but still viable hypoxic cancer cells.	22720	23015
27134166	We wondered, therefore, if mTOR inhibition affected expression of glucose transporters?	23016	23103
27134166	We first surveyed untreated tumors and observed heterogeneous expression of GLUT1 and a related transporter GLUT2, which is involved in glucose homeostasis in pancreatic islets (Guillam et al., 1997) (Figure S5A).	23104	23317
27134166	A third transporter, GLUT3, was not consistently expressed (data not shown).	23318	23394
27134166	Mono-S- and R+S-treated tumors were stained with antibodies that recognized pimonidazole adducts, indicative of hypoxia, and anti-GLUT1 and anti-GLUT2 antibodies (Figure 6B).	23395	23569
27134166	The analysis revealed appreciable upregulation of GLUT2 expression (red staining) in the normoxic regions of R+S, but not Mono-S-treated tumors (Figure 6B, bottom); the Mono-S tumors express very little GLUT2 (or GLUT1) in normoxic regions proximal to the vessels.	23570	23834
27134166	In contrast to GLUT2, GLUT1 is not widely upregulated in the normoxic compartment of R+S-treated tumors.	23835	23939
27134166	We also performed comparative IHC using automated staining with GLUT1 and GLUT2 and saw a similar upregulation of GLUT2 in the normoxic regions of R+S- versus Mono-S-treated tumors (Figure S5B).	23940	24134
27134166	Western blot analysis on tumors also confirmed GLUT2 upregulation in R+S-treated tumors versus Mono-S (Figure S5C), as did qRT-PCR (Table S1).	24135	24277
27134166	There was also a modest upregulation of GLUT2 in βTC3 cells cultured in glutamine+lactate+rapamycin versus glutamine ± lactate (Figure S5D), conditions we believe may be a surrogate for those found in the oxidative cancer cells inside AI-treated tumors.	24278	24531
27134166	Although consistent with the in vivo results, further work is required to substantiate these findings and determine the molecular pathway that governs this regulation.	24532	24699
27134166	Thus, we envision that the normoxic compartment of the putative symbiotic clusters switches, in the context of mTOR inhibition, to importing and metabolizing blood-borne glucose instead of sparing it to favor lactate.	24700	24917
27134166	Consequently, the vascular non-proximal hypoxic cells would starve from glucose deprivation and die; likely exacerbated by lactic acidosis, since the normoxic cells are now net secretors of lactate as a consequence of aerobic glycolysis.	24918	25155
27134166	Transmission electron microscopy (Figure S6) of cancer cells in the peri-necrotic region of a R+S-treated tumor reveals cells with granulated cytoplasm and grossly distended mitochondria, and abundant insulin granules, potentially indicative of the extreme conditions of insufficient oxygen and glucose, and an acidic microenvironment.	25156	25491
27134166	To further substantiate these associations, Figure S7 shows images of additional Control, Mono-S-, and R+S-treated tumors on serial sections stained with anti-MCT1, anti-MCT4, and pimonidazole, matched with anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (pS6), -GLUT1, and -GLUT2.	25492	25759
27134166	These images further document the upregulation of MCT1/4 in Mono-S- and R+S-treated tumors versus untreated controls and abundant MCT1 staining in the R+S tumors.	25760	25922
27134166	The pimonidazole/pS6 panels show strong and relatively homogenous staining of pS6 in non-hypoxic control tumors, and compartmentalized pS6 staining in the normoxic regions of Mono-S tumors, but no reactivity in the R+S-treated tumors.	25923	26157
27134166	The TEM and immunostaining analysis both support the interpretation that the hypoxic compartment is being eliminated faster than the normoxic one in the R+S-treated tumors.	26158	26330
27134166	In this and the two companion reports in this issue of Cell Reports from Pisarsky et al., 2016 and Jiménez-Valerio et al., 2016, we describe an unanticipated new mode of adaptive resistance—metabolic symbiosis—that is induced in response to potent anti-angiogenic therapies that cause vascular collapse and consequent hypoxia.	26331	26657
27134166	We show that cancer cells compartmentalize themselves in the acute condition of vascular insufficiency into comparatively hypoxic and normoxic compartments, based on their relative proximity to the few remaining functional blood vessels.	26658	26895
27134166	The hypoxic cancer cells induce expression of the glucose importer GLUT1 and the lactate exporter MCT4, which is dependent on HIF1α.	26896	27028
27134166	The normoxic cells express the lactate transporter MCT1, and we show that both normoxic cancer cells in culture and tumors in vivo import and catabolize lactate; thus lactate is not just toxic waste from glycolysis, but rather is being used for energy metabolism.	27029	27292
27134166	Moreover, our data reveal that the metabolic branch of lactate catabolism involving glutamine metabolism is favored, and this branch is blocked in tumors treated with rapamycin and anti-angiogenic therapy.	27293	27498
27134166	Moreover, PanNET cancer cells cultured in the presence of lactate and glutamine upregulate phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6); the proposition that glutamine metabolism upregulates mTOR activity is consistent with previous studies in other cell culture systems (Durán et al., 2012).	27499	27782
27134166	The association of lactate and glutamine catabolism in the regulation of mTOR in these conditions of stressful vascular insufficiency is further substantiated by our results showing that mTOR upregulation can be suppressed by impairing lactate uptake with known inhibitors of MCT1, or by inhibiting enzymes involved in glutaminolysis, namely glutaminase 2 that converts glutamine to glutamate in the first step of its metabolism and an alanine aminotransferase that in turn catalyzes the production of alanine + α-ketoglutarate from (lactate-derived) pyruvate and glutamate.	27783	28357
27134166	Other studies have reported that mTOR regulates glutamine flux and glutaminase levels (Csibi et al., 2014).	28358	28465
27134166	The observed upregulation/segregation of mTOR activity into the normoxic cell compartment induced by two potent AIs, and the resultant putative metabolic symbiosis, can be disrupted by concomitant inhibition of mTOR signaling with rapamycin.	28466	28707
27134166	Remarkably, the initial impact of inhibiting mTOR in normoxic cancer cells is the necrotic death of the hypoxic cells, which lack elevated levels of mTOR signaling.	28708	28872
27134166	An explanation for this intercellular crosstalk is offered by the observation that another glucose importer, GLUT2, is upregulated in normoxic peri-vascular cancer cells in response to rapamycin.	28873	29068
27134166	The data suggest that the normoxic cancer cells proximal to the few remaining vessels consume the available blood-borne glucose when mTOR is inhibited, thereby starving distal hypoxic cancer cells, leading to their demise.	29069	29291
27134166	Additionally, our NMR analysis of tumors suggests that mTOR inhibition blocks lactate catabolism via the anaplerotic pathway, and this abrogation of lactate consumption may lead to the intra-cellular and peri-cellular accumulation of toxic levels of lactate.	29292	29550
27134166	The regulatory pathways involved in GLUT2 induction and metabolic reprogramming when the normoxic compartment is subjected to mTOR inhibition warrant future investigation.	29551	29722
27134166	Remarkably, as summarized in the introduction, multiple modes of adaptive or evasive resistance to therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis have been reported (Casanovas et al., 2005, Shojaei and Ferrara, 2008, Bergers and Hanahan, 2008, Ebos et al., 2009, Pàez-Ribes et al., 2009, Sennino et al., 2012) in experimental therapeutic trials performed using conventional transplant and genetically engineered de novo mouse models of cancer.	29723	30158
27134166	Of these, only heighted invasiveness has been clearly implicated as an adaptive resistance mechanism in a human cancer, namely glioblastoma (Lu and Bergers, 2013; and references therein), although similar mechanisms can be envisioned to underlay the transitory clinical responses to AI therapy in virtually all tested forms of human cancer.	30159	30499
27134166	Notably, the accompanying report by Jiménez-Valerio et al. (2016, this issue of Cell Reports) documents the induction of MCT1/MCT4 lactate transporters in a pattern consistent with metabolic symbiosis in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patient-derived xenograph tumor (PDX) models treated with AI therapy.	30500	30800
27134166	Moreover, analysis of biopsies of tumors from RCC patients treated with sunitinib produced histologic signatures of metabolic symbiosis that were exacerbated in relapsing/progressing (resistant) tumors from patients on anti-angiogenic therapy.	30801	31044
27134166	Their data further show that this metabolic patterning is associated with TOR signaling, since its inhibition can evidently block this characteristic patterning.	31045	31206
27134166	This study in human RCC, along with the accompanying article by Pisarsky et al. (2016, this issue of Cell Reports) in a mouse model of breast cancer and the results presented herein collectively and compellingly add metabolic symbiosis to the roster of adaptive/evasive resistance mechanisms to anti-angiogenic therapy.	31207	31526
27134166	In a broader context, the existence of metabolic symbiosis in tumors has been previously reported by Dewhirst, Sonveaux, Feron, and colleagues to arise spontaneously in certain transplant tumor models (Kennedy et al., 2013, Sonveaux et al., 2008, Semenza, 2008).	31527	31789
27134166	They have described in a series of publications a metabolic symbiosis that conveyed decreased reliance on bioavailable glucose that limited the collateral damage from secreted lactate and consequent lactic acidosis, achieved by symbiotic cells importing and utilizing the lactate produced by glycolysis (Kennedy et al., 2013, Sonveaux et al., 2008, Semenza, 2008).	31790	32154
27134166	The concept of metabolic symbiosis in neoplasia has been extended to interactions between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts endothelial cells, macrophages (Nakajima and Van Houten, 2013; and references therein), and also documented in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Guillaumond et al., 2013).	32155	32456
27134166	Its physiological basis lays in analogous symbiotic relationships operative in certain normal tissues, in particular brain and muscle (Draoui and Feron, 2011; and references therein).	32457	32640
27134166	The concept can now be extended further, with the demonstrations that metabolic symbiosis can be induced in response to a serious environmental stress—angiogenesis inhibition, with consequent dropout and insufficiency of the tumor vasculature, and widespread hypoxia—in models of pancreatic neuroendocrine, breast, and renal cancer and in human RCC (this report, and the accompanying reports by Pisarsky et al. and Jiménez-Valerio et al.).	32641	33080
27134166	The question arises as to whether disruption of this mode of resistance might have value in extending the duration of efficacious responses by anti-angiogenic therapies.	33081	33250
27134166	We show that metabolic symbiosis induced by sunitinib/axitinib can be disrupted by concomitant inhibition of mTOR signaling, resulting in significant reductions in TB and viability, but with only modest (albeit significant) extension in survival.	33251	33497
27134166	The limited survival benefit suggests that “rapalogs” may not prove to be ideal drugs to disrupt this form of adaptive resistance; moreover, combinations of sunitinib/axitinib with the rapalog everolimus have been tested clinically, with limited benefit and significant toxicity (Molina et al., 2012).	33498	33799
27134166	An alternative and potentially more attractive strategy may be to inhibit the MCT1 and/or MCT4 lactate transporters with highly selective drugs.	33800	33944
27134166	Indeed, the preliminary studies reported herein and in the companion paper by Christofori et al. (2016), in which expression of MCT4 was suppressed genetically, encourages further preclinical and then potentially clinical evaluation, given that a number of MCT1 and MCT4 inhibitors are in pharmacological development.	33945	34262
27134166	An important further consideration is that tumors faced with vascular dropout and insufficiency evoked by potent AIs may activate multiple modes of adaptive/evasive resistance, in different regions of the tumor microenvironment.	34263	34491
27134166	For example, in the RIP1Tag2 mouse model of PanNET, sunitinib is apparently inducing two distinctive modes of adaptive resistance, namely, symbiosis in hypoxic regions of regressing tumors, and, as reported previously, increased invasion and metastasis (Pàez-Ribes et al., 2009), in part by upregulating cMET signaling (Sennino et al., 2012).	34492	34834
27134166	It is presently unclear whether these invading cancer cells also induce symbiosis upon reaching a size/location where diffusion of oxygen and glucose from co-opted normal vessels is insufficient, evoking hypoxia and, in turn, symbiosis.	34835	35071
27134166	In fact, others have postulated that tumor acidity may promote local invasion (Gatenby and Gillies, 2004, Estrella et al., 2013).	35072	35201
27134166	Interestingly, we observed that co-inhibiting angiogenesis and mTOR reduces the incidence of metastasis, but it is unclear whether this effect relates to disruption of symbiosis or some other physiological parameter.	35202	35418
27134166	Future studies in preclinical and clinical trials may shed light on the interplay between adaptive resistance mechanisms and means to concomitantly disrupt them.	35419	35580
27134166	An interesting question, not fully answered by the current studies, is how these metabolic clusters are induced to form, and in particular, why the peri-vascular normoxic cancer cells choose to take up and metabolize lactate and spare the limited glucose for their hypoxic brethren.	35581	35863
27134166	A plausible explanation for the formation and disruption of metabolic symbiosis is illustrated schematically in Figure 7, and might transpire as follows: extensive vascular collapse elicited by the AIs results in hypoxia to trigger the HIF1α transcription factor; HIF1α induces GLUT1 and MCT4 and activates glycolysis in the hypoxic cancer cells, leading to high levels of lactate secretion; accumulating extracellular lactate induces expression of the MCT1 lactate transporter and, consequently, import of lactate into the normoxic cancer cells; in concert with serum-derived glutamine, lactate is catabolized in the normoxic cancer cells with consequent induction of mTOR signaling to promote tumor metabolism.	35864	36576
27134166	Notably, mTOR expression must be both cause and consequence, since its pharmacological inhibition results in the normoxic cancer cells upregulating a glucose transporter (GLUT2), and apparently switching to secrete rather than import lactate, resulting both in insufficient glucose for the hypoxic cells and likely toxic acidosis in the extracellular microenvironment.	36577	36945
27134166	In addition, mTOR has been shown by others to be upregulated by (Durán et al., 2012) and also to control glutamine metabolism (Csibi et al., 2014).	36946	37093
27134166	We extend these results by showing that its inhibition blocks the conversion of lactate-derived pyruvate/glutamate to alanine/α-ketoglutarate in R+S-treated tumors, disrupting the production of TCA cycle intermediates, potentially contributing to increased levels of (toxic and non-catabolized) lactate.	37094	37397
27134166	While plausible, this rationale for the assembly and disruption of symbiosis will require future experimental validation.	37398	37519
27134166	In conclusion, the induction of metabolic symbiosis in response to vascular insufficiency elicited by potent AIs further illustrates the remarkable propensity of cancer cells to circumvent barriers that arise during tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and in response to treatment.	37520	37799
27134166	This symbiotic adaptation evidently constitutes another mechanism that enables tumors to overcome the damaging effects of targeted therapies, by co-opting cellular processes intended for important homeostatic purposes that instead serve the evolving cancer.	37800	38057
27134166	Sunitinib and axitinib were purchased from LC laboratories.	38058	38117
27134166	Rapamune (rapamycin) was purchased from Galexis.	38118	38166

27134166	All mice used in this study were maintained in a pathogen-free barrier animal facility of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EFPL) in accord with Swiss regulations for the care and use of mice in experimental research.	38254	38489
27134166	βTC3 cells were acclimated to “low” glucose (6.25 mM glucose + 4 mM Gln +10% FCS).	38490	38572
27134166	They were subsequently plated at 7 × 106 cells/10 cm tissue culture dish in low glucose culture media for 2 days, switched to 0% glucose/0% Gln + 10% FCS ON, then cultured in 20 mM 3–13C-lactate or 20 mM 1–13C-glucose + 4 mM Gln (no glucose) for 16 hr in hypoxic (1% O2/5% CO2) or normoxic (21% O2/5% CO2) conditions, and harvested for NMR.	38573	38913
27134166	Plates were harvested individually on ice, rinsed twice with PBS, and collected in 0.9 M perchloric acid, which was subsequently titrated to approximately neutral pH with 0.9 M potassium hydroxide (KOH); extracts were lyophilized for NMR.	38914	39152
27134166	Mice were treated for 10 days with sunitinib or vehicle control and were infused with 3–13-C-lactate in PBS, by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, over a period of 90 min.	39153	39323
27134166	Pentobarbital was administered, and the mice were perfused intravenously (i.v.) with a fluoresceinated lectin.	39324	39434
27134166	Tumors were excised and immediately quick frozen in liquid nitrogen.	39435	39503
27134166	For NMR, the frozen tumors were pulverized in liquid nitrogen, 0.9 M perchloric acid was added to the pulverized tumor tissue, rotated at 4°C for 2 hr, and titrated with 0.9 M KOH to a final of approximately pH 6–7.	39504	39719
27134166	NMR analysis was performed using a Bruker AVII 800 MHz spectrometer (18.8 T) equipped with a triple channel 5 mm cryoprobe (CPTCIz).	39720	39852
27134166	13C and 1H spectra were acquired using 30° angle pulses on 13C with decoupling on proton (zgpg).	39853	39949
27134166	A repetition delay (d1) of 3 s and 2,048 scans (ns) was used.	39950	40011
27134166	Spectra were processed with MestreNova software 10 using 5 Hz of line broadening.	40012	40093
27134166	The chemical shift scale was calibrated with 3–13C lactate (21 ppm) as a reference, according to Shen et al. (1999) and Patel et al. (2005).	40094	40234
27134166	To prepare samples for introduction into the NMR, 300 μl of pulverized cell solution was mixed with 100 μl of D2O (99.9% deuterated), shaken for 2 min, and directly poured into a 5 mm NMR tube.	40235	40428
27134166	Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) software, and a log rank test was performed using software from the Broad Institute (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/russell/logrank/index.html).	40429	40653
27134166	Due to the small sample size (as few as eight animals per treatment group) and the fact that not all the data are normally distributed, a non-parametric, suitable Mann-Whitney test was used (Figures 1A, 5B, 5C, S1A, S3A, S4B, and S4C; Tables S1 and S2), the log rank test was used for survival studies (Figure 5D), and the Student’s t test was used for Figures 4C, S5C, and S5D.	40654	41032
27134166	For the incidence of metastasis during survival trials (Figure S3B), data were analyzed using R, where the event is “metastasis” and the horizontal axis is “age of sacrifice due to declining health status”, we tested whether the metastases are more frequent in one group versus the other (function “survdiff”).	41033	41343

27248656	1.	0	2
27248656	A long-time phenomenon has been observed and confirmed that hypertensive patients from northern China usually suffer from more serious kidney disease than those from southern China, mainly because people in northern China favour a high-salt diet, whereas people in southern China do not.	3	290
27248656	Based on previous investigations, high-salt diet often increases glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, size and weight of rat kidneys.	291	428
27248656	However, it was found that the augmented proteinuria was not simply owing to the adverse effects of hypertension on kidneys.	429	553
27248656	Atenolol treatment was reported to reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) effectively, but it hardly relieved the increased urinary protein excretion in salt-loaded SHR, suggesting blood-pressure-independent factors possibly contribute to renal disease.	554	805
27248656	Thus, it was concluded that the increases in SBP and proteinuria might be independent consequences of a high-salt diet.	806	925
27248656	In addition to the well-known effect of salt loading on blood pressure, such clinical and experimental observations were in favour of non-pressure-related effects of salt that could contribute to its influence on nephropathic outcome.	926	1160
27248656	A reduction in renal oxygenation often occurs in most chronic kidney diseases irrespective of aetiology.	1161	1265
27248656	This is due to a combination of several pathophysiological and morphological changes, which consist of increased oxygen demand from hyperfiltration, tubular hypertrophy, capillary rarefaction and glomerular injury.	1266	1480
27248656	The resulting reduction in renal oxygen availability is furthermore exacerbated by renal fibrosis, which limits oxygen diffusion.	1481	1610
27248656	Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a hallmark of tissue hypoxia, which is responsible for the induction of genes that facilitate tissue fibrosis from normoxia to hypoxia.	1611	1786
27248656	Among numerous growth factors and cytokines, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been identified as the most potent target cytokine of HIF-1α in renal fibrosis.	1787	1952
27248656	On the other hand, HIF-1α levels paralleled not only tissue hypoxia, but also oxidative stress and accumulation of inflammatory mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1).	1953	2198
27248656	IL-6−/− mice previously demonstrated reduced histological evidence of tubular injury when they were subjected to renal infusion/repression (I/R).	2199	2344
27248656	In the kidney, TNF-α often contributes to the chronic inflammation that often precedes interstitial matrix deposition, and is also implicated in obstruction-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis.	2345	2539
27248656	MCP-1 has been recognized as an angiogenic cytokine, which was implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases characterized by monocytic infiltrates, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or atherosclerosis.	2540	2754
27248656	Furthermore, MCP-1 was likewise produced in renal tubular cells, and increased MCP-1 expression usually contributed to renal tubular damage.	2755	2895
27248656	Although hypoxia is well known to increase HIF-1α, a growing body of evidence indicates that oxidative stress-dependent mediators, including inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, also stimulate HIF-1α gene activity.	2896	3116
27248656	In short, high-salt-induced nephropathy is an extremely complicated biological process, which contains the cross-talk between renal hypoxia and excessive oxidative stress.	3117	3288
27248656	Thus, animal models were much better research objects than cell models in this study.	3289	3374
27248656	Urine is easily obtainable biological fluid that contains useful biological markers for renal diseases.	3375	3478
27248656	It has been widely used to study renal pathophysiology.	3479	3534
27248656	Urinary proteins mainly come from the glomerular filtration of blood plasma.	3535	3611
27248656	Urine has been defined as a fluid biopsy of the kidneys because it provides direct (and indeed substantial) information about the kidney.	3612	3749
27248656	Thus, many changes and alterations in kidney functions can be detected in the urinary proteome.	3750	3845
27248656	Here, with the help of the latest proteomic technology, we investigate the possible mechanisms of high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY)/spontaneous hypertensive (SHR) rats.	3846	4050

27248656	The rat cell line, NRK-52E (ATCC, CRL-1571™), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Hyclone, Herndon, VA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, NY) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco; Grand Island, NY), and incubated at 5% CO2 and 95% humidified atmosphere air at 37°C.	7958	8271
27248656	The culture medium was replaced twice a week.	8272	8317
27248656	Once the cells reached confluency, they were passaged using trypsin (0.05%)–EDTA (0.02%) solution.	8318	8416
27248656	The two recombinant lentiviral expression vectors used in this study were synthesized by Bioworld.	8417	8515
27248656	One vector expressed Hsp90β-specific siRNA (sense strand: 5′-GAGCTGATACCTGAGTACCTCAACT-3′) and GFP, whereas the other expressed Control siRNA (sense strand: 5′-GCAACCAGGACACTCGTTACATGTT-3′) and GFP.	8516	8714
27248656	Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells well−1 in six-well culture plates for lentiviral infection.	8715	8822
27248656	After 24 h, the medium was removed and 1.0 ml DMEM containing 10% FBS, 10 µl (5 × 107) lentivirus and 1 µl (10 mg ml) polybrene (Bioworld, Nanjing) was added to each culture well and gently mixed.	8823	9019
27248656	After 12 h, the cell culture medium was removed again, and 2 ml DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics was added.	9020	9134
27248656	Infection was confirmed after 72 h by fluorescence microscopy and little to no toxicity was seen.	9135	9232
27248656	The cells were passaged and immediately assessed by RT-PCR to ensure the effects of Hsp90β knockdown.	9233	9334
27248656	Cadmium was added to the medium to induce Hsp90 expression, which could upregulate Hsp90 level in NRK-52E cell line.	9335	9451
27248656	2.7.	9452	9456
27248656	At this stage, 10-week-old SHR rats (n = 60) received a high-NaCl (4%) diet for six weeks.	7394	7484
27248656	SHR rats were also regularly tested with polymorphic markers to confirm their inbred status.	7485	7577
27248656	Then, these SHR rats were randomly divided into three groups (SHR + HS group, SHR + HS + Control siRNA group and SHR + HS + Hsp90β siRNA group).	9641	9785
27248656	NRK-52E transfectants (1 × 106 cells) expressing either Control siRNA sequence or Hsp90β siRNA sequence were injected into kidneys of SHR + HS rats via the renal artery as previously described.	9786	9979
27248656	Rats received 1 ml renal arterial injection of vehicle (saline) as control.	9980	10055
27248656	2.8.	10056	10060
27248656	Tissue samples of whole kidneys were homogenized in ice-cold PBS buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail, and the total proteins were extracted using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL), according to the manufacturer's protocol.	10061	10333
27248656	The protein concentration of tissue supernatant was determined by BioSpec-nano (Shimadzu Biotech, Kyoto).	10334	10439
27248656	Proteins were immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies respectively.	10440	10512
27248656	The precleared Protein A/G Plus–agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with immunocomplexes for 2 h and washed four times with the lysis buffer.	10513	10674
27248656	The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS–PAGE followed by transferring onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences).	10675	10813
27248656	The immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously.	10814	10876
27248656	The antibody–antigen complexes were visualized by the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System according to the manufacturer's instruction using IRDye800 fluorophore-conjugated antibody (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) or using TMB immunoblotting system (Promega, Madison, WI).	10877	11153
27248656	Quantification was directly performed on the blot using the LI-COR Odyssey analysis software.	11154	11247
27248656	2.9.	11248	11252
27248656	Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.	11253	11286
27248656	Statistical analyses were performed by unpaired t-test, ANOVA and subsequent Tukey's test or Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Mann–Whitney U-test.	11287	11432
27248656	p < 0.05 was considered significant.	11433	11469
27248656	3.	5841	5843
27248656	3.1.	11473	11477
27248656	We first examined whether a high-salt diet affected blood pressure and proteinuria in WKY/SHR rats.	11478	11577
27248656	Even at the age of 20 weeks, the SBP of high-salt-diet groups was not considerably higher than the normal-salt-diet group (electronic supplementary material, figure S1).	11578	11747
27248656	However, the relativity of the relationship between natriuresis and blood pressure tended to be somewhat significant with increasing age, thereby indicating that blood pressure might be sensitive to salt loading with old age.	11748	11973
27248656	Urinary microalbumin and β2-microglobulin are common nephropathic indicators that reflect the severity of renal pathogenesis.	11974	12099
27248656	Strikingly, the differences of microalbumin and β2-microglobulin were much more pronounced (electronic supplementary material, figure S1).	12100	12238
27248656	At the age of 20 weeks, the degree of proteinuria in WKY + HS group was nearly twice that seen in WKY group, and the degree of proteinuria in SHR + HS group even reached three times that of SHR group.	12239	12439
27248656	Thus, the data implied that non-pressure-related effects of salt loading mainly contributed to its impact on nephropathic outcome.	12440	12570
27248656	3.2.	12571	12575
27248656	HE staining and injury indices showed that high-salt diet indeed caused nephropathy in WKY/SHR rats (figure 1), where renal tubular hyalinecasts enlargement and atrophy were obviously seen in high-salt-diet groups.	12576	12790
27248656	Meanwhile, hypertension-induced renal arteriole wall thickening was also markedly seen in either SHR group or SHR + HS group.	12791	12916
27248656	In human renal disease, the reduction in glomerular filtration rate is significantly related to the histological changes observed in the tubules and interstitium.	12917	13079
27248656	The excess filtered protein reabsorption by the proximal tubules is degraded by lysosomes.	13080	13170
27248656	When the intracellular products of this degradation reach the interstitial space, they give rise to focal infiltrates of inflammatory cells with an increased deposition of collagen, matrix and fibrous tissue.	13171	13379
27248656	Our data also yielded that high-salt diet resulted in the inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis of rat kidneys.	13380	13492
27248656	Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed severe renal damage, such as renal tubular epithelial cell vacuolization in high-salt-diet groups (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).	13493	13705
27248656	Interestingly, renal tubular atrophy and epithelial cell vacuolization were usually indicative of epithelial cells undergoing programmed cell death.	13706	13854
27248656	3.3.	13855	13859
27248656	Many changes and alterations in kidney functions can be monitored in rat models through urinary proteomic analysis.	13860	13975
27248656	Here, we performed urine quantitative proteome analysis in either normotensive or hypertensive rats that could specifically reflect non-pressure-related proteomic changes upon salt-loading.	13976	14165
27248656	Contrasted with WKY group, there were 28 upregulated proteins and 12 downregulated proteins in WKY + HS group (electronic supplementary material, table S2).	14166	14322
27248656	Moreover, contrasted with SHR group, there were 39 upregulated proteins and 18 downregulated proteins in SHR + HS group (electronic supplementary material, table S3).	14323	14489
27248656	Among these differentially expressed proteins, 25 upregulated proteins and 10 downregulated proteins were common in WKY + HS group and SHR + HS group (bold in electronic supplementary material, table S2 and S3).	14490	14701
27248656	Elevated level of fibronectin is usually involved in tissue fibrosis, which can be directly regulated by HIF-1α transcriptionally.	14702	14832
27248656	Superoxide dismutase [Cu–Zn] was also upregulated, which was involved in excessive renal oxidative stress.	14833	14939
27248656	On the other hand, EGF, u-PA and cadherin-1 were downregulated in high-salt-diet groups, which were proven to have cytoprotective effects in the kidney, such as the prevention of fibrosis and degradation of accumulated extracellular matrix.	14940	15180
27248656	We finally selected heat shock protein β (Hsp90β) owning to two factors: it was previously proven to regulate the upstream mediators in multiple cellular signalling cascades through stabilizing and maintaining their activities, and it is the only protein possibly involving renal fibrosis, inflammation and tubular epithelial cell death here; it has been rarely seen in previous investigations of salt-loading-induced renal dysfunction.	15181	15617
27248656	3.4.	15618	15622
27248656	Immunohistochemical analysis of Hsp90β were performed here, and revealed that its expression was indeed elevated in high salt diet groups (electronic supplementary material, figure S3), which was also confirmed by RT-PCR measurements.	15623	15857
27248656	Interestingly, high-salt diet did not affect Hsp90α expression (figure 2).	15858	15932
27248656	TGF-β, HIF-1α, TNF-α, IL-6 and MCP-1 expressions were similarly elevated in high-salt-diet groups markedly (figure 2).	15933	16051
27248656	These nephropathic markers are universal proinflammatory or profibrotic cytokines, which can be directly or indirectly regulated by diverse cellular signalling cascades, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).	16052	16308
27248656	Therefore, we examined the effects of high-salt diet on NF-κB, extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK signalling cascades here.	16309	16486
27248656	The results showed that high-salt diet augmented the activations of NF-κB and p38 MAPK without altering the activations of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 in high-salt-diet groups (figure 3).	16487	16664
27248656	Meanwhile, NF-κB nuclear translocation was also increased markedly by high-salt diet (electronic supplementary material, figure S4).	16665	16797
27248656	In addition, due to the fact that tubular epithelial cell death occurred in high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy, we also examined the effects of salt-loading on Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2, an anti-apoptotic protein) activation, and the data showed that it indeed led to the phosphorylation/inactivation of Bcl-2.	16798	17107
27248656	3.5.	17108	17112
27248656	In this study, SHR rats developed more severe nephropathy than WKY rats in response to high-salt diet, because essential hypertension is often characterized to induce vascular remodelling (VR).	17113	17306
27248656	VR mainly involves thickening of the arterial wall, and this change also facilitates the development of tissue damage.	17307	17425
27248656	Thus, we selected SHR + HS group as the target of Hsp90β inhibition in this study.	17426	17508
27248656	A water-soluble Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-DMAG, was administrated to investigate the role of Hsp90β in high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy.	17509	17641
27248656	On the other hand, Hsp90β siRNA was also transfected into rat kidneys to improve the specificity of Hsp90β inhibition, whereas immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the effects of Hsp90β knockdown in vivo (electronic supplementary material, figure S5).	17642	17895
27248656	It was demonstrated that Hsp90β inhibition hardly affected the SBP of SHR + HS group (electronic supplementary material, figure S6a,d).	17896	18031
27248656	However, urinary secretion of microalbumin and β2-microglobulin was reversed significantly by 17-DMAG dose-dependently (electronic supplementary material, figure S6b,c), and this effect was also confirmed by treatment with Hsp90β knockdown (electronic supplementary material, figure S6e,f).	18032	18322
27248656	HE staining and TEM analysis were carried out to evaluate the effects of Hsp90β inhibition on renal histology.	18323	18433
27248656	We discovered that 17-DMAG or Hsp90β knockdown significantly impaired glomerular fibrosis, renal tubular hyalinecasts, enlargement and atrophy (figure 4), and renal tubular epithelial cell vacuolization was also relieved by Hsp90β inhibition (electronic supplementary material, figure S7).	18434	18723
27248656	3.6.	18724	18728
27248656	Contrasted with SHR + HS group, 17-DMAG or Hsp90β knockdown reversed the phosphorylations of inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBα), Bcl-2 and p38 MAPK, without altering their protein expressions (figure 5).	18729	18925
27248656	Meanwhile, NF-κB nuclear translocation was impaired significantly by Hsp90β inhibition (electronic supplementary material, figure S8).	18926	19060
27248656	Next, we examined the effects of Hsp90β inhibition on upstream kinases of NF-κB and p38, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3/6) and IKKα/β (IκB kinase α/β).	19061	19239
27248656	The results showed that 17-DMAG or Hsp90β knockdown also reversed the phosphorylation of IKKα/β in SHR + HS rats, suggesting that Hsp90β is required for the protein stability of IKK.	19240	19422
27248656	Surprisingly, MKK3/6 activation was not affected by Hsp90β inhibition.	19423	19493
27248656	It was suspected that p38 activation might be regulated via other uncanonical activators.	19494	19583
27248656	MKK3/6-independent p38 activation is usually associated with TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB-1) interaction, when active AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can trigger p38 recruitment to TAB1 and p38 autophosphorylation.	19584	19801
27248656	Our data revealed that Hsp90β inhibition reversed TAB-1-mediated p38 phosphorylation via inactivation of AMPKα (electronic supplementary material, figure S9).	19802	19960
27248656	In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylates and activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6 K, Thr389), which is also involved in the phosphorylation/inactivation of Bcl-2.	19961	20155
27248656	Inactivation of Bcl-2 triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, leading to the activations of downstream pro-apoptotic caspases.	20156	20298
27248656	Our data also showed that 17-DMAG or Hsp90β knockdown indeed reversed the activations of mTOR/p70S6 K and the release of cytochrome c (figure 6), suggesting that Hsp90β promotes the tubular epithelial cell apoptosis mediated by mTOR signalling.	20299	20543
27248656	3.7.	20544	20548
27248656	A variety of signalling proteins involved in cell survival, growth and differentiation are recognized as Hsp90 client proteins.	20549	20676
27248656	On ATP binding, the Hsp90 client complex associates with co-chaperones such as cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) and p23 to facilitate client stabilization.	20677	20830
27248656	Here, we investigated whether Hsp90β inhibition affected the stability of some potential Hsp90β client proteins in rat kidneys (figure 7).	20831	20969
27248656	The results demonstrated that 17-DMAG or Hsp90β knockdown effectively reduced the interactions of TAK1 (TGF-β-Activated Kinase 1), AMPKα, IKKα/β, HIF-1α and Raptor (regulatory-associated protein of TOR, an important positive regulatory subunit of mTOR complex) with Hsp90β, indicating that endogenous Hsp90β protein complex was required to maintain the high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy.	20970	21358
27248656	In addition, we measured the urinary secretion of 8-OHdG (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, an indicator of renal oxidative stress; electronic supplementary material, figure S10).	21359	21533
27248656	Compared with normal-salt-diet groups, high-salt-diet induced greater renal oxidative damage.	21534	21627
27248656	However, 17-DMAG or Hsp90β knockdown decreased the urinary secretion of 8-OHdG in SHR + HS group.	21628	21725
27248656	In spite of the effects of Hsp90β on ROS-mediated cellular signalling pathways, our results indicated that Hsp90β was also required for excessive renal oxidative stress in salt-loaded rats.	21726	21915
27248656	4.	6949	6951
27248656	Here, we identified a novel mechanism of high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy, including renal inflammation, fibrosis and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis.	21919	22073
27248656	Our data showed for the first time that, to the best of our knowledge, high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy was specifically associated with enhanced levels of Hsp90β, which played the key role in non-pressure-related effects of salt loading.	22074	22314
27248656	However, Hsp90α, another important isoform of Hsp90, tended to be sensitive to hypertension instead of salt loading in this study.	22315	22445
27248656	It indicated that Hsp90α and Hsp90β might exhibit significantly different behaviours under stress conditions, though they had similar interactions with co-chaperones.	22446	22612
27248656	The majority of renal oxygen consumption results from reabsorption of approximately 99.5% of filtered sodium, so the increased kidney metabolism is usually associated with high-salt diet, as well as the decreased renal oxygen availability in both animals and patients.	22613	22881
27248656	This change directly results in renal hypoxia, which often leads to the overexpression of HIF-1.	22882	22978
27248656	Here, HIF-1 was indeed increased dramatically in response to salt loading in WKY/SHR.	22979	23064
27248656	HIF-1 is often responsible for renal fibrosis.	23065	23111
27248656	Here, our in vivo data showed that Hsp90β protected HIF-1α in high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy, which was reversed by 17-DMAG or Hsp90β knockdown.	23112	23260
27248656	Hsp90 has been reported to induce the stabilization of HIF-1α.	23261	23323
27248656	Thus, Hsp90β inhibition resulted in the decreased expression of HIF-1α, leading to the impaired transcriptional regulatory activity of HIF-1.	23324	23465
27248656	In this study, the expression of TGF-β (a key downstream target gene of HIF-1) was indeed reduced by Hsp90β inhibition, and the TGF-β-mediated renal fibrosis obtained effective restriction simultaneously.	23466	23670
27248656	In the kidney, a high salt intake often favours not only renal hypoxia, but also renal oxidative stress.	23671	23775
27248656	The reason might be that hypoxia could accumulate ROS in renal tissue, and this oxidative stress conversely facilitated renal hypoxia owing to inefficient cellular respiration.	23776	23952
27248656	In vitro COS-7 cell experiments previously demonstrated that Hsp90 could interact with Nox5, and was required for enzyme stability and ROS production of Nox.	23953	24110
27248656	Our in vivo data also yielded that secretion of urinary 8-OHdG was strikingly elevated in response to salt loading, and reversed by Hsp90β inhibition.	24111	24261
27248656	Besides the direct effect on renal oxidative stress, Hsp90β might also affect ROS-mediated renal inflammation and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis together.	24262	24419
27248656	Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6 and MCP-1, were indeed induced substantially in response to salt loading, which could be transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB or p38 MAPK signalling cascades.	24420	24626
27248656	Our results showed that high-salt diet simultaneously promoted the inflammatory response via NF-κB and p38 MAPK activations in rat kidneys, which were markedly reversed by 17-DMAG or Hsp90β knockdown.	24627	24827
27248656	Here, Hsp90β maintained the protein stability of IKK, and IKK activated downstream IκBα, where inactivated IκBα blocked the transcriptional regulatory activity of NF-κB.	24828	24997
27248656	Decreased nuclear translocation of NF-κB confirmed the role of Hsp90β inhibition.	24998	25079
27248656	Similarly, Hsp90β inhibition might induce the degradation of AMPKα, and cause a significant decrease in enzyme ability of AMPKα, where AMPKα–TAB1 complex maintained the kinase activity of p38.	25080	25272
27248656	More importantly, Hsp90β inhibition significantly suppressed salt-loading-stimulated expression of TAK1, where TAK1–TAB1 complex maintained the kinase activity of IKK.	25273	25440
27248656	In addition, HIF-1α has been reported to be phosphorylated by p38 directly, and NF-κB could stimulate the transcription of HIF-1α gene.	25441	25576
27248656	Thus, there might be a cross-talk between renal inflammation and fibrosis.	25577	25651
27248656	On the other hand, high-salt-diet-induced oxidative stress damages epithelial cells directly, causing the tubular epithelial cell death.	25652	25788
27248656	mTOR may have a pleiotropic function in the regulation of cell apoptosis.	25789	25862
27248656	The binding of raptor to mTOR is required for the mTOR-catalysed phosphorylation of downstream effectors, where it strongly enhances the mTOR kinase activity towards p70S6 K. Activation of mTOR and downstream target p70S6 K is associated with increased inactivation of Bcl-2 and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, suggesting that the mTOR pathway plays a critical role in the apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells in response to salt loading.	25863	26332
27248656	Our results showed that 17-DMAG or Hsp90β knockdown impaired the protein stability of Raptor, and this change resulted in the suppression of mTOR activity.	26333	26488
27248656	Thus, Hsp90β inhibition might relieve the renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis via downregulating mTOR-p70S6 K-Bcl2 axis, and the reduction of renal tubular epithelial cell vacuolization confirmed this point.	26489	26700
27248656	Moreover, IKK has been reported to phosphorylate and inactivate tuberous sclerosis protein 1, which could facilitate the activation of mTOR signalling.	26701	26852
27248656	It indicated that renal inflammation might not only promote renal fibrosis reciprocally, but also affect the renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis.	26853	27002
27248656	In this study, the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by Hsp90β inhibition indeed accompanied the downregulation of HIF-1-mediated fibrosis and Bcl-2-mediated cell death.	27003	27178
27248656	As a conclusion, the renal hypoxia and oxidative stress driven by high-salt diet promoted the progress of renal damage, including renal inflammation, fibrosis and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis.	27179	27376
27248656	Hsp90β maintained the stability and activity of various cellular signalling proteins, which might be required for non-pressure-related effects of high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy (figure 8).	27377	27569
27248656	We also believed that the regulatory functions of Hsp90β would not be merely confined to our study, because the latest discovery revealed that 17-DMAG also ameliorated diabetic nephropathy via the suppression of NF-κB and STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) signalling in experimental mice.	27570	27882
27248656	All these factors suggest that Hsp90β has potential therapeutic value in high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy.	27883	27991
27384305	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) defines a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, progressing in rare cases to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1–3).	0	226
27384305	Around 30% of the United States adult population has NAFLD with 3%–5% diagnosed with NASH (4), leading to increased morbidity and mortality (5).	227	371
27384305	Accumulating evidence supports an association between NAFLD and metabolic syndrome (MetS).	372	462
27384305	Around 75% of obese people have NAFLD, with insulin resistance a key mechanistic factor between both conditions (6).	463	579
27384305	As such, NAFLD can be regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the MetS, which together increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (6, 7).	580	730
27384305	Patients affected by glucocorticoid (GC) excess (Cushing syndrome) present with many of the disorders associated with MetS and can develop NAFLD (8).	731	880
27384305	GCs promote steatosis through multiple mechanisms including stimulation of lipolysis within adipose tissue resulting in increased free fatty acid (FFA) delivery for utilization in the liver to produce lipids through enhanced hepatic de novo lipogenesis (9–11).	881	1141
27384305	In most patients with NAFLD and MetS, circulating GC concentrations are not elevated (12).	1142	1232
27384305	However, GCs can be activated in a tissue-specific manner through the prereceptor activity of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) enzyme, with the site of greatest activity being the liver (13).	1233	1446
27384305	Thus, hepatic metabolism affected by GCs is a balance between circulating delivery and 11β-HSD1-mediated intracellular activation.	1447	1577
27384305	Preclinical studies using 11β-HSD1 knockout (KO) and transgenic mice have exemplified the role 11β-HSD1 can play in determining hepatic metabolic phenotype.	1578	1734
27384305	Global deletion of 11β-HSD1 protects against high-fat diet induced obesity and glucose intolerance, whereas liver-specific 11β-HSD1 deletion does not (14–16).	1735	1893
27384305	11β-HSD1KO mice are protected from hepatosteatosis in the face of circulating GC excess and reveal the importance of adipose tissue in determining hepatic phenotype (14).	1894	2064
27384305	Furthermore, mice with transgenic overexpression of 11β-HSD1, specifically in adipose and liver, develop hepatosteatosis in the context of a high-fat diet (17, 18).	2065	2229
27384305	Data from studies in humans support the idea that with steatosis there is decreased hepatic 11β-HSD1-mediated GC reactivation, possibly due to decrease local GC availability and preservation of metabolic phenotype (19).	2230	2449
27384305	11β-HSD1 inhibitors have been the subject of interest regarding their use in the treatment of conditions associated with MetS, with in-excess of 170 compounds having been developed for this purpose (20–23).	2450	2656
27384305	Human clinical studies evaluating NAFLD patients showed that pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 was able to modestly reduce liver fat content over a 12-week treatment period, although whether this was a direct or peripheral effect was unclear (24).	2657	2909
27384305	Given the important role that 11β-HSD1-mediated GC metabolism plays in determining systemic and liver metabolic phenotype, we hypothesized that global deletion (11β-HSD1KO) and hepatocyte-specific deletion (LKO) mice would be protected from MetS and hepatosteatosis when subjected to a potent steatogenic diet.	2910	3220
27384305	To this end, we fed 11β-HSD1KO mice the American Lifestyle Induced Obesity Syndrome (ALIOS) diet which, unlike a standard high-fat diet, is known to more faithfully recapitulate the spectrum of NAFLD, from steatosis to NASH (25).	3221	3450
27384305	Our data suggest that 11β-HSD1 loss of function affords no protection from ALIOS induced obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance or hepatosteatosis.	3451	3608
27384305	Unexpectedly, we show that in the context of hepatosteatosis, 11β-HSD1KO mice have increased inflammation, a prerequisite for the progression to NASH, as revealed by an accumulation of hepatic immune foci and increased expression of immune and inflammatory markers.	3609	3874
27384305	These results suggest a role for 11β-HSD1 in restraining hepatic inflammation in NAFLD.	3875	3962
27384305	Male mice aged 7–8 weeks, with global (11β-HSD1KO) and hepatocyte-specific (LKO) deletions of 11β-HSD1 (16, 26); along with age-matched C57BL/6 control mice (Charles River) were used.	3963	4146
27384305	Male mice were used as we did not want to deviate from the original ALIOS protocol, where advanced hepatosteatosis was attained using the feeding protocol described below (25).	4147	4323
27384305	Mice were housed 2–3 per cage and maintained at the Biomedical Services Unit at the University of Birmingham, and all procedures conducted in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986; regulated by the United Kingdom Home Office.	4324	4572
27384305	Mice were maintained on a 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycle at 21°C–22°C and were fed ad libitum, a diet consisting of 45% of calories from fat, of which 11.6% were derived from transfats (D13022701; Research Diets, Inc).	4573	4794
27384305	Mice were also given a high fructose corn syrup equivalent drinking water replacement (55% fructose:45% glucose [wt/vol] deionized H2O at a concentration of 42 g/L).	4795	4960
27384305	This feeding regimen, referred to as the ALIOS diet (25), was maintained for 16 weeks, after which mice were subjected to exsanguination via cardiac puncture under general anesthetic (isoflurane), followed by cervical dislocation; upon which tissues were excised and weighed.	4961	5236
27384305	Once weighed, tissues were dissected then promptly snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN2) or fixed in 4% formaldehyde (10% formalin [vol/vol] PBS).	5237	5382
27384305	After 13 weeks of ALIOS treatment, blood from each mouse was collected into Microvette EDTA lined hematological tubes, from lateral tail veins and blood-glucose concentrations measured using an Accu-Chek monitor.	5383	5595
27384305	The week after, mice were fasted overnight and glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) performed; whereby ip injections of 20% glucose (vol/vol) 0.9% sterile saline solutions at a dose of 2 g/kg were administered.	5596	5800
27384305	Blood-glucose concentrations were measured at times (T)0, T15, T30, T60, T90, and T120 minutes after glucose injections.	5801	5921
27384305	Blood samples were also collected at T0 and T30 after glucose injection and plasma insulin concentrations measured using the Ultra Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem).	5922	6102
27384305	Insulin tolerance testing (ITT) was performed during week 15 of the study.	6103	6177
27384305	Mice were fasted for 4 hours and blood-glucose concentrations measured (T0), followed by the administration of insulin (Actrapid) via ip injection at a concentration of 0.1 IU/mL (0.1% 100 IU/mL [vol/vol] 0.9% sterile saline) at a dose of 0.75 IU/kg.	6178	6428
27384305	Blood-glucose concentrations were subsequently measured at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after insulin injections.	6429	6545
27384305	Plasma FFA, triglyceride (TAG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)/low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were measured from blood taken via terminal cardiac bleeds using protocols outlined according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioVision).	6546	6811
27384305	Hepatic TAG content was ascertained using Biovision's colorimetric assay (Cambridge Bioscience).	6812	6908
27384305	Briefly, 100 mg of frozen liver tissue was homogenized in 5% Nonidet P-40 before being heated for 5 minutes at 95°C in a water bath to solubilize TAGs, samples were left to cool to room temperature and the process repeated before centrifugation at 13 000 rpm.	6909	7168
27384305	The resultant supernatants were diluted in distilled H2O and analyzed on a 96-well Wallac plate reader at λ570 nm.	7169	7283
27384305	Freshly excised livers were dissected, processed and embedded in paraffin wax, from which 5-μm sections were cut for analyses via histological staining.	7284	7436
27384305	Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to score hepatosteatosis and inflammation using the NAFLD activity score (NAS) (27) and trichrome staining to access fibrosis.	7437	7609
27384305	All images pertaining to histological analyses were viewed via light microscopy and photomicrographs taken using a Leica imaging system.	7610	7746
27384305	Fragments of frozen liver tissue were homogenized using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) for total RNA isolation.	7747	7855
27384305	One microgram of total RNA was reversed transcribed to cDNA using Applied Biosystems High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions.	7856	8048
27384305	Reaction mixes consisting of Applied Biosystems TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and primer/probes (assays on demand), along with 1-μL cDNA, were made to 20 μL with nuclease-free water.	8049	8233
27384305	All primer/probes targeted to genes of interest were labeled with FAM, whereas the reference gene, invariably 18s, was labeled with VIC; all reactions were singleplex and performed using Applied Biosystems ABI 7500 sequence detection system.	8234	8475
27384305	Gene expression data was graphically represented as fold changes against controls.	8476	8558
27384305	Reference genes' (18s) cycle threshold (Ct) values from each sample were subtracted from Ct values of corresponding samples genes of interest for δCt values (ΔCt).	8559	8722
27384305	These values were then averaged and controls averages taken from those of KOs to give ΔΔCt values which were then incorporated into the equation 2∧ − ΔΔCt; to normalize cohort controls values to 1 and KO cohort as fold changes compared with controls (28).	8723	8978
27384305	All data are derived from n = 13 controls, n = 11 11β-HSD1KO, n = 9 LKO, and n = 9 LKO control male mice with data presented as the mean ± SEM.	8979	9122
27384305	Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney and Student's t tests and statistical significance assigned where P < .05.	9123	9252
27384305	Although graphical representation of RT-qPCR data are presented as fold change verses controls, statistical analyses were performed using ΔCt values.	9253	9402
27384305	NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of the MetS.	9403	9461
27384305	Thus, we used the ALIOS diet as a means to induce MetS and fatty liver disease in 11β-HSD1KO and control mice.	9462	9572
27384305	After 16 weeks of ALIOS diet, controls and 11β-HSD1KO mice showed similar rates of body weight gain (Figure 1A).	9573	9685
27384305	Body weight normalized sc fat, gonadal fat, and perirenal fat pad weights showed no differences, with evidence for moderately increased accumulation of mesenteric fat in 11β-HSD1KOs compared with controls (P < .01) (Figure 1B).	9686	9913
27384305	No differences were seen in lean mass (quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscles) between 11β-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 1C).	9914	10052
27384305	11β-HSD1KO mice showed no difference in glucose or insulin tolerance when compared with control mice (Figure 1, D and E).	10053	10174
27384305	Furthermore, neither fed nor fasted state blood-glucose concentrations were different between 11β-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 1F).	10175	10309
27384305	Blood-insulin concentrations in the fasted state and 30 minutes after glucose bolus injection showed no differences between 11β-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 1G).	10310	10474
27384305	We also assessed plasma lipid profiles and show HDL and LDL cholesterol, FFAs and TAGs were no different between 11β-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 1, H–J).	10475	10632
27384305	Taken together, these data suggest that global deletion of 11β-HSD1 does not protect form the metabolic dysregulation associated with 16 weeks of ALIOS diet feeding, a time frame validated to cause obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia (25).	10633	10882
27384305	ALIOS diet is also an established means to induce the classical features of hepatosteatosis and fatty liver disease (25), from which 11β-HSD1KO mice should be protected.	10883	11052
27384305	However, there were no differences in the macroscopic appearance of the liver, or body weight normalized liver weight between 11β-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 2A).	11053	11219
27384305	Hepatic TAG content endorsed the liver weight data, with no differences observed (Figure 2B).	11220	11313
27384305	Steatosis analysis, using blind scoring of H&E-stained livers of 11β-HSD1KO and control mice, showed microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis in both 11β-HSD1KO and control mice.	11314	11495
27384305	Although the severity varied across the cohorts, no differences in overall distribution in lipid accumulation were observed (Figure 2C).	11496	11632
27384305	Indeed, qualitative assessment using NAS showed there was no statistically significant difference between hepatosteatosis in 11β-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 2D).	11633	11798
27384305	Overall, we find that deletion of 11β-HSD1 in mice treated with the ALIOS diet affords no protection from hepatic TAG accumulation or classical histological profile associated with hepatosteatosis and an overall MetS.	11799	12016
27384305	We also wished to delineate the contribution of hepatocyte specific-11β-HSD1 deletion to the development of a MetS and fatty liver in ALIOS-fed mice given the high level of enzyme expression in this cell type and its prominent role in GC-regulated lipid metabolism.	12017	12282
27384305	To do this, we subjected hepatocyte-specific KO mice (LKO) to ALIOS diet for 16 weeks.	12283	12369
27384305	As in 11β-HSD1KO, LKO mice gained weight at a similar rate to controls over the 16 weeks, with no discernible differences in end-point weight observed (control 34.73 ± 1.47 vs LKO 36.56 ± 0.70 g).	12370	12566
27384305	No differences in body weight normalized adipose or lean tissue weights tissue weights were seen.	12567	12664
27384305	In terms of glucose metabolism, area under the curve (AUC) analysis of GTTs and ITTs again showed no differences between LKO and control mice (GTT AUC, control 17.23 ± 2.26mM vs LKO 20.32 ± 2.22mM; ITT AUC, control 7.92 ± 0.33mM vs LKO 7.35 ± 0.37mM).	12665	12916
27384305	Furthermore, there were no differences between normalized liver weight and hepatic TAG content between control and LKO mice, being equivalent to the 11β-HSD1KO (Figure 3, A and B).	12917	13097
27384305	Hepatosteatosis analysis was conducted and showed equally distributed microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis in both LKO and control mice (Figure 3C).	13098	13253
27384305	NAS-assessed LKO and control livers showed similar levels of hepatosteatosis (Figure 3D).	13254	13343
27384305	These data confirmed the overall view that ALIOS diet and its associated induction of MetS and NALFD is unaffected by the 11β-HSD1 loss of function.	13344	13492
27384305	It became apparent during the process of blind assessing histological NASs that certain sections displayed accumulations of hepatic immune foci in the context of steatosis.	13493	13665
27384305	To better characterize this, blinded NAS system quantification of inflammatory and immune foci was conducted and revealed an average of 80% of fields of view from 11β-HSD1KO livers had 2 or more inflammatory foci compared with 30% in controls (P < .001) (Figure 4, A and B).	13666	13940
27384305	Importantly, scoring of LKO immune foci showed no discernible differences with their controls (Figure 4C).	13941	14047
27384305	These data suggest that despite no differences in systemic or hepatic metabolic parameters being observed, 11β-HSD1KO livers are potentially engaged in the early transition to inflammatory disease, and that extrahepatocyte 11β-HSD1 activity is important to this process.	14048	14318
27384305	Following the observation of increased immune foci and early stage inflammatory disease in 11β-HSD1KO mice, we conducted gene expression analysis for markers of cytokines, macrophages, lymphocytes and fibrosis to further characterize this finding.	14319	14566
27384305	The proinflammatory genes Tnf and Ccl2 were significantly increased in livers of 11β-HSD1KO compared with controls (Figure 5A).	14567	14694
27384305	Further to this, macrophage markers Lgals3, Fsp1, and Cd11b, known to be involved in the early modulation of NASH, were significantly increased, as were lymphocyte specific markers Cd8 and B220 in 11β-HSD1KO compared with controls (Figure 5, B and C).	14695	14946
27384305	These suggest that 11β-HSD1 expression in nonhepatocyte cells is important to restraining the immune response to ectopic liver fat accumulation.	14947	15091
27384305	Because the pathogenesis of NASH involves the deposition of collagen and the formation of fibrotic lesions as hallmark features of advancing disease, we assessed the expression of fibrosis markers and show that Col1a1, encoding the major protein component of type 1 collagen, is significantly increased (P = .004) in 11β-HSD1KO but not in control livers.	15092	15446
27384305	Reelin (Reln) expressed by hepatic stellate cells can act as a marker of hepatocyte damage, and was shown not to be altered (Figure 6A).	15447	15583
27384305	However, trichrome staining showed no ectopic collagen deposition evident in either 11β-HSD1KO or control liver, with only collagen of the tunica externa of blood vessels stained (Figure 6B), suggesting that increased Col1a1 expression was a marker of the very earliest progression to NASH only seen in 11β-HSD1KO mice.	15584	15903
27384305	Mice deficient in 11β-HSD1, or treated with 11β-HSD1 inhibitors, resist obesity and a MetS phenotype when fed conventional high-fat diets (15, 21).	15904	16051
27384305	Based on observations from such models and recent human clinical studies we postulated that 11β-HSD1KO and hepatocyte-specific KO (LKO) mice would be protected against the development of MetS and resist hepatosteatosis when challenged with the ALIOS diet.	16052	16307
27384305	After 16 weeks of ALIOS, we show that male 11β-HSD1KO and LKO mice are indistinguishable from control mice displaying obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and indeed hepatosteatosis.	16308	16496
27384305	An increase in mesenteric adipose tissue mass was measured in 11β-HSD1KO mice.	16497	16575
27384305	This runs contrary to that found for 11β-HSD1KO mice fed a high-fat diet, in which there was preferential adipose deposition away from the mesenteric depot (15).	16576	16737
27384305	Nonetheless, positive correlations have been shown between mesenteric fat mass and hepatosteatosis in human subjects (28–30).	16738	16863
27384305	Unlike conventional high-fat diets, ALIOS diet includes transfats and fructose, both of which can drive hepatic lipid metabolism and accumulation, and have been shown to exacerbate the development of MetS beyond that achieved by conventional high-fat diets (25, 31–33).	16864	17133
27384305	Indeed ALIOS is also validated to induce a more vigorous progression from simple steatosis to NASH, something that high-fat diets rarely achieve (25, 34).	17134	17288
27384305	We had further hypothesized that KO mice would be protected from developing overt fatty liver and show a decrement in lipid accumulation.	17289	17426
27384305	However, hepatic lipid accumulation and quantitative NAS analysis demonstrated no differences between 11β-HSD1KO, LKO, and their control mice.	17427	17569
27384305	A number of preclinical animal models have demonstrated the potential for 11β-HSD1 to modulate lipid accumulation and the NAFLD phenotype.	17570	17708
27384305	Mice with transgenic over expression of 11β-HSD1, specifically in adipose and liver, develop steatosis in the context of a HFD (17, 18).	17709	17845
27384305	11β-HSD1KO and adipose-specific 11β-HSD1KO mice resist hepatosteatosis when GCs are in circulatory excess, achieved through the lack of adipose 11β-HSD1 limiting lipolysis and hepatic FFA delivery, whereas LKO maintained florid steatosis as in wild-type mice (14, 16).	17846	18114
27384305	Furthermore, a recent phase 1B clinical trial using the 11β-HSD1 inhibitor RO5093151 effectively reduced liver-fat content of those treated; however, the tissues mediating this effect were not identified (24).	18115	18324
27384305	On this basis, we conclude that in the context of the ALIOS diet, neither global nor hepatocyte-specific 11β-HSD1 loss of function in male mice has any protective effect against the development of hepatosteatosis.	18325	18538
27384305	Simple and benign steatosis is a reversible condition which precedes more destructive NASH, fibrosis and cirrhosis (35).	18539	18659
27384305	Our unanticipated observations of inflammatory disease only, in 11β-HSD1KO mice, implied that we had collected liver transitioning to the early stage of NASH.	18660	18818
27384305	Inflammatory scoring was not a primary end-point measure in terms of our initial hypothesis regarding metabolic disease.	18819	18939
27384305	However, there is accumulating evidence for a prominent role for 11β-HSD1 in modulating local tissue inflammatory responses, regulating early restraint of the acute inflammatory process.	18940	19126
27384305	11β-HSD1 deficiency has been shown to worsen acute inflammation with greater infiltration of inflammatory cells into target sites in experimental models of rheumatoid arthritis and myocardial infarction (36, 37).	19127	19339
27384305	However, this is not a universal observation.	19340	19385
27384305	Reduced inflammation in adipose tissue has been observed in 11β-HSD1KO mice, suggesting tissue-specific inflammatory phenotypes are important (38).	19386	19533
27384305	We endorsed our histological observations by showing elevated expression of markers of inflammation and immune cell infiltration/activation in livers of 11β-HSD1KO mice when compared with controls.	19534	19731
27384305	Fibroblast-specific protein-1 (Fsp1/S100a4), a marker for a subpopulation of macrophages specific to liver damage was increased yet F4/80 and Cd68, pan macrophage markers, and Clec4f, expressed in Kupffer and migrant liver macrophages were not.	19732	19976
27384305	Although no firm conclusions can be drawn, they do suggest differential regulation of FSP1+ve macrophages in the context of 11β-HSD1 and diet-induced hepatic inflammation.	19977	20148
27384305	Importantly, FSP1+ve macrophages also express Cd11b, Ccl2, and Tnf, all of which were also significantly increased in 11β-HSD1KO mice.	20149	20283
27384305	Because several liver resident immune cells types express these markers, elucidation of the subpopulations involved could not be ascertained (39–42).	20284	20433
27384305	In healthy livers, resident immune cells are found in portal tracts and migrate into the parenchyma upon initiation of an inflammatory response (43–45).	20434	20586
27384305	It has been shown that they automodulate their physiology via intracrine 11β-HSD1-mediated reactivation of GC, regulating processes such as mast cell degranulation, dendritic cell differentiation, and neutrophil and dendritic cell susceptibility to apoptosis (46–50).	20587	20854
27384305	This evidence suggests the intrinsic ability of immune cells to autoregulate availability of GC is crucial to appropriate immune function.	20855	20993
27384305	We postulate that ALIOS induced hepatic inflammation is initially restrained by extrahepatocyte 11β-HSD1 activity in resident hepatic immune cells or/and by peripheral extravasated immune cells such as macrophages (51, 52).	20994	21217
27384305	This is supported by data showing macrophages deficient in 11β-HSD1 fail to phagocytose apoptotic neutrophils when treated in vitro with 11β-HSD1 substrate; with 11β-HSD1KO mice having delayed macrophage phagocytic competence during induced peritonitis (49).	21218	21476
27384305	The enhanced inflammatory phenotype exhibited by 11β-HSD1KO mice also endorses clinical data, whereby steatohepatitis was accompanied with an increase in 11β-HSD1, suggesting a requirement for increased GC activity in inflamed livers (19).	21477	21716
27384305	Although we show significantly increased hepatic expression of Col1a1, an early marker of liver collagen deposition (53), we could not demonstrate histological evidence of fibrosis, and may be due to 16 weeks of ALIOS being insufficient to evoke fibrotic lesions.	21717	21980
27384305	ALIOS diet fed for 12 months has been shown to recapitulate the development of NASH, as 80% of animals developed fibrosis and 60% hepatocellular carcinoma (34).	21981	22141
27384305	These data indicate ALIOS as a useful means to examine the relationship between hepatic 11β-HSD1-mediated GC metabolism, MetS and inflammatory disease.	22142	22293
27384305	Importantly, we highlight the need to further explore 11β-HSD1 in the context of hepatic inflammation and its role in the mechanisms that gateway the development of NASH.	22294	22464
27384305	Further work is required to elucidate the cell types and mechanisms critical to resolving hepatic inflammation in the setting of ALIOS induced NAFLD and MetS.	22465	22623
27384305	Ultimately, the clinical application of 11β-HSD1 inhibitors as treatments for many of the conditions associated with MetS may not be advisable when NAFLD is also present.	22624	22794

27640183	Moreover, Epo receptors (Epo-R) of alleged functionality have been identified in numerous tissues.	140	238
27640183	In particular, data in mice suggest high expression of Epo-R mRNA in spleen and in white adipose tissue (WAT).	239	349
27640183	Studies in end-stage renal disease (ERSD) patients show that serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL decrease to normal levels after Epo treatment [3–5], but acute administration of rHuEpo in healthy subjects do not significantly affect lipid levels, although a tendency to increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels have been observed.	350	700
27640183	However, prolonged treatment to healthy humans with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) significantly increases serum FFA levels and hepatic lipid content.	701	862
27640183	In mice overexpressing the Epo gene, increased fat oxidation and an up-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle has been shown.	863	1017
27640183	On the other hand, mice with a lack of Epo-R, except for the bone marrow, have a significantly higher body weight, increased fat mass and increased serum TG levels [2, 9].	1018	1189
27640183	Furthermore, a reduction in body weight due to reduced WAT mass in obese mice is found after Epo treatment [2, 8–11].	1190	1307
27640183	The mechanism by which Epo regulates fat metabolism and body weight is currently unknown.	1308	1397
27640183	One explanation could be an increase in resting energy expenditure including fat oxidation, but only the former has been documented in healthy human subjects [6, 7].	1398	1563
27640183	As regards direct peripheral actions of Epo, there is no evidence to support such effects in human skeletal muscle [12, 13].	1564	1688
27640183	The effect of Epo treatment on WAT in humans has so far not been evaluated, but Epo-R protein and mRNA has been detected in WAT from mice in addition to a suppressive effect of Epo on fat accumulation and preadipocyte differentiation and expansion in vitro [2, 14].	1689	1954
27640183	Epo administration in mice is also associated with induction of brown adipose tissue (BAT) like features in WAT with increased mitochondrial content and uncoupling.	1955	2119
27640183	Furthermore, adipocyte specific deletion of the Epo-R in mice lead to obesity and decreased insulin sensitivity.	2120	2232
27640183	In contradiction, specific knockdown of the adipocyte Epo-R showed that Epo signaling at physiological levels was not essential for WAT metabolism.	2233	2380
27640183	The aim of the current study was to evaluate both the acute and prolonged effects of Epo treatment on human subcutaneous WAT on; 1) Epo-R expression, 2) activation of Epo-R related signaling pathways, and 3) direct and indirect effects on lipolysis and WAT metabolism.	2381	2649
27640183	Ten healthy young men (23 (20–28) years, 179 (173–192) cm, and 77 (68–90) kg, median (range)) participated after providing written informed consent, in adherence to the declaration of Helsinki.	2650	2843
27640183	The Local Ethical Committee of Central Denmark Region (M-2008-0016) approved the study and it was further registered at clinicaltrials.gov (M-20080035).	2844	2996
27640183	Results regarding whole body and skeletal muscle metabolism from the same study have previously been published.	2997	3108
27640183	Eighteen healthy untrained men (placebo group: 23 (21–35) years, 183 (172–191) cm, and 80.1 (67.7–96.5) kg; ESA group: 22 (19–29) years, 186 (177–198) cm, and 80.3 (70.7–102.5) kg, median (range)) were included after receiving oral and written information and written informed consent to participate, in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.	3109	3457
27640183	This study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee of Central Denmark Region (M-20110035) and registered at clinical trials (NTC01320449).	3458	3600
27640183	This study is part of a larger study where the effects of erythropoietin and endurance training on skeletal muscle and whole body metabolism have been compared [7, 13, 16, 17].	3601	3777
27640183	The subjects were in a single-blind, crossover design randomized to receive placebo and rHuEpo on two occasions with a 14-day wash-out period in-between.	3778	3931
27640183	On the experimental days, the subjects arrived fasting (from 10 pm the evening before, water allowed) at the clinical research unit in the morning.	3932	4079
27640183	Placebo (saline) or rHuEpo (Epoietin alpha, Eprex, 400 IU/kg) were administered i.v. and subcutaneous fat biopsies were collected 1 h post administration from the abdomen by liposuction under local anesthesia.	4080	4289
27640183	Fat biopsies were cleaned from blood, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further analysis.	4290	4399
27640183	The experiments were performed under thermo neutral conditions (21–23 °C).	4400	4474
27640183	Only subjects fulfilling the following criteria were included in the study: maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) below 50 ml/min/kg, age between 18 and 35, body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29 kg/m2, normal blood pressure <135/85, and a hematocrit <45 %.	4475	4726
27640183	The subjects were randomly assigned to either a placebo group (saline, n = 9) or an Epo group (n = 9).	4727	4829
27640183	The subjects were in a single blinded manner treated with either an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) (Darbepoietin-α, Aranesp, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) or placebo (saline) for 10 weeks.	4830	5027
27640183	ESA/placebo were administrated subcutaneously once weekly and the ESA dose was 40 μg for the first 3 weeks and 20 μg for the remaining 7 weeks as previously detailed.	5028	5194
27640183	Subcutaneous fat biopsies were collected from the abdomen with liposuction under local anesthesia, before and after the 10 weeks treatment.	5195	5334
27640183	The biopsies were cleaned for blood, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further analysis.	5335	5443
27640183	The procedure was performed under thermo neutral conditions (21–23 °C).	5444	5515
27640183	The participants were instructed to refrain from hard physical activity, alcohol intake, or dietary changes 3 days prior to collection of the biopsies.	5516	5667
27640183	On the day of biopsy collection the subjects arrived at the clinical research unit after an overnight fast (water intake allowed).	5668	5798
27640183	During the study period the participants were informed not to change their level of physical activity or dietary habits.	5799	5919
27640183	Subcutaneous WAT from the subjects in the acute study (placebo treatment), bone marrow, and K-562 cells were used for RNA extraction using TRIzol (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Roskilde, Denmark) and homogenized with 1 tungsten bead (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) using a Mixer Mill.	5920	6202
27640183	RNA was quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm using a NanoDrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Pierce, Waltham, ME, USA).	6203	6349
27640183	Integrity of the RNA was checked by visual inspection of the 2 ribosomal RNAs on an agarose gel.	6350	6446
27640183	cDNA was synthesized using a Verso cDNA kit (cat# Ab-1453, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with random hexamer primers.	6447	6579
27640183	The levels of Epo receptor mRNA was investigated, b2microglobolin were used as housekeeping gene.	6580	6677
27640183	For Epo receptor PCR a RealTime ready Assay (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, 9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN 46250-0414 USA) was used.	6678	6813
27640183	In this assay the following primers were used: Epo-R: 5′-GCATTGCTGATTTTGTCTGC-3′ and 5′-AAATACTGCAAGGTTGTGGTTTC-3′ together with a small Universal hydrolysis probe substituted with Locked Nucleic Acids from Roche (no152).	6814	7035
27640183	No amplification was observed in negative control tubes (without reverse transcription or with only water).	7036	7143
27640183	The b2microglobulin PCR was performed as a SYBR-Green assay using KAPA SYBR® FAST qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc. Woburn, MA, USA) with primers: 5′-GAGGCTATCCAGCGTACTCC-3′ and 5′-AATGTCGGATGGATGAAACCC-3′.	7144	7348
27640183	The PCR-reactions were performed in duplicate in a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) using the following protocol: EPO-receptor assay: One step at 95 °C for 3 min., then 95 °C for 10 s., 60 °C for 30 s., and 72 °C for 11 s. b2microglobulin assay: One step at 95 °C for 3 min., then 95 °C for 10 s., 60 °C for 20 s., and 72 °C for 10 s, and finally a melting curve analysis was performed (for the b2microglobulin assay).	7349	7774
27640183	The increase in fluorescence was measured in real time during the extension step.	7775	7856
27640183	The relative gene expression was estimated using the default “Advanced Relative Quantification” mode of the software version LCS 480 1.5.0.39 (Roche Applied Science).	7857	8023
27640183	Approximately 100 mg subcutaneous fat tissue was homogenized in homogenization buffer (Acute study: 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM EDTA, 5 % SDS, 50 μg/ml Soybean trypsin inhibitor, 4 μg/ml Leupepsin, 0.1 mM Benzamidine, 2 μg/ml Antipain, and 1 μg/ml Pepstatin; Prolonged study: 50 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM EDTA, 5 % SDS, HALT, 5 mM NAM, 10 μM TSA) on a Precellys 24 (Bertin technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France).	8024	8470
27640183	Hereafter, samples were thermo mixed at 37 °C and 500-1000 rpm for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 20 min at room temperature.	8471	8615
27640183	The homogenate was carefully separated from the lipid layer by a syringe, snap frozen, and centrifuged again, in order to purify the homogenate even further.	8616	8773
27640183	The homogenate was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further analysis.	8774	8863
27640183	In short, western blotting was performed as follows; 10 μl homogenate was loaded onto a 4–15 % SDS gel (Criterion TGX stain-free gels, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), followed by electro blotting onto a PVDF membrane.	8864	9078
27640183	The stain-free technology was used to ensure equal loading.	9079	9138
27640183	Membranes were blocked with 2.5 % skimmed milk for 2 h before the primary antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C.	9139	9264
27640183	The following primary antibodies were used: From Cell signaling, Danvers, MA, USA; phospho-LYN (Thr507) (#2731), LYN (#2732), phospho-Akt (Ser473) (#9271), phospho-Akt (Thr308) (#9275), pan-Akt (#4691), phospho-p70S6k (Thr389) (#9205), p70S6k (#9202), phospho-STAT5 (Thr694) (#9359), STAT5 (#9358), phospho-p38MAPK (Thr180/Thr182) (#9211), p38MAPK (#9212), phospho-HSL (Ser660, corresponding to Ser650 in humans) (#4126), phospho-HSL (Ser563, corresponding to Ser552 in humans) (#4139), phospho-HSL (Ser565, corresponding to Ser554 in humans) (#4137), HSL (#4107), ATGL (#2138), HSP60 (#12165), SDHA (#11998), PDH (#3205), VDAC (#4661), phosphor-AMPKα (Thr172) (#2531), and PKA (#9624), from Abcam, Cambridge, UK; CGI-58 (#ab183739), anti-β-actin (#ab8227), and G0S2 (#ab80353), from Novus bio, Littleton, CO, USA; Cidea (#NB100-94219), from Abnova, Atlanta, GA, USA; Cidec (#H00063924-M07), from Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany; AMPKα pan (#07-181) and phospho-ACC (Ser79) (#07-303), from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA; anti-Epo-R (#A82), from Southernbiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA: HRP streptavidin (#7100-05), from Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA; G0S2 (#sc-133424), and from Pierce antibody production, Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Perilipin (#PA1-1052).	9265	10524
27640183	Following several washes, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody (donkey-anti-rabbit IgG, #NA934, Amersham, GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA/goat-anti-rabbit IgG, #sc-2054, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) for 1 h at room temperature.	10525	10773
27640183	Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence detection system (Super signal dura extended duration substrate, Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA/Clarity Western ECL substrate, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA #170-2054) using a ChemiDocTM MP imaging system (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA).	10774	11063
27640183	Precision Plus Protein All Blue Prestained Protein Standard (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA #1610373) was used as molecular weight marker.	11064	11197
27640183	To evaluate adipocyte morphology, selected WAT biopsies from the prolonged study was fixed in cold (4 °C) 4 % formaldehyde (pH 7.0) for 2 days and embedded in paraffin, after which sections of 3 μm were obtained.	11198	11410
27640183	After de-waxing and rehydration, the sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and examined under an Olympus light microscope (Olympus BX50).	11411	11560
27640183	Due to a low sample size and non-normally distributed data, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for treatment effect on intracellular signaling in the acute study.	11561	11733
27640183	Results are shown as median and 25 % and 75 % percentiles.	11734	11792
27640183	A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze results from the prolonged study, QQ-plots and plots of residuals vs. the fitted values checked normality, and data were log-transformed when not normally distributed.	11793	11996
27640183	The level of significance was set to p < 0.05.	11997	12043
27640183	Results are presented as means ± SE.	12044	12080
27640183	Statistical analyses were made in STATA version 12 (StataCorp, Collage Station, TX, USA) and graphical presentations were made in Sigmaplot version 11.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA).	12081	12271
27640183	Epo-R mRNA was detected in WAT from all subjects (average ct level of 29.0 cycles), as well as in the positive K-562 cells (ct level of 29.6 cycles).	12272	12421
27640183	A slightly lower level of Epo-R mRNA was observed in bone marrow (average ct level of 29.3 cycles) (Fig.	12422	12526
27640183	1a).	12527	12531
27640183	No band corresponding to the Epo-R (59kD) was identified in any of the fat biopsies or the negative control 769-P cells (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA), however a band was identified in the two positive controls, K-562 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and UT-7/Epo cells (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) (Fig.	12532	12830
27640183	1b + c).	12831	12839
27640183	Western blot analysis was used to measure phosphorylation levels of pertinent proteins indicative of Epo-R activation and signaling.	12840	12972
27640183	Phosphorylation levels were measured 1 h post placebo/rHuEpo treatment.	12973	13044
27640183	Neither p-Akt (Thr308, p = 0.915; Ser473, p = 0.244), p-STAT5 (p = 0.309), p-p70s6k (p = 0.405), p-LYN (p = 0.245), or p-p38MAPK (p = 0.735) levels were significantly different between placebo and rHuEpo treatment (Fig.	13045	13264
27640183	2).	7032	7035
27640183	Acute rHuEpo administration did not induce any differences in the phosphorylation levels of p-HSL (Ser563, p = 0.259; Ser565, p = 0.892; Ser660, p = 0.480), p-ACC (p = 0.132), p-Perilipin (p = 0.295), or p-AMPK (p = 0.665).	13269	13492
27640183	Furthermore, total protein levels of G0S2 (p = 0.276) did not change (Fig.	13493	13567
27640183	3).	13568	13571
27640183	Changes in both phosphorylation (Fig.	13572	13609
27640183	4) and total protein levels (Fig.	13610	13643
27640183	5) of proteins involved in lipolysis in adipose tissue after prolonged treatment with ESA were evaluated.	13644	13749
27640183	We did not record changes in any of the proteins analyzed (two-way ANOVA, interactions p > 0.05, time effects p > 0.05, ESA effects p > 0.05).	13750	13892
27640183	Selected WAT sections after prolonged treatment with ESA were stained with haematoxylin/Eosin in order to evaluate WAT morphology and visually evaluate adipocyte size.	13893	14060
27640183	Biopsies from 2 subjects in each group were evaluated (Fig.	14061	14120
27640183	6), the morphology appeared normal and adipocyte size did not change substantially during the 10 weeks of placebo/ESA treatment.	14121	14249
27640183	Different mitochondrial proteins (VDAC, HSP90, PDH, and SDHA) were measured before and after prolonged ESA treatment in order to evaluate mitochondrial protein content, as an indirect measure of mitochondrial biogenesis.	14250	14470
27640183	None of these proteins changed in response to prolonged ESA treatment (Fig.	14471	14546
27640183	7).	14547	14550
27640183	The level of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was also measured as a marker of BAT in the human subcutaneous adipose biopsies.	14551	14672
27640183	A band corresponding to UCP1 was detected in rat BAT but not in our human WAT biopsies (data not shown).	14673	14777
27640183	Previous studies in mice have shown significant effects of Epo treatment on adipose tissue lipolysis and total body weight.	14778	14901
27640183	In human studies, FFA levels is increased both after acute and prolonged rHuEpo/ESA treatment [6, 7].	14902	15003
27640183	However, the current study did not confirm either acute or prolonged effects of rHuEpo/ESA treatment on adipose tissue lipases and signaling pathways involved in the regulation of lipolysis.	15004	15194
27640183	Mouse WAT contains a sizable amount of Epo-R mRNA, and Epo treatment associates with phosphorylation of Akt.	15195	15303
27640183	Moreover, mice lacking the Epo-R in non-hematopoietic tissues exhibit significantly reduced phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK, ERK42/44, and PPARγ.	15304	15451
27640183	Furthermore, phosphorylation of ERK42/44, p38MAPK, and PPARγ in preadipocytes does not depend on Epo-R expression under normal culture conditions, but during adipocyte differentiation the expression of Epo-R increases in concomitance with increased phosphorylation of ERK42/44, p38MAPK, PPARγ, Akt, and STAT5 [2, 19].	15452	15769
27640183	In our human study, we detected higher Epo-R mRNA levels in WAT than in bone marrow and than previously found in human skeletal muscle.	15770	15905
27640183	However, we were not able to measure any Epo-R protein in subcutaneous WAT and no evidence of pertinent signaling cascades related to the Epo-R after acute Epo exposure.	15906	16075
27640183	Species and dosing differences could be an explanation for these conflicting results.	16076	16161
27640183	The direct effects of Epo on lipolysis in WAT have not previously been investigated.	16162	16246
27640183	Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) converts triglycerides (TG) to diacylglycerol, and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) hydrolyses diacylglycerol to monoacylglycerol, in the process of converting TG to FFA.	16247	16450
27640183	HSL and ATGL were not affected by rHUEpo/ESA treatment in the current studies.	16451	16529
27640183	ATGL is primarily activated by protein-protein interaction with the co-activator comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58).	16530	16655
27640183	G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) is identified as an inhibitor of ATGL.	16656	16721
27640183	Inhibition by G0S2 appears to be dominant to activation by CGI-58 [22, 23].	16722	16797
27640183	In the current study, prolonged ESA treatment did not affect protein levels of CGI-58., nor did G0S2 change after acute or prolonged rHuEpo/ESA treatment.	16798	16952
27640183	Different lipid droplet proteins are involved in the regulation of lipolysis.	16953	17030
27640183	Perilipin (PLIN1) regulates the activity of ATGL and HSL and their access to lipid substrates in the lipid droplet.	17031	17146
27640183	Cidea and Cidec are negative regulators of lipolysis and promote lipid droplet stabilization and inhibit lipolysis by providing a barrier around the lipid core.	17147	17307
27640183	No alteration in PLIN1 or Cidea/Cidec was found in the current study.	17308	17377
27640183	Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC) is involved in the regulation of beta-oxidation.	17378	17455
27640183	In its active state ACC catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which inhibits beta-oxidation.	17456	17565
27640183	Phosphorylation levels of ACC were not altered in the current studies.	17566	17636
27640183	Insulin also affects lipolysis, with increased insulin levels inhibiting lipolysis and stimulating lipogenesis.	17637	17748
27640183	Insulin levels were not altered in response to either acute or prolonged rHuEpo/ESA treatment [6, 7].	17749	17850
27640183	In addition, ESA treatment did not result in a visual reduction in adipocyte morphology evaluated from haematoxylin/eosin staining.	17851	17982
27640183	It cannot be excluded that Epo can affect lipolysis in other indirect ways not evaluated in the current study.	17983	18093
27640183	High-dose Epo treatment to mice leads to pronounced reductions in body weight and knock-down of the Epo-R in non-hematopoietic tissues leads to dramatic elevations in WAT amount [2, 9].	18094	18279
27640183	In contradiction, specific knock-down of the Epo-R in mice adipose tissue did not affect either body weight or body composition.	18280	18408
27640183	In support hereof, in the current prolonged human study we did not observe any changes in weight or body composition.	18409	18526
27640183	Recently it was shown that Epo treatment leads to increased AMPKα phosphorylation both in preadipocytes and in WAT from diet-induced obese mice.	18527	18671
27640183	The increased AMPKα activity changed the NAD+/NADH ratio resulting in activation of Sirt1 followed by increased deacetylation of PGC-1α.	18672	18808
27640183	Thus, Epo could through activation of the AMPKα-Sirt1-PGC-1α pathway acts as an energy sensor and modulate cellular redox state and energy homeostasis in adipocytes.	18809	18974
27640183	In the current study, AMPKα phosphorylation was not altered 1-h post rHuEpo administration.	18975	19066
27640183	Alterations in body weight and the amount of WAT could also be due to alterations in energy expenditure.	19067	19171
27640183	In a mouse model, Epo was shown to affected activity levels, total oxygen consumption, and respiratory quotient (RQ).	19172	19289
27640183	The authors speculated that Epo could directly stimulate the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus to induce α-melanocyt-stimulating hormone production that exerts direct effects on food intake and energy homeostasis.	19290	19524
27640183	In support of this, adipose tissue specific deletion of Epo-R in mice did not significantly alter whole-body energy expenditure or RQ values.	19525	19666
27640183	Resting energy expenditure significantly increased in the current studies, and fat oxidation tended to be increased in relation to rHuEpo treatment [6, 7].	19667	19822
27640183	The effect of Epo on POMC was not measured in our human studies, hence, we cannot conclude on the neurological effects.	19823	19942
27640183	Diet-induced obese mice treated with EPO exhibit increased CytC, Cpt1, and PGC-1α mRNA levels indicating an increased mitochondrial biogenesis.	19943	20086
27640183	In addition, Epo stimulation increases citrate synthase activity and fatty acid oxidation in both adipocytes and WAT from diet-induced obese mice.	20087	20233
27640183	Thus, Epo seems to increase cellular mitochondrial respiration and oxidative metabolism beyond its effects on increased oxygen transport in these animal studies.	20234	20395
27640183	However, prolonged ESA treatment to humans did not support the hypothesis that ESA should induce alterations in mitochondrial content in humans.	20396	20540
27640183	In contradiction to WAT, BAT does not respond to Epo treatment in mice models.	20541	20619
27640183	However, Epo treatment seems to promote a BAT-like phenotype in WAT in mice with increased gene expression of e.g. Cidea, UCP1, UCP3, PPARα, and PGC-1α, resulting in mitochondrial biogenesis and increased uncoupled respiration.	20620	20847
27640183	In the current study, UCP1, Cidea and Cidec protein levels were not significantly altered after 10 weeks of ESA treatment, thus, ESA treatment does not seem to induce browning of WAT in humans.	20848	21041
27640183	In contrast to alluring data in mice model, the present human studies do not support direct effects of Epo on adipose tissue lipases and signaling pathways involved in the regulation of lipolysis.	21042	21238
27640183	Although Epo-R mRNA was detected in human WAT samples, this did not translate into detectable Epo-R protein, which is compatible with the absence of evidence of Epo-R signaling.	21239	21416
27640183	However, it has to be acknowledged that the sample size in the current study is small and the variation substantial.	21417	21533
27640183	It remains to be tested whether prolonged administration of Epo in supra-physiological amounts to human subjects may affect adipose tissue similar to what has been observed in animal studies.	21534	21725
27825100	One in 2 patients with diabetes suffers from diabetic nephropathy, the leading cause of chronic kidney disease worldwide (1).	0	125
27825100	Previous studies have revealed that glomerular visceral epithelial cells, namely podocytes, could play a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (2–5).	126	290
27825100	Podocytes have complex structures, which are known as foot processes, slit diaphragm, and the focal adhesion complex, all of which are altered in diabetic nephropathy (2–5).	291	464
27825100	Because a considerable number of mitochondria have been observed in the cell body and in the narrow peripheral foot processes, it is thought that podocytes could be sensitive to an alteration of oxidative metabolism (6, 7).	465	688
27825100	Furthermore, in cases of mitochondrial disorders, podocytes lose the interdigitating foot processes and accumulate dysmorphic mitochondria (8, 9).	689	835
27825100	Such foot process effacement resembles an early morphologic change of diabetic nephropathy (2); therefore, understanding the peculiarities of podocyte energy metabolism, notably in diabetic conditions, could provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and the role of mitochondria (10, 11).	836	1151
27825100	We hypothesized that high glucose levels could alter mitochondrial function in human podocytes, as found in pancreatic β-cells (12), muscle cells (13), adipocytes (14), or neurons (15), which should lead to diabetic complications (16).	1152	1387
27825100	Because podocytes dedifferentiate in the process of injuries as diabetic nephropathy (17, 18), we investigated podocyte energetics and proteome remodeling during normal differentiation as well as under hyperglycemic stress.	1388	1611
27825100	Human podocytes, previously described (19), were used in our study.	1612	1679
27825100	These cells began to differentiate after switching from 33° to 37°C and were fully differentiated 15 d after this switch (19, 20).	1680	1810
27825100	Podocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium that was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, insulin (10 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France), transferrin (5.5 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), selenium (5 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and penicillin-streptomycin 1X (100×; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), with 5 mM glucose from d 0 (day of temperature switch) to d 7 (7 d after temperature switch).	1811	2204
27825100	We confirmed that podocytes at d 15 expressed nephrin, podocin, and podocalyxin by Western blot.	2205	2301
27825100	To observe mitochondrial network morphology, MitoTracker Red CMXRos 100 nM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to culture medium and cells were incubated at 37°C for 25 min (21).	2302	2481
27825100	Endogenous cellular oxygen consumption rate was monitored in intact podocytes at 37°C in a 1-ml thermostatically controlled chamber (1.0 × 107 cells/ml/run) that was equipped with a Clark oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, United Kingdom).	2482	2741
27825100	Endogenous respiratory rate was expressed in nanomolar O2 per min per 105 cells.	2742	2822
27825100	Data were collected from 3 independent flasks for each condition.	2823	2888
27825100	Podocytes were collected and resuspended in culture medium at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml.	2889	2987
27825100	Cell suspension (0.1 ml/tube) was incubated at 37°C for 45 min with or without 5 μl of 100 mM antimycin (Sigma-Aldrich) to block mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis.	2988	3161
27825100	After incubation, cells were treated with a cell lysis buffer (ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and ATP content that was released into the medium was measured by bioluminescence (21).	3162	3377
27825100	ATP produced by mitochondria was calculated as the total ATP content minus the ATP content measured in the presence of antimycin.	3378	3507
27825100	Cell culture medium was deproteinized with a 10-kDa MW cut-off spin filter to remove lactate dehydrogenase.	3508	3615
27825100	Lactate concentration was determined by using an enzymatic assay (Lactate Assay Kit; Sigma-Aldrich).	3616	3716
27825100	We measured the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α).	3717	3855
27825100	After collecting cultured podocytes, total DNA was extracted by using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).	3856	4053
27825100	First-strand cDNA was synthesized in a 20-μl volume using 1 μg total RNA, with 50 units of M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H−) and Oligo d(T)16 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).	4054	4245
27825100	Real-time quantitative PCR for nuclear DNA, mtDNA, and PGC-1α mRNA was performed by using IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) on a thermocycler CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad), as previously described (22).	4246	4479
27825100	Normalized units to the endogenous references (RPLP0 and GUSB) were calculated by using the CFX Manager Software program (Bio-Rad).	4480	4611
27825100	All assays were performed in 200 µl of Tp II:Mannitol buffer (225 mM mannitol, 75 mM saccharose, 10 mM TrisHCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2).	4612	4745
27825100	All results were normalized by protein concentration (BCA protein assay; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).	4746	4846
27825100	We determined several respiratory chain complexes (complex III and IV) and citrate synthase enzymatic activities, as previously described (23).	4847	4990
27825100	Western blot was performed as previously described (22) by using the following antibodies: PGC-1α (P-19; sc-5815, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1; ab55744, 1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM; ab119684, 1:500; Abcam), AMPK (2532, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), phospho-AMPK-α for the detection of endogenous AMPKα only when phosphorylated at threonine 172 (2531, 1:1000: Cell Signaling Technology), serine–threonine liver kinase B1 (LKB1; ab15095, 1:100; Abcam), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; ab87540, 1:200; Abcam).	4991	5650
27825100	Changes in reactive oxygen species levels were monitored by using the CM-H2DCFDA probe (C6827; Thermo Fisher Scientific).	5651	5772
27825100	Cells were plated in 96 wells (20,000 cells/well).	5773	5823
27825100	The probe was added to cell medium and incubated for 30 min at 37°C.	5824	5892
27825100	Of H2O2, 10 µl was used a positive control.	5893	5936
27825100	Fluorescence was measured on a Xenius Spectrofluorometer (Safas, Monaco, France).	5937	6018
27825100	This analysis was performed by the proteomic facility of Bordeaux University (http://www.cgfb.u-bordeaux2.fr/en/synthese-proteome).	6019	6150
27825100	The steps of sample preparation and protein digestion, nano-scale liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis, and database search and results processing were performed as previously described (24).	6151	6361
27825100	Label-free quantitative data analysis was performed by using Progenesis Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry 4.0 software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, United Kingdom).	6362	6542
27825100	Data processing included the following steps: 1) feature detection, 2) feature alignment, 3) volume integration for 2–6 charge-state ions, 4) normalization of the total protein abundance, 5) import of sequence information, 6) ANOVA test at the peptide level and filtering for features P < 0.05, 7) calculation of protein abundance (sum of the volume of corresponding peptides), and 8) ANOVA test at the protein level and filtering for features P < 0.05.	6543	6996
27825100	Of note, only nonconflicting features and unique peptides were considered for calculation at the protein level.	6997	7108
27825100	We selected proteins that showed >20% change in their expression levels with statistical significance (P < 0.05) between 2 groups (n = 3 in each group).	7109	7261
27825100	Furthermore, these proteins were categorized according to their functions by using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis in the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins (STRING) database (http://string-db.org).	7262	7506
27825100	A more global analysis of the data was performed via use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen).	7507	7603
27825100	In this study, we used 2 different quantitative PCR microarrays: Human Glucose Metabolism RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen) and Human Transcription Factors RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen).	7604	7790
27825100	At d 12, we transfected cells with endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNA (esiRNA) under 4 conditions: esiRNA enhanced green fluorescent protein, esiRNA myogenic factor 5 (MYF5), esiRNA myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), and esiRNA MYF5 plus MEF2C.	7791	8058
27825100	Human esiRNA from Sigma-Aldrich and Dharmafect transfection reagent provided by Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Lafayette, CO, USA) were used.	8059	8197
27825100	We prepared 5 µM esiRNA solutions in serum-free medium, mixed them with Dharmafect transfection reagent, and incubated them at room temperature for 20 min.	8198	8353
27825100	Then, antibiotic-free complete medium was added for a final esiRNA concentration of 25 nM.	8354	8444
27825100	We removed the medium in flasks and added the appropriate esiRNA solution for each condition.	8445	8538
27825100	Podocytes were cultured in 5 mM glucose.	8539	8579
27825100	At d 15, protein from podocytes was extracted.	8580	8626
27825100	Kidney biopsied tissues from 5 patients with diabetic nephropathy and 5 normal participants were used in this study.	8627	8743
27825100	Primary antibodies were PGC-1α (P-19; sc-5815; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and pyruvate kinase muscle type 2 (PKM2; D78A4; #4053; Cell Signaling Technology), as well as MYF5 (C-20, sc-302; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and MEF2C (ab191428; Abcam).	8744	8985
27825100	Numbers of PKM2-positive podocytes per glomerulus were counted.	8986	9049
27825100	In addition, we calculated mean percentages of PGC-1α-, MYF5-, and MEF2C-positive nuclei of total nuclei per glomeruli; more than 10 glomeruli per patient were counted in these analyses.	9050	9236
27825100	This study was approved by the ethical committee of Chiba-East Hospital.	9237	9309
27825100	Upon induction of podocyte differentiation (19, 20), cell morphology changed from a small, circular cell to a reticulated one, which became mature at d 15.	9310	9465
27825100	The size of the mitochondrial network also increased progressively (Fig.	9466	9538
27825100	1A).	9539	9543
27825100	Oxygen consumption rate (Fig.	9544	9573
27825100	1B) increased significantly during cell differentiation (P < 0.01, ANOVA analysis), with an increment factor of 2.2 after 15 d of growth in 5 mM glucose medium.	9574	9734
27825100	Cellular ATP content (Fig.	9735	9761
27825100	1C) also increased between d 0 and 15 (P < 0.05, ANOVA analysis), and this increase was attributed to oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos), but not glycolysis (Fig.	9762	9924
27825100	1D–F).	9925	9931
27825100	Accordingly, the amount of mtDNA increased during differentiation (Fig.	9932	10003
27825100	1G).	10004	10008
27825100	Likewise, PGC-1α mRNA levels increased significantly (Fig.	10009	10067
27825100	1H), with a factor of 2.7 between d 0 and 15.	10068	10113
27825100	In addition, NRF-1 and TFAM mRNA expression also increased by factors of 1.5 and 4.2, respectively (Fig.	10114	10218
27825100	1I, J).	10219	10226
27825100	To investigate the molecular changes in podocytes undergoing differentiation, we compared the proteome between d 0–3, 3–7, and 7–15 (Table 1).	10227	10369
27825100	Approximately 8% of the proteins whose expression levels changed within those 3 periods belonged to mitochondria.	10370	10483
27825100	Among proteins that increased between d 0–3 and 3–7 (Fig.	10484	10541
27825100	2A, B), the proteasome comprised the largest population (>30 proteins).	10542	10613
27825100	Then, >10 proteins associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, oxphos, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle also increased during both periods.	10614	10759
27825100	From d 7–15 (Fig.	10760	10777
27825100	2C), a considerable number of proteins (>40) that were associated with ribosome biogenesis and function increased, which suggested an intense phase of protein translation and cellular reprogramming.	10778	10976
27825100	In particular, enzymes that were involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (>20 proteins), oxphos (>15 proteins), branched-chain amino acid degradation (>10 proteins), and the TCA cycle (>10 proteins) increased their content by a factor above +20% (P < 0.05).	10977	11233
27825100	Components of oxphos did not increase simultaneously during the 3 phases of differentiation introduced above (Table 2).	11234	11353
27825100	Subunits of respiratory chain complex IV and V were increased at later stages compared with complex I.	11354	11456
27825100	In particular, synthesis of the α- and β-subunits of the F1 catalytic-domain of the F1F0ATP synthase complex was increased at the final stages of podocyte differentiation (Table 2 and Fig.	11457	11645
27825100	2E).	11646	11650
27825100	Proteomic analysis also revealed that most glycolytic enzymes were decreased during podocyte differentiation (Table 2).	11651	11770
27825100	In accordance with an oxidative shift, proteins that were involved in the fueling of oxphos with fatty acid, amino acids, or ketones were also up-regulated (Table 2).	11771	11937
27825100	Premature podocytes that were cultured from d 7 to 15 in media with 8 different glucose concentrations showed an increase in lactate levels (Fig.	11938	12083
27825100	3A) that was suggestive of a glycolytic switch.	12084	12131
27825100	Although hyperglycemia is clinically observed when glucose concentration ranges above 7 mM, diabetes symptoms do not typically become noticeable until 15–20 mM.	12132	12292
27825100	To mimic this situation, we conducted in vitro studies with 20 mM glucose.	12293	12367
27825100	Podocyte dependency on oxphos for cellular ATP production was decreased in high glucose (HG; 20 mM), whereas that of glycolysis increased compared with podocytes cultured in normal glucose (5 mM; Fig.	12368	12568
27825100	3B).	12569	12573
27825100	This metabolic switch was explained, in part, by a reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis, as PGC-1α, NRF-1, and TFAM expression as well as mtDNA content were reduced in HG conditions (Fig.	12574	12762
27825100	3C).	12763	12767
27825100	Accordingly, activity of citrate synthase, an indicator of mitochondrial active content, was also decreased in those conditions (Fig.	12768	12901
27825100	3C).	12763	12767
27825100	We performed a differential proteomic analysis between podocytes that were grown in 20 mM (HG) or those grown in 5 mM glucose (normal glucose) between d 7 15.	12907	13065
27825100	Thirty-one mitochondrial proteins were decreased in podocytes that were cultured under HG (Table 1).	13066	13166
27825100	Oxphos was severely impacted, with >10 proteins reduced.	13167	13223
27825100	Key components of intermediate metabolism, such as glutaminolysis or TCA cycle, were altered (Table 2).	13224	13327
27825100	On the one hand, at the level of the respiratory chain, key components of complexes III, IV, and V were decreased (Table 2), as well as key components of ADP phosphorylation, such as ATPsynthase (Fig.	13328	13528
27825100	2E), ANT2, and the mitochondrial phosphate carrier.	13529	13580
27825100	Measurement of respiratory chain enzyme activities confirmed a reduction for complexes III and IV (Fig.	13581	13684
27825100	3D).	13685	13689
27825100	On the other hand, the content of 5 glycolytic enzymes was increased in HG conditions (Table 2).	13690	13786
27825100	Lactate dehydrogenase A was also increased in HG (+48%), which was consistent with the elevated lactate production described in Fig.	13787	13919
27825100	3A.	13920	13923
27825100	Lastly, proteomic analysis showed that antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (+86%), glutathione S transferase (+65%), glutathione S transferase ω 1 (+21%), thioredoxin reductase (+59%), and peroxredoxin 2 (+51%) were increased in hyperglycemia.	13924	14169
27825100	This could be consecutive to the higher steady-state of H2O2 levels that were measured in the HG conditions (Fig.	14170	14283
27825100	3E).	14284	14288
27825100	First, we observed an alteration of the LKB1-AMPK pathway—a master regulator of oxphos—in podocytes that were grown under HG conditions (Fig.	14289	14430
27825100	3F).	14431	14435
27825100	Analysis of the mRNA content of 84 genes that are involved in glucose metabolism (Fig.	14436	14522
27825100	4A) also showed that hyperglycemia stimulated glycolysis but also activated expression of the oxphos inhibitor, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) (25).	14523	14679
27825100	Search for potential transcription factors involved in metabolic reprogramming induced by hyperglycemia (Fig.	14680	14789
27825100	4B) showed a decrease in MEF2C and MYF5.	14790	14830
27825100	A previous study revealed that MEF2C controls the expression of numerous components of oxidative metabolism, notably PGC-1α (26).	14831	14960
27825100	Accordingly, the concomitant down-regulation of MEF2C and MYF5 by using esiRNA in human podocytes triggered a significant down-regulation of respiratory chain complex IV (Fig.	14961	15136
27825100	4C) and PGC1-α (Fig.	15137	15157
27825100	4D).	15158	15162
27825100	In these conditions, dual inhibition of MEF2C and MYF5 also altered podocin expression (Fig.	15163	15255
27825100	4E).	15256	15260
27825100	Of note, use of a single esiRNA against MEF2C or MYF5 alone did not change the levels of complex IV, PGC-1α, or podocin (Fig.	15261	15386
27825100	4C–E).	15387	15393
27825100	Such a cooperative effect between MEF2C and MYF5 was previously described for the synergistic transactivation of a myogenin (27).	15394	15523
27825100	We further observed that MEF2C controlled MYF5 expression (Fig.	15524	15587
27825100	4F), whereas the opposite did not occur (data not shown).	15588	15645
27825100	In addition to energy metabolism and the role of MEF2C-MYF5 cooperation in reducing PGC-1α and oxphos, changes in the cellular signaling pathways of podocytes challenged with HG are listed in Table 3.	15646	15846
27825100	As discussed above, NRF-2–mediated oxidative stress response was identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software as activated under HG conditions, as well as glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction.	15847	16048
27825100	Because proteomics showed up-regulation of the glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 podocyte, under HG (Table 2), and given the role of this enzyme in anabolic glycolysis (28), we measured PKM2 expression in human kidney sections (Fig.	16049	16285
27825100	5).	287	290
27825100	Intense labeling was found in podocytes and Bowman’s capsules in glomeruli, and PKM2-positive podocytes were significantly more numerous in diabetic kidney patients (Fig.	16290	16460
27825100	5).	287	290
27825100	Furthermore, expression of MYF5 and MEF2C, which were detected as decreased transcriptomic factors in our in vitro study, was significantly decreased in patients with diabetic nephropathy (Fig.	16465	16658
27825100	5).	287	290
27825100	Likewise, intensities of PGC-1α expression were also down-regulated in samples from patients with diabetic nephropathy (Fig.	16663	16787
27825100	5).	287	290
27825100	Mitochondria are increasingly recognized as key players in acquired renal diseases (29), and Reidy et al. (30) recently reviewed their role in diabetic kidney disease initiation.	16792	16970
27825100	In the present study, we described the metabolic reprogramming of human podocytes that are confronted with HG levels and we demonstrated the role of MEF2C and MYF5 in the glycolytic switch.	16971	17160
27825100	Our work has implications for the fundamental understanding of human podocyte differentiation, but also for the study of diabetic nephropathy, as we could validate some of the in vitro findings on human kidney samples that were obtained from patients with diabetes.	17161	17426
27825100	Regarding the analysis of the determinants of podocyte differentiation, our study has relevance as podocyte dedifferentiation may occur in the context of podocyte injuries (17, 18).	17427	17608
27825100	Moreover, previous analyses of the alteration of mitochondrial bioenergetics were performed in diabetic podocytes that were obtained from rats and mice, which could differ from human podocytes (31, 32) or between different mouse strains (33).	17609	17851
27825100	Moreover, the situation is unclear in mice podocytes, as Wang et al. (34) reported an alteration of oxphos by hyperglycemia, whereas other authors showed the opposite (10, 35).	17852	18028
27825100	In contrast with mice or rat podocyte studies, our data were obtained from human podocytes and from kidney sections from patients with diabetic nephropathy.	18029	18185
27825100	A novel finding of our study is that MEF2C and MYF5 were involved in the bioenergetic dedifferentiation of human podocytes toward oxphos, and that hyperglycemia altered these transcription factors.	18186	18383
27825100	In addition, we described a sequential change in the energetic machinery without precedent.	18384	18475
27825100	We found that glycolytic enzymes are immediately repressed when podocyte differentiation occurs and that respiratory chain proteins increase in a specific order.	18476	18637
27825100	In particular, the components of the F1F0-ATP synthase complex are only built up when the rest of the machinery has been produced, which could potentially be to avoid hydrolysis of glycolytic ATP by this complex.	18638	18850
27825100	A recent study showed that the respiratory chain complex III assembly depends on the energy state of mitochondria (36); thus, feedback mechanisms could also control synthesis of ATP synthases and the overall maturation of oxphos.	18851	19080
27825100	Another feature of podocyte differentiation resides in the stimulation of oxidative fueling processes.	19081	19183
27825100	Fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids are excellent fuels for oxphos in skeletal muscle and the heart, and our findings suggest that those energy substrates could also play an important role in podocyte physiology (37).	19184	19408
27825100	Our findings indicate that onset of oxphos that was observed during normal podocyte differentiation (5 mM glucose) required expression of both MEF2C and MYF5, but also that of TFAM, NRF-1, and PGC-1α (38).	19409	19614
27825100	The second part of our work focused on the toxic effect of HG levels (in vitro) and of hyperglycemia (in vivo) on podocyte bioenergetic apparatus.	19615	19761
27825100	Podocytes that were exposed to 20 mM glucose not only aborted the bioenergetic differentiation process discussed above, but they also shifted to a different program that favored glycolysis (bioenergetic dedifferentiation).	19762	19984
27825100	Ateration in mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase subunits might impact mitochondrial structure (39), dynamics, and function (40) in podocytes, thereby leading to foot process effacement as an early pathologic change in diabetic nephropathy (2).	19985	20225
27825100	Of interest, knockdown of MEF2C and MYF5 also triggered the reduction of podocin expression in our in vitro study, which suggested a more global dedifferentiation process caused by hyperglycemia.	20226	20421
27825100	Glycolytic switch observed in podocytes that were grown in 20 mM glucose resembles the Warburg effect described in cancer cells wherein a reduction of PGC-1α content and mitochondrial biogenesis was previously reported (41).	20422	20646
27825100	Increase in oxidative stress triggered by HG growth conditions in our in vitro study also correlates with the consequences of hyperglycemia in humans (42).	20647	20802
27825100	In different models, mechanisms of HG-mediated reactive oxygen species increase involved the alteration of mitochondrial respiration (43), which suggested the importance of restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics in this disease.	20803	21030
27825100	In our study, human podocytes that were confronted with HG showed an increase in oxidative stress despite up-regulation of several antioxidant defenses proteins.	21031	21192
27825100	In patients with diabetes, advanced glycation end products that induced increased oxidative stress were considered therapeutic targets for using Kremezin and benfotiamine, 2 U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved advanced glycation end product inhibitors (44).	21193	21457
27825100	Regarding the signaling mechanisms that are involved in hyperglycemia-induced metabolic shift in podocytes, we observed that HG and hyperglycemia reduced the expression of MEF2C, which participates in control of the expression of numerous components of oxidative metabolism, notably PGC-1α (41).	21458	21753
27825100	Previous findings demonstrated the association between MEF2C and the AMPK axis during exercise training in skeletal muscle (45), and our findings revealed that HG altered both the activation of AMPK and the protein content of AMPK activator LKB1 (24, 46, 47).	21754	22013
27825100	Of interest, we observed that only a combined inhibition of MEF2C and MYF5 expression with esiRNA was required to block the oxphos shift.	22014	22151
27825100	This could suggest that both transcription factors cooperate at the site of gene transcription to induce expression of target genes.	22152	22284
27825100	In agreement with our findings, a synergistic transactivation of a myogenin by Myf5 and MEF2 was previously demonstrated (27).	22285	22411
27825100	The recently identified RNA-binding activity of MYF5 (48) might also suggest the need to conduct further genetic investigations on the collaboration between MEF2C and MYF5.	22412	22584
27825100	In addition, we observed up-regulation of PDK1, a critical component of the Warburg effect that is capable of shutting down glucose-dependent oxphos in situations of pseudohypoxia (49) or in conditions of high fatty acid and HG intake in pancreatic β-cells (50).	22585	22847
27825100	The link between MEF2C and PDK1 remains to be established.	22848	22906
27825100	Lastly, our signaling study showed that mTOR expression was inhibited in podocytes that were cultured in HG medium, as expected in conditions of LKB1-AMPK axis activation.	22907	23078
27825100	This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that mTOR is activated in podocytes in diabetic nephropathy (51, 52).	23079	23205
27825100	Recently, mTOR inactivation (52, 53), restoration of the LKB1-AMPK activity (54), and PGC-1α activation (55) were proposed as novel potential therapeutic options for diabetic nephropathy.	23206	23393
27825100	Our findings further suggest that stimulation of MEF2C and MYF5 expression could permit the restoration of podocyte bioenergetics and mitochondrial biogenesis in these conditions.	23394	23573
28098423	Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug in clinical setting 1.	0	79
28098423	Despite successful treatment of various malignancies, Dox‐induced dose‐dependent progressive myocardial damage seriously limits its clinical usage 2.	80	229
28098423	Doxorubicin‐induced cardiotoxicity is characterized by oxidative stress, DNA damage, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis et al. 3, 4, 5.	230	380
28098423	During the past years, many studies were performed to explore the methods for attenuating Dox‐induced cardiac dysfunction 6.	381	505
28098423	Several agents have been uncovered to protect against the cardiotoxicity of Dox such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril) 7, β‐blockers (metoprolol, carvediol) 8, 9 and resveratrol 10, 11.	506	713
28098423	Recently, other new measures were developed to mitigate Dox‐induced cardiomyopathy 12, 13.	714	804
28098423	For example, mesenchymal stem cells produced promising cardioprotective effects against Dox‐induced damage by paracrine of potent cytokines such as migration inhibitory factor and growth differentiation factor‐15 12.	805	1021
28098423	However, the direct effects of those cytokines/growth factor on Dox‐induced cardiomyopathy remain largely unknown.	1022	1136
28098423	Brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most abundant neurotrophins in the mammalian central nervous system that promotes neuronal survival and differentiation 14.	1137	1315
28098423	Growing studies have documented that BDNF plays crucial roles in the cardiovascular system 15, 16, 17, 18.	1316	1422
28098423	Among them, two recent studies proved that BDNF modulated the contraction of normal heart 16, 17.	1423	1520
28098423	Studies by other laboratories and ours demonstrated BDNF could repair injured myocardium by ameliorating endothelial function and inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis 18, 19.	1521	1693
28098423	Previous studies also found that BDNF repressed neuroblastoma cells from chemotherapy‐induced apoptosis by activating its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) 20, 21.	1694	1869
28098423	However, whether BDNF could attenuate Dox‐induced cardiotoxicity remains unclear.	1870	1951
28098423	PI3K/Akt and mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) are two key intracellular signalling transduction pathways, which participate in various important biological activities such as apoptosis and autophagy 22, 23.	1952	2165
28098423	Previous studies have illustrated that activation of Akt and downstream signals, for example, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Bad and/or inhibition of p38 MAPK are capable of inhibiting Dox‐induced cardiac injury 24, 25, 26.	2166	2399
28098423	Therefore, this study aimed to investigate determine the therapeutic role of BDNF against Dox‐induced cardiotoxicity by regulating Akt or MAPK signals to facilitate their safe use in cancer treatment.	2400	2600
28098423	All animal experiments were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethic Committee of Harbin Medical University and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (Publication, 8th Edition, 2011).	2601	2863

28098423	The rats have free access to standard rat chow and water and 15 rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham, Dox and BDNF treatment group (5 rats in each group).	3032	3200
28098423	In Dox group, rats were injected with Dox (2.5 mg/kg, 3 times/week, intraperitoneally) for 2 weeks.	3201	3300
28098423	In BDNF group, rats were injected with Dox (2.5 mg/kg, 3 times/week, 2 weeks, intraperitoneally) and recombinant human BDNF (0.4 μg/kg/day) every day for 2 weeks via tail vein.	3301	3477
28098423	The dose of BDNF referred to previous study 27.	3478	3525
28098423	For sham rats, equivalent volume of saline was given.	3526	3579
28098423	All rats were killed at the end of the 2‐week treatments after detecting cardiac function, and the hearts were quickly excised in cold buffer.	3580	3722
28098423	Both left and right ventricles were collected and stored at −80°C for subsequent histological, biochemical and Western blot analysis.	3723	3856
28098423	Left ventricles were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and then rinsed in buffer, post‐fixed in PBS 1% OsO4 for 2 hrs.	3857	3970
28098423	Then, they were stained by 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin.	3971	4074
28098423	The sections were electron‐stained and observed by electron microscope (JEM‐1200; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).	4075	4182
28098423	Both left and right ventricular samples were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 μm thick sections.	4183	4282
28098423	Then, they were stained with haematoxylin and eosin or Masson trichrome for histological and collagen analysis.	4283	4394
28098423	The interstitial fibrotic areas were calculated by image analysis software (Image‐pro plus 6.0; Meida Cybernetics LP, Washington, USA).	4395	4530
28098423	Collagen volume fraction (CVF) was calculated as the ratio of collagen area to total area.	4531	4621
28098423	Cardiac function was measured by Acuson Sequoia 512 Ultrasound System (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA).	4622	4754
28098423	Left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) and left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) were measured, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (FS) were calculated.	4755	4958
28098423	The concentrations of three enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in both left and right ventricular homogenate were determined using commercial kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).	4959	5230
28098423	H9c2 cells were cultured in DMEM (high glucose; Corning, Manassas, VA, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin.	5231	5384
28098423	The cells were maintained under a water‐saturated atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C.	5385	5476
28098423	The cells were exposed to Dox at different concentrations range from 0.3, 1 to 3 μM for different time‐points (6, 24 or 48 hrs), respectively.	5477	5619
28098423	Recombinant human BDNF (200 and 400 ng/ml) and/or BDNF scavenger TrkB‐Fc (4 μg/ml) were pre‐treated 30 min.	5620	5727
28098423	before Dox treatment in the presence or absence of Akti (0.5 μM).	5728	5793
28098423	The effects of Akti and TrkB‐Fc in this concentration have been validated in previous work 19, 28.	5794	5892
28098423	Cell viability was determined by cell counting kit‐8 (CCK‐8) kit as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan).	5893	6029
28098423	After stimulation as designated, the supernatant was removed and 100 μl of DMEM medium containing 10 μl CCK‐8 was added.	6030	6150
28098423	Then, the plate was incubated for 2 hrs in the incubator.	6151	6208
28098423	The optical density values were read at 450 nm using an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria).	6209	6324
28098423	For each sample, five parallel experimental wells were used to evaluate the cell viability.	6325	6416
28098423	In situ Cell Death Detection Kit (TUNEL fluorescence FITC kit; Roche, Indianapolis, USA) was used to examine the apoptosis in rat ventricles and H9c2 cells.	6417	6573
28098423	After washing with PBS for three times, treated samples were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton x‐100 sodium citrate buffer for 2 min.	6574	6741
28098423	The nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:30; Beyotime, Haimen, China).	6742	6808
28098423	Fluorescence staining of ventricles was viewed by Olympus BX‐60 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) while fluorescence staining of cells was scanned by a laser scanning confocal microscope (FV1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).	6809	7020
28098423	Five high power fields were randomly selected and analysed.	7021	7080
28098423	The ratio of TUNEL‐positive cells per field was calculated by Olympus Fluoview version 2.0a Viewer software.	7081	7189
28098423	DNA damage was evaluated according to previous study 29.	7190	7246
28098423	After exposure to Dox in the presence or absence of BDNF, H9c2 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and probed with anti‐γH2AX antibody (Ser139, 20E3; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) overnight at 4°C followed by fluorescence‐labelled secondary antibody.	7247	7525
28098423	Immunofluorescence images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).	7526	7624
28098423	Annexin‐V‐FLUOS kit (Roche) was used with procedures described in previous studies 30.	7625	7711
28098423	Briefly, H9c2 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH [pH 7.4], 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2).	7712	7882
28098423	A total of 5 μl of AnnexinV‐FITC and 10 μl of 20 μg/ml PI were then added to the cells, which were analysed with a flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).	7883	8066
28098423	Viable cells were negative for both PI and Annexin V, while apoptotic cells were positive for Annexin V and negative for PI.	8067	8191
28098423	Late apoptotic dead cells showed both Annexin V and PI positivity.	8192	8258
28098423	The apoptotic rate was calculated by BD FACSDiva software.	8259	8317
28098423	Total protein was extracted and separated from both ventricles and H9c2 cells for immunoblotting analysis with the procedures described in our previous work 19.	8318	8478
28098423	Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against BDNF (1:500), TrkB (1:500), p‐Akt (1:1000), t‐Akt (1:1000), p‐mTOR (1:1000), mTOR (1:1000), p‐Bad (1:500), Bad (1:1000), p‐ERK (1:2000), extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK; 1:1000), p‐p38 (1:1000), p38 (1:1000) or GAPDH (1:1000) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with a fluorescence‐labelled secondary antibody (LI‐COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).	8479	8902
28098423	The images were scanned on the Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging System (LI‐COR Biosciences).	8903	8991
28098423	Western blot bands were quantified using Odyssey CLx v2.1 software and normalized to GAPDH as an internal control.	8992	9106
28098423	Anti‐BDNF and anti‐TrkB antibodies were bought from Abclonal (Wuhan, China).	9107	9183

28098423	Anti‐GAPDH antibody was obtained from Kangchen Biotech Co Ltd (Shanghai, China).	9432	9512
28098423	Doxorubicin was provided by Aladdin Industrial Company (Shanghai, China, purity 98%).	9513	9598
28098423	Recombinant human BDNF and TrkB‐Fc were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).	9599	9689
28098423	Akt inhibitor (Akti) was provided by Sigma‐Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).	9690	9762
28098423	All value were presented as mean ± S.E.M.	9763	9804
28098423	and analysed by SPSS17.0 software.	9805	9839
28098423	Student's t‐test was performed for two‐group comparisons.	9840	9897
28098423	One‐way anova followed by Dunnet's t‐test was used for multiple‐group comparisons.	9898	9980
28098423	P < 0.05 was considered significant.	9981	10017
28098423	Protein expression of BDNF and its receptor TrkB were detected in both left and right ventricles to observe the change in cardiac BDNF/TrkB axis in Dox‐treated myocardium and validate the efficiency of BDNF supplement.	10018	10236
28098423	Figure 1A indicated that protein expression of BDNF was decreased in left ventricles of Dox‐treated rats, which was significantly restored after BDNF administration.	10237	10402
28098423	Meanwhile, protein expression of TrkB was markedly increased by BDNF, although no significance was found between sham and Dox‐treated rats (Fig.	10403	10547
28098423	1B).	10548	10552
28098423	Similar results of BDNF and TrkB expression were obtained in right ventricles (Fig.	10553	10636
28098423	1C and D).	10637	10647
28098423	Thus, cardiac BDNF was down‐regulated by Dox and was successfully reversed after BDNF injection.	10648	10744
28098423	Brain‐derived neurotrophic factor/TrkB axis was activated in BDNF‐treated rat hearts.	10745	10830
28098423	Transmission electron microscopy and haematoxylin and eosin staining were employed to examine the ultrastructural and histological changes of LV myocytes in Dox and BDNF‐treated rats.	10831	11014
28098423	As shown in Figure 2A and D, a clear regular structure was observed in the cardiac muscle fibres of sham rats at different magnifications.	11015	11153
28098423	However, disorganized myofibres and swollen mitochondria were shown in Dox‐treated cardiomyocytes (Fig.	11154	11257
28098423	2B and E), which was markedly improved by BDNF (Fig.	11258	11310
28098423	2C and F).	11311	11321
28098423	Similarly, haematoxylin and eosin staining results displayed compactly arranged fibres without inter‐cellular space in cardiomyocytes of sham rats (Fig.	11322	11474
28098423	2G).	11475	11479
28098423	In contrast, disordered myocardial fibres as well as hypertrophic and oedematous cardiomyocytes were observed in the Dox‐treated rats (Fig.	11480	11619
28098423	2H), which was significantly reversed by BDNF (Fig.	11620	11671
28098423	2I).	11672	11676
28098423	Thus, these findings together displayed that BDNF mitigated Dox‐induced cardiac injury in rat ventricular myocytes.	11677	11792
28098423	We further detected cardiomyocyte apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis in Dox and BDNF‐treated rats.	11793	11892
28098423	As shown in Figure 3A–F, TUNEL assay was used to detect the effect of BDNF on cardiac apoptosis in Dox‐treated rat left ventricles at different magnifications.	11893	12052
28098423	TUNEL‐positive cells in left ventricles were significantly higher in the Dox‐treated rats than sham rats, which was markedly reduced by BDNF (Fig.	12053	12199
28098423	3G).	12200	12204
28098423	In addition, the cardimyocytes of sham rats appeared grossly normal under light microscopy.	12205	12296
28098423	However, obvious interstitial fibrosis was examined in Dox‐treated rats.	12297	12369
28098423	Bundles of myofibres were packed less tightly and were separated by thick layers of fibrous tissue in Dox‐treated rats, which was slightly reversed by BDNF (Fig.	12370	12531
28098423	3H–J).	12532	12538
28098423	Statistically, CVF was significantly elevated in Dox‐treated rats compared to sham rats but did not significantly changed by BDNF (Fig.	12539	12674
28098423	3K).	12675	12679
28098423	Consistently, the effects of Dox and BDNF on cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis in right ventricles were similar to left ventricles (Fig.	12680	12813
28098423	S1).	12814	12818
28098423	It is well known that SOD, MDA and reduced GSH are good indicators of oxidative stress.	12819	12906
28098423	Therefore, these markers are examined to assess the effects of BDNF on oxidative stress in our study.	12907	13008
28098423	It was found that BDNF significantly restored antioxidant markers (SOD activity and GSH content) and decreased MDA level in Dox‐treated left and right ventricles (Fig.	13009	13176
28098423	4A–F).	13177	13183
28098423	We further validated the salutary role of BDNF in protection of Dox‐induced cardiac dysfunction.	13184	13280
28098423	Echocardiographic data indicated that BDNF significantly ameliorated cardiac function in Dox‐treated rats (Fig.	13281	13392
28098423	4G).	13393	13397
28098423	In detail, BDNF markedly increased LVEF and FS (Fig.	13398	13450
28098423	4H and I), as well as decreased LVESV and LVEDV (Fig.	13451	13504
28098423	4J and K).	13505	13515
28098423	Therefore, the above findings strongly supported that BDNF protected against Dox‐induced oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction.	13516	13646
28098423	We then examined the role of Akt signals in the anti‐apoptotic effect of BDNF against Dox‐induced cardiac injury in both left and right ventricles.	13647	13794
28098423	It was found that protein level of p‐Akt was significantly repressed by Dox, which was recovered by BDNF (Fig.	13795	13905
28098423	5A) in left rat ventricles.	13906	13933
28098423	Meanwhile, no significant change in t‐Akt was observed among these groups (Fig.	13934	14013
28098423	5A).	14014	14018
28098423	We further detected protein expression of mTOR and Bad, the downstream signal of PI3K/Akt pathway, and found that p‐mTOR and p‐Bad were inhibited by Dox and was restored by BDNF.	14019	14197
28098423	In addition, mTOR and Bad protein levels did not change in those three groups (Fig.	14198	14281
28098423	5B and C).	14282	14292
28098423	Consistently, similar results were found in right ventricles (Fig.	14293	14359
28098423	5D–F).	14360	14366
28098423	So, these data supported that Akt regulated mTOR and Bad signals were involved in the protective effect of BDNF against Dox‐induced cardiotoxicity.	14367	14514
28098423	Mitogen‐activated protein kinase family members including p38 MAPK and ERK were also examined.	14515	14609
28098423	We found that protein levels of p‐p38 and p‐ERK as well as ratios of p‐p38/p38 and p‐ERK/ERK were increased in Dox rats, however, did not significantly change after BDNF treatment (Fig.	14610	14795
28098423	6A and B).	14796	14806
28098423	Similarly, expression of p38 MAPK and ERK in right ventricles are consistent with findings in left ventricles (Fig.	14807	14922
28098423	6C and D).	14923	14933
28098423	Then, we aimed to validate the effect and mechanisms of BDNF on the cardiotoxicity of Dox in vitro.	14934	15033
28098423	First, we examined the dose–response of Dox in H9c2 cells.	15034	15092
28098423	As shown in Figure 7A, the cell viability was markedly reduced by Dox at 1 and 3 μM for 24 hrs, whereas not significantly changed by 0.3 μM Dox.	15093	15237
28098423	Then, we tested the various time‐points and found that Dox (1 μM) treatment for 24 and 48 hrs markedly reduced the cell viability, however, 6 hrs treatment did not significantly reduced the cell viability (Fig.	15238	15448
28098423	7B).	15449	15453
28098423	Accordingly, 1 μM Dox treatment for 24 hrs were selected for subsequent experiments.	15454	15538
28098423	Furthermore, we detected the effect of BDNF on cell viability treated with Dox.	15539	15618
28098423	We found that BDNF (400 ng/ml) significantly reversed cell viability induced by Dox (Fig.	15619	15708
28098423	7C).	15709	15713
28098423	Therefore, BDNF (400 ng/ml) was determined for the following studies.	15714	15783
28098423	TUNEL assay and flowcytometry were employed to confirm the anti‐apoptotic effect of BDNF in Dox‐treated H9c2 cells.	15784	15899
28098423	It was suggested that TUNEL‐positive cells dramatically increased in Dox group, which was reversed by BDNF (Fig.	15900	16012
28098423	7D and E).	16013	16023
28098423	Phosphorylated γH2AX, a sensitive marker of double‐stranded DNA break, was employed to assess whether BDNF reduced DNA damage in Dox‐treated H9c2 cells (Fig.	16024	16181
28098423	7F).	16182	16186
28098423	Fluorescence intensity of γH2AX was higher in Dox group than untreated cells, which was limited by BDNF (Fig.	16187	16296
28098423	7G).	16297	16301
28098423	Furthermore, as shown in Figure 8A, the apoptotic rate was increased by Dox, which was attenuated by BDNF (Fig.	16302	16413
28098423	8B).	16414	16418
28098423	Taken together, these findings supported that BDNF protected against Dox‐induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells.	16419	16524
28098423	We further confirmed the impact of BDNF on protein expression of Akt in H9c2, and found that BDNF treatment significantly increased p‐Akt level without affecting t‐Akt level (Fig.	16525	16704
28098423	8C and D), which is agreement with previous in vivo results.	16705	16765
28098423	Then, BDNF blocker TrkB‐Fc and Akti were employed to validate the pivotal role of BDNF/TrkB/Akt cascade in beneficial effect of BDNF.	16766	16899
28098423	The cell viability in BDNF‐treated cells was reversed by BDNF scavenger TrkB‐Fc or Akti (Fig.	16900	16993
28098423	8E).	16994	16998
28098423	It was also found that the anti‐apoptotic effect of BDNF against Dox was significantly restored by TrkB‐Fc or Akti (Fig.	16999	17119
28098423	8F and G).	17120	17130
28098423	Collectively, our findings suggest that Akt signal is indispensible for the cardioprotective effect of BDNF against Dox‐induced cardiotoxicity.	17131	17274
28098423	This study mainly found that (i) cardiac BDNF expression was downregulated in Dox‐treated rat; (ii) exogenous BDNF inhibited Dox‐induced cardiac dysfunction including oxidative stress, DNA damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis by activating Akt signalling and preserving phosphorylation of mTOR and Bad; (iii) BDNF did not affect p38 MAPK and ERK in Dox‐treated rat heart.	17275	17644
28098423	In our previous study, it was found that protein expression of BDNF was increased in response to acute ischaemia for 1 or 6 hrs 19.	17645	17776
28098423	On the contrary, other study reported that chronic myocardial ischaemia (range from 1 to 14 days) significantly decreased protein level of BDNF with time‐dependent manner 15.	17777	17951
28098423	Besides, plasma BDNF level was elevated in acute myocardial infarction patients 19 while reduced in heart failure patients 31, 32.	17952	18082
28098423	On the basis of these findings, we speculated that increment of BDNF expression in acute injury was a compensatory mechanism while reduction expression after sustained injury was the outcome of decompensation.	18083	18292
28098423	In agreement with the above findings, we found that protein level of BDNF in the myocardium of Dox‐treated rats was markedly decreased.	18293	18428
28098423	Exogenous BDNF not only reversed cardiac BDNF expression but also improved Dox‐induced cardiac dysfunction.	18429	18536
28098423	Accordingly, BDNF deficiency is probably the consequence of Dox‐induced cardiotoxicity, which was restored after BDNF treatment.	18537	18665
28098423	It is well known that TrkB is the high‐affinity receptor of BDNF, which is indispensable for functional role of BDNF in both neurons 33 and heart 16, 17.	18666	18819
28098423	Our previous study also confirmed the crucial role of BDNF/TrkB pathway in the heart 19.	18820	18908
28098423	In this study, we observed the protective effect of BDNF against Dox‐induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was recovered by TrkB‐Fc.	18909	19035
28098423	In addition, TrkB could induce PI3K activity and leads to Akt activation by phosphorylating Akt at ser473 34.	19036	19145
28098423	We demonstrated the BDNF/TrkB/Akt axis in the protection of Dox‐induced cardiac injury.	19146	19233
28098423	Once Akt is activated, the phosphorylation of downstream key molecules mTOR and Bad are up‐regulated and regulates many important cellular activities including proliferation, growth, survival and angiogenesis.	19234	19443
28098423	PI3K/Akt pathway was well recognized to promote survival by downregulating pro‐apoptotic factors and up‐regulating anti‐apoptotic factors.	19444	19582
28098423	Through phosphorylation, PI3K/Akt inhibits the activity of proapoptotic members while activating anti‐apoptotic members 35.	19583	19706
28098423	On the other hand, MAPK family members p38 MAPK and ERK have also been demonstrated participated in Dox‐induced cardiac dysfunction 26.	19707	19842
28098423	In our present study, both p‐p38 MAPK and p‐ERK were activated by Dox, however, neither of them was affected by BDNF.	19843	19960
28098423	So, p38 MAPK and ERK were not involved in the protective role of BDNF against Dox‐induced injury.	19961	20058
28098423	Consistently, it has been previously described with effects of BDNF against Dox‐induced apoptosis in cancer cells 36.	20059	20176
28098423	Middlemas et al. reported the beneficial role of BDNF against cytotoxic agents including cisplatin, Dox and topotecan 20.	20177	20298
28098423	They found that BDNF protected cell against DNA damaging caused by these agents.	20299	20379
28098423	Moreover, they also speculated that BDNF regulate a common signalling pathway which is required for cell death 20.	20380	20494
28098423	Similarly, Ho et al. revealed that BDNF/TrkB signalling pathway has a beneficial impact when exposed to DNA‐damaging reagents in neuroblastomas.	20495	20639
28098423	Moreover, they also found that activation of PI3K/Akt survival pathway may contribute to the increased Dox resistance in TrkB‐expressing neuroblastomas 21.	20640	20795
28098423	Lately, another study reported that BDNF has potent cytoprotective effects against Dox‐induced injury in pancreatic β cells 37.	20796	20923
28098423	These findings suggest that the protective effect of BDNF may exist in different types of cells.	20924	21020
28098423	PI3K/Akt pathway phosphorylates many intracellular substrates 38.	21021	21086
28098423	It has been revealed that BDNF exerted its pro‐survival effects by binding TrkB and activating downstream signalling pathways.	21087	21213
28098423	In particular, TrkB‐induced PI3K activity lead to Akt activation and thereby phosphorylated downstream pro‐apoptotic targets, including Forkhead and Bad2 39, 40.	21214	21375
28098423	Moreover, up‐regulation of BDNF activated Akt and promotes hippocampal neuronal proliferation in mice by regulating Bcl‐2 and caspase‐3 41.	21376	21515
28098423	Combined ampakine and local delivery of BDNF improved post‐stroke functional recovery in aged mice by activating Akt/CREB signalling 42.	21516	21652
28098423	Here, we validate that phosphorylation of mTOR and Bad are preserved by BDNF in Dox‐induced cardiotoxicity.	21653	21760
28098423	Of course, other signals modulated by BDNF against Dox‐induced cardiac injury could not be excluded, although p38 and ERK were determined.	21761	21899
28098423	But the present findings strongly suggest that Akt signals are central in the protection of BDNF against Dox‐induced cardiac injury.	21900	22032
28098423	On the other hand, although BDNF has promising effect on cardiomyocyte injury, it should be noted that Dox‐induced interstitial fibrosis was not significantly ameliorated by BDNF.	22033	22212
28098423	Thus, whether BDNF reverses cardiac remodeling in several periods of Dox treatment is interesting to study in the following work.	22213	22342
28098423	In summary, the findings of this study highlight potential implications of BDNF against Dox‐induced cardiac dysfunction, which may enhance our understanding of therapeutic role of neurotrophic factors against chemotherapeutic agents induced cardiotoxicity to facilitate their safe use in cancer treatment.	22343	22648
28098423	The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.	22649	22709
28279980	Lifestyle modification, including an increase in physical activity, has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes (1).	0	137
28279980	Resistance exercise training has been specifically recommended due to its ability to reduce fasted blood glucose levels (2,3), fasted blood insulin levels (3), and hemoglobin A1c levels (2–4), as well as to increase whole-body glucose disposal (2,5), skeletal muscle mass (2–4), and muscle glucose uptake (5).	138	447
28279980	Given the importance of muscle in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis, understanding how resistance training alters muscle glucose metabolism may lead to new treatments for type 2 diabetes.Resistance exercise training is defined as repeated muscle contraction against a load (2–5).	448	734
28279980	In rodents, chronic muscle loading (overload) can be achieved via surgical ablation of synergist muscles or tendons (6–9), and studies have shown that it rapidly and consistently induces adaptations in skeletal muscle similar to resistance training, such as muscle hypertrophy (6–9).	735	1018
28279980	In both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant mouse muscle, 3–4 days of overload is sufficient to increase muscle mass (30–40%) (6–8) and glucose uptake (∼80%) (6), suggesting that resistance training and overload may use the same cellular mechanisms to regulate muscle metabolism.	1019	1302
28279980	Unfortunately, these mechanisms are not well understood.GLUT4 is considered to be the main GLUT in skeletal muscle as a number of studies have demonstrated a positive association between GLUT4 protein levels and muscle glucose uptake.	1303	1537
28279980	In mouse skeletal muscle, overexpression of GLUT4 increased basal (20–300%), insulin-induced (60–200%), and contraction-induced (35%) muscle glucose uptake (10,11).	1538	1702
28279980	In contrast, muscle-specific loss of GLUT4 decreased basal glucose uptake (70–80%) and completely prevented insulin- and contraction-induced muscle glucose uptake (11–13).	1703	1874
28279980	Thus, these findings demonstrate that GLUT4 plays an essential role in mediating skeletal muscle glucose uptake in response to short-term stimulation.In contrast to short-term stimulation, the role of GLUT4 in mediating muscle glucose uptake in response to long-term stimulation, such as resistance training or muscle overload, is less clear.	1875	2217
28279980	Studies conducted in humans and rodents have demonstrated an increase (5,9,14–18) as well as no change (16,18–20) in skeletal muscle GLUT4 protein levels in response to resistance training or muscle overload.	2218	2426
28279980	In addition, previous work in rodent muscle has demonstrated a dissociation between resistance training–induced increases in muscle glucose uptake and GLUT4 protein levels (18), suggesting that another GLUT may be involved.	2427	2650
28279980	Thus, the role of GLUT4 in mediating resistance training/loading–induced increases in muscle glucose uptake is not clear.	2651	2772
28279980	Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether GLUT4 expression is necessary for the long-term adaptation of overload to stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.Plasmids containing mouse GLUT1 (catalog #MR207871), GLUT3 (catalog #MR2097915), GLUT6 (catalog #MR219710), and GLUT10 (catalog #MR227535) and an HEK293 cell GLUT10 overexpression lysate (catalog #LY410718) were purchased from OriGene Technologies.	2773	3203
28279980	2-Deoxy-d-glucose (catalog #D8375), d-mannitol (catalog #M4125), phloridzin dihydrate (catalog #P3449), cytochalasin B (catalog #C6762), l-glucose (catalog #G5500), d-glucose (catalog #G8270), d-fructose (catalog #F0127), d-galactose (catalog #G0750), and d-xylose (catalog #X3833) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.	3204	3520
28279980	2-[1,2-3H(N)]-Deoxy-d-glucose (catalog #NET549001MC) and d-[1-14C]-mannitol (catalog #NEC314250UC) were purchased from PerkinElmer.All procedures were performed in accordance with the East Carolina University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.	3521	3866
28279980	Mice were housed in cages at 21–22°C with a 12 h light/dark cycle and fed a standard chow diet (Prolab RMH 3000, catalog #5P00; PMI Nutrition International).	3867	4024
28279980	Food and water were available ad libitum.Female CD-1 mice (7–8 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.	4025	4145
28279980	GLUT4 LoxP mice were generated as previously described (21) and obtained from Dr. Barbara B. Kahn (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center).	4146	4283
28279980	GLUT4 LoxP mice were bred with muscle creatine kinase Cre recombinase transgenic mice (MCK-Cre+; C57BL/6J strain; The Jackson Laboratory) to generate the following mice: wild-type (WT), GLUT4 LoxP+/−, LoxP+/+ (control), MCK-Cre+ (control), muscle-specific GLUT4 heterozygous (mGLUT4 HET) and muscle-specific GLUT4 knockout (mGLUT4 KO).	4284	4619
28279980	For these studies, both male and female mGLUT4 KO, mGLUT4 HET, and their WT/control littermates (11–12 weeks old) were used.Mice were weighed, and body composition was assessed using an EchoMRI Model 700 Body Composition Analyzer prior to any surgical procedure.In vivo muscle gene transfer/electroporation was performed using methods described by Hinkley et al. (22).	4620	4988
28279980	Five days post-transfection, muscles were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and processed for immunoblot analyses.Muscle overload was induced via unilateral ablation of synergist muscles using methods described by Ferey et al. (7).	4989	5222
28279980	Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–3%).	5223	5269
28279980	For plantaris muscle overload, the distal two-thirds of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were ablated.	5270	5376
28279980	For soleus muscle overload, the distal two-thirds of the gastrocnemius muscle was ablated.	5377	5467
28279980	A sham surgery was performed on the contralateral leg.	5468	5522
28279980	After 1, 3, or 5 days (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were fasted overnight, anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (90–100 mg/kg body weight) for 40 min or isoflurane (2–3%) for 3–5 min, and euthanized by cervical dislocation.	5523	5761
28279980	Muscles were excised, weighed, and then used to assess [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake or processed for immunoblot analyses.Ex vivo muscle [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was assessed using methods adapted from Hinkley et al. (22).	5762	5989
28279980	Muscles were preincubated in continuously oxygenated 37°C Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) composed of the following (in mmol/L): 117 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2 ⋅ 2H2O, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4 ⋅ 7H2O, and 24.6 NaHCO3, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 mmol/L pyruvate.	5990	6254
28279980	For glucose uptake, muscles were incubated in KRBB supplemented with 1.5 μCi/mL [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose, 1 mmol/L 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 0.45 μCi/mL [14C]-mannitol, and 7 mmol/L mannitol, unless otherwise indicated.	6255	6465
28279980	All radioactive incubations were conducted at 30°C for 10 min.	6466	6528
28279980	Cytochalasin B and phloridzin were added into buffers as described in the figure legends.Hexose competition experiments were performed using methods adapted from Ryder et al. (23).	6529	6709
28279980	Muscles were preincubated in KRBB plus pyruvate and then incubated in 90% KRBB supplemented with 1.5 μCi/mL [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose, 1 mmol/L 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 0.45 μCi/mL [14C]-mannitol, and 35 mmol/L d-fructose, d-galactose, d-glucose, d-xylose, or l-glucose.	6710	6971
28279980	The osmolarity of the radioactive solution was kept at ∼310 mOsm by the 10% dilution of the KRBB and the removal of nonradiolabeled mannitol.After radioactive incubations, muscles were frozen in liquid nitrogen, weighed, and solubilized in 1 mol/L NaOH at 80°C for 15 min.	6972	7244
28279980	Solubilized muscles were neutralized with 1 mol/L HCl.	7245	7299
28279980	Nonsoluble particulates were precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000g for 1 min.	7300	7381
28279980	Aliquots were removed for scintillation counting of the [3H] and [14C] labels, and the extracellular and intracellular spaces calculated to determine [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake.Immunoblot analyses were performed using standard methods as previously described by Hinkley et al. (22) and Ferey et al. (7).	7382	7688
28279980	Frozen muscles were homogenized in buffer containing the following (in mmol/L): 20 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 EDTA, 10 Na4P2O7, 100 NaF, 2 NaVO4, 0.01 leupeptin, 3 benzamidine, 1 phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1% Tergitol, and 10 μg/mL aprotinin.	7689	7927
28279980	Samples were rotated end over end at 4°C for 60 min and centrifuged at 14,000g for 30 min.	7928	8018
28279980	Lysate protein concentrations were determined via the Bradford method.	8019	8089
28279980	Lysates (80 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.	8090	8194
28279980	Blocking, primary, and secondary antibody conditions were as described in Table 1.	8195	8277
28279980	Horseradish peroxide–conjugated secondary antibodies were detected using chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer).	8278	8392
28279980	Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was performed using Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad).Data are presented as the mean ± SEM.	8393	8517
28279980	Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05 and was determined by Student t tests, one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis.	8518	8681
28279980	The number of mice or muscles used to determine statistical significance is indicated in the text or figure legends.Previous work demonstrated that muscle-specific loss of GLUT4 led to slight (10–15%) or nonsignificant alterations in mouse body weight (11,12,24), and this small difference in phenotype was attributed to the heterogeneity of the background strain (i.e., mixture of C57BL6, 129, and FVB).	8682	9086
28279980	Consistent with those findings, at the current level of backcross to the C57BL6 strain neither female or male mGLUT4 KO mice exhibited a significant difference in body weight, fat mass, or lean mass compared with WT/controls (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1).To determine whether GLUT4 was necessary for overload-induced muscle hypertrophy, unilateral synergist ablation of the distal two-thirds of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was performed to induce plantaris overload.	9087	9568
28279980	As shown in Table 2, after 5 days overload-induced muscle hypertrophy was not impaired in female mGLUT4 HET or mGLUT4 KO mice compared with WT/controls.	9569	9721
28279980	Similar results were obtained in male mice (Supplementary Table 1).	9722	9789
28279980	Thus, GLUT4 is not necessary for overload-induced muscle growth in either sex.To determine whether GLUT4 was necessary for overload-induced muscle glucose uptake, muscles were incubated in buffer containing [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose.	9790	10020
28279980	Female mGLUT4 KO mice had significantly lower basal muscle glucose uptake compared with both WT/control and mGLUT4 HET mice, but in response to overload all three groups increased glucose uptake to the same level (Fig.	10021	10239
28279980	1A).	10240	10244
28279980	Thus, the percentage change in muscle glucose uptake in response to overload was enhanced in the mGLUT4 KO mice compared with WT/control and mGLUT4 HET mice (Fig.	10245	10407
28279980	1B).	10408	10412
28279980	Similar results were obtained in male mice (Supplementary Fig.	10413	10475
28279980	1A and B).	10476	10486
28279980	Thus, GLUT4 is not necessary for overload-induced muscle glucose uptake in either sex.There are two main glucose transporter families in mammalian cells: the solute carrier family 2, which consists of facilitated GLUTs; and the solute carrier family 5, which consists of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLTs).	10487	10806
28279980	To determine whether overload uses SGLTs or GLUTs to increase glucose uptake, isolated muscles were treated in the short term with the chemical SGLT inhibitor phloridzin or the GLUT inhibitor cytochalasin B, and [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was assessed.	10807	11062
28279980	As shown in Fig.	11063	11079
28279980	2, while phloridzin did not alter glucose uptake (Fig.	11080	11134
28279980	2A), cytochalasin B lowered basal and overload-induced glucose uptake compared with vehicle (Fig.	11135	11232
28279980	2B).	11233	11237
28279980	Since the overload-induced increase in muscle mass was the same among the groups (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), these results indicate that GLUTs mediate overload-induced glucose uptake.There are 14 members of the GLUT family found in mammalian cells (GLUT1 to GLUT14).	11238	11508
28279980	To narrow down the list of GLUT isoforms involved in overload-induced glucose uptake, the isoforms were screened for the following characteristics: 1) presence in the mouse genome, 2) ability to transport 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and 3) inhibition by cytochalasin B.	11509	11769
28279980	Importantly for this study, previous work has demonstrated that the mouse genome does not possess GLUT11 or GLUT14 (25,26), that neither GLUT7 nor GLUT13 (also known as the H+/myo-inositol transporter) can transport 2-deoxy-d-glucose (27,28), and that [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose transport via GLUT9 is not inhibited by cytochalasin B (29).	11770	12105
28279980	Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GLUT7, GLUT9, GLUT11, GLUT13/H+/myo-inositol transporter, and GLUT14 cannot be part of the mechanism by which overload mediates [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in mouse muscle.Hexose competition experiments have been performed in Xenopus oocytes expressing individual GLUT isoforms (27,30–35), and these studies have demonstrated considerable substrate transport heterogeneity among the GLUTs.	12106	12543
28279980	For example, GLUT2, GLUT5, GLUT8, and GLUT12 have a higher affinity for transporting d-fructose over 2-deoxy-d-glucose (30–33), while GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT10 have a higher affinity for transporting d-galactose (30,34,35), and GLUT3 has a higher affinity for d-xylose (30,35).	12544	12820
28279980	To further narrow down the list of GLUTs involved in overload-induced glucose uptake, experiments were performed to assess the ability of different hexoses to compete against [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose for transport into muscle cells.	12821	13051
28279980	For all experiments, overload-induced increases in muscle mass were not significantly different (Supplementary Tables 4A and B).	13052	13180
28279980	As shown in Fig.	11063	11079
28279980	3A, d-glucose completely blocked [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in both the sham and overload-stimulated muscles compared with l-glucose controls.	13198	13343
28279980	In contrast, d-fructose did not impair either sham or overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake (Fig.	13344	13450
28279980	3A), demonstrating that the fructose-transporting GLUT2, GLUT5, GLUT8, and GLUT12 are not involved.	13451	13550
28279980	d-galactose and d-xylose inhibited both sham and overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake by ∼40–50% (Fig.	13551	13663
28279980	3A and B), suggesting a possible role for GLUT1, GLUT3, and/or GLUT10.	13664	13734
28279980	To date, no studies have examined GLUT6 substrate transport preference.The results of the hexose competition experiments suggested that overload uses GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and/or GLUT10 to increase muscle glucose uptake.	13735	13954
28279980	To assess the potential involvement of these GLUTs, immunoblots were performed in muscles 1, 3, and 5 days after overload.	13955	14077
28279980	Commercially available GLUT antibodies were validated for the ability to detect their specified protein using GLUT isoform overexpression samples and/or tissues known to express that GLUT isoform (Supplementary Fig.	14078	14293
28279980	2).	4985	4988
28279980	Muscle weights time-dependently increased after overload (Supplementary Table 5).	14298	14379
28279980	Overload did not significantly alter GLUT4 protein levels (Fig.	14380	14443
28279980	4).	11505	11508
28279980	In contrast, overload significantly increased GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and GLUT10 protein levels (Fig.	14448	14546
28279980	4), suggesting that any or all of these GLUTs could be involved in overload-induced muscle glucose uptake.To determine whether the overload-induced increase in GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, or GLUT10 protein levels was enhanced by the loss of GLUT4, immunoblots were performed in muscles from the mGLUT4 HET and mGLUT4 KO mice.	14547	14865
28279980	Immunoblot results for female mice are provided in Fig.	14866	14921
28279980	5, whereas results for male mice are provided in Supplementary Fig.	14922	14989
28279980	3.	14990	14992
28279980	A direct comparison of GLUT immunoblot data between male and female mice is provided in Supplementary Fig.	14993	15099
28279980	4.	6136	6138
28279980	As shown in Fig.	11063	11079
28279980	5, the overload-induced increases in GLUT3 and GLUT10 protein levels were not altered by the loss of GLUT4.	15120	15227
28279980	In contrast, although the overload-induced increase in GLUT1 trended toward being higher in the mGLUT4 KO mice (P = 0.13), the overload-induced increase in GLUT6 was significantly impaired (Fig.	15228	15422
28279980	5).	444	447
28279980	In addition, GLUT6 protein levels were lower in the sham muscles from the mGLUT4 KO mice compared with WT/control mice (P = 0.05).The data presented in this study are the first to demonstrate that GLUT4 is not necessary for overload to stimulate glucose uptake or hypertrophic growth in skeletal muscle.	15427	15730
28279980	In addition, these studies demonstrate that overload-induced muscle glucose uptake is mediated via a facilitated GLUT with a hexose transport preference of d-glucose > d-galactose ≈ d-xylose > 2-deoxy-d-glucose and not d-fructose.	15731	15961
28279980	Immunoblot analyses found that muscle GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and GLUT10 protein levels are increased by overload, suggesting that one or more of these transporters is responsible for overload-induced glucose uptake.Five days of overload increased glucose uptake ∼80% in plantaris muscles from both male and female WT/control mice (11–12 weeks old) (Figs.	15962	16314
28279980	1–3 and Supplementary Fig.	16315	16341
28279980	1) and ∼90% in soleus muscle from female mice (8–9 weeks old) (Supplementary Fig.	16342	16423
28279980	4).	11505	11508
28279980	These findings, along with previous work that showed that 4 days of overload increased soleus muscle glucose uptake ∼80% in male mice that were 25–30 weeks old (6), demonstrate that overload can stimulate muscle glucose uptake irrespective of fiber type, sex, or age.In this study, muscle GLUT4 protein levels were not significantly changed by overload (Fig.	16428	16786
28279980	4).	11505	11508
28279980	Although this is in contrast with work that demonstrated an ∼70% increase in GLUT4 protein levels after overload (9), there are a number of important differences between these studies that could account for the observed inconsistency in findings, including species examined (rat vs. mouse), age of animals (6 vs. 2–3 months old), duration of overload (120 vs. 5 days), type of surgery (bilateral vs. unilateral), and muscle examined (medial gastrocnemius vs. plantaris).	16791	17261
28279980	Consistent with no change in GLUT4 protein levels, overload-induced muscle glucose uptake was not impaired in either the male or female mGLUT4 KO mice (Fig.	17262	17418
28279980	1 and Supplementary Fig.	17419	17443
28279980	1).	134	137
28279980	This finding is in agreement with work in rat hind limb muscle that demonstrated a disconnect between resistance training–induced increases in muscle glucose uptake and GLUT4 protein levels (18) and work in human muscle that demonstrated no change in GLUT4 protein after resistance training in healthy subjects (4,5).	17448	17765
28279980	Thus, collectively these results suggest that GLUT4 does not regulate loading-induced glucose uptake in healthy muscle.	17766	17885
28279980	However, overload and resistance training are not identical stimuli and elicit some differential adaptations in muscle (e.g., change in fiber type), so future studies will need to examine the necessity of GLUT4 in other models that induce hypertrophy (e.g., weighted ladder climbing).Treatment of mouse plantaris muscles with the SGLT inhibitor phloridzin (10 or 100 μmol/L) had no significant effect on basal or overload-induced glucose uptake (Fig.	17886	18336
28279980	2A).	18337	18341
28279980	These findings are in contrast with previous work in mouse soleus in which a 30-min preincubation with phloridzin (5 mmol/L) impaired basal and overload-induced glucose uptake 70–75% (6).	18342	18529
28279980	Since the current study allowed a longer time (60 min) for phloridzin diffusion to the innermost muscle fibers, the discrepancy between these findings is most likely due to inhibitor dose.	18530	18718
28279980	Phloridzin has an IC50 of ∼0.760 μmol/L for SGLT1 (36), ∼0.066 μmol/L for SGLT2 (36), ∼360 μmol/L for GLUT1 (37), and ∼140 μmol/L for GLUT4 (37).	18719	18864
28279980	Thus, the decreased glucose uptake observed with 5 mmol/L phloridzin was most likely due to nonspecific inhibition of GLUTs and not to a muscle fiber type–specific difference in inhibitor action.d-Fructose had no effect on either sham or overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake (Fig.	18865	19155
28279980	3A).	19156	19160
28279980	These results are consistent with those found in mouse soleus muscle demonstrating no inhibition of basal or insulin-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake by d-fructose (23) and indicate that the GLUTs capable of transporting fructose (i.e., GLUT2, GLUT5, GLUT8, GLUT9, and GLUT12) do not functionally contribute to basal, insulin-induced, or overload-induced muscle glucose uptake.	19161	19543
28279980	d-Galactose and d-xylose both partially impaired basal and overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake (Fig.	19544	19655
28279980	3A and B).	19656	19666
28279980	Since previous work has shown that d-galactose is a competitive inhibitor of [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake via GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT10 (30,34) and d-xylose is a competitive inhibitor of [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake via GLUT3 (30), these results suggest that GLUT1, GLUT3, and/or GLUT10 mediate overload-induced muscle glucose uptake.The mouse GLUT1 gene encodes a 492-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of ∼54 kDa, and in this study GLUT1 was detected at ∼55 kDa in mouse muscle (Supplementary Fig.	19667	20185
28279980	2A).	18337	18341
28279980	Overload time-dependently increased muscle GLUT1 protein levels up to ∼480% in WT mice (Fig.	20191	20283
28279980	4), and overload-induced increases in GLUT1 protein were elevated ∼50% in mGLUT4 KO mice compared with WT/control mice (Fig.	20284	20408
28279980	5).	444	447
28279980	These data are consistent with those in cardiac muscle, in which pressure overload time-dependently increased GLUT1 protein up to ∼200% by 4 days (38), and in cardiac-specific GLUT4 KO mice, which exhibited ∼200% increases in cardiac GLUT1 protein levels (21).	20413	20673
28279980	At 5 days postoverload, GLUT1 protein was increased ∼480% (Fig.	20674	20737
28279980	4), but muscle glucose uptake was only increased ∼80% (Figs.	20738	20798
28279980	1–3), suggesting that at least some of the GLUT1 proteins were not actively transporting glucose.	20799	20896
28279980	These findings are consistent with those in muscle-specific GLUT1 overexpression mice in which >40-fold increases in GLUT1 protein only increased basal muscle glucose uptake approximately ninefold (39).	20897	21099
28279980	Thus, future studies will need to assess the activity of muscle GLUT1 in order to determine a role for this protein in overload-induced muscle glucose uptake.The mouse GLUT3 gene encodes a 493-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of ∼54 kDa, and in this study GLUT3 was detected at ∼66 kDa in mouse sciatic nerve and muscle (Supplementary Fig.	21100	21459
28279980	2B).	11233	11237
28279980	These data are consistent with those from studies detecting GLUT3 in mouse neurons (mRNA and protein) (40) and C2C12 muscle cells (mRNA) (41) but are in contrast with work that failed to detect GLUT3 protein in mouse soleus (23).	21465	21694
28279980	The reason underlying this inconsistency in the predicted versus observed molecular weight of GLUT3, as well as the discrepancy in detection of GLUT3 protein in mouse muscle, is unclear.	21695	21881
28279980	However, since [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake via GLUT3 can be competitively inhibited by d-xylose (30) and muscle [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was impaired by d-xylose in this study (Fig.	21882	22070
28279980	3B), these results support the conclusion that GLUT3 protein is present in mouse plantaris muscle and suggest that GLUT3 expression in rodent muscle may be fiber type specific.	22071	22247
28279980	Overload time-dependently increased GLUT3 protein levels up to ∼140% in WT mice (Fig.	22248	22333
28279980	4).	11505	11508
28279980	Since overload stimulates muscle satellite cell recruitment and myocyte fusion (42) and GLUT3 mRNA levels transiently increase during myocyte fusion (43), these findings suggest that overload-induced increases in GLUT3 protein levels may be due to an increase in muscle satellite cells.	22338	22624
28279980	Overload-induced increases in GLUT3 protein levels were not impaired in mGLUT4 KO mice (Fig.	22625	22717
28279980	5), suggesting that GLUT3 could regulate overload-induced glucose uptake.	22718	22791
28279980	Consistent with this hypothesis, work in Xenopus oocytes has shown that GLUT3 exhibits a fivefold or greater capacity to transport glucose than GLUT1 or GLUT4 (35).	22792	22956
28279980	Thus, even a small increase in GLUT3 protein levels could have a significant impact on muscle glucose uptake.The mouse GLUT6 gene encodes a 497-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of ∼55 kDa, and in this study GLUT6 protein was detected at ∼52 kDa in mouse brain and muscle (Supplementary Fig.	22957	23267
28279980	2D).	23268	23272
28279980	These data are consistent with those in human tissues in which GLUT6 mRNA was strongly detected in brain with lower transcript levels found in muscle (44).	23273	23428
28279980	Overload increased muscle GLUT6 protein levels ∼200–300% in WT/control and mGLUT4 KO mice (Figs.	23429	23525
28279980	4 and 5), suggesting that GLUT6 could mediate overload-induced glucose uptake.	23526	23604
28279980	In support of this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated that GLUT6 transports d-glucose within a physiological range (1–5 mmol/L) (44) and that GLUT6 knockdown impaired [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in malignant human endometrial cells (45).	23605	23847
28279980	However, even though studies in 3T3L1 adipocytes demonstrated that mutation of an N-terminal di-leucine motif in GLUT6 caused its relocalization to the cell surface (46), to date no studies have demonstrated GLUT6 translocation in response to any stimulus in any cell type (46).	23848	24126
28279980	Thus, future studies will need to determine whether overload increases cell surface GLUT6 protein levels.	24127	24232
28279980	Interestingly, GLUT6 protein levels were decreased ∼40–50% in the sham and overload-stimulated muscles from the female and male mGLUT4 KO mice (Fig.	24233	24381
28279980	5 and Supplementary Figs.	24382	24407
28279980	3 and 4), suggesting that GLUT4 and GLUT6 may interact to coordinately regulate glucose uptake.	24408	24503
28279980	Future studies will need to determine the relationship between GLUT4 and GLUT6 in skeletal muscle.The mouse GLUT10 gene encodes a 536-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of ∼57 kDa, and in this study GLUT10 was detected at ∼66 kDa in mouse muscle (Supplementary Fig.	24504	24787
28279980	2C).	24788	24792
28279980	Although the reason behind the discrepancy in the predicted versus observed molecular weight of GLUT10 is unclear, the current finding is consistent with previous work that reported GLUT10 mRNA in C2C12 cells (41) and mouse muscle (47).	24793	25029
28279980	Overload increased GLUT10 protein levels 100–150% in muscles from WT/control, mGLUT4 HET, and mGLUT4 KO mice (Figs.	25030	25145
28279980	4 and 5), suggesting that GLUT10 could regulate overload-induced glucose uptake.	25146	25226
28279980	However, in 3T3L1 adipocytes GLUT10 is localized to the Golgi and mitochondria and not to the cell surface (48).	25227	25339
28279980	Thus, even though GLUT10 has the lowest Km value for 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport of all of the overload-regulated GLUTs (i.e., Km ∼0.3 mmol/L) (34), without localization to the cell surface, GLUT10 could not be involved in overload-induced muscle [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake.	25340	25617
28279980	Future studies will need to determine the intracellular localization of GLUT10 in muscle.A direct comparison of the GLUT immunoblot data from the male and female mice revealed a sex difference in the expression of GLUT4, GLUT6, and GLUT10 (Supplementary Fig.	25618	25876
28279980	5).	444	447
28279980	Although the physiological significance of these findings is presently unclear, it may explain the different rates of muscle glucose uptake observed between the sexes (e.g., basal muscle glucose uptake rates were 0.88 ± 0.10 μmol/g/h in WT/control female mice [Fig.	25881	26146
28279980	1] and 0.59 ± 0.04 μmol/g/h in male mice [Supplementary Fig.	26147	26207
28279980	1]).In conclusion, the results from this study demonstrated that GLUT4 is not required for overload-induced increases in skeletal muscle glucose uptake or hypertrophic growth and suggest that GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and/or GLUT10 may play a key role in the regulation of overload-induced glucose uptake.	26208	26508
28279980	Future studies are currently underway to identify the GLUTs that are responsible for this effect and to determine whether they also play a key role in the beneficial effects on whole-body glucose metabolism elicited by resistance exercise training in individuals with type 2 diabetes.	26509	26793
28348168	Like human airways, the mouse trachea contains three major epithelial lineages.	0	79
28348168	Basal cells (BCs) are a stem cell population and include slowly dividing stem cells and committed luminal precursors.	80	197
28348168	Luminal secretory cells self-renew and produce terminally differentiated ciliated cells.	198	286
28348168	Multiple studies have shown that SOX2 is a key transcription factor (TF) for the development and maintenance of all airway epithelial cells.	287	427
28348168	Deletion of Sox2 in adult mouse tracheal epithelium caused loss of differentiated cells.	428	516
28348168	Moreover, the Sox2Δ/Δ BCs were less able to proliferate in vitro or in vivo following injury.	517	610
28348168	SOX2 is thus required for BC self-renewal and luminal differentiation.	611	681
28348168	SOX2 overexpression can be a driver of squamous cell carcinoma, which has a predominantly basal cell phenotype.	682	793
28348168	FGFR2 function has been extensively studied during lung branching where one of its roles is to maintain undifferentiated epithelial progenitors by inhibiting SOX2 expression.	794	968
28348168	However, at later stages of embryonic development ectopic FGF10 can promote BC differentiation in SOX2+ airway progenitors.	969	1092
28348168	The same study expressed a secreted dominant-negative FGFR2 in the late stages of embryogenesis and suggested that there could be a role for FGFR2 signalling in maintenance of airway BCs.	1093	1280
28348168	We have now specifically tested this hypothesis in the steady-state adult mouse trachea, and show that FGFR2 is required for BC self-renewal and terminal differentiation.	1281	1451
28348168	Moreover, FGFR2 signalling maintains SOX2 expression.	1452	1505
28348168	We detected FGFR2 protein in airway basal cells and at the apical surface of secretory cells (Fig.	1506	1604
28348168	1A,B), confirming previous results.	1605	1640
28348168	To determine the role of FGFR2 in BCs, we conditionally deleted one copy of Fgfr2 and activated a GFP reporter in adult tracheal BCs using Tg(KRT5-CreER); Rosa26RfGFP/+; Fgfr2fx/+ (Fgfr2 conditional heterozygous, cHet) and control Tg(KRT5-CreER); Rosa26RfGFP/+ mice (Fig.	1641	1912
28348168	1C).	1913	1917
28348168	To test for co-recombination between Fgfr2fx and the reporter, we isolated GFP+ BCs by flow cytometry as GFP+, GSIβ4-lectin+ cells at 3 weeks post-tamoxifen (tmx) induction and performed RT-qPCR for Fgfr2 (Fig.	1918	2128
28348168	1D).	2129	2133
28348168	This confirmed that cHet BCs had ∼50% of the control Fgfr2 mRNA level.	2134	2204
28348168	Hence, we use GFP+ cells as a surrogate marker for Fgfr2Δ/+ cells, being aware that co-recombination will not be 100%.	2205	2323
28348168	Tracheae were harvested at intervals to assess the contribution of GFP+, Fgfr2Δ/+ BCs to the epithelium during homeostatic turnover (Fig.	2324	2461
28348168	1E).	2462	2466
28348168	At 1.5 weeks post-tmx, ∼30% of total BCs were GFP+ in Fgfr2cHet and control mice.	2467	2548
28348168	In controls, this percentage increased to ∼60% at 5 weeks post-tmx, before dropping to initial levels by 24 weeks.	2549	2663
28348168	By contrast, in the Fgfr2cHet tracheae, the percentage of GFP+ BCs remained approximately constant at 5 weeks, but decreased to less than 5% of total basal cells by 24 weeks (Fig.	2664	2843
28348168	1F).	2844	2848
28348168	In both genotypes, labelled BCs produced labelled luminal cells.	2849	2913
28348168	Luminal differentiation initially appeared more rapid in the Fgfr2cHets.	2914	2986
28348168	However, luminal cell production was not sustained over time, likely due to the loss of GFP+ BCs, and by 24 weeks the percentage of labelled luminal cells was significantly lower in the Fgfr2cHet tracheae (Fig.	2987	3197
28348168	1G).	3198	3202
28348168	This showed that Fgfr2cHet BCs can produce luminal cells, but that mutant basal and luminal cells are gradually lost.	3203	3320
28348168	One possible reason for the loss of Fgfr2cHet cells is differential fitness and competition with neighbouring wild-type cells.	3321	3447
28348168	To test this, we mixed pure populations of Rosa26RtdTomato/+; Fgfr2Δ/+ with unlabelled Fgfr2+/+ BCs (1:2 ratio) and assessed their ability to compete in vitro at steady-state and following injury.	3448	3644
28348168	We were unable to find evidence for differential proliferation or survival in the mixed cultures and conclude that it is unlikely that cell competition contributes to the observed loss of mutant cells (Fig.	3645	3851
28348168	S1; Movies 1-5).	3852	3868
28348168	We asked whether the loss of Fgfr2cHet cells was due to a decrease in cell division.	3869	3953
28348168	As expected, proliferation rates were low in all tracheae, but dividing GFP+ cells were observed (Fig.	3954	4056
28348168	S2A).	4057	4062
28348168	We noted an increase in proliferation of the Fgfr2cHet GFP+ cells at 1.5 weeks post-tmx, although this was not statistically significant and the change was not sustained over time (Fig.	4063	4248
28348168	S2B).	4249	4254
28348168	Thus, altered proliferation does not explain the phenotype.	4255	4314
28348168	We also assessed apoptosis using cleaved caspase 3 staining, but did not identify caspase 3+ cells (665 GFP+ cells scored in four independent 5 week samples; Fig.	4315	4477
28348168	S2C,D).	4478	4485
28348168	We assessed the ability of Fgfr2cHet cells to differentiate by analysing the luminal (KRT8) and basal (KRT5) cytokeratins at 5 weeks post-tmx (Fig.	4486	4633
28348168	2A).	4058	4062
28348168	A higher percentage of the total GFP+ cells co-stained with KRT8 in the mutants, indicating that more cells had begun differentiation to a luminal fate (Fig.	4639	4796
28348168	2B).	4250	4254
28348168	Similarly, plotting the GFP/T1α staining (Fig.	4802	4848
28348168	1D) as a percentage of GFP+ cells (GFP+, T1α−) showed more differentiating cells in the mutants (Fig.	4849	4950
28348168	2B).	4250	4254
28348168	Thus, Fgfr2cHet cells exit the basal layer at a greater rate than controls and their descendants take on a luminal KRT8+, T1α− fate, suggesting a self-renewal defect.	4956	5122
28348168	At steady-state, BCs initially differentiate into secretory cells that later produce ciliated cells.	5123	5223
28348168	Cell fate analysis at 5 weeks post-tmx showed that both control and Fgfr2cHet BCs produce secretory SCGB1A1+ cells (Fig.	5224	5344
28348168	2C,D).	4479	4485
28348168	Moreover, there were no signs of goblet cell production in the mutants (Fig.	5352	5428
28348168	2C; n=4 MUC5AClo cells observed from 859 cells counted in 5 Fgfr2cHet individuals).	5429	5512
28348168	However, analysis of acetylated tubulin-positive cilia (marker of terminal luminal differentiation) at 24 weeks post-tmx showed that the Fgfr2cHet cells never took on a ciliated cell identity (Fig.	5513	5710
28348168	2E).	5711	5715
28348168	We tested the ability of Fgfr2cHet cells to proliferate and differentiate in vitro using a high dose of an adenovirus containing CMV-Cre (Ad-Cre) to recombine Rosa26RfGFP/+; Fgfr2fx/+ and control Rosa26RfGFP/fGFP BCs grown in self-renewing conditions (Fig.	5716	5972
28348168	3A).	5973	5977
28348168	When analysed by genomic PCR, this resulted in an almost-pure population of Fgfr2Δ/+ cells (Fig.	5978	6074
28348168	S3A,B).	6075	6082
28348168	Four days after Ad-Cre-mediated deletion, we observed an increased proportion of KRT8+ cells in the Fgfr2cHet cultures (Fig.	6083	6207
28348168	3A-C).	6208	6214
28348168	This recapitulates the in vivo phenotype and supports the conclusion that Fgfr2cHet BCs have a self-renewal defect.	6215	6330
28348168	Additional cultures were passaged and grown to confluence before differentiation at air-liquid interface (Fig.	6331	6441
28348168	S4A-D).	6442	6449
28348168	The Fgfr2cHet cells survived passaging but did not reach confluence and failed to express markers of ciliated or basal cell differentiation.	6450	6590
28348168	Moreover, passaged cells were unable to grow in sphere-forming assays (Fig.	6591	6666
28348168	S4E-H).	6667	6674
28348168	The passaged Fgfr2cHet cells were somewhat enlarged and flattened, possibly indicating a senescent phenotype (Rodier and Campisi, 2011).	6675	6811
28348168	We therefore tested for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity in primary cultures of Fgfr2cHet cells.	6812	6922
28348168	β-Galactosidase activity was detected in 3/3 Fgfr2cHet cultures and 0/3 controls (Fig.	6923	7009
28348168	3D).	7010	7014
28348168	Senescence of the Fgfr2cHet cells in vivo could potentially explain why the luminal GFP+ cells can express secretory markers, but do not later produce ciliated cells.	7015	7181
28348168	However, we cannot absolutely exclude a luminal fate choice defect in Fgfr2cHet BCs.	7182	7266
28348168	We determined the effects of decreasing FGFR2 signalling on downstream pathways using immunoblotting.	7267	7368
28348168	There was a 1.5-fold decrease in phosphorylated AKT in the Fgfr2Δ/+ cells (Fig.	7369	7448
28348168	3E,F), but no change in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig.	7449	7500
28348168	S3C,D).	7501	7508
28348168	These changes are consistent with a decrease in FGFR2 signalling via the PI3K-AKT pathway, which was implicated as the main pathway downstream of FGFR2 in adult small airway secretory cells and the developing trachea.	7509	7726
28348168	Most strikingly, there was a twofold decrease in SOX2 in the Fgfr2Δ/+ cells (Fig.	7727	7808
28348168	3E,F; Fig.	7809	7819
28348168	S3C,D).	7501	7508
28348168	We confirmed the decrease in SOX2 protein at a cellular level by in vitro immunostaining (Fig.	7828	7922
28348168	3G).	7923	7927
28348168	Similarly, there was consistently lower SOX2 expression in GFP+ cells in the Fgfr2cHet tracheae in vivo (Fig.	7928	8037
28348168	3H, arrows).	8038	8050
28348168	As expected from the genetic strategy, in the mutants we also observed GFP+, SOX2+ cells (Fig.	8051	8145
28348168	3H, arrowheads) and GFP−, SOX2− cells (Fig.	8146	8189
28348168	3H, yellow arrows), both are likely to have recombined only one floxed allele.	8190	8268
28348168	Co-immunostaining with FGFR2 confirmed that the GFP+, SOX2+ cells observed in the mutants retained high levels of FGFR2 protein (Fig.	8269	8402
28348168	3I).	8403	8407
28348168	We predicted that if a decrease in Fgfr2 results in loss of BC self-renewal, then activation of FGFR2 in vitro should promote the growth of BC colonies.	8408	8560
28348168	FGF7 and FGF10 are expressed in homeostatic tracheae and are known to activate FGFR2 preferentially in vitro and in vivo. We plated wild-type BCs at low density and added FGF7 or FGF10 on culture day 2 after colonies were established (Fig.	8561	8800
28348168	4A).	8801	8805
28348168	Addition of FGF7 or FGF10 had the opposite effect to decreasing Fgfr2 and significantly increased colony size (Fig.	8806	8921
28348168	4B,C).	8922	8928
28348168	Interestingly, FGF7 and FGF10 had no effect on the level of Sox2 mRNA (Fig.	8929	9004
28348168	4D).	9005	9009
28348168	In conclusion, our data suggest that a normal function of FGFR2 signalling in adult airway BCs is to promote asymmetric self-renewing divisions (Fig.	9010	9159
28348168	4E).	9160	9164
28348168	This is consistent with work in the embryonic trachea where ectopic FGF10 was observed to promote BC fate.	9165	9271
28348168	By contrast, our previous work on FGFR1 in adult BCs showed that FGFR1 is required to inhibit steady-state proliferation and does not change the ability of BCs to self-renew.	9272	9446
28348168	Thus, FGFR1 and FGFR2 have independent functions in airway BCs.	9447	9510
28348168	We cannot exclude the possibility that they also have other overlapping functions.	9511	9593
28348168	We also show that steady-state FGFR2 signalling is required, directly or indirectly, to maintain SOX2 protein levels in the adult airway.	9594	9731
28348168	This is in contrast to the branching lung, where FGFR2 inhibits SOX2 expression at the tips.	9732	9824
28348168	Interestingly, an FGFR2-SOX2 inductive relationship has been observed in other cell types.	9825	9915
28348168	An FGFR2-SOX2 relationship may be maintained in some squamous lung cancers where FGFR2 and SOX2 transcript levels are often correlated.	9916	10051
28348168	We were surprised that our Fgfr2cHet BCs displayed striking phenotypes when germline Fgfr2Δ/+ animals are viable and fertile.	10052	10177
28348168	We therefore looked for subtle epithelial defects in germline-deleted Fgfr2Δ/+ tracheae compared with wild-type siblings, but were unable to find any abnormalities (Fig.	10178	10347
28348168	S5).	10348	10352
28348168	Fgfr2 is haploinsufficient in several organs, including the lacrimal and salivary glands.	10353	10442
28348168	We suggest that in mouse embryos heterozygous for Fgfr2, genetic compensation operates in most tissues.	10443	10546
28348168	However, conditional heterozygous deletion in the adult by-passes such mechanisms.	10547	10629
28348168	This is very similar to recent findings from zebrafish genetics where genetic compensation has been found to operate in germline mutants, but not in acute knockdowns.	10630	10796
28348168	It raises the possibility that many genes that the mouse developmental community assume are uninteresting/redundant based on lack of germline knockout phenotypes do play important roles in development/homeostasis.	10797	11010
28348168	Experiments were approved by local ethical review committees and conducted according to UK Home Office project licenses PPL80/2326 and 70/812.	11011	11153
28348168	Fgfr2fx, Tg(KRT5-CreER), Rosa26R-fGFP, Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(CAG-tdTomato*,-EGFP*)Ees and Fgfr2Δ/+ animals were generated by crossing Fgfr2fx to Zp3-Cre.	11154	11302

28348168	For competition assays, mixed populations of cells were grown to confluence and then imaged every 4 h for 10 days in a Nikon Biostation.	12148	12284
28348168	Alternatively, confluent cultures were scratched and imaged every 2 h for 5 days.	12285	12366
28348168	In vitro experiments were preformed in triplicate.	12367	12417
28348168	Tracheae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 4 h; washed PBS, sucrose protected, embedded in OCT (Optimum Cutting Temperature Compound, Tissue Tek) and sectioned at 6 μm.	12418	12597
28348168	Airway culture inserts were washed in PBS, fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100.	12598	12742

28481876	Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the US.	0	55
28481876	It is estimated 1,658,370 new cancer cases diagnosed and 589,430 cancer deaths in the US in 2014(1, 2).	56	159
28481876	The understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the development of these lethal diseases remains incomplete.	160	269
28481876	Prostate cancer is one of the most diagnosed cancers in men in the US.	270	340
28481876	Over 161,000 new cases of prostate cancer were identified in 2016, accounting for approximately 10% of all new cancer cases.	341	465
28481876	Unfortunately, the disease is not always indolent; about 26,730 men are expected to die from prostate cancer this year(3).	466	588
28481876	Despite the high incidence of prostate cancer, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the aggressive behavior of some prostate cancer cases remain unclear.	589	744
28481876	Identification of the molecular events that trigger the aggressive behavior of prostate cancer is crucial in reducing the mortality of this disease.	745	893
28481876	Comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analyses of human cancers had revealed numerous numerical or mutational, or epigenomic changes in the cancer genome that may drive gene expression alterations in cancers(4–17).	894	1111
28481876	The pattern changes of gene expression and genome abnormalities may provide significant insight into the mechanism of human cancer development.	1112	1255
28481876	However, the relationship between these abnormalities and behavior of cancers remains unclear.	1256	1350
28481876	To gain a clear and new understanding of the roles of these genes in the biology of human cancers, experimental analysis of these genes one at a time is required.	1351	1513
28481876	In this report, we performed meta-analyses of genome-wide copy number analysis on MCM proteins and led to the identification of MCM8, a critical component of DNA replication licensing gene(18–21), amplified or gain in 17 human malignancies.	1514	1754
28481876	Similarly, overexpression of MCM8 was found in a wide variety of human malignancies.	1755	1839
28481876	Over-expression of MCM8 was also identified in prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145 and LNCaP.	1840	1935
28481876	Forced expression in immortalized prostate epithelial cell lines RWPE1 induced transformation, while knocked down of MCM8 induced growth arrest of PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cells.	1936	2111
28481876	It appears that MCM8 amplification and over-expression underlie the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.	2112	2214
28481876	Significant evidence suggests that amplification and overexpression of DNA replication licensing factor have been associated with aggressive human malignancies(22–30).	2215	2382
28481876	One of these DNA replication licensing factors, MCM7, had been well characterized to drive the aggressive behavior in prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer and gastric cancer(23, 25, 31–38).	2383	2624
28481876	To investigate whether other DNA replication licensing factors are also implicated in human cancers, we screened 3 data sets of prostate cancer.	2625	2769
28481876	We found that MCM8, a DNA replication licensing factor involving replication elongation and DNA homologous recombination, were consistently up-regulated in prostate cancer samples in comparison with normal prostate tissues (Table 1).	2770	3003
28481876	To investigate whether MCM8 is also similarly up-regulated in other human malignancies, microarray data from European Bioinformatics Institute of EMBL were screened for MCM8 expression in a variety of human cancers.	3004	3219
28481876	The analyses suggest that MCM8 is over-expressed in a large number of human cancers, including, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, liver cancer, medulloblastoma, and glioblastoma multiforme (Table 1).	3220	3428
28481876	The magnitudes of over-expression range from 2- to 5.2 fold, suggesting a wide significance of MCM8 overexpression in human malignancies.	3429	3566
28481876	To investigate the cause of MCM8 over-expression in prostate cancer, we analyzed 2 prostate cancer copy number data set from University of Pittsburgh and TCGA.	3567	3726
28481876	The results showed that 19 and 8% of prostate cancer genomes have a gain of MCM8 genome copy, respectively.	3727	3834
28481876	To examine whether other human malignancies also have similar gain of MCM8 gene copy number, we analyzed additional large sets of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays on 16 other human malignancies including glioblastoma multiforme, breast cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoma, diffuse large cell lymphoma, thyroid cancer, rectal adenocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia and bladder cancer.	3835	4332
28481876	The gain of MCM8 gene copy is widespread among human malignancies: ranging from 4.2% in thyroid cancer to 79.7% in rectal adenocarcinoma (Table 2).	4333	4480
28481876	In some breast and colon cancer samples, up to 16 copies of MCM8 were found in the genomes of cancer cells, suggesting that the gain of MCM8 was the result of amplification of the genome sequence encoding MCM8 in some of these cancers.	4481	4716
28481876	These analyses suggest that the copy number gain of MCM8 is probably the underlying mechanism of MCM8 overexpression in human malignancies.	4717	4856
28481876	Analysis of prostate cancer data set from TCGA indicates that gain of MCM8 is associated with higher Gleason’s grade (p=0.0007), more advanced pathological stage (p=0.036) and more likely to have lymph node metastasis (p=0.0025).	4857	5086
28481876	The gain of MCM8 is also associated with higher level of residual tumors of lung adenocarcinoma (p=0.002), lymph node metastasis (p=0.03) and higher grades (p=0.000098) of esophageal cancer, more advanced stages (p=0.00025) and more frequent lymph node metastasis (p=0.0017) of colon cancer.	5087	5378
28481876	The gain of MCM8 is also found disproportionately in ovarian cancer (p=0.026) and uterine endometrial carcinoma (p=0.0000024) that were presented as advanced stages of cancer at the time of diagnosis.	5379	5579
28481876	Urothelial carcinoma with a gain of MCM8 also showed a higher level of aggressiveness by displaying frequent lymph node metastasis and recurrence of cancer after treatment (p=0.049).	5580	5762
28481876	These results indicate that gain of MCM8 is likely a marker for the aggressiveness of human cancers.	5763	5863
28481876	To validate the gain of MCM8 in prostate cancer, qPCR was performed using primers corresponding to intron16/exon17 region on 115 prostate samples, including 19 organ donor prostate tissue samples with ages ranging from 15 to 72, three benign prostate tissues adjacent cancer, and 93 prostate cancer samples.	5864	6171
28481876	As shown in figure 1A, the gain of MCM8 was not detected in any of the organ donor prostates and benign prostate tissues adjacent to cancer, while 52% (52/93) of the prostate cancer samples were detected with a gain of MCM8.	6172	6396
28481876	Among those prostate cancer samples from patients that experienced recurrence of the disease after radical prostatectomy, the frequency of gain of MCM8 reached 70.5% (43/49).	6397	6571
28481876	In contrast, the rate of MCM8 gain was only 26.5% (9/34) for prostate cancers that did not reoccur for at least 5 years after the surgery.	6572	6710
28481876	These results indicate a strong association between prostate cancer recurrence and the gain of MCM8 (p<0.0001).	6711	6822
28481876	To visualize the gain of MCM8 in prostate cancer samples, fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed using bacterial artificial chromosome probe corresponding to genome region where MCM8 resides (Figure 1B and C).	6823	7043
28481876	The results indicate MCM8 gain in 40% (8/20) of the samples examined: 83% (5/6) samples from patients who experienced prostate cancer recurrence had MCM8 gain in their cancer genomes, while only 21% (3/14) indolent cancer samples were positive of the gain of MCM8.	7044	7308
28481876	Kaplan-Meir analysis based on the status of MCM8 gain showed that patients with MCM8 gain in their cancer genome had PSA-free survival rate of 33.3%, while patients with no MCM8 gain had the 5-year PSA-free survival rate of 74.5% (figure 1D), suggesting that the gain of MCM8 signals a significantly poorer clinical outcomes (p=7.8 × 10−5) for prostate cancer.	7309	7669
28481876	To examine whether MCM8 protein is over-expressed in prostate cancer samples, 533 prostate samples were examined for MCM8 expression through immunostaining using antibodies specific for MCM8 protein.	7670	7869
28481876	The expression of MCM8 was quantified based on the number of cells positive for MCM8 staining: negative (0), focal positive (0.5), 1–20% cells positive (1), 20–50% cells positive (2), 50–80% cells positive (3) and more than 80% cells positive (4).	7870	8117
28481876	As shown in figure 2A and B, most organ donor prostate cancers are only focally positive for MCM8 protein with an average score of 0.56.	8118	8254
28481876	In contrast, a significant number of prostate cancer samples had the expression of MCM8 in more than 20%, with an average of scores of 1.6.	8255	8394
28481876	The average of MCM8 expression scores for prostate cancer that proved recurrent reached 1.99.	8395	8488
28481876	Higher MCM8 protein expression score is strongly associated with prostate cancers that had cancer recurrence (p=3.5 × 10−15).	8489	8614
28481876	To analyze the impact of MCM8 protein expression on PSA-free survival of prostate cancer, Kaplan-Meir analysis was performed based on MCM8 expression levels.	8615	8772
28481876	As shown in figure 2C, 42.4% patients with MCM8 expression scoring 2 or more survived 5 years without prostate cancer recurrence.	8773	8902
28481876	In contrast, approximately 90% patients with MCM8 scoring less than 2 survived at least 5 years cancer free.	8903	9011
28481876	These results indicate that MCM8 overexpression had a significant negative impact on the prostate cancer prognosis (p=9.25 × 10−13).	9012	9144
28481876	To investigate the biological role of MCM8 over-expression in prostate epithelial cells, RWPE1, the immortalized but non-transformed prostate epithelial cells, were transfected with pCDNA4-MCM8-FLAG.	9145	9344
28481876	Fifteen colonies were screened for inducible expression of MCM8.	9345	9409
28481876	Two clones were selected for further analysis (RM8#2 and RM8#9).	9410	9474
28481876	As shown in figure 3A and B, induced expression of MCM8 in RWPE1 cells resulted in an average of 2.5 fold (p<0.01) increase of S-phase and concomitant 32.6% (p<0.01) decrease of G0/G1 phase cells.	9475	9671
28481876	MCM8 expression increased colony formation by 2.8 fold (p<0.01) and anchorage independent growth by 12.7 fold (p<0.01) of RWPE1 cells (figure 3C and D).	9672	9824
28481876	Most non-transformed cells grow poorly in anchorage-independent growth assays.	9825	9903
28481876	Dramatic improvement of anchorage-independent growth of RWPE1 cells induced by MCM8 clearly indicates that RWPE1 cells were transformed.	9904	10040
28481876	MCM8 appears abundantly expressed in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells, in comparison with RWPE1 (figure 3A).	10041	10143
28481876	To assess the impact of MCM8 overexpression in prostate cancer, prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145 and LNCaP were transfected with pSingle-tts-siMCM8 that expresses a shRNA targeting at MCM8 mRNA upon the treatment of doxycycline (5μg/ml).	10144	10386
28481876	Two clones of each cell lineage were selected for analysis.	10387	10446
28481876	Knocked down of MCM8 in PC3 (73% for M8P#5 and 71% for M8P#7) by shRNA specific for MCM8 reduced S-phase entry by an average of 51% (p<0.01), and reduced colony formation by over 83% (p<0.01) (figure 3C and D).	10447	10657
28481876	These biological changes were accompanied by drops of DNA replication licensing of Cdt1 (average 66.7% for M8P#5 and M8P#7), MCM6 (average 59.2%) and MCM7 (average 78.7%), suggesting that down-regulation of MCM8 have significant negative impact on DNA replication licensing.	10658	10932
28481876	Similar results were also found when DU145 (51% knocked-down for M8D#1 and 75% for M8D#4) and LNCaP (65% for M8L#3 and 63% M8L#5) cells were knocked down with shRNA specific for MCM8: 65% drop (p<0.01) in S-phase cells and 94% drop (p<0.01) in colony formation for DU145, and 44% drop (p<0.01) in S-phase cells and 91% drop (p<0.01) in colony formation for LNCaP cells.	10933	11302
28481876	Over-expression of MCM8 in non-transforming prostate epithelial cells RWPE1 (RM8#2 and RM8#9, average 2.3 fold) resulted in 2.5 fold increase of S-phase entry in average (figure 3A and B).	11303	11491
28481876	These were also accompanied by significant increase of Cdt1 (>5 fold), MCM6 (2.2 fold) and MCM7 (>5 fold) licensing.	11492	11608
28481876	Over-expression of MCM8 is clearly necessary for cancer cell growth and transformation.	11609	11696
28481876	To investigate the impact of MCM8 overexpression on prostate cancer growth metastasis in vivo, M8P#5 and M8D#1cells were xenografted into the subcutaneous regions of severe combined immunodeficiency mice.	11697	11901
28481876	These mice were treated with doxycycline to knock down the expression of MCM8 in these cancer cells.	11902	12002
28481876	As shown in figure 3E–F, mice treated with doxycycline water (5μg/ml) had 74.3% (p<0.01) decrease in tumor volume for M8P#5 cells and 65% (p<0.01) decrease for M8D#1 cells, in comparison with the untreated controls.	12003	12218
28481876	The mice treated with doxycycline water had 93.8% survival rate.	12219	12283
28481876	In contrast, only 31% mice xenografted with tumor cells without treatment survived 6 weeks (p=0.00015).	12284	12387
28481876	These results suggest that MCM8 expression is crucial for cancer growth and aggressiveness.	12388	12479
28481876	To investigate the mechanism of MCM8 mediated cancer growth and transformation, Yeast two-hybrid cDNA library from human prostate was screened for MCM8 interacting protein by pBD-MCM8full that expresses bait domain-MCM8 fusion protein (BD-MCM8).	12480	12725
28481876	Thirty-one colonies were found to grow in most stringent selective medium and positive for β-galactosidase.	12726	12833
28481876	Eleven unique clones were identified.	12834	12871
28481876	One of these clones contains a cDNA encoding cyclin D1 (CCND1).	12872	12935
28481876	To validate these results, pAD-CCND1 and pBD-MCM8 were co-transfected into Yeast AH109 cells.	12936	13029
28481876	Co-transfection of pBD-MCM8 (full length) and pAD-CCND1 showed positive galactosidase activity and grew in most stringent selective medium, while all negative controls were negative, confirming the initial Yeast Two-hybrid screening results (Figure 4A).	13030	13283
28481876	To test the binding between MCM8 and cyclin D1 in vivo, co-immunoprecipitations of MCM8 and cyclin D1 were performed on the protein extracts of PC3 and RWPE1 cells.	13284	13448
28481876	As shown in Figure 4B, co-immunoprecipitation of MCM8 and cyclin D1 was readily apparent.	13449	13538
28481876	To visualize whether MCM8 and cyclin D1 co-localize in the nucleus, double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against MCM8 and cyclin D1 were performed in RWPE1 cells.	13539	13716
28481876	As demonstrated in figure 4C, MCM8 and a significant amount of cyclin D1 were colocalized in the nuclei.	13717	13821
28481876	Similar colocalization results were obtained with PC3 cells (data not shown).	13822	13899
28481876	To validate the interaction between MCM8 and cyclin D1 in vitro, MCM8 coding region was segmented into 4 regions: MCM8N (aa2-204), MCM8M1 (aa205-409), MCM8M2 (aa409-618), MCM8C (aa615-880).	13900	14089
28481876	These cDNA fragments were constructed into pGEX-5X-3 to create GST-MCM8N, GST-MCM8M1, GST-MCM8M2 and GST-MCM8C fusion proteins.	14090	14217
28481876	These constructs were transfected into E.coli strain BL21.	14218	14276
28481876	Each of these fusion proteins was induced to express with Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), purified and assayed for their binding activity with recombinant HisTAG-cyclin D1 purified from bacterial protein extract.	14277	14503
28481876	The results of the binding assays indicate that GST-MCM8M1 (aa408-618) bound with cyclin D1 in the cell-free system (figure 4D and E), while GST-MCM8N, GST-MCM8M2, and GST-MCM8C were negative in the binding assays.	14504	14718
28481876	These results indicate that the cyclin D1 binding motif is located in the region of amino acids 205–409 in MCM8 protein.	14719	14839
28481876	The interaction between MCM8 and cyclin D1 is direct.	14840	14893
28481876	No “bridge protein” is required in their interaction in vitro.	14894	14956
28481876	A series of deletion mutants of GST-MCM8M1 were assayed to identify the motif that is required for interaction with cyclin D1.	14957	15083
28481876	A stretch of 30 amino acid sequence located in 261–290 of MCM8 was found crucial for MCM8 binding with cyclin D1 because the fusion proteins with deletion of this sequence did not bind with cyclin D1, while all proteins containing this sequence bound with cyclin D1 (figure 4D and E).	15084	15368
28481876	Cyclin D1 is a binding protein and co-factor for cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)(39), and plays a crucial role in promoting cell cycle entry to S phase through phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein(40).	15369	15581
28481876	Interestingly, in vitro binding assays indicate that the presence of MCM8 produced a multi-protein complex that includes CDK4, cyclin D1and MCM8 (figure 5A).	15582	15739
28481876	To investigate whether binding of MCM8 with cyclin D1 has an impact on the kinase activity of CDK4, protein kinase assays were performed on recombinant CDK4/cyclin D1 protein with or without MCM8, using recombinant Rb as a substrate.	15740	15973
28481876	As shown in figure 5, the presence of recombinant GST-MCM8 enhanced kinase activity of CDK4 and reduced the Km value by 6.8 fold (455 μM vs. 3100 μM) in comparison with cyclin D1/CDK4 alone.	15974	16164
28481876	These experiments suggest that MCM8 is a cofactor for enhancing the kinase activity of CDK4.	16165	16257
28481876	In contrast, such enhancement of CDK4 kinase activity was abrogated when the cyclin D1 interaction motif was deleted from GST-MCM8 (GST-dMCM8, figure 5B).	16258	16412
28481876	The peptide corresponding to aa261-290 of MCM8 blocked the kinase enhancement effect of MCM8 on CDK4/cyclin D1 complex (figure 5B).	16413	16544
28481876	Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that MCM8 formed a large complex with cyclin D1, CDK4, p21 and p27 in PC3 cells (figure 5C), suggesting complex nature of these interactions.	16545	16725
28481876	To investigate the impact of MCM8 on Rb phosphorylation in vivo, MCM8 mRNA was knocked down by induction MCM8 shRNA with doxycycline in M8P#5 (PC3) and M8D#1 (DU145) cells.	16726	16898
28481876	As shown in figure 6A, a decrease of MCM8 protein (>90% for M8P#5 and 82% for M8D#1) level accompanied by a reduction of Rb phosphorylation in both cell types.	16899	17058
28481876	The in vitro CDK4 kinase activity also showed similar decreases when MCM8 was knocked down in these cell lines (figure 6B).	17059	17182
28481876	These experiments suggest that the presence of MCM8 is essential for Rb phosphorylation.	17183	17271
28481876	To examine whether binding of MCM8 with cyclin D1 is required for CDK4 kinase activation, a mutant MCM8 that contains only 31 amino acids from MCM8 (aa1,261-290) and FLAG-TAG sequence was ligated into pCDNA4 to create pCDNA4-CBM-FLAG (cyclin D1 binding motif-FLAG) to interfere the binding between MCM8 and cyclin D1.	17272	17589
28481876	The mutant was cotransfected with pCDNA6 into PC3 cells.	17590	17646
28481876	Two clones were selected for further analysis.	17647	17693
28481876	As shown in figure 6A, induction of mutant MCM8 effectively decreased the phosphorylation level of Rb, in comparison with uninduced controls.	17694	17835
28481876	Similar decreases were also identified in the in vitro kinase assays (figure 6B), while MCM8 mutant that contains no cyclin D1 binding motif had no impact on Rb phosphorylation (figure 6A–B), DNA replication licensing and cell cycle S-phase entry (figure 3B).	17836	18095
28481876	These analyses support that MCM8/cyclin D1 interaction is crucial for CDK4 kinase activation.	18096	18189
28481876	It appears that DNA replication licensing in vivo is also dependent on MCM8/cyclin D1 interaction.	18190	18288
28481876	Interestingly, over-expression of cyclin D1 partially reversed the inhibitory effect induced by MCM8 knockdown (58–65% for M8P#5 and 41–67% for M8D#1) in cell cycle analysis (figure 6C and D), probably due to forcing more CDK4/cyclin D1 complex formation due to a larger quantity of cyclin D1.	18289	18582
28481876	In addition, copy number analysis of TCGA data suggests that most samples with MCM8 gain contain at least one intact Rb copy (Supplemental Table 1), supporting a clinical significance of MCM8/cyclin D1/CDK4/Rb signaling.	18583	18803
28481876	MCM8 is one of the DNA replication licensing factors participating in DNA replication initiation and elongation(41–43).	18804	18923
28481876	Recent studies suggest that MCM8 is recruited to the DNA repair site to facilitate DNA homologous recombination and double-strand breaks(44, 45).	18924	19069
28481876	Genome instability was identified in mice that are deficient in MCM8(46).	19070	19143
28481876	Mutations of MCM8 resulted in human gonadal failure(47).	19144	19200
28481876	To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that widespread gain and overexpression of MCM8 are present in human malignancies.	19201	19334
28481876	Since the gain of MCM8 is associated with aggressive characteristics of several human cancers, it implies that the gain of MCM8 may play significant roles in driving the cancer metastasis.	19335	19523
28481876	Most aggressive cancer genomes demonstrate extensive chromosome rearrangement, deletion, and amplification of genes critical to cell survival, growth and migration.	19524	19688
28481876	It is conceivable that overexpression of MCM8 may facilitate and exacerbate the process of chromosome rearrangement.	19689	19805
28481876	Cyclin D1/CDK4 complex has been a critical target by many proteins that regulate cell cycle progression, including p27(48, 49), p16(50), p21(51), Hsp90(52), ccdc37(53), PCNA(54), MyoD(55), etc.	19806	19999
28481876	MCM8 probably contains versatile functions beyond DNA replication licensing and repair.	20000	20087
28481876	It is possible that MCM8 serves as one of the assembly factors in building CDK4/cyclin D1 complex since the presence of MCM8 enhanced the recruitment of CDK4/cyclin D1 complex.	20088	20264
28481876	In addition, our analysis showed that MCM8 is crucial in CDK4 activation by significantly lowering the substrate threshold required for CDK4 kinase activation.	20265	20424
28481876	Phosphorylation of Rb correlates with the level of MCM8.	20425	20481
28481876	Indeed, forced expression of MCM8 in cancer cell lines resulted in dramatic increase of cell entry into S phase in non-transformed cells, while knocked down of MCM8 generates growth arrest of cancer cells.	20482	20687
28481876	These results indicate that MCM8 is essential for cell S phase entry.	20688	20757
28481876	Over-expression of MCM8 may produce two consequences: Promoting cell growth through increasing phosphorylation and inactivation of Rb molecule and promoting DNA recombination that produces abnormal chromosome rearrangements and mutations.	20758	20996
28481876	As a result, abnormal expression of MCM8 could be one of the fundamental causes that initiate the carcinogenic process.	20997	21116
28481876	The underlying cause of MCM8 overexpression in human cancers is probably the gain of MCM8 gene copy in the cancer genome.	21117	21238
28481876	For most cases, the increase of copy number of MCM8 appears moderate, estimated 3–4 copies per cancer genome.	21239	21348
28481876	However, in some samples of breast and colon cancers, the copy number reached 16 copies per genome, clearly indicating amplification in the region of MCM8.	21349	21504
28481876	The expression of MCM8 is inhibited during S, G2 and early M phase to prevent additional DNA synthesis(56).	21505	21612
28481876	Terminally differentiated cells do not express replication complex proteins.	21613	21689
28481876	Amplification or gain of MCM8 may weaken the control of its expression.	21690	21761
28481876	The continuing presence of MCM8 throughout the cell cycle may induce improper DNA synthesis that leads to genome instability of cancer cells, in addition to increased recruitment of larger proportion of cell population into the proliferation cycle.	21762	22010
28481876	The association of MCM8 gain with some of the aggressive features of human cancers may indicate the significance of MCM8 in driving the behavior of human cancers.	22011	22173
28481876	Overexpression of MCM8 gene in prostate immortalized epithelial cells inducing marked transformation underlies the important role of this gene in cancer development.	22174	22339
28481876	The significance of the discovery of MCM8 gain and over-expression in human malignancies not only lies at a new insight gained towards understanding the carcinogenic process of human cancers but also at identifying a new base to develop potential therapeutic intervention to treat cancers that over-express MCM8 protein.	22340	22660
28481876	All cell lines, including PC3, Du145, RWPE1, and LNCaP were purchased from American Type Cell Culture (Manassas, VA).	22661	22778
28481876	PC3 cells were cultured with F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).	22779	22888
28481876	DU145 cells were cultured with modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (InVitrogen).	22889	22996
28481876	LNCaP cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.	22997	23079
28481876	RWPE1 cells were cultured with K-SFM supplemented with recombinant human Epidermal Growth Factor (rhEGF) and Bovine Pituitary Extract (BPE).	23080	23220
28481876	The genomes of these cell lines were tested for a short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profile on eight different loci (CSF1PO, D13S317, D16S539, D5S818, D7S820, THO1, TPOX, and vWA) of the genomes by PCR using the primer sets for CSF1PO, D13S317, D16S539, D5S818, D7S820, TH01, TPOX, vWA recommended by ATCC on April 22, 2016 (latest).	23221	23550
28481876	These cell lines were authenticated because the STR profiles of the cell lines perfectly matched those published by ATCC.	23551	23672
28481876	All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), including: Antibodies for MCM6 (sc-55577), MCM7 (sc-9966), MCM8 (sc-47117), Cdt1 (sc-28262), CCND1 (sc-20044), p27 (sc-1641), p21 (sc-6246), CDK4 (sc-136241), Rb (sc-102), pRb (sc-271930) and β-actin (sc-47778).	23673	23968
28481876	Fresh prostate cancer tissues were prepared as described previously(11, 12).	23969	24045
28481876	Tumor samples were microdissected to 70% purity for qPCR analysis.	24046	24112
28481876	Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were used in FISH assays.	24113	24190
28481876	One hundred thirty-three samples including 93 prostate cancers, three benign prostate tissues adjacent to cancer and 19 normal prostate samples from healthy organ donors were examined.	24191	24375
28481876	The construction of microarrays of prostate tissues was previously described(25).	24376	24457
28481876	The procedure of tissue collection, de-identification, and experimental protocols were approved by institutional review board of University of Pittsburgh.	24458	24612
28481876	The similar procedure was previously described[12–14].	24613	24667
28481876	The FISH probe was prepared by combining 7 ml of SpectrumOrange-labeled Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequence containing MCM8 (RP11-1203216, InVitrogen, Inc, Grand Island, NY) /50% formamide with 1 ml of direct-labeled CEP20 SpectrumGreen (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL).	24668	24943
28481876	The cutoff for a gain of MCM8 is an average of at least 2.5 copies per genome (for detailed procedure, please see Ren et al. (25)).	24944	25075
28481876	For quantitative RT-PCR, QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, CA) was used, and the reaction was carried out in an Eppendorf Realplex Mastercycler machine (Thermo-Fisher, Inc Waltham, MA).	25076	25269
28481876	The procedure was similar to those previously described(25).	25270	25330
28481876	The assays were performed with 100 ng genomic DNA for all of the experimental and control samples.	25331	25429
28481876	MCM8 amplification was performed with primers CTATGGCAGTGCTACATTGGG/CCTGTTGCTCATTCCAGAACC for 45 cycles of the following program: 94°C for 10 s, 62°C for 5 s, and 72°C for 10 s. A separate quantification of β-actin DNA copy was also performed in parallel with MCM8 analysis using the following primers TCTTTGCACTTTCTGCATGTCCCC/GTCCATCACGATGCCAGTGGTAC.	25430	25781
28481876	For construction of pBD-MCM8full fusion protein, a mutagenic primer set (5′- TGTGGCCTATAATCATATGAATGGAGAGTATAGAGGC -3′ and 5′- TTCATTTCAAGCAAAGTCGACTCTGCAATAAACCCAGGAGGC- 3′) was used.	25782	25966
28481876	PCR was performed on the cDNA template from the donor prostate (Clontech) using the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 3 min, and a final 3 min extension step at 68 °C.	25967	26190
28481876	The PCR product was restricted with Nde1 and Sal1 (New England Biolabs, MA), gel purified, and ligated into a similarly digested pGBKT7 vector.	26191	26334
28481876	The fusion protein contained 840 amino acids from the MCM8.	26335	26394
28481876	For the construction of pGST-MCM8N, a GST fusion protein, a mutagenic primer set (5′- AGGAATTCCCGGGTCGACAATGGAGAGTATAGAGGC -3′ and 5′- AGTCACGATGCG GCCGCCAAAGGCTCATAGTTGTACAC -3′) was used.	26395	26584
28481876	PCR was performed using these primers under the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 3 min, and a final 10 min extension step at 68 °C.	26585	26773
28481876	The PCR product was then ligated into a pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen).	26774	26852
28481876	A similar strategy was used for constructing pGST-MCM8M1, pGST-MCM8M2 and pGST-MCM8C using the following pair of primers: AGGAATTCCCGGGTCGACACACAGCTCAAGAATGTCAGA/AGTCACGATGCGGCCGCCCGAGTTGACAATGAGTTTAAAC for pGST-MCM8M1, AGGAATTCCCGGGTCGACtCGCTTTGCCCTGTCATTTTTG/AGTCACGATGCGGCCGCCTCTCTGCTTTCCAGCTCTTATTG for pGST-MCM8M2, and AGGAATTCCCGGGTCGACGGAAAGCAGAGAACCATTAGC/AGTCACGATGCGGCCGCCTCTGCAATAAACCCAGGAGGC for pGST-MCM8C.	26853	27272
28481876	The inserts of these plasmids were retrieved with Sal1 and Not1 and were ligated into a similarly restricted pGEX-5x-3 vector.	27273	27399
28481876	A series of deletions, including 5′ or 3′ deletions, of pGST-MCM8M1 were then constructed using the primer sets listed in Table 3.	27400	27530
28481876	The procedures for constructing these mutants are similar to that described for pGST-MCM8N.	27531	27622
28481876	E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with these mutant constructs for induction of recombinant protein expression.	27623	27736
28481876	MCM8 cDNA was obtained by extended long PCR (Roche Applied Science, NJ) using primers (AGAAGCTTCCAGTTGTGAACTAGGAGAGC/AGCTCGAGCATAGTTTGAAGCTGGTAAACTTTTGGGC) on cDNA templates from donor prostate tissue.	27737	27938
28481876	The PCR product was digested with HindIII and XhoI and ligated into a similarly digested pCDNA4-FLAG vector.	27939	28047
28481876	This construct and pCDNA6 were transfected into RWPE1 cells, the immortalized prostate epithelial cell line with low MCM8 expression, using superfect™ kit (InVitrogen, CA).	28048	28220
28481876	The transformed cells were cultured with 100 μg/ml zeocin and 5 μg/ml blasticidin.	28221	28303
28481876	Colonies were selected for MCM8-FLAG expression in the presence of (5 μg/ml) tetracycline.	28304	28394
28481876	To construct the vector that expresses shRNA specific for MCM8, the following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-tcgagctctcaattccaaccttgctcgtgccgaagcacgagcaaggttggaattgagaga-3′/5′-agcttctctcaattccaaccttgctcgtgcttcggcacgagcaaggttggaattgagagc-3′.	28395	28635
28481876	These primers were annealed and ligated into a pSingle-tts-shRNA vector.	28636	28708
28481876	The constructs were then transfected into PC3, LNCaP, and DU145 cells to generate cells that are doxycycline-inducible for the suppression of MCM8 expression.	28709	28867
28481876	The procedure of MCM8 immunoblotting is similar to previously described(25).	28868	28944
28481876	The primary mouse anti-MCM8 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA.	28945	29041
28481876	The MCM8 expression was detected with the ECL system (Amersham Life Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.	29042	29161
28481876	Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin association analyses were performed similarly to those previously described(57).	29162	29279
28481876	The similar procedure was described previously(58–61).	29280	29334
28481876	Briefly, cells were cultured to 40%-50% confluence.	29335	29386
28481876	These cells were synchronized with medium containing no serum for 24 h to G0 phase.	29387	29470
28481876	The cells were then stimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum for 4 h and labeled with 5-Bromo-2-DeoxyUridine (10 μM).	29471	29586
28481876	The cells were then harvested and stained with propidium iodide /tritonX-100.	29587	29664
28481876	BrdU labeling and nuclei were quantified using a FACSCalibur Automated Benchtop Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, MA), and analyzed by WinMDI 2.9 program.	29665	29819
28481876	The clinical features of these cases were tabulated in Table 4.	29820	29883
28481876	The procedure was described previously (62, 63).	29884	29932
28481876	The expression of MCM8 was graded as 0 (0%), 0.5 (focal positive), 1 (<20%), 2 (20–50%), 3 (50–80%) or 4 (>80%) based on % cells positive.	29933	30071
28481876	The scores were the averages of 2 independent observers.	30072	30128
28481876	Power analysis were performed based on the assumption that 75% mice xenografted with M8P#5 and M8D#1 without doxycycline treatment may die in 6 weeks, while mice treated with doxycycline may have a mortality of 27% in the same period.	30129	30363
28481876	Thus, a total of 32 mice (3 weeks old) were used.	30364	30413
28481876	All male mice severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY) were chosen due to the relevance of prostate cancer.	30414	30551
28481876	No randomization was performed due to inbred nature of the SCID mice.	30552	30621
28481876	These mice were subcutaneously implanted at the abdominal flank with ~1 × 107 viable cells.	30622	30713
28481876	The detailed procedure of xenograft tumor monitoring was described previously(25).	30714	30796
28481876	All procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.	30797	30902
28481876	Data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccessMatrix.htm).	30903	31018
28481876	Hg19 CNV (SNP array, BI Genome-wide SNP 6) level 3 tumor sample data were collected for multiple cancer types: BLCA (bladder urothelial carcinoma), BRCA (breast invasive carcinoma), COAD (colon adenocarcinoma), ESCA (esophageal carcinoma), GBM (glioblastoma multiforme), LIHC (liver hepatocellular carcinoma), LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma), LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma), PAAD (pancreatic adenocarcinoma), PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma), LAML (acute myeloid leukemia), OV (ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma), THCA (thyroid carcinoma), UCEC (uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma), SARC (sarcoma), READ (rectum adenocarcinoma), DLBC (lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), HNSC (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma).	31019	31749
28481876	CNV segments overlapped with the MCM8 gene were defined to be the MCM8 related CNVs.	31750	31834
28481876	Fisher’s exact test was applied to test whether amplification (with segment mean equal to or greater than 0.2) or non-amplification (with segment mean smaller than 0.2) status of MCM8 related CNVs was associated with the clinical information.	31835	32077
28481876	Clinical information chosen included: ajcc_pathologic_tumor_stage (Stage I, II VS III, IV), ajcc_metastasis_pathologic_pm (M0 VS M1), lymph_nodes_examined_he_count (0 VS others), tumor_grade (G1, G2 VS others), residual_tumor (R0 VS others), pathologic_N (N0 VS others), pathologic_T (T2 VS higher), clinical_stage (Stage I, II VS others), gleason_score (for PRAD, <=7 VS higher), aggressive (new_tumor_event_dx_indicator is “Yes”, lymph_nodes_examined_he_count is non-zero, lymph_nodes_examined is not 1 VS new_tumor_event_dx_indicator is “No”, lymph_nodes_examined_he_count is non-zero, lymph_nodes_examined is not 0 or 1).	32078	32703
28481876	For lymph_nodes_examined, Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied.	32704	32765
28481876	These association p-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple comparisons.	32766	32865
28481876	The samples were divided into A (red), and B (blue) group and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted.	32866	32970
28481876	Groups were segregated based on MCM8 gain or non-gain status (figure 1) or MCM8 expression score≥2 or <2 status (figure 2) or treated with or without doxycycline (figure 3).	32971	33144
28481876	The p-value by the log-rank test was calculated to indicate the significant level of the difference between these two groups.	33145	33270
28481876	The Yeast competent cell preparation and the procedure of Yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screening were described previously(64).	33271	33399
28481876	Fresh AH109 competent cells (100 μl) were co-transfected with pBD-MCM8full (0.5 μg) and 0.5 μg DNA from prostate Yeast Two-Hybrid cDNA library constructed in pACT2.	33400	33564
28481876	The transformants were plated on the high stringency selection plate (SD-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp).	33565	33658
28481876	The grown colonies were then assayed for β-galactosidase as described previously (64).	33659	33745
28481876	Thirty-one transformants were found positive for β-galactosidase and grown in most stringent selection condition.	33746	33859
28481876	Through restriction enzyme cutting pattern analysis, 11 transformants were found unique.	33860	33948
28481876	One of these transformants was identified as a clone containing cyclin D1 cDNA in frame with the activation domain of GAL4.	33949	34072
28481876	GST-CDK4 was purchased from Abcam, Inc (Cambridge, MA), while GST-CDK4/cyclin D1 was from Signal Chem, Inc (Richmond, Canada).	34073	34199
28481876	For GST protein, E. coli.	34200	34225
28481876	harboring GST or GST-CDK4 were grown overnight in room temperature.	34226	34293
28481876	The recombinant proteins were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 hours.	34294	34359
28481876	GST was purified by glutathione column and diluted to 1 ng/ul with 1X kinase assay buffer provided by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling, Inc, Danvers, MA).	34360	34514
28481876	This was followed by combining 25 μl GST or GST-CDK4 with 1 ng substrate (GST-Rb) with or without 25 ng of cyclin D1, or HisTAG-MCM8, or HisTAG- ΔMCM8del261-290 or 2 ng of HisTAG-MCM8CBM in 1xkinase reaction buffer.	34515	34730
28481876	The solutions were incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.	34731	34783
28481876	The reactions were terminated by adding 25 μl of 2N NaOH stop solution to each reaction well.	34784	34877
28481876	The kinase activities were quantified using the kit and protocols of ADP-Glo™ Kinase Assay from Promega, Inc, Madison, WI.	34878	35000
28481876	For in vitro MCM8/cyclin D1/CDK4 binding assay, the following condition was used: 25 ng of each of HisTAG-MCM8, GST-cyclinD1 and GST-CDK4 produced from E.coli.	35001	35160
28481876	were incubated with 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 12.5 mM β-glycerol phosphate at 37°C for 2 h. The products were then resolved in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.	35161	35363
28687665	Brain development involves extensive migration of neurons to regions forming the gray matter.	0	93
28687665	Inhibitory neurons or interneurons (INs) are a critical and complex population that regulates resulting brain networks.	94	213
28687665	IN precursors in different brain structures can migrate long distances to reach their appropriate final targets.	214	326
28687665	Embryonic IN precursors destined for the olfactory bulb (OB) originate mainly from the lateral ganglionic eminences and migrate long distances to arrive at their final position.	327	504
28687665	Continuously, during adult life, new neurons are added in the granular cell layer (GCL) and periglomerular layer of the OB through the rostral migratory stream (RMS), allowing them to become integrated into the preexisting local olfactory circuitry.	505	754
28687665	This is thought to be important for forming olfactory memories and represents an intensively studied topic.	755	862
28687665	However, the regulation of neurogenesis and migration is not well understood.	863	940
28687665	Cell displacement from regions of production may be an essential step to permit the correct integration and function of these INs.Neuronal migration to the OB is finely tuned by the synergistic action of cell-extrinsic and -intrinsic cues that contribute to the precise targeting of migrating neurons into the right layer of the OB at the correct time.	941	1293
28687665	There, they differentiate into GABAergic INs according to a well-defined sequence of maturation.Among the different cytoskeletal components that are crucial for neuronal migration, microtubules (MTs) are thought to support a wide range of functions, such as growth of the leading process and its dynamic reorientation and coupling of the nucleus with the centrosome during the saltatory movement of neurons (Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015; Kawauchi, 2015).	1294	1749
28687665	In response to extrinsic signals, MTs are extensively remodeled during cell movement.	1750	1835
28687665	MTs are cytoskeletal fibers that are dynamically assembled from heterodimers made up of evolutionarily conserved α- and β-tubulin subunits.	1836	1975
28687665	Despite this high degree of conservation, α- and β-tubulins are each coded by multiple genes, several of which are expressed in migrating neurons (Jaglin and Chelly, 2009; Reiner and Sapir, 2009).	1976	2172
28687665	The study of the specific contribution of each of these tubulin isotypes during migration has so far been challenging, as they exhibit a high degree of homology.	2173	2334
28687665	Indeed, different tubulin isotypes may be required for specialized MT functions in different cells and compartments (Tischfield and Engle, 2010).In recent years, the interest in the functional role of tubulin isotypes has strongly increased, as tubulin genes have been found mutated in human cortical malformations that are part of an emerging heterogeneous family known as the tubulinopathies.	2335	2729
28687665	Alpha–tubulin 1A (TUBA1A) mutations were among the first identified, leading to lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum agenesis, and, in rare cases, perisylvian asymmetrical polymicrogyria.	2730	2938
28687665	Detailed analyses of fetal cases also identified agenesic or dysmorphic OBs.	2939	3015
28687665	Thus, Tuba1a is likely to play a critical role in the formation of several brain areas, and its mutation may change the behavior of MTs to an extent that cannot be compensated for by other α-tubulin isotypes expressed in the same cells.	3016	3252
28687665	Here, we sought to characterize molecular and cellular alterations induced by the S140G mutation of Tuba1a.We investigated a mouse model with a chemically induced Tuba1a missense mutation and report that this protein plays an important role in neuronal migration in the RMS.	3253	3527
28687665	This mouse mutant has hippocampal and subtle cortical defects, but abnormalities in the RMS were never previously recognized.	3528	3653
28687665	Our data show that the heterozygote S140G mutation is sufficient to produce a strong migratory phenotype in mutant mice, despite the fact that several other α-tubulin genes are also expressed in postmitotic neurons in the affected brain region.	3654	3898
28687665	Histological and live-imaging studies using organotypic brain slices revealed a malformed RMS and OB, as well as distinctly altered characteristics of migration.	3899	4060
28687665	Postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) electroporations of the same mutation demonstrated impaired nucleus–centrosome (N–C) coupling, directionality, speed, and branching.	4061	4229
28687665	Using fluorescence imaging and structural-modeling studies, we demonstrate that these alterations are related to functional and structural MT defects.	4230	4380
28687665	Finally, we demonstrate that Tuba8, another α-tubulin isotype previously associated with cortical malformations, has altered function compared with Tuba1a, thus highlighting the specificities of these α-tubulins.	4381	4593
28687665	Our data pinpoint an essential, noncompensated key role of Tuba1a in the RMS, related to tubulin heterodimer structure and to MT integrity, critical in migrating neurons.To evaluate the consequences of the Tuba1a S140G mutation during neuronal migration, the RMS was analyzed in sagittal sections from adult control and Tuba1a-mutant mice.	4594	4933
28687665	In contrast to control mice where the RMS appeared as a thin pathway (Fig.	4934	5008
28687665	1, A and C), we observed a large accumulation of cells within the RMS of Tuba1a-mutant animals (Fig.	5009	5109
28687665	1, B and D).	5110	5122
28687665	The overall organization of the OB was preserved, but its size appeared greatly reduced (Fig.	5123	5216
28687665	1 B).	5217	5222
28687665	In coronal sections, whereas in control mice the RMS remained thin all along the rostral–caudal axis (Fig.	5223	5329
28687665	1 E), in Tuba1a-mutant mice, a cell accumulation was observed in the central part of the RMS (Fig.	5330	5428
28687665	1 F), with a concomitant rostral reduction in the number of cells, clearly visible at the level of the OB.	5429	5535
28687665	Developmental studies in Tuba1a-mutant animals revealed subtle changes in the OB GCL already at embryonic (E16.5; Fig.	5536	5654
28687665	S3, A and B) and early postnatal stages (Fig.	5655	5700
28687665	S3, C and D).	5701	5714
28687665	The RMS develops mainly postnatally (Pencea and Luskin, 2003), and anatomical alterations were clearly visible from P8 onwards (Fig.	5715	5847
28687665	S3, E–J).	5848	5857
28687665	Embryonic cortical IN migration streams from the GEs also showed abnormalities in the mutant, with less INs reaching the dorsal telencephalon and hippocampal primordium (Fig.	5858	6032
28687665	S1, A–G).	6033	6042
28687665	Measuring RMS thickness in the adult revealed a significant increase in size at two different rostrocaudal levels, RMS2 (75.4 ± 7.2 µm in control vs. 350.8 ± 9.8 µm in mutant mice; P < 0.001; Fig.	6043	6239
28687665	1 G) and RMS3 (76.4 ± 12.2 µm in control vs. 269 ± 23.9 µm in mutant mice; P < 0.001; Fig.	6240	6330
28687665	1 G).	6331	6336
28687665	Conversely, the OB surface measured on sagittal sections was smaller in mutant compared with control mice (6.68 ± 0.187 mm2 in control vs. 5.55 ± 0.119 mm2 in mutant mice; P < 0.01; Fig.	6337	6523
28687665	1 H).	6524	6529
28687665	Once they reach the OB, neuronal precursors settle mainly in the GCL.	6530	6599
28687665	We observed a decrease in its surface in mutant mice (3.91 ± 0.147 mm2 in control vs. 2.51 ± 0.126 mm2 in mutant mice; P < 0.001; Fig.	6600	6734
28687665	1 I).	6735	6740
28687665	Together, these data show consistent IN migration defects with a severe accumulation of cells in the Tuba1a-mutant RMS leading to a reduction of OB size related to the GCL in the mutant brain.We further characterized the identity of cells that accumulate in the RMS.	6741	7007
28687665	Staining with the neuronal anti–PSA-NCAM (polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule) antibody revealed a normal thin stream in control mice (Fig.	7008	7156
28687665	2, A–C) but an abundance of PSA-NCAM–positive (PSA-NCAM+) cells in the core of the mutant RMS (Fig.	7157	7256
28687665	2, D–F).	7257	7265
28687665	At higher magnification, PSA-NCAM+ neurons were observed to form chains of cells in the control RMS (Fig.	7266	7371
28687665	2 C, and Fig.	7372	7385
28687665	S3, K–N) but appeared more numerous and less directional in the mutant RMS2 region (Fig.	7386	7474
28687665	2 F) and unchanged in the RMS1 region (Fig.	7475	7518
28687665	S3, K–N).	7519	7528
28687665	Neurons in chains migrate within glial corridors.	7529	7578
28687665	When comparing these glial structures by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining, we observed a corresponding increase in the size of the astrocytic tunnels that surround the clusters of neurons in adult mutant animals (Fig.	7579	7811
28687665	2, G–J).	7812	7820
28687665	Glial defects were less obvious at early postnatal (P8) stages (Fig.	7821	7889
28687665	S2, A–D), despite the neuronal accumulation.	7890	7934
28687665	We estimated the density of GFAP+ glial fibers in the RMS of adult control and mutant mice and observed a significant decrease in the RMS1 region and similar tendencies in RMS2 and RMS3 (Fig.	7935	8126
28687665	S2, E–K).	8127	8136
28687665	Thus, the increase in size of the GFAP+ region is partially compensated by a decrease of fiber density, and larger dispersions of GFAP+ fibers are observed in mutant caudal regions.Furthermore, most cells migrating toward the OB are transiently present in the RMS and do not differentiate along its path (Luskin, 1993; Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994; Jankovski and Sotelo, 1996).	8137	8515
28687665	Whereas migrating neurons in control brains rarely express calretinin, a marker of IN differentiation, many calretinin+ cells were found in the mutant RMS (Fig.	8516	8676
28687665	2, K–M).	8677	8685
28687665	The numbers of calretinin+ cells were quantified at four different rostrocaudal levels (RMS1, RMS2, RMS3, and RMS4; Fig.	8686	8806
28687665	2 N), and a tendency of decreasing densities from RMS1–4 was observed in control brains.	8807	8895
28687665	At the RMS2 level, a significant increase of calretinin+ cells was observed in the Tuba1a mutant (37.33 ± 10.6 cells in control vs. 171.91 ± 24.95 cells in mutant mice; P < 0.001; Fig.	8896	9080
28687665	2 N).	9081	9086
28687665	This suggests that slowed or blocked neurons in the RMS are able to continue an intrinsic program of maturation.To test whether the defect observed in the Tuba1a-mutant RMS is cell autonomous, we electroporated the SVZ of P0–P2 WT mice with a construct expressing either GFP alone or GFP and the Tuba1a protein, with or without the S140G mutation, under the control of the doublecortin (Dcx) promoter (Fig.	9087	9493
28687665	3 G).	9494	9499
28687665	This allowed us to test the expression of WT or mutant α-tubulin in GFP+ migrating neurons.	9500	9591
28687665	The majority of cells electroporated with GFP only or with the WT Tuba1a construct migrated along the RMS and reached the OB (Fig.	9592	9722
28687665	3, A, B, D, and E), indicating no obvious effect of WT Tuba1a overexpression.	9723	9800
28687665	On the contrary, the S140G mutation led to less GFP+ neurons reaching the OB and more retained at the beginning of the RMS (Fig.	9801	9929
28687665	3, C and F).	9930	9942
28687665	Automated counting of GFP+ cells per region (Fig.	9943	9992
28687665	3 H, SVZ, RMS, and OB) showed that those expressing S140G were significantly increased in the SVZ and the RMS and reduced in the OB in comparison with the control constructs (Fig.	9993	10172
28687665	3 H).	10173	10178
28687665	Together, these data show that a cell-autonomous defect of the S140G mutation leads to a phenotype in migrating neurons.	10179	10299
28687665	Glial fibers in early electroporated brains resembled WT (Fig.	10300	10362
28687665	S2, L and M), although glial defects that accumulate over time cannot be excluded in this model.To study more precisely the neuronal migration defects generated by the S140G mutation, WT mice were again electroporated with either Tuba1a WT or S140G-mutant constructs (as no difference was observed between GFP alone and Tuba1a WT-GFP previously).	10363	10709
28687665	We analyzed migration in the RMS 5 d post-electroporation (dpe) by live imaging with a spinning-disk microscope.	10710	10822
28687665	Control Tuba1a GFP+ cells migrated tangentially along the RMS within the normal stream (Fig.	10823	10915
28687665	4, A and C; and Video 1).	10916	10941
28687665	Neurons expressing the S140G mutation migrated less uniformly, no longer parallel and unidirectional within the main stream as in the control (Fig.	10942	11089
28687665	4, B and D; and Video 2).	11090	11115
28687665	In both conditions, individual neurons were numbered and tracked as shown in the displayed sequences (Fig.	11116	11222
28687665	4, A–D).	11223	11231
28687665	The speed of migration as well as directionality and branching were quantified from time-lapse videos.	11232	11334
28687665	First, we quantified mean migration speed by tracking and performing instantaneous speed measurements.	11335	11437
28687665	A significant decrease in the mean speed was observed for S140G-mutant neurons (90.3 ± 2.79 µm/h for control vs. 74.4 ± 2.14 µm/h for mutant; P < 0.001; Fig.	11438	11595
28687665	5 A).	11596	11601
28687665	Similar defects in cortical IN migration speed were also observed in E12.5 GE explant cultures from WT and Tuba1a-mutant brains (Fig.	11602	11735
28687665	S1 G).	11736	11742
28687665	In the RMS, Tuba1a S140G-electroporated neurons showed abnormal directionality (Fig.	11743	11827
28687665	4, C and D).	11828	11840
28687665	This was quantified by plotting each cell according to their angles deviating from the rostral direction, comparing positions at the beginning to the end of the sequence.	11841	12011
28687665	Whereas a high proportion of control neurons (54%) migrate rostral and tangential to the stream (at 270°, rostral; Fig.	12012	12131
28687665	5 B), only 22% of the mutant neurons do this (Fig.	12132	12182
28687665	5 B, P < 0.001).	12183	12199
28687665	Many Tuba1a S140G neurons migrated oblique and perpendicular to the stream and even backward (Fig.	12200	12298
28687665	5 B), confirming the initial observation of the more randomized migration direction in the mutant condition (Video 2).Analysis of WT neuron migration speed distributions revealed a potential bimodal distribution.	12299	12511
28687665	This was assessed using Hartigan’s dip test (P < 0.01) together with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).	12512	12620
28687665	The experimental data fitted with a Gaussian mixture model revealing two Gaussian curves (Fig.	12621	12715
28687665	5 C).	12716	12721
28687665	The threshold between the two classes of migrating neurons was mathematically defined as the intersection between the two curves, occurring at 75.4 µm/h.	12722	12875
28687665	We termed these slow (<75.4 µm/h) and fast (>75.4 µm/h) migrating cells (Fig.	12876	12953
28687665	5 C).	12716	12721
28687665	As speed of migration has been associated with complexity of neuronal branching, individual neurons exhibiting fast and slow speeds were then classified according to four different categories, depending on the number of processes they exhibited during migration (one, two, three, or four processes; Fig.	12960	13263
28687665	5 D).	13264	13269
28687665	Among control neurons, no significant difference in categories was observed between fast and slow migrating neurons (Fig.	13270	13391
28687665	5 E).	13392	13397
28687665	For the mutant, we observed a modest but significant difference within categories 1 (slow migration, 70.3 ± 3.3% of neurons vs. fast migration, 79.3 ± 3.1% of neurons, P < 0.01; Fig.	13398	13580
28687665	5 E) and 2 (slow migration, 25.8 ± 2.6% of neurons vs. fast migration, 18.7 ± 2.9% of neurons, P < 0.05; Fig.	13581	13690
28687665	5 E).	13392	13397
28687665	Indeed, slow mutant neurons are more complex than fast mutant neurons, and mutant neurons, in general, are more complex than control neurons.We also correlated morphology with directionality (unidirectional vs. non-unidirectional).	13697	13928
28687665	Comparing even control migrating neurons between them revealed a significant decrease of category 1 (unidirectional, 83.1 ± 6.2% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 43.1 ± 6.4% of neurons, P < 0.001; Fig.	13929	14132
28687665	5 F) and increase of category 2 (unidirectional, 16.8 ± 6.2% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 41 ± 5.7% of neurons, P < 0.001; Fig.	14133	14266
28687665	5 F) neurons related to non-unidirectionality.	14267	14313
28687665	Hence, less directionality is associated with increased branching complexity.	14314	14391
28687665	Comparatively, in the mutant, the same trends were observed; significantly decreased non-unidirectional category 1 neurons (unidirectional, 67.8 ± 4.9% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 22.1 ± 5.5% of neurons, P < 0.001; Fig.	14392	14618
28687665	5 F) were replaced by higher complexity neurons (category 2: unidirectional, 32.1 ± 4.9% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 47.3 ± 6.2% of neurons, NS; category 3: unidirectional, 0% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 25.2 ± 7% of neurons, P < 0.001; Fig.	14619	14874
28687665	5 F).	14875	14880
28687665	Thus, mutant neurons show increased complexity associated with abnormal directionality.	14881	14968
28687665	Abnormal neuronal complexity and directionality hence strongly contribute to the Tuba1a-mutant RMS phenotype.	14969	15078
28687665	Further analyses (unpublished data) revealed that abnormal new branches can occur either from the soma or from the leading process with no differences between the genotypes.The cyclic repetition of elongation of the leading process, followed by nucleokinesis and retraction of the trailing process, generates a global forward progression of the neuron.	15079	15431
28687665	Nucleokinesis in migrating INs depends strongly on synchronization with forward movement of the centrosome.	15432	15539
28687665	To more precisely track the movement of the centrosome relative to the nucleus (measured from soma position), the distance separating these two organelles was assessed.	15540	15708
28687665	For this, a PACT-mKO1 centrosome targeting vector was coelectroporated with Tuba1a WT and S140G-mutant constructs to label the centrosome with monomeric Kusabira Orange (mKO1) fluorescent protein.	15709	15905
28687665	This allowed visualization of centrosome displacement during the migration cycle.	15906	15987
28687665	Videos showed that, at the beginning of the cycle, the centrosome is very close to the soma and then progressively moves forward with the extension of the leading process (Fig.	15988	16164
28687665	6 A and Video 3).	16165	16182
28687665	To complete neuronal movement, in most cases, the nucleus rejoins the centrosome followed by the advancement of the trailing process.	16183	16316
28687665	Hence, migration is composed of the cyclic repetition of the separation and recoupling of the nucleus and the centrosome (Fig.	16317	16443
28687665	6 B).	16444	16449
28687665	The oscillating cycle time and the distance between the edge of the soma and the centrosome were measured (Fig.	16450	16561
28687665	6 C and Videos 3 and 4).	16562	16586
28687665	The automatized analysis of WT and mutant cells revealed a significant increase in the mean duration of the saltatory cycle (14.1 ± 0.39 min for control vs. 15.9 ± 0.53 min for the S140G-mutant construct; P < 0.01; Fig.	16587	16806
28687665	6 D) and in the maximum distance coupling the nucleus and the centrosome in the S140G-mutant condition (10.3 ± 0.44 µm for control vs. 12.3 ± 0.67 µm for the S140G-mutant construct; P < 0.01; Fig.	16807	17003
28687665	6 E).	17004	17009
28687665	In most WT migrating neurons, a forward recoupling of the nucleus was observed, with only in rare cases a reversal of centrosome movement (Fig.	17010	17153
28687665	6 F and Videos 3 and 4).	17154	17178
28687665	A significant increase of events when the centrosome moved backward to rejoin the nucleus was observed in mutant cells (3.2% for control vs. 11.4% for the S140G-mutant construct; P < 0.05; Fig.	17179	17372
28687665	6 G).	17373	17378
28687665	This observation, as well as the N–C distance, and the increased duration of the saltatory cycle indicate substantial perturbations in somatic regions likely to contribute to abnormal migration speed and directionality in the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition.To identify MT defects potentially contributing to these cell phenotypes, Neuro-2a cells were differentiated and transfected with an end-binding 3 (EB3)–mCherry construct to track the plus ends of MTs during ongoing polymerization.	17379	17866
28687665	MT polymerization dynamics were first monitored in the presence of Tuba1a WT or S140G constructs and then compared with experiments in which Tuba8 WT alone or in the presence of Tuba1a S140G was expressed in these cells.	17867	18087
28687665	We wished to test whether Tuba8 could rescue the effects of the Tuba1a S140G mutation when present in the same cells.We analyzed two parameters: MT polymerization speed and MT straightness (Fig.	18088	18282
28687665	7, A–E; and Videos 5–8).	18283	18307
28687665	Both parameters were measured independently in the soma and in the neuritic processes.	18308	18394
28687665	In the soma, the Tuba1a S140G mutation lead to increased polymerization straightness in comparison with control Tuba1a (Fig.	18395	18519
28687665	7 B and Table S1), whereas polymerization speed was not significantly altered (Fig.	18520	18603
28687665	7, C and E).	18604	18616
28687665	Strikingly, Tuba8 led to an MT behavior that differed from both control and mutant Tuba1a in both the soma and the process, reducing straightness and increasing polymerization speed (Fig.	18617	18804
28687665	7, B–E).	18805	18813
28687665	Similarly, the combination of Tuba8 and Tuba1a S140G led to significantly different MT dynamics compared with Tuba1a S140G alone (Fig.	18814	18948
28687665	7, B–E).	18805	18813
28687665	Indeed, coexpression had a similar effect to Tuba8 overexpression alone.	18958	19030
28687665	Thus, in most conditions tested, Tuba8 overexpression overrides the effects of Tuba1a when it is present in the same cell (Fig.	19031	19158
28687665	7 E).	19159	19164
28687665	These results suggest functional specificities of Tuba1a versus Tuba8 related to their capacities of modulating dynamic parameters during MT polymerization.These data also demonstrate that the Tuba1a S140G mutation has functional consequences on growing MTs.	19165	19423
28687665	The specific effects on straightness might contribute to alterations in N–C coupling, as well as to increased branching.	19424	19544
28687665	These defects are likely to affect the overall efficiency in speed and direction of neuronal migration.We further explored the impact of the mutation on the structure of the tubulin heterodimer by structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations (Fig.	19545	19802
28687665	8, A–E; and Figs.	19803	19820
28687665	S4 and S5).	19821	19832
28687665	In our dynamics simulation, the time-dependent changes in values of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of α- and β-tubulin subunits in WT and mutant dimers indicated that mutant α-tubulin, more so than β-tubulin, undergoes structural changes compared with WT (Fig.	19833	20096
28687665	S4, A and B).	20097	20110
28687665	Root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) calculate the flexibility of different regions in the protein: those that are highly flexible show a larger RMSF value, whereas those that are rigid show a lower RMSF value.	20111	20322
28687665	We observed that the mutant shows slower dynamics in several important structural elements known to be involved in lateral and longitudinal MT contacts along the lattice compared with the WT protein (Fig.	20323	20527
28687665	S4, C and D).	20528	20541
28687665	Thus, the incorporation of mutant tubulin dimers is likely to induce changes in MT dynamics.Simulations further showed that mutant S140G induces a straighter conformation of dimers compared with WT, which adapts a slightly curved conformation in the nonpolymerized state.	20542	20813
28687665	Fig.	5004	5008
28687665	8 A shows the superposition of time-averaged structures of WT (green) and S140G-mutant (red) proteins and shows a deviation between mutant and WT tubulin dimers.	20819	20980
28687665	To further characterize their conformational flexibility, the intradimer angles subtended by the axes of α-core helix H7 and β-core helix H7 were computed.	20981	21136
28687665	The resulting time-dependent angle changes between WT and mutant are shown in Fig.	21137	21219
28687665	8 B.	21220	21224
28687665	The inset shows the probability of computed angular distributions over 25-ns simulations.	21225	21314
28687665	The distribution is nearly Gaussian, showing a peak at an angle of ∼22° for WT and ∼12° for the S140G mutant (P < 0.001).	21315	21436
28687665	The angle values indicate that the S140G mutant restricts the conformational flexibility of the tubulin dimer and favors a straighter conformation compared with WT.We further analyzed the mode of GTP interactions in Tuba1a WT (Fig.	21437	21668
28687665	S5 A) and S140G mutant (Fig.	21669	21697
28687665	S5 B).	21698	21704
28687665	In WT heterodimers, S140, which is close to the GTP-binding site, stabilizes GTP in the active site by forming hydrogen bonds.	21705	21831
28687665	In contrast, in the S140G mutant, the stabilizing interactions with α-GTP are lost, which results in the flipping of GTP in the active site (Fig.	21832	21977
28687665	S5, A–C).	21978	21987
28687665	As a result, some of the native tubulin dimer interactions are lost (Fig.	21988	22061
28687665	S5, A, B, D, and E).	22062	22082
28687665	Determining the effects on the intradimer interface contacts, we demonstrated an alteration of the native contacts for the S140G mutant (Fig.	22083	22224
28687665	S5, D and E), and the total number of intradimer interactions was also increased.	22225	22306
28687665	This could lead to an increase in the overall stability of the mutant tubulin dimer, thus reducing its curvature.	22307	22420
28687665	Indeed, further detailed analysis of the intradimer interface contacts revealed that the S140G mutant forms an additional buried salt-bridge triad between α:N98 and β:R251, as well as β:R162 (Fig.	22421	22617
28687665	8, C–E).	22618	22626
28687665	The strength of this salt–bridge interaction increases the stability and proximity in this region (Fig.	22627	22730
28687665	S5, F and G), indicating that the S140G mutation leads to closer and stronger intradimer interface interactions.Then, we compared the structures of Tuba1a and Tuba8.	22731	22896
28687665	Superposing the models of these α-tubulins showed only slight changes in the core structure (Fig.	22897	22994
28687665	8 F).	22995	23000
28687665	Next, we characterized the distribution of charges in the tubulin models by electrostatic analyses.	23001	23100
28687665	We found unique charge differences between Tuba1a and Tuba8 (Fig.	23101	23166
28687665	8 G) in the H1-S2 loop, which is known to interact laterally with M-loop of the tubulin molecule in the adjacent protofilament (Sui and Downing, 2010).	23167	23318
28687665	Whereas in Tuba1a the electrostatic distribution in the H1-S2 loop complements well with the M loop region because of its positive-charge distribution, in Tuba8 this region shows negative-charge distribution (Fig.	23319	23532
28687665	8 G).	23533	23538
28687665	These electrostatic differences might result in different binding affinities of Tuba1a and Tuba8 within the MT lattice and thus provide the structural basis for the functional specificities observed in MT polymerization studies for Tuba1a and Tuba8.Altogether, our detailed analyses demonstrate for the first time the different functional contributions of specific isoforms of α-tubulin in neuronal cells.	23539	23944
28687665	In particular, our molecular analyses show that mutant Tuba1a affects MT polymerization straightness and heterodimer stability, and the strict regulation of these parameters is clearly important for correct saltatory neuronal migration.To date, studies of Tuba1a-mutant mice focused on organizational defects in different brain structures such as subtle wave-like perturbations in the neocortex, a fractured pyramidal layer in the hippocampus, and abnormalities in the superior colliculus.	23945	24434
28687665	These were attributed to defects in neuronal migration, considering the well-known functions of MTs in this process and the disorganized cortical lamination in human patients carrying TUBA1A mutations.	24435	24636
28687665	However, little was known concerning molecular and cellular mechanisms affected by the expression of mutated TUBA1A.	24637	24753
28687665	In light of potential functional redundancy between different α-tubulin isotypes, it is intriguing that single heterozygous mutations can have a significant effect on MT functions.	24754	24934
28687665	According to expression databases (e.g., http://mouse.brain-map.org/), Tuba1a, Tuba1b, Tuba3a, and Tuba3b are expressed in the adult RMS, whereas Tuba8 is expressed in a subpopulation of cells in the OB.	24935	25138
28687665	These isotypes often only differ by a few amino acids, and little is known about their specific functions.	25139	25245
28687665	Transgenic lines and in situ hybridization for Tuba1a have demonstrated that most neuronal-committed postmitotic precursors along the RMS and in the OB are Tuba1a+ (and Sox2−) from P0 to the adult stage..	25246	25450
28687665	Consistent with developmental studies showing that Tuba1a is expressed in β3-tubulin– and MAP-2–positive neurons, it hence appears that this protein is expressed in most early postmitotic neurons with no exception in the RMS/OB system.Our current study confirms and adds to a previous study that, despite the presence of different α-tubulin proteins, a heterozygote Tuba1a missense mutation in the mouse leads to a robust neuronal migratory defect.	25451	25899
28687665	We also found that Tuba8 overexpression in vitro was able to counteract the effect of the Tuba1a S140G mutation.	25900	26012
28687665	Hence, phenotypes would be expected to be different in coexpressing cells; however, this protein is not expressed in RMS migrating neurons.	26013	26152
28687665	Recent data also show that the Tuba8-knockout mouse model presents no obvious defect in brain development but instead affected spermatogenesis.	26153	26296
28687665	Specific molecular features may be expected for these two proteins, which we confirmed here by structural modeling.It still remains unclear whether the Tuba1a mutant represents a cell-autonomous consequence of Tuba1a S140G in neurons or whether non–cell autonomous defects are also involved.	26297	26588
28687665	The dispersed glial phenotype observed in the adult RMS could either contribute to the neuronal defects or be a consequence of neuronal accumulation in the RMS.	26589	26749
28687665	Previous expression data have shown that Tuba1a is restricted to neuronally committed cells and not expressed in glial cells.	26750	26875
28687665	Nevertheless, adult mutant mice present glial defects in regions where neurons do not accumulate abnormally (i.e., RMS1; Fig.	26876	27001
28687665	S2, E–K).	8127	8136
28687665	The reasons for this are currently unclear, although glial directionality signaling cues such as Slit/Robo may be abnormal, or defects in the overlying corpus callosum and/or oligodendrocyte progenitor migration defects might also contribute to glial abnormalities.	27012	27277
28687665	Further studies are needed to understand whether Tuba1a influences MT regulation in glial cells directly or whether these are influenced by surrounding cells.During neuronal migration, the extension of the leading process needs to be fine tuned, not only to provide directionality to the neurons, but also to constitute an anchor during the displacement of the soma (Solecki, 2012; Kawauchi, 2015).	27278	27676
28687665	Biochemical studies have previously suggested that the S140G mutation leads to a reduction in the ability of the mutated tubulin to incorporate GTP, which is consistent with our modeling data.	27677	27869
28687665	This may result in a declining efficiency of tubulin heterodimer formation or affect the structure of the tubulin dimer as we show here and, consequently, the MT lattice.	27870	28040
28687665	Changed MT dynamics in neuronal cells could be detrimental for the rapid construction and deconstruction of the leading process, as well as for its stabilization, affecting migration.	28041	28224
28687665	Altered MT dynamics could also be the origin of increased neuronal branching observed in Tuba1a S140G-mutant neurons, a phenotype described previously for migrating INs with mutations of different MAPs such as p27Kip1 or Dcx, which also affect dynamics by binding and stabilizing MTs.	28225	28509
28687665	Less stable MTs have been associated with membrane intrusion and emergence of new growth cones, the origins of neuronal processes.	28510	28640
28687665	Excessive branching in mutant neurons appears in both fast and slow migrating populations and indistinctly in both soma and collaterals in unidirectional and non-unidirectional migrating neurons (unpublished data).	28641	28855
28687665	It could be one of the major causes for the lack of directionality, as well as potentially contributing to N–C coupling defects to subsequently reroute the neurons from their main target, the OB.Based on the availability of novel structural data for tubulin within the MT lattice, we have modeled the impact of Tuba1a mutations into the structure of the α/β-tubulin dimer and demonstrated that the mutation straightens the natively curved dimer structure.	28856	29311
28687665	This change in longitudinal curvature will potentially reduce the dynamics of the MT lattice, thus affecting architecture and function of the MT network.	29312	29465
28687665	More stable dimers would also translate into straighter polymerized MTs in cells, which is what we observed with live imaging in differentiated cells.	29466	29616
28687665	It has also been shown recently that more flexible MTs generated by acetylation of lysine 40 of α-tubulin become more resistant to breakage.	29617	29757
28687665	However, MT breakage by severing enzymes such as Spastin and Katanin is a prerequisite for neuronal branching.	29758	29868
28687665	Thus, in the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition, straighter MTs could be more susceptible to mechanical stress, breaking more often, and be at the origin of the excessive branching we observed.The precise and dynamic regulation of N–C coupling is also a fundamental prerequisite for correct neuronal migration.	29869	30174
28687665	Even subtle centrosomal dysfunction can cause massive IN migratory defects between the SVZ and OB.	30175	30273
28687665	Koizumi et al. (2006) also showed abnormal nuclear translocation in the Dcx mouse mutant.	30274	30363
28687665	In the case of the Tuba1a S140G mutation, less curvature of the heterodimer and an increased MT straightness in the soma may contribute to an increased amplitude and augmented duration of N–C separation.	30364	30567
28687665	Thus, less stable straighter MTs could affect the synchronization between nuclear and centrosome movements.	30568	30675
28687665	Although migration for some specific neuronal subtypes and species might not require strict N–C coupling, our results for RMS neurons show that lack of adequate N–C oscillations contribute to their defective movement, characterized by increased pauses and slowed saltatory movements.Our data show direct consequences of the Tuba1a S140G mutation on MT straightness and polymerization, which are likely to account for pathological alterations of neuronal migration in the mouse brain.	30676	31159
28687665	We cannot exclude that the observed phenotypes are not also partially related to secondary consequences of altered MT structure, such as defects in MT-based intracellular vesicle traffic.	31160	31347
28687665	For instance, the Tuba1a mutation could have an effect on the turnover of receptors such as integrins, which are required to interact with the cellular environment, or guidance molecules such as Robo/Slits, netrins/DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), Prokineticin2, S1P1, or SDF1.	31348	31628
28687665	This could potentially explain regional effects in the RMS.	31629	31688
28687665	A possible deleterious cumulative effect of the Tuba1a S140G-mutant protein depending on the age of the neuroblast is also not excluded.	31689	31825
28687665	Moreover, radial migration in the OB might also be affected, although in our experiments we observed no obvious defects in these migrating INs.	31826	31969
28687665	Future studies could also address these questions.In summary, we have demonstrated how variations in an α-tubulin gene mutated in cortical malformations can lead to neuronal migration defects in mice.	31970	32170
28687665	Notably, we identified diverse effects that are related to an underlying conformational defect of the tubulin dimer and which are likely to alter MT curvature, flexibility, and polymerization straightness.	32171	32376
28687665	Also, we reveal for the first time that the tight regulation of MT flexibility might constitute a prerequisite for correct branching and N–C coupling during saltatory neuronal migration, affecting speed and directionality.	32377	32599
28687665	This work hence provides important new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying observed cellular defects.	32600	32711
28687665	Conceptually, our work reveals how variations that generate apparently subtle alterations on the structure of tubulin molecules can potentially alter complex MT behavior in neuronal cells, thus leading to severe pathological conditions.The Tuba1a S140G (Jenna)–mutant mouse line (provided by D. Keays, IMP, Vienna, Austria) has been described previously and is present on the C3H background.	32712	33103
28687665	In brief, this mouse line was originally identified from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) behavioral screen based on a semidominant hyperactive locomotor phenotype.	33104	33266
28687665	For electroporation studies, P0–P2 RjOrl:SWISS mouse pups were obtained from Janvier Labs.	33267	33357

28687665	The sections were analyzed with a brightfield microscope (Provis; Olympus) using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (CoolSNAP CF; Photometrics) with 2× (NA = 0.08) and 4× (NA = 0.13) objectives.	34605	34801
28687665	Minimum contrasts were adjusted using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).	34802	34888
28687665	Immunostaining was performed on floating sections in 24-well plates.	34889	34957

28687665	Stained sections were analyzed with epifluorescence (DM6000; Leica) with the following objectives: 4× (NA = 0.1), 10× (NA = 0.3), 20× (NA = 0.7), and 40× (NA = 1.25) linked with a CoolSNAP EZ CCD camera (Photometrics) controlled by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) or a confocal microscope (SP5; Leica) with a 40× (NA = 1.25–0.75) objective controlled by LAS-AF software (Leica).	35804	36189
28687665	Minimum contrast adjustment was performed using ImageJ software.For Nissl staining experiments, three to seven littermate animals per condition and per stage were studied from E16.5, P0, P8, P21, and adult.	36190	36396
28687665	RMS thickness and OB and GCL surfaces were quantified from three sections per adult animal (five animals per condition).	36397	36517
28687665	All values are given as mean ± SEM, and a Student’s t test was performed.For calretinin staining quantification in the RMS, five control and four Tuba1a S140G-mutant littermate animals were studied; four rostrocaudal levels were selected along the RMS, and three adjacent slices per level were analyzed.	36518	36821
28687665	The RMS was manually delineated with DAPI counterstaining.	36822	36880

28687665	The GFAP+ staining from each region within a region of interest (ROI; 75.8 × 75.8 × 21 µm) was converted to a 3D volume using the Surface module from Imaris software (Bitplane).	37372	37549
28687665	All values are given as the mean of GFAP+ glial fiber volume in cubic micrometers per ROI ± SEM, and a two-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.For embryonic studies on GFP-positive brains, 20-µm serial coronal cryostat sections were prepared from frozen embryonic brains.	37550	37851
28687665	Nine rostrocaudal levels were chosen for GFP analyses covering the lateral GE, medial GE, and caudal GE regions.	37852	37964
28687665	Sections were imaged using a microscope (DM6000; Leica) with the following objectives: 4× (NA = 0.10) and 10× (NA = 0.3) linked to a CCD camera (CoolSNAP EZ; Photometrics) controlled by Metamorph software.	37965	38170
28687665	For E13.5 migration distances, the region of the cortex studied was identified by drawing a horizontal line across the top of the GE.	38171	38304
28687665	The reference distance was a line extended from this position to the apex of the cortex.	38305	38393
28687665	The length of the GFP-positive migratory stream was then measured from the GE to the point where no further migrating neurons could be observed.	38394	38538
28687665	The migration index was calculated from the ratio of this measurement to the reference distance.	38539	38635
28687665	Coronal sections of E15.5 cortices were analyzed in the region of the developing hippocampus.	38636	38729
28687665	Gad67-GFP–positive cells in marginal zone, intermediate zone, SVZ, and ventricular zone migratory streams were observed, and individual cells were counted in a defined ROI (ROI = 300 × 300 µm).P0–P2 RjOrl:SWISS mouse pups were anaesthetized on ice for 3 min before being maintained on a 4°C pad during the injection procedure.	38730	39056
28687665	Mice were injected with the different plasmids directly into the lateral ventricle by transluminescence with an optical fiber (Leica).	39057	39191
28687665	Approximately 2 µl of plasmid solutions at a concentration of 1 µg/µl (in endotoxin-free Tris-EDTA buffer; Qiagen) was injected with a 3.5-in glass-pulled pipette (Drummond) connected to a 15-µl Hamilton syringe.	39192	39404

28687665	Five, 50-ms square-wave pulses of 100 V, with a latency of 950 ms, were given with an electroporator (BTX ECM 830; Harvard Apparatus).	39534	39668
28687665	Reanimated mice were kept warm on a 37°C heated pad and quickly returned to their mother after the procedure.	39669	39778
28687665	Electroporated plasmids were as follows: Dcx-ires (internal ribosomal entry site)-GFP; Dcx-Tuba1a S140G-ires-GFP obtained by subcloning Tuba1a S140G–pET23 (gift from G. Tian, New York University, New York, NY) into the Dcx-ires-GFP vector; Dcx–WT Tuba1a–ires-GFP for control conditions, produced by PCR mutagenesis from Dcx–Tuba1a S140G–ires-GFP; Dcx-Tuba8-ires-GFP obtained after amplification of Tuba8 by PCR from adult mouse brain cDNA using the following primers: 5′-AATTCACTAGATGCATCACCATGAGGGAATGCATATCGGTC-3′ and 5′-GGAGAGGGGCGGATCCTTAAAATTCCTCCCCCTCATTCTC-3′ (the 1.35-kb PCR product was purified and cloned into pDcx-ires-GFP); and the pCAG-PACT-mKO1 vector (PACT domain of Pericentrin protein fused with the fluorescent protein mKO1), a gift from F. Matsuzaki (RIKEN CDB, Kobe, Japan) to track the centrosome.For GFP staining quantification in the OB, four P1 mouse pups electroporated with the GFP construct only, five P1 with the Tuba1a control construct, and five P1 with the Tuba1a S140G-mutant construct were studied; two sections per mouse were selected for all three conditions.	39779	40874
28687665	The SVZ, RMS, and OB were manually delineated with DAPI counterstaining.	40875	40947
28687665	The total number of GFP+ cells in the three regions (SVZ, RMS, and OB) was quantified to avoid cell density variability within each region.	40948	41087
28687665	This unbiased automatic counting was performed with ICY Bioimage Analysis software using the Spot Detector plugin.	41088	41202
28687665	All values are given as a mean of percentage of GFP+ cells per region ± SEM, and a two-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.For neuron migration analysis, 5 dpe, mouse pups were rapidly decapitated, and the brain was extracted.	41203	41459
28687665	150-µm sagittal brain slices were prepared with a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica) in cold HBSS (Life Technologies).	41460	41570
28687665	Organotypic brain slices were mounted on a CM translucent membrane (Millipore) within a glass-bottom dish (Matek).	41571	41685
28687665	Slices were perfused with the following culture medium: 46% MEM and 25% HBSS, supplemented with 25% horse serum, 2% 1 M Hepes, 6 mg/ml d-glucose, and primocin antibiotic (InVivoGen).	41686	41868
28687665	The culture dish was placed within a thermostatic chamber maintained at 37°C.	41869	41946
28687665	Time-lapse imaging was performed using an inverted confocal spinning-disk microscope (DMI4000; Leica) linked with a CCD camera (QuantEM:512c; Photometrics) controlled by Metamorph software.	41947	42136
28687665	Typically, the slices were imaged from 12–24 h with a 20× (NA = 0.4) long-distance objective (Leica), and images were captured every 5 min; each frame in the time-lapse videos was generated from a 20 µm–thick z stack containing three separate images that were compressed into a single frame.For neuronal speed quantification, 140 neurons in both conditions were studied by measuring instantaneous speeds manually with Metamorph software independent of direction.	42137	42599
28687665	All values are given as mean ± SEM, and a Student’s t test was performed.	36518	36591
28687665	To distinguish slow and fast migration, we first performed a Hartigan’s dip test, confirming that the frequency distribution of migration speeds was not unimodal.	42674	42836
28687665	Then, using the AIC, we showed that the best fitting model for the frequency distribution is bimodal (AIC = 1,376.8 for a bimodal distribution).	42837	42981
28687665	The threshold between low- and high-speed migration was defined mathematically as the intersection of the two Gaussian distributions fitting the frequency distributions of instantaneous speeds.	42982	43175
28687665	Migration was correlated with the number of processes exhibited by the neuron.	43176	43254
28687665	Instantaneous speeds, grouped according to fast (>75.48 µm/h) and slow (<75.48 µm/h) migration, were classified according to the four categories of morphology (Fig.	43255	43419
28687665	5 D): category 1, one process; category 2, two processes; category 3, three processes; and category 4, four processes.	43420	43538
28687665	A total of 90 neurons were studied for each condition from three independent experiments.	43539	43628
28687665	All values are given as a percentage of slow and fast migrating neurons ± SEM represented in these four categories for both control and Tuba1a S140G-mutant constructs.	43629	43796
28687665	A two-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.GE explant cultures were performed as previously described.	43797	43928
28687665	Time-lapse imaging was performed using an inverted confocal spinning-disk microscope (DMI4000) linked with a CCD camera (QuantEM:512c) controlled by Metamorph software for 24 h with a 20× long distance objective (Leica), and images were captured every 5 min.	43929	44187
28687665	Neuronal speed quantifications were performed by automated tracking of cell bodies using the Imaris image analysis software.	44188	44312
28687665	A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare WT and mutant means.For RMS migratory directionality quantification, each cell was plotted according to the angle formed between the beginning and end of the migratory sequence (from 0 to 360° with ranges of 30° and 0°/360° corresponding to dorsal, 90° to caudal, 180° to ventral, and 270° to rostral).	44313	44655
28687665	A total of 90 neurons were studied for each condition from three independent experiments.	43539	43628
28687665	All values are given as a percentage represented as a polar graph, and a χ2 test was performed.For morphology directionality–related quantifications, we manually correlated each migratory step with the number of processes exhibited by the neuron and the type of migration (unidirectional, i.e., parallel to the main migratory stream, or non-unidirectional migration, i.e., not parallel to the RMS and perpendicular to the stream or reversing and switching direction) according to the four categories of morphology described in the first paragraph of this section.	44746	45309
28687665	A total of 100 neurons were studied for each condition from three independent experiments.	45310	45400
28687665	All values are given as a percentage of unidirectional or non-unidirectional migrating neurons ± SEM represented in these four categories for both control and Tuba1a S140G-mutant constructs.	45401	45591
28687665	A two-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.For N–C coupling quantification, we measured every 5 min (time separating two acquisitions) the distance that separated the front part of the nucleus (GFP+ soma used as the limit for delineating the nucleus) from the centrosome (stained with PACT-mKO1).	45592	45917
28687665	Over time, these distances vary and can be represented as oscillations, as at the beginning of the saltatory cycle, the distance is minimal but becomes maximal when the centrosome moves forward in the leading process and then becomes minimal again when the nucleus rejoins the centrosome.	45918	46206
28687665	Oscillations were studied using an automated analysis of cycles in Matlab.	46207	46281
28687665	In brief, the variation of distance (Δd) between the centrosome and nucleus was computed for each time and categorized between increasing (Δd > 3 µm), unchanged (−3 µm < Δd < 3 µm), and decreasing (Δd < −3 µm) distance.	46282	46501
28687665	A cycle was determined as a succession of increasing and decreasing distances.	46502	46580
28687665	Cycles could be interrupted by periods of unchanged distance as long as these were consecutive.	46581	46676
28687665	For each cycle, its duration and its amplitude (maximum distance to minimum distance) were subsequently retrieved.	46677	46791
28687665	A total of 93 neurons were studied for the control condition and 79 neurons for the S140G-mutant condition from three independent experiments.	46792	46934
28687665	All values are given as mean ± SEM, and a Student’s t test was performed.To quantify the specific movement of the centrosome according to the migratory steps, we manually correlated all the cases when the nucleus joined the centrosome (= forward population) or on the contrary when the centrosome moved back to rejoin the nucleus (= backward population).	46935	47289
28687665	A total of 30 neurons (94 cycles) were studied for the control condition and 40 neurons (158 cycles) for the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition from three independent experiments.	47290	47464
28687665	All values are given as a percentage of neurons in these two classes (forward or backward) in both conditions, and a Fisher test was used.To image the polymerization dynamics of MTs, we cultivated Neuro-2a cell lines (ATTC) with DMEM + 10% FCS (Life Technologies) directly on glass-bottom dishes (Ibidi Biosciences).	47465	47781
28687665	2 d before transfection, cells were cultivated in the same medium but deprived of serum to differentiate the cells.	47782	47897
28687665	Differentiated cells were recognized by the growth of processes.	47898	47962
28687665	Then, cells were transfected with a normalized amount of total plasmids (3 µg) of Dcx–WT Tuba1a–ires-GFP, Dcx–Tuba1a S140G–ires-GFP, or Dcx–WT Tuba8–ires-GFP or Dcx–Tuba1a S140G–ires-GFP and Tuba8-ires-GFP together with EB3-mCherry vector (a gift from A. Andrieux, Institut des Neurosciences, Grenoble, France) using ExGen500 reagent (Euromedex) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.	47963	48356
28687665	24 h later, EB3-mCherry time-lapse imaging was performed using an inverted confocal spinning-disk microscope (DMI4000) with a 63× objective (NA = 1.4) linked with a CCD camera (QuantEM:512c;) controlled by Metamorph software for 4 min, and each frame in the time-lapse video was generated from a 0.6 µm–thick z stack containing three separate images taken every second that were compressed into a single frame.For the MT polymerization quantification, the Track module from Imaris software was used to detect automatically the EB3-mCherry+ spots and track them over time.	48357	48928
28687665	Different parameters were extracted, such as the speed of EB3-mCherry spots (by measuring the instantaneous speed of the spot) and the straightness of the EB3-mCherry polymerization (which is the total displacement of the spot divided by the length of the trajectory).	48929	49197
28687665	For the studies in the soma, a total of 8,253 spots were tracked for the control condition, 8,933 spots for the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition, 8,450 spots for the Tuba8 condition, and 9,182 spots for the Tuba1a S140G + Tuba8 condition.	49198	49433
28687665	For the studies in the processes, a total of 2,185 spots were tracked for the control condition, 1,450 spots for the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition, 2,242 spots for the Tuba8 condition, and 3,065 spots for the Tuba1a S140G + Tuba8 condition.	49434	49674
28687665	All the quantifications were performed from three independent transfection experiments.	49675	49762
28687665	For both the polymerization speed and the polymerization straightness, all values are given as mean ± SEM in the two cellular compartments (soma and processes), and a one-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.The atomic coordinates for the WT tubulin dimer were obtained from the crystal structure of tubulin in the Protein Data Bank.	49763	50125
28687665	The coordinates for missing residues in α-tubulin (42–44) were constructed using the Pymol software package (Schrödinger).	50126	50248
28687665	The hydrogens for heavy atoms were added by the leap program in the AmberTools13 package.	50249	50338
28687665	Added hydrogens were energy minimized for 2,000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm.	50339	50430
28687665	The partial atomic charges for GTP were obtained via quantum electronic structure calculations using the Gaussian 09 program (Gaussian Inc.) with the 6–31+G* basis set with the Hartree-Fock geometry optimization procedure.	50431	50653
28687665	The atom-centered restrained electrostatic potential charges were determined by fitting the electrostatic potentials obtained from the calculated wave functions.	50654	50815
28687665	The missing interaction parameters in the nucleotide were generated using the antechamber module in AmberTools.After relaxing the added atoms in the gas phase, the structure was solvated in a cubic periodic box of explicit 3-site TIP3P water molecules extending 12 Å outside the protein on all sides.	50816	51116
28687665	The system was neutralized, and 150 mM KCl was used to maintain the ionic strength.	51117	51200
28687665	Particle-Mesh Ewald sum with a 10-Å cutoff was used to treat the long-range electrostatics.	51201	51292
28687665	The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain the bond lengths between heavy atoms and hydrogens.	51293	51386
28687665	Then, the system was equilibrated for 10 ns in the NPT ensemble with a simulation time step of 2 fs and further simulated to generate 25-ns trajectory data for WT.	51387	51550
28687665	In the equilibrated structure of the WT tubulin dimer, the S140G mutation was introduced in the α-tubulin, and the mutant tubulin was further equilibrated for 10 ns following the same procedure as described for WT.	51551	51765
28687665	Subsequently, a simulation run of 25 ns was generated for the S140G-mutant protein.	51766	51849
28687665	Both WT and mutant simulations were performed using the NAMD 2.10 package with an AMBERFF99SB force field.	51850	51956
28687665	The data were saved at an interval of 2 ps for analyses.To compare the overall structural variations during WT and mutant simulations, RMSD for the backbone atoms for WT and mutant were calculated.	51957	52154
28687665	RMSD values were calculated for each frame along the entire trajectory as a function of time with respect to the respective starting structure of the WT and mutant simulation.	52155	52330
28687665	The Cα RMSF was calculated to detect the mean fluctuations of each residue during simulations.	52331	52425
28687665	RMSF calculates the movement of each Cα around its mean position, indicating highly flexible regions with larger RMSF values and rigid regions with lower RMSF values.To characterize the conformational flexibility of the tubulin dimer in WT and mutant simulations, the intradimer angle subtended by the axes of α-core helix H7 and β-core helix H7 was calculated along the respective trajectories.	52426	52821
28687665	The vector drawn along the α:H7 was termed as A^, and the vector drawn along β:H7 was termed as  B^.	52822	52922
28687665	The intersection of the two vectors represents the intradimer bending angle of the tubulin dimer.	52923	53020
28687665	We selected this angle because a relative translational motion was noted between α:H7 and β:H7 during simulations.	53021	53135
28687665	The intradimer bending angle in the tubulin dimer was computed as Θ=cos−1A^.B^/A^B^.The amino acid sequences of Tuba1a and Tuba8 were retrieved from the UniProtKB database (accession nos.	53136	53323

28687665	The structural superposition and structure-based sequence alignment were performed using University of California, San Francisco chimera software.The electrostatic analysis of Tuba1a and Tuba8 was calculated using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation implemented in the ABPS program.	53550	53827
28687665	The structures were assigned the correct protonation state of residues using PROPKA, and the PQR files were generated using the PDB2PQR server.	53828	53971
28687665	Electrostatic calculations were performed using the following parameters: ionic strength of 150 mM, ionic radius 1.5 Å, dielectric constant for the protein interior 1, and dielectric constant in water 80.Fig.	53972	54180

29045486	Thiamine deficiency (TD) may occur in numerous conditions such as cancer and diabetes, or following bariatric surgery.	0	118
29045486	Additionally, it may occur in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, although it is most prevalent in chronic alcoholics [2–5].	119	280
29045486	Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS) is a life-threatening consequence of TD occurring in up to 12.5% of chronic alcoholics.	281	402
29045486	It is characterized by memory loss, motor dysfunction and ocular disturbances resulting from focal damage in the thalamus and mammillary bodies.	403	547
29045486	Mechanistically, TD in alcoholism is multi-factorial involving poor nutrition, impaired coenzyme activation, and reduced intestinal absorption and renal transport [7–9].	548	717
29045486	It is estimated that ~30–80% of alcoholics have low circulating thiamine.	718	791
29045486	Although acute TD symptoms can be successfully treated by thiamine administration, untreated TD leads to irreversible lesions that are unresponsive to treatment.	792	953
29045486	A central feature in TD-induced neurological damage is severe deficits in cerebral metabolism through impairment of thiamine dependent enzymes [12, 13].	954	1106
29045486	The resulting metabolic disruption leads to oxidative stress, inflammation, excitotoxicity, blood brain barrier dysfunction, cytotoxic edema, and apoptotic cell death [12, 14, 15].	1107	1287
29045486	Many effects of TD-induced metabolic disruption occur in astrocytes [16, 17].	1288	1365
29045486	TD disrupts neuron-astrocyte metabolic trafficking and induces focal lactic acidosis that further contributes to neurological damage.	1366	1499
29045486	Additionally, astrocyte-specific morphological changes are an early marker of TD-induced damage [18, 19].	1500	1605
29045486	Since astrocytes are essential to maintenance of neuronal energy and metabolism, astrocyte dysfunction may contribute to TD-induced neurological injury.	1606	1758
29045486	However, the fundamental elements that initiate cell death as a consequence of TD are unresolved.	1759	1856
29045486	Recently, we have demonstrated that TD stabilizes Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) in the absence of ischemic stress.	1857	1978
29045486	HIF-1α is a stress response transcription factor that regulates expression of genes with pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and pro-survival functions.	1979	2127
29045486	The consequences of gene regulation by HIF-1α have been extensively investigated in ischemic stroke [22, 23].	2128	2237
29045486	Whether cells undergo apoptotic cell death or metabolic adaptation following ischemia is determined by both the severity of the insult and the cell type.	2238	2391
29045486	In neuron/astrocyte co-cultures exposed to hypoxia, HIF-1α expression mediated pro-survival responses in neurons, but pro-apoptotic responses in astrocytes.	2392	2548
29045486	Acute neuronal HIF-1α signaling promotes survival through metabolic reprogramming, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis through expression of genes such as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [24–27].	2549	2817
29045486	Pro-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and BCL2/Adenovirus E1B 19kDa Interacting Protein 3 Like (Nix) are also established targets of HIF-1α and have been shown to induce apoptosis in an ischemic model [28, 29].	2818	3086
29045486	Other damaging responses such as inflammation have also been linked to chronic HIF-1α activation through direct up-regulation of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP1) [30–32].	3087	3266
29045486	Comparable histological lesions in patients with hypoxia/ischemia and TD have been described in the thalamus and mammillary bodies, suggesting a congruency between the cellular response to hypoxic and TD stress [33, 34].	3267	3487
29045486	Thus, stabilization and persistence of HIF-1α activity during TD may be a critical underlying initiator of apoptosis in astrocytes.	3488	3619
29045486	It is unclear whether HIF-1α transcriptional activation during TD may contribute to neurological damage, as previously described in ischemia.	3620	3761
29045486	Therefore, the purpose of this work was to determine whether HIF-1α activation during TD in mouse primary astrocytes may contribute to cell death through activation of pro-apoptotic proteins.	3762	3953
29045486	The animal protocol was approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and was compliant with Guidelines for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health.	3954	4177
29045486	Primary mouse astrocyte cultures were prepared from both male and female C57BL/6 mouse pups (Taconic Biosciences, Hudson, NY) as described by Schildge et al. with slight modifications.	4178	4362
29045486	Within 48h of birth, pups were euthanized and cortices were dissected, minced and digested with 0.25% trypsin and 2.21mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Corning, Corning, NY) for 30min at 37°C.	4363	4564
29045486	Trypsin was inactivated with 5mL RPMI 1640 media (Corning), and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 300xg for 5min at 4°C in an Allegra X-22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).	4565	4749
29045486	The supernatant was discarded, and pelleted cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 media and subsequently filtered through a 100μm cell strainer (Greiner Bio-one, Monroe, NC).	4750	4922
29045486	The filtered suspension was centrifuged at 300xg for 5min at 4°C in an Allegra X-22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter).	4923	5037
29045486	Supernatant was discarded and the pelleted cells were resuspended in 5mL RPMI 1640 media and subsequently filtered through a 40μm cell strainer (Greiner Bio-one).	5038	5200
29045486	The filtered cell suspension was then seeded into RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Seradigm, Radnor, PA) and 0.1% gentamycin (Corning, Corning, NY) in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, and 21% O2 at a density of ~3 brains in a T75 flask (Greiner Bio-one) with the media being refreshed after 24h.	5201	5523
29045486	Mixed glia were maintained until they grew to full confluency, and then cultures were enriched for astrocytes by shaking at 180rpm in a Incubating Orbital Shaker (VWR, Radnor, PA) for 30min at 37°C followed by a media change and subsequent shaking for 6h at 260rpm.	5524	5789
29045486	Following enrichment, cells were passaged into a T175 flask until they reached confluency, and were subsequently passaged for treatments.	5790	5927
29045486	Characterization of glial and astrocyte cultures was performed by both Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry (S1 Fig).	5928	6054
29045486	Custom formulated thiamine deficient RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), contains ~10nm thiamine (Data not shown).	6055	6197
29045486	Therefore, this was not sufficient to achieve complete thiamine deficient conditions.	6198	6283
29045486	While the use of dialyzed FBS may remove the majority of thiamine, other essential nutrients and growth factors are also lost.	6284	6410
29045486	Therefore, thiamine deficiency was achieved using a thiamine pyrophosphate kinase-1 inhibitor, pyrithiamine hydrobromide (PT) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) which inhibits the conversion of thiamine to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate.	6411	6653
29045486	While chemicals such as amprolium which inhibit thiamine transport may also induce thiamine deficiency, these have no effect on intracellular thiamine/thiamine pyrophosphate pools, which take long treatment periods to diminish.	6654	6881
29045486	Pyrithiamine treatment is commonly used to reproducibly induce a series of pathological changes both in vivo and in vitro.	6882	7004
29045486	Additionally, pathological changes associated with TD in primary astrocytes were observed following treatment with 10μM pyrithiamine, the concentration used in this study [39–41].	7005	7184
29045486	Confluent astrocyte-enriched cultures were seeded into custom formulated thiamine deficient RPMI 1640 media (United States Biological, Salem, MA) and refreshed with 10μM PT containing media every 48h during treatments up to 14 days.	7185	7417
29045486	For thiamine repletion experiments, primary astrocytes were treated with 10μM pyrithiamine for 4d (PT).	7418	7521
29045486	Subsequently, 3μM thiamine- containing RPMI 1640 was repleted into the culturing media for up to 5d (5R) without the presence of PT.	7522	7654
29045486	To pharmacologically inhibit HIF-1α expression, 10μM YC1 was supplemented into PT containing media after a loading dose of 20μM for 24h.	7655	7791
29045486	YC1 +/- pyrithiamine treatments lasted a total of 4d.	7792	7845
29045486	A loading dose of YC1 was utilized prior to induction of thiamine deficiency to circumvent HIF-1α induction during simultaneous treatment with PT.	7846	7992
29045486	Cisplatin treatment was used to demonstrate that the effects of YC1 treatment were specific to the inhibition of HIF-1α, without corresponding non-specific effects on apoptotic cell death.	7993	8181
29045486	Primary astrocytes were treated with 30μM cisplatin +/- 10μM YC1 for 48h, following a loading dose of 20μM YC1 for 24h.	8182	8301
29045486	In each treatment condition, control cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 3μM thiamine for the duration of treatment.	8302	8434
29045486	Additionally, treatment start times were staggered such that each treatment period concluded at the same time.	8435	8545
29045486	Therefore, all dishes were maintained equally in culture to control for changes in cell confluency and media conditions.	8546	8666
29045486	Gene expression was assessed using quantitative real time PCR analysis.	8667	8738
29045486	RNA was extracted using the E.Z.N.A.	8739	8775
29045486	Total RNA Kit I (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.	8776	8864
29045486	RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop 2000c Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and 1μg was reverse transcribed to cDNA with the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta BioSciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions.	8865	9085
29045486	Changes in gene expression of the established HIF-1α target genes LDHA, GLUT1, and VEGF, as well as the pro-apoptotic genes BNIP3, Nix, Noxa and MCP1 were evaluated by qRT-PCR using a LightCycler 480 II (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).	9086	9331
29045486	Gene specific primers were designed using the Roche Universal Probe Library assay design center to correspond with a specific hydrolysis probe labeled at the 5’ end with fluorescein (FAM) listed in Table 1.	9332	9538
29045486	Actin was used as a housekeeping gene, with probe and primer from the Roche Applied Science reference assay kit.	9539	9651
29045486	Changes in gene expression were calculated using 2-ΔΔCt method, with an assumed efficiency of 2 for relative quantification.	9652	9776
29045486	Changes are expressed as the fold change relative to untreated samples.	9777	9848
29045486	To assess changes in protein expression and localization, primary astrocytes were harvested as whole cell lysates (WCL) or nuclear lysates for Western blot analysis as previously described.	9849	10038
29045486	WCL (50μg) and nuclear lysates (25μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.	10039	10187
29045486	Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in tris buffered saline-tween 20 (TBS-T) for 3 h at 4°C.	10188	10286

29045486	Blots were washed 3 times each for 10 min in TBS-T, and then immunoblotted with 1:20,000 goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA), 1:10,000 (BNIP3, Nix, Noxa) or 1:20,000 goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) for 1 h at room temperature.	11234	11583

29045486	Induction of thiamine deficiency in mouse primary astrocytes resulted in an ~3 fold increase in total HIF-1α expression as early as 24h of pyrithiamine (PT) treatment, which was maintained with minimal fluctuation in expression for up to 14 days (Fig 1A and 1B).	15985	16247
29045486	Additionally, nuclear localization of HIF-1α increased as early as 8h after exposure to PT and was also maintained up to 14 days (Fig 1C and 1D).	16248	16393
29045486	In contrast, no change in total protein or nuclear localization of HIF-2α was observed (Fig 1A–1D) In these same conditions, mRNA levels of the established HIF-1α target genes LDHA, GLUT1 was significantly increased ~2 fold (Fig 1E).	16394	16627
29045486	Transcript levels of the target gene VEGF increased ~10 fold by day 14 (Fig 1E).	16628	16708
29045486	There was no observed change in total p53 expression (Fig 2A and 2C) or nuclear localization (Fig 2B and 2D) after 14 days of PT treatment.	16709	16848
29045486	Protein expression of the pro-apoptotic p53 target gene Bax was not altered, while Bid expression significantly increased ~2.5 fold (Fig 2A and 2C).	16849	16997
29045486	In contrast, Fig 3 demonstrates that both protein and mRNA expression of various pro-apoptotic HIF-1α target genes increased following PT treatment.	16998	17146
29045486	Specifically, protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine MCP1 increased ~3 fold, while pro-apoptotic BNIP3 protein levels increased up to 8 fold (Fig 3A and 3B).	17147	17317
29045486	Similarly, protein levels of Nix increased up to 8 fold, while Noxa protein levels increased ~6 fold after 14 days of PT treatment (Fig 3A and 3B).	17318	17465
29045486	Fig 3C demonstrates a significant increase in mRNA levels of MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa as compared to the untreated control.	17466	17590
29045486	To achieve thiamine repletion following TD, astrocytes dosed with 10μM PT for 4 days were switched to normal (control) RPMI media containing 3μM thiamine (no PT) for up to an additional 5 days.	17591	17784
29045486	Within 1 day of thiamine repletion following PT treatment a significant reduction in HIF-1α protein levels was observed that returned to control levels by day 5 of repletion (Fig 4A and 4B).	17785	17975
29045486	The HIF-1α target gene LDHA was induced by thiamine deficiency, and subsequently reduced following thiamine repletion, although the protein did not return to control levels (Fig 4B).	17976	18158
29045486	Furthermore, the expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1α target genes was reduced following thiamine repletion.	18159	18265
29045486	Noxa protein levels were significantly reduced following 24 h thiamine repletion, while BNIP3 protein was returned to control levels after 5 days repletion (Fig 4B).	18266	18431
29045486	Although MCP1 and Nix protein levels were significantly reduced after thiamine repletion, they did not return completely to control levels after 5 days of repletion (Fig 4B).	18432	18606
29045486	Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1α was achieved using YC1, which reduces HIF-1α protein stabilization and transcriptional activity [43, 44].	18607	18749
29045486	After pre-treatment of astrocytes with a loading dose of 20μM YC1 for 24 h, 10μM YC1 was then supplemented into control (3μM thiamine) or PT containing media for a total of 4 days.	18750	18930
29045486	In samples supplemented with 3μM thiamine and YC1, there was no significant change in expression of the proteins evaluated as compared to control samples (Fig 5A and 5B).	18931	19101
29045486	In contrast, YC1 treatment significantly suppressed HIF-1α stabilization and attenuated protein expression of the HIF-1α target gene LDHA during PT treatment (Fig 5A and 5B).	19102	19276
29045486	Additionally, YC1 was sufficient to minimize expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1α target genes during PT treatment (Fig 5).	19277	19398
29045486	A significant reduction in the protein expression of MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa was observed with PT and YC1 treatment compared to PT treatment alone (Fig 5A and 5B).	19399	19564
29045486	Thiamine deficiency induced expression of pro-apoptotic proteins that was inhibited by YC1 treatment and reduced following thiamine repletion (Fig 6).	19565	19715
29045486	Cleaved Caspase-3 levels were significantly increased ~4 fold with PT treatment compared to the untreated control, while cleaved Parp expression was significantly increased ~3 fold (Fig 6A and 6B).	19716	19913
29045486	Although Parp and Caspase-3 cleavage was significantly reduced, protein expression did not return to control levels following 5d of thiamine repletion (Fig 6C and 6D).	19914	20081
29045486	Inhibition of HIF-1α activation through YC1 treatment was sufficient to block the cleavage of Caspase-3 and Parp (Fig 6E and 6F).	20082	20211
29045486	DNA fragmentation was determined by a TUNEL assay where hydroxyl ends of damaged DNA were specifically labeled with dUTP.	20212	20333
29045486	Fig 7A depicts representative plots generated by flow cytometry of all treatment groups subjected to the TUNEL assay.	20334	20451
29045486	A shift of the cell population to the right side of the plot represents increased TUNEL staining, and therefore increased DNA fragmentation as seen in the PT treated group (Fig 7A).	20452	20633
29045486	Quantification of TUNEL stained cells from each independent flow cytometry replicate reveals a statistically significant increase in DNA fragmentation in the PT treated group relative to control or YC1 treated cells (Fig 7B).	20634	20859
29045486	Thiamine repletion for 2 days reduced DNA damage relative to PT treatment, although the change was not statistically significant (Fig 7B).	20860	20998
29045486	Immunofluorescence images of the astrocytes subjected to the TUNEL assay visually confirm DNA fragmentation in PT treated cells, which was not observed following YC1 treatment or thiamine repletion (Fig 7C).	20999	21206
29045486	Similarly, a significant increase in nuclear fragmentation into nucleosomal units was induced by PT treatment as demonstrated by the Cell Death ELISAPLUS kit (Fig 7D).	21207	21374
29045486	This effect was also significantly inhibited through YC1 treatment, and significantly reduced with thiamine repletion for 2 days (Fig 7D).	21375	21513
29045486	Additionally, treatment with 30μM cisplatin for 48h was used to demonstrate that YC1 treatment did not reduce apoptosis without co-occurring inhibition of HIF-1α.	21514	21676
29045486	Cisplatin treatment induced nucleosomal fragmentation, which was not significantly altered with simultaneous YC1 treatment (Fig 7E).	21677	21809
29045486	Finally, Fig 7E demonstrates representative plots generated by flow cytometry of all treatment groups subjected to PI/Annexin V staining.	21810	21947
29045486	A shift of the cell population to the right side of the plot represents increased Annexin V staining, and therefore increased phosphatidyl serine translocation to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane as seen in the PT treated group (Fig 7E).	21948	22193
29045486	Quantitation of flow cytometry replicates reveals that Annexin V staining was significantly increased following PT treatment, and significantly reduced following YC1 treatment and thiamine repletion (Fig 7F).	22194	22402
29045486	The consistency between TD and hypoxia/ischemia (H/I) is apparent with many cellular responses centralizing on HIF-1α activity.	22403	22530
29045486	For instance, HIF-1α regulation of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) lead to edema and blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption during ischemia [45, 46].	22531	22705
29045486	Focal edema during TD also correlates with increased expression of AQP-4 and MMP9 [40, 47].	22706	22797
29045486	Neuronal expression of the HIF-1α regulated chemokine MCP1 is induced in both H/I and TD [32, 48, 49].	22798	22900
29045486	Our findings have for the first time directly correlated HIF-1α activation during TD to expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and subsequent apoptotic death in primary mouse astrocytes.	22901	23085
29045486	A related protein HIF-2α is also responsible for regulating the cellular hypoxic response.	23086	23176
29045486	Although each protein recognizes the same consensus sequence, cell-type expression and activity of HIF-2α is significantly more restricted [50, 51].	23177	23325
29045486	We found that HIF-1α was stabilized in TD, however no induction of HIF-2α was observed.	23326	23413
29045486	Both HIF-1α and HIF-2α are stabilized by the loss of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) activity in H/I, although it appears in the context of TD that additional distinct regulatory mechanisms may be involved [22, 52].	23414	23622
29045486	Studies in renal carcinomas have demonstrated that BNIP3 expression correlates positively to HIF-1α activity, but negatively to HIF-2α suggesting distinct roles in apoptotic signaling as well.	23623	23815
29045486	Furthermore, a study in hepatocytes demonstrated a correlation between p53-mediated apoptotic death and HIF-2α expression, neither of which were observed in the primary mouse astrocytes during TD in this study.	23816	24026
29045486	H/I studies have demonstrated that acute HIF-1α activation is protective through increased oxygen availability due to the promotion of angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming to an aerobic shift [54, 55].	24027	24233
29045486	Direct HIF-1α trans-activation of VEGF mRNA results in increased angiogenesis and subsequent oxygen availability.	24234	24347
29045486	This is consistent with our work in mouse primary astrocytes, and previous studies in SK-N-BE cells which demonstrate an increase in VEGF mRNA during TD.	24348	24501
29045486	TD-mediated HIF-1α activation and up-regulation of VEGF may explain the clinical observation of high circulating VEGF and cerebral blood flow hyperperfusion observed in TD patients and rodent models [57–59].	24502	24709
29045486	HIF-1α signaling also attempts to preserve metabolism through regeneration of NAD+ via LDHA activity and maintenance of ATP production via rapid glycolysis.	24710	24866
29045486	HIF-1α mediated up-regulation of GLUT1 and LDHA promotes rapid glycolysis and reduces oxidative phosphorylation.	24867	24979
29045486	Likewise, up-regulation of GLUT1 and LDHA in mouse primary astrocytes as a direct consequence of HIF-1α activation is consistent with established metabolic sequalae during TD.	24980	25155
29045486	The observed alterations to glucose metabolism result in impaired ATP production in astrocytes, and impact the metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons.	25156	25317
29045486	An increase in glucose utilization was found in TD animals that correlated with the onset of neuronal damage.	25318	25427
29045486	Additionally, lactate accumulation via LDHA activity is an established metabolic consequence of TD in astrocytes that also contributes to neuronal death and the formation of histological lesions.	25428	25623
29045486	Recent evidence suggests that lactic acidosis increases Aquaporin-4 protein expression and plasma membrane localization in astrocytes leading to cellular swelling, increased BBB permeability, and subsequent edema.	25624	25837
29045486	Additionally, astrocyte swelling is associated with increased glutamate release resulting in glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity which has been implicated in neuronal cell death in TD.	25838	26020
29045486	Glucose administration to TD patients further increases focal lactate production and LDHA expression in TD-vulnerable brain regions contributing to the precipitation and exacerbation of symptoms.	26021	26216
29045486	Overall this suggests that loss of astrocyte energetic integrity due to HIF-1α mediated metabolic reprogramming may contribute to neuronal injury and explain the clinical and biochemical manifestations of TD.	26217	26425
29045486	In contrast to its pro-survival function, HIF-1α mediated apoptosis is associated with chronic activation.	26426	26532
29045486	Apoptosis during H/I is related to HIF-1α trans-activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins BNIP3, Nix and Noxa [67, 68].	26533	26651
29045486	However, the increase in Noxa protein levels in astrocytes during TD did not appear to be linked to increased mRNA levels.	26652	26774
29045486	Aside from transcriptional regulation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Noxa can be suppressed in response to cell stress.	26775	26910
29045486	Similar to our observations in TD, Noxa protein levels rapidly increased in response to ischemic stress, while the transcriptional response was delayed.	26911	27063
29045486	Further work is necessary to understand whether TD can suppress proteasome activity as a contributing factor to Noxa induction.	27064	27191
29045486	Induction of BNIP3 and Nix expression induces plasma membrane permeability, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, pore opening, and increased ROS generation.	27192	27350
29045486	Consistent with H/I, cell death and expression of BNIP3, Nix and Noxa were attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1α during TD in astrocytes.	27351	27501
29045486	Noxa suppression was sufficient to rescue cells from H/I death, and decrease injury in vivo. TD-induced apoptosis was suppressed by YC1 treatment, although the effects of thiamine repletion are less straightforward.	27502	27717
29045486	Following thiamine repletion apoptotic cells are no longer detected, though it is unclear whether apoptosis is reversed to promote cell growth, or whether it merely halts the further progression of damage.	27718	27923
29045486	YC1 is an established inhibitor of HIF-1α, although it was initially developed as a soluble guanyl cyclase (sGC) activator with effects on vasodilation.	27924	28076
29045486	While studies have identified protective effects of YC1 through inhibition of glutamate-mediated toxicity, superoxide production, and pro-inflammatory activators, these are independent of sGC activation.	28077	28280
29045486	To date, limited studies have demonstrated anti-apoptotic effects of YC1 mediated through activation of the sGC pathway.	28281	28401
29045486	Our results demonstrate that YC1 had no impact on cisplatin induced apoptotic death, suggesting the reduction in apoptosis by YC1 during TD was mediated through HIF-1α inhibition.	28402	28581
29045486	Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1α may be a potential therapeutic target to limit TD-induced neurological damage.	28582	28708
29045486	This strategy has already been investigated for treatment of H/I, and may therefore be adapted to TD related conditions.	28709	28829
29045486	Mechanistically, how TD induces HIF-1α may involve accumulation of pyruvate and lactate, ROS, or signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway [73–75].	28830	28974
29045486	Lactate and pyruvate accumulation stabilizes HIF-1α in the absence of ischemia.	28975	29054
29045486	This is in contrast to canonical HIF-1α activation, which occurs in H/I due to PHD inactivation.	29055	29151
29045486	Hydroxylation of specific proline residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α facilitates binding of the von Hippel Lindau protein which acts to ubiquitinate the protein for degradation [76, 77].	29152	29365
29045486	Due to structural similarities of pyruvate and lactate to α-ketoglutarate, a required cofactor for PHD activity, an abundance of these metabolites stabilizes HIF-1α.	29366	29531
29045486	While ischemic activation of HIF-1α occurs rapidly within 4h of treatment, our data demonstrates TD-induced HIF-1α stabilization within 8h.	29532	29671
29045486	While this is still a rapid response, the difference may reflect the time required to achieve loss of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and sufficient pyruvate accumulation.	29672	29849
29045486	Reduced activity of the thiamine dependent enzyme PDH and up-regulation of LDHA during TD is consistent with increased pyruvate and lactate in patients [12, 79].	29850	30011
29045486	Alternatively, an increase in ROS generated by complex III of the electron transport chain (ETC) has been implicated in HIF-1α stabilization following H/I.	30012	30167
29045486	An abundance of ROS is a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction in TD brains [11, 80].	30168	30256
29045486	A reduction in α-KGDH activity induces mitochondrial uncoupling and oxidative stress in astrocytes.	30257	30356
29045486	ROS-mediated HIF-1α activation limits flux through the ETC as a pro-survival response to combat oxidative stress.	30357	30470
29045486	Activation of the Akt/PI3K signaling pathway may also contribute to HIF-1α stabilization.	30471	30560
29045486	Akt/PI3K plays an important role in regulating nutrient homeostasis, and promoting cellular survival in nutrient deficient conditions.	30561	30695
29045486	Studies in breast cancer cells have observed no change in Akt total protein or phosphorylation following TD, suggesting this may not effect HIF-1α stabilization.	30696	30857
29045486	However, the role of Akt in TD still needs to be investigated in a primary cell model.	30858	30944
29045486	This work has identified a potential underlying transcriptional regulator that centralizes on many cellular responses occurring during alcohol and TD neurological injury (Fig 8).	30945	31123
29045486	Interestingly, ethanol induced HIF-1α signaling is recognized as a mediator of Alcoholic Liver Disease [84–86].	31124	31235
29045486	In hepatocytes, CYP2E1 mediated ethanol metabolism increases oxygen consumption to induce a hypoxic microenvironment and produce ROS.	31236	31369
29045486	Pretreatment of mice with a HIF-1α inhibitor before ethanol ingestion correlated with a reduction in apoptosis, confirming an important contribution for HIF-1α mediated hepatotoxicity.	31370	31554
29045486	CYP2E1 has also been associated with ethanol mediated neurotoxicity.	31555	31623
29045486	High CYP2E1 expression in the hippocampus and cortex is observed in alcoholic patients and brain CYP2E1 was inducible after ethanol consumption in animal models [89, 90].	31624	31794
29045486	Increased HIF-1α mRNA and protein in the cortex have been observed in a rat model of chronic alcohol ingestion.	31795	31906
29045486	The concomitant induction of HIF-1α via ethanol metabolism and associated TD in multiple brain regions may provide insight into the increased progression of damage in rats fed both ethanol and TD diet compared to either alone.	31907	32133
29045486	Overall, this suggests that astrocyte cell death in either uncomplicated alcoholism or in conjunction with TD may centralize with a HIF-1α mediated transcriptional response and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic/inflammatory genes.	32134	32361
29045486	Due to the important role for astrocyte integrity in neuronal survival, these findings suggest that TD-induced HIF-1α may contribute to neuronal cell death in TD.	32362	32524
29045486	Moreover, along with thiamine administration, use of HIF-1α inhibitors such as YC1 may limit TD associated astrocyte death, similar to that following stroke.	32525	32682
30442153	Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder leading to a progressive decline in cognitive function that is characterized at the molecular level by β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, tau pathology, and oxidative stress.	0	256
30442153	Reactive gliosis, including microglia activation and astrocyte reactivation, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD, both in transgenic rodent models and human patients [1, 2].	257	445
30442153	During the onset of AD, abnormal Aβ metabolism has a profound effect on the local community of neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), while in the developmental stage of disease, the inflammatory response of reactive glial cells contributes to neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation.	446	740
30442153	In neurons, Aβ peptides induce neurotoxic effects that are mediated via deregulation of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis, which results in synaptic loss.	741	905
30442153	However, little is known about the role of Aβ in the regulation of astrocytic Ca2+ homeostasis and subsequent pathological influences.	906	1040
30442153	Stimulation of Aβ in primary astrocytes triggers elevations in [Ca2+]i and the formation of reactive oxygen species, which are associated with metabolic failure of astrocytes and may directly induce neuronal loss [3–5].	1041	1260
30442153	Notably, spontaneous [Ca2+]i accumulation has been identified in astrocytes of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice in vivo, independent of neuron hyperactivity.	1261	1439
30442153	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) regulates [Ca2+]i homeostasis and protein folding.	1440	1521
30442153	Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) channels, which are complexes composed of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1, an ER calcium sensor) and calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (Orai1, a pore-forming protein), can be activated by the depletion of Ca2+ stores in the ER.	1522	1806
30442153	SOCE plays an essential role in the activation of non-excitable cells, including astrocytes and microglia, via triggering Ca2+ influx.	1807	1941
30442153	Disruption of protein folding in the ER triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) via activation of three ER pathways: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) [9, 10].	1942	2180
30442153	The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) dissociates from PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 during ER stress, and then initiates proapoptotic signaling via activation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP).	2181	2403
30442153	Accumulating evidence suggests that Ca2+-dependent ER stress is correlated with reactive astrogliosis (RA) in both an AD mouse model and ischemic stroke [11, 12].	2404	2566
30442153	In addition, the intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 is reported to be involved in cisplatin-initiated acute kidney injury and the phenotypic switch of RA in ischemic stroke via attenuation of ER stress.	2567	2792
30442153	KCa3.1 regulates K+ efflux and subsequent Ca2+ entry via hyperpolarization of the membrane potential.	2793	2894
30442153	The KCa3.1 channel has been investigated as a therapeutic target in neurodegeneration diseases, vascular restenosis, and autoimmune diseases [15–17].	2895	3044
30442153	Our group recently reported that KCa3.1 inhibition significantly ameliorated neuronal loss, RA, microglial activation, and memory deficits in both APP/PS1 mice and senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice [15, 18].	3045	3268
30442153	KCa3.1 also plays a key role in mediating Aβ-induced RA, which includes activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (MAPK/JNK) signaling pathway and upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.	3269	3506
30442153	Blockade of KCa3.1 channels with triarylmethane-34 (TRAM-34) was shown to attenuate microglial-dependent indirect neurotoxicity in vivo, which emphasizes the role of Ca2+ in the process of neuroinflammation [19, 20].	3507	3723
30442153	Collectively, these data clearly demonstrate that KCa3.1 presents a potential therapeutic target in AD.	3724	3827
30442153	Therefore, the aim of present study was to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Aβ-mediated ER stress in RA and to identify key molecules involved in the regulation of RA-induced neurotoxicity.	3828	4023
30442153	We report that Ca2+ overload induces ER stress in primary astrocytes and ER stress is increased in AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mice.	4024	4155
30442153	Blockade or gene deletion of KCa3.1 decreased SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and attenuated ER stress via the protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathway in primary astrocytes, which is essential to protect neurons against RA-induced neurotoxicity.	4156	4424
30442153	We also show that the absence of KCa3.1 channels attenuated ER stress, gliosis, neuroinflammation, memory deficits, and neuronal loss in KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice.	4425	4585
30442153	These results reveal an important correlation between KCa3.1 activation and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 AD mice, suggesting that KCa3.1 may be an effective therapeutic target in AD.	4586	4769
30442153	Frozen tissues and paraffin-embedded brain slices from the hippocampi of postmortem human samples of control and AD patients were obtained from the Netherlands Brain Bank (Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, Netherlands).	4770	5006
30442153	The Netherlands Brain Bank obtained written informed consent for brain autopsy specimens for research purposes after death.	5007	5130
30442153	The Braak stage, neuropathological and clinical diagnoses, age and gender distributions, as well as diagnostic groupings are presented in Table 1.	5131	5277
30442153	The frozen tissues were used to isolate proteins, and expression of proteins was evaluated by Western blotting as described below.	5278	5408
30442153	Immunofluorescence was performed on 8-μm sections using antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), KCa3.1, Orai1, and GRP78 antibodies as described below.	5409	5579
30442153	Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (male, 25–30 g) were procured from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China).	5580	5699
30442153	KCa3.1−/− mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed as described previously.	5700	5814
30442153	APP/PS1 transgenic mice (an AD model) were also purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (no.	5815	5905

30442153	Mouse cohorts of the four genotypes (WT, KCa3.1−/−, KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1, and APP/PS1) were generated and used for behavioral analysis.	6051	6183
30442153	The protocols of all animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China (ethics protocol number: A-2015-010).	6184	6391
30442153	The modified Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed as previously described.	6392	6472
30442153	Briefly, the test requires the mice to receive 5 consecutive training days (1 day with the visible platform and 4 days with the hidden platform) in a circular water tank (diameter = 80 cm; height = 50 cm) containing opaque water (22 °C, 25 cm deep).	6473	6722
30442153	A spatial probe trial was performed on day 6 with no platform present.	6723	6793
30442153	During the hidden platform training days, the mice were allowed to swim for 60 s to find the hidden platform (1 cm below the water surface).	6794	6934
30442153	The platform was removed from the pool on day 6 of the spatial probe trial and the mice swam freely for 60 s. Performance of the MWM test was recorded using a video camera and analyzed using a video tracking system (Jiliang Software Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).	6935	7207
30442153	Confocal microscopy was performed as previously described.	7208	7266
30442153	Briefly, mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde.	7267	7358
30442153	Then, 10% goat serum in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to block 12-μm sections of the mice brain or 8-μm sections of the human brain for 1 h at room temperature.	7359	7537

30442153	After incubation at 4 °C overnight, the brain sections were incubated with the respective Alexa Fluor® 488- or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (1500; Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA).	8160	8357
30442153	Images were collected using a TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and processed with Leica LASAF Lite imaging software.	8358	8523
30442153	The same reference position was used for each brain slice for quantification, i.e., between three and five random 0.01-mm2 microscopic fields.	8524	8666
30442153	Quantification was measured from six sections per brain (120-μm intervals) in a blinded manner.	8667	8762
30442153	Mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused with saline.	8763	8832
30442153	Mice or human brain tissues and cells were lysed on ice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100; 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium orthovanadate, sodium fluoride, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, leupeptin) containing 1% phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride.	8833	9165
30442153	The supernatants were collected after centrifuging at 13,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C.	9166	9249
30442153	Equal concentrations of proteins were separated by 10% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was blocked for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20.	9250	9548
30442153	The membrane was incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: mouse anti-KCa3.1 (1:100; Alomone Labs, Ltd.), mouse anti-STIM1 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-Orai1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-GRP78, rabbit anti-mTOR, rabbit anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), rabbit anti-phospho-PERK (Thr980), rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2α, rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308), rabbit anti-Akt, rabbit anti-phospho-4E-BP1, rabbit anti-phospho-p70 S6 Kinase, mouse anti-CHOP, rabbit anti-iNOS, rabbit anti-COX2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse anti-β-actin (1:1000; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China).	9549	10220
30442153	The membranes were subsequently washed and incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP for 1 h at RT, and developed using BeyoECL solution (P0018A; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology).	10221	10407
30442153	Image Studio Lite Ver 5.2 software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) was used to analyze the proteins.	10408	10515
30442153	ELISA was performed using the kit for TNF-α and IL-1β (Rapidbio Labs, Langka Trade Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China).	10516	10626
30442153	The procedures were conducted according to manufacturer’s protocols.	10627	10695
30442153	The oligomeric Aβ was prepared as described previously.	10696	10751
30442153	Briefly, monomeric peptide Aβ was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro 2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 1 mg/mL.	10752	10892
30442153	The dried monomeric peptide Aβ was resolved in ddH2O at a concentration of 100 mM and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h to induce aggregation.	10893	11028
30442153	Primary cortical astrocyte cultures derived from newborn (P0–P2) WT or KCa3.1−/− C57BL/6 mouse brains were prepared from mixed glial cultures (10–14 days in vitro) as described previously.	11029	11217
30442153	Briefly, the cerebral cortices were dissociated into single cell suspensions.	11218	11295
30442153	Dissociated single cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2.	11296	11450
30442153	When the astrocytes grew to confluence (10–14 days later), the flasks were shaken overnight (200 rpm, 37 °C) to deplete microglia and oligodendrocytes.	11451	11602
30442153	The purified astrocytes were then plated onto 6-well or 96-well plates in serum containing medium.	11603	11701
30442153	Astrocytes were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 24 h after reaching confluence again, and then were treated with Aβ for different time periods before harvest.	11702	11863
30442153	The culture medium (CM) was changed to neurobasal medium (NB) with B27 supplement (Invitrogen Corporation) after confluent astrocytes were serum-free for 24 h. The NB/B27-based WT and KCa3.1−/− astrocytes were then treated with 5 μM Aβ oligomer.	11864	12109
30442153	The CM from the NB/B27-based cells was collected and used immediately.	12110	12180
30442153	The primary cultured cortical neurons were isolated from neonatal (P0–P2) C57BL/6 mice and cultured as described previously.	12181	12305
30442153	Cells were stained with primary antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and Alexa Fluor® 568-conjugated secondary antibody.	12306	12446
30442153	A Cellomics Kinetic Scan reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to scan the MAP2-positive cells.	12447	12565
30442153	Extended Neurite Outgrowth software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to analyze the data.	12566	12658
30442153	The purified astrocytes were plated in the wells of 96-well plates containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.	12659	12783
30442153	After once again reaching confluence, the cells were incubated with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4AM (1.6 μM; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) for 25 min and then washed three times with 0.01 M PBS.	12784	12996
30442153	Afterward, 2 μM ethylene glycol-bis (β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid was used to chelate the calcium in the DMEM and then 1 μM thapsigargin (Tg) was used to induce [Ca2+]i release.	12997	13192
30442153	After the [Ca2+]i concentration was stable, 2 mM CaCl2 solution was added to the DMEM to induce Ca2+ influx.	13193	13301
30442153	Fluorescence signals were recorded and analyzed using a FlexStation 3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).	13302	13441
30442153	All data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean.	13442	13506
30442153	Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).	13507	13609
30442153	Data were tested for Gaussian distribution with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test and then analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Dunnett’s post-hoc test.	13610	13786
30442153	Data were analyzed with an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test when comparing between two groups or the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test was applied.	13787	13938
30442153	Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.	13939	13984
30442153	ER stress induced by increased protein misfolding and upregulation of the UPR has been observed in AD patients and in an AD mouse model [23, 24].	13985	14130
30442153	Disruption of protein folding in the ER triggers the UPR via activation of three ER pathways: PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 [9, 10].	14131	14254
30442153	The GRP78 dissociates from PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 during ER stress, and then initiates proapoptotic signaling via activation of CHOP.	14255	14386
30442153	GRP78 and CHOP protein levels were increased in both the brains of AD patients (p < 0.05, Fig.	14387	14481
30442153	1a, b) and the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice (p < 0.05, Fig.	14482	14539
30442153	1c, d), as compared to control tissues.	14540	14579
30442153	The Aβ oligomer was reported to disrupt Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER of astrocytes, which leads to ER stress-induced RA.	14580	14698
30442153	The addition of Aβ to primary cultured astrocytes significantly upregulated the protein levels of GRP78 and CHOP at 12 h, as compared with control cells, indicating that Aβ induces the activation of the UPR in astrocytes (p < 0.05, Fig.	14699	14935
30442153	1e, f).	14936	14943
30442153	Overall, these data obtained from AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mouse models demonstrate a potential mechanism of ER stress activation in AD.	14944	15082
30442153	For evaluation of SOCE, Tg (1 μM), an ER Ca2+ ATPase pump blocker, was used to deplete ER Ca2+ stores.	15083	15185
30442153	Without extracellular Ca2+ (0 Ca2+), Tg-induced upregulation of [Ca2+]i (first peak) showed no significant changes in response to treatment with 5 μM Aβ at 12 h, as compared to the control astrocytes (p > 0.05, Fig.	15186	15401
30442153	1g, h).	15402	15409
30442153	However, SOCE, initiated by external Ca2+ (2 mM), was increased at 12 h (p < 0.05, Fig.	15410	15497
30442153	1g, h) and 24 h (p < 0.01, Fig.	15498	15529
30442153	1g, h) in response to treatment with 5 μM Aβ, as compared to control cells.	15530	15605
30442153	Colocalization experiments were conducted using antibodies against the ER stress marker GRP78 and the RA marker GFAP.	15606	15723
30442153	Double-labeled staining showed that GRP78 and GFAP colocalized in the AD brain tissues, but not the controls (Fig.	15724	15838
30442153	1i).	15839	15843
30442153	The accumulation of Aβ oligomers and amyloid plaques in the brain is associated with neuroinflammation and abnormal gliosis, including reactive astrocytes [3, 26].	15844	16007
30442153	We previously reported that KCa3.1 gene deletion attenuated ER stress in RA via the c-Jun/JNK and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in ischemic mice.	16008	16151
30442153	Given the key role of Aβ-induced astrocytes ER stress due to SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload, we then measured the expression levels of KCa3.1 and SOCE channels following stimulation by prolonged Aβ treatment.	16152	16356
30442153	Although the exact SOCE molecular components in astrocytes are unknown, KCa3.1 and Orai1 have been reported as components of SOCE channels in some cell types [8, 27, 28].	16357	16527
30442153	Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate changes in the expression profiles of KCa3.1, Orai1, and STIM1, which revealed upregulation of the KCa3.1 and Orai1 channels in response to stimulation with 5 μM Aβ for 24 h, as compared to the control group, whereas there was no obvious change in the expression of STIM1 (a regulator of KCa3.1 and Orai1) (p > 0.05, Fig.	16528	16897
30442153	2a, b).	16898	16905
30442153	Colocalization experiments were conducted using specific KCa3.1 and Orai1 antibodies.	16906	16991
30442153	Double-labeled staining showed that the colocalization of KCa3.1 and Orai1 was increased in primary astrocytes in response to stimulation with 5 μM Aβ for 24 h, as compared to the control cells (Fig.	16992	17191
30442153	2c).	17192	17196
30442153	We then further studied the potential relevance of KCa3.1 and Orai1 in the hippocampi of control and AD patients.	17197	17310
30442153	The results showed that the expression levels of the KCa3.1 and Orai1 proteins, but not STIM1, were upregulated in the hippocampi of AD patients, as compared to the control tissues (p < 0.05, Fig.	17311	17507
30442153	2d, e).	17508	17515
30442153	Colocalization experiments were conducted by immunostaining the brain tissues of AD patients and controls with specific KCa3.1 and Orai1 antibodies.	17516	17664
30442153	Double-labeled staining showed that the colocalization of KCa3.1 and Orai1 was increased in the brain tissues of AD patients, as compared to the controls (Fig.	17665	17824
30442153	2f).	17825	17829
30442153	In the present study, colocalization between KCa3.1 and astrocytes was detected in the brains of AD patients and 15-month-old APP/PS1 mice.	17830	17969
30442153	Age-matched control humans and WT littermates were used as controls.	17970	18038
30442153	In AD patients (Fig.	18039	18059
30442153	2g) and APP/PS1 mice (Fig.	18060	18086
30442153	2h), colocalization of KCa3.1 and GFAP+ astrocytes was increased, as compared to the controls.	18087	18181
30442153	The findings of the above experiments suggest that KCa3.1 plays a key role during the process of SOCE and in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER.	18182	18330
30442153	Pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 was then conducted to further confirm the critical role of KCa3.1 in Ca2+ homeostasis and stress in the ER.	18331	18473
30442153	The results showed that blockade of KCa3.1 with 1 μM TRAM-34 attenuated Aβ-induced SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload, as compared with Aβ-treated cells (p < 0.05, Fig.	18474	18634
30442153	3a, b).	18635	18642
30442153	Pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 with 1 μM TRAM-34 decreased the upregulation of GRP78 and CHOP, which was induced by treatment with 5 μM Aβ for 24 h, indicating that blockade of KCa3.1 could inhibit prolonged UPR activation (p < 0.05, Fig.	18643	18885
30442153	3c, d).	18886	18893
30442153	KCa3.1 gene deletion (KCa3.1−/−) from astrocytes was stimulated with 5 μM Aβ or 1 μM Tg for 24 h, as compared to WT control cells.	18894	19024
30442153	KCa3.1 gene deletion also decreased Aβ or Tg-induced upregulation of GRP78 (p < 0.05, Fig.	19025	19115
30442153	3e–h).	19116	19122
30442153	As a critical transducer of the UPR, phosphorylation of PERK (p-PERK) was increased after stimulation with 5 μM Aβ or 1 μM Tg, but decreased in KCa3.1−/− astrocytes (p < 0.05, Fig.	19123	19303
30442153	3e–h).	19116	19122
30442153	Similarly, prolonged UPR has been shown to activate eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), an important downstream signaling target, which was also increased in Aβ or Tg-treated WT astrocytes, but was restored to normal in KCa3.1−/− cells (p < 0.05, Fig.	19311	19567
30442153	3e–h).	19116	19122
30442153	WT and KCa3.1−/− astrocytes were used to test whether KCa3.1-mediated astrogliosis could induce dendritic damage.	19575	19688
30442153	More dendritic damage was observed in the CM from 5 μM Aβ-stimulated WT astrocytes (WT/Aβ-CM) than in those treated with CM from WT astrocytes (WT/CM), as shown by immunofluorescent staining of the dendritic marker MAP2 (Fig.	19689	19914
30442153	3i).	19915	19919
30442153	Incubation with WT/Aβ-CM decreased total neurite length (p < 0.01, Fig.	19920	19991
30442153	3j) and number of branch points (p < 0.01, Fig.	19992	20039
30442153	3k).	20040	20044
30442153	Incubation with CM from 5 μM Aβ-stimulated KCa3.1−/− astrocytes (KCa3.1−/−/Aβ-CM) attenuated the effect of WT/Aβ-CM by increasing total neurite length and the number of branch points (p < 0.05, Fig.	20045	20243
30442153	3j, k).	20244	20251
30442153	In the present study, APP/PS1 mice were crossed with KCa3.1−/− mice to study the role of KCa3.1 channels in RA-mediated neuronal toxicity.	20252	20390
30442153	Offspring intercrossing generated mice with the WT, KCa3.1−/−, APP/PS1, and KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 genotypes.	20391	20495
30442153	Western blot analysis was conducted to identify changes in the expressions patterns of GRP78 and CHOP in the brains of 15-month-old APP/PS1 and KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice, as compared with WT and KCa3.1−/− controls.	20496	20707
30442153	Similar to previous results in AD patients (Fig.	20708	20756
30442153	1a, b), GRP78 and CHOP levels were significantly increased in APP/PS1 mice, as compared to WT and KCa3.1−/− mice (p < 0.05, Fig.	20757	20885
30442153	4a–c), while the expression levels of GRP78 and CHOP were significantly decreased in KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice, as compared to APP/PS1 mice (p < 0.05, Fig.	20886	21038
30442153	4a–c).	21039	21045
30442153	It was reported that upregulation of GRP78 and phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to Aβ-induced ER stress contributed to RA in the AD mouse model and primary cultured astrocytes.	21046	21226
30442153	We then investigated whether KCa3.1 gene deletion could prevent changes in GRP78 expression levels in the astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice.	21227	21360
30442153	To compare the response in astrocytes specifically, immunofluorescence was used to quantify GRP78 levels in GFAP+ astrocytes in the hippocampi of WT, KCa3.1−/−, APP/PS1, and KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice.	21361	21558
30442153	In the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice, GRP78 expression was increased in GFAP+ astrocytes, as compared to that of WT controls (p < 0.01, Fig.	21559	21696
30442153	4d, e).	21697	21704
30442153	Meanwhile, hippocampal GRP78 immunoreactivity levels of KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice were significantly decreased, as compared to that of APP/PS1 mice (p < 0.01, Fig.	21705	21865
30442153	4d, e).	21697	21704
30442153	The foregoing data suggest that KCa3.1 gene deletion prevented activation of the UPR and attenuated astrocytic ER stress in an in vivo AD model.	21874	22018
30442153	However, the signaling intermediates linking KCa3.1 and astrocytic ER stress in AD remain unknown.	22019	22117
30442153	Given the reported relationship between the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway and ER stress, we tested whether the AKT pathway is involved in KCa3.1-mediated astrocytes ER stress.	22118	22315
30442153	Decreased phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) (Thr308) was observed in the brain tissues of AD patients (p < 0.01, Fig.	22316	22430
30442153	5a, b).	22431	22438
30442153	In primary cultured astrocytes, Aβ treatment for 1 h significantly decreased p-AKT (Thr308) levels without inducing changes in total AKT (p < 0.01, Fig.	22439	22591
30442153	5c, d), while KCa3.1 gene deletion (KCa3.1−/−) inhibited the decrease in p-AKT (Thr308) after Aβ treatment (p < 0.05, Fig.	22592	22714
30442153	5c, d).	22715	22722
30442153	We then examined whether KCa3.1 gene deletion would activate the AKT/mTOR pathway in an in vivo AD model.	22723	22828
30442153	Consistent with the in vitro results (Fig.	22829	22871
30442153	5c), p-AKT (Thr308) levels were decreased in the brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice (p < 0.01, Fig.	22872	22965
30442153	5e, f).	22966	22973
30442153	KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1) attenuated p-AKT (Thr308) suppression (p < 0.05, Fig.	22974	23084
30442153	5e, f).	22966	22973
30442153	Importantly, the phosphorylation of mTOR, a kinase that regulates cell survival, was decreased in the brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice (p < 0.01, Fig.	23093	23239
30442153	5e, f).	22966	22973
30442153	mTOR suppression, in turn, suppressed its downstream proteins, including phosphorylated 4EBP1 (p-4EBP1) and p70 S6 kinase (p-p70 S6 kinase) (Thr389), while KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1) attenuated the suppression of mTOR phosphorylation (p < 0.05, Fig.	23248	23527
30442153	5e, f).	22966	22973
30442153	It was reported that blockade of KCa3.1 significantly reduced neuronal loss and memory deficits in both APP/PS1 mice and SAMP8 mice [11, 15].	23536	23677
30442153	Given that neuronal loss and decreased expression of synaptic proteins are likely correlated with the severity of AD, we compared expression levels of the neuron marker NeuN in the brain tissues of APP/PS1 mice with those of KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mutants.	23678	23929
30442153	Immunostaining analysis revealed that NeuN-positive neuron levels were decreased in the CA1 areas of the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice, as compared with that in the WT group, while KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1) attenuated the decrease of NeuN staining (p < 0.05, Fig.	23930	24221
30442153	6a, b).	24222	24229
30442153	Both reactive astrocytes and microglial activation are predominant pathological features of AD.	24230	24325
30442153	Immunostaining of the RA marker GFAP was measured to determine whether KCa3.1 gene deletion affects RA in APP/PS1 mice.	24326	24445
30442153	Immunostaining of GFAP+ astrocytes was increased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, as compared with WT mice (p < 0.05, Fig.	24446	24566
30442153	7a, b), while KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1) attenuated the increase in immunostaining of GFAP+ astrocytes (p < 0.05, Fig.	24567	24715
30442153	7a, b).	24716	24723
30442153	We also investigated whether KCa3.1 gene deletion attenuates microglial activation in APP/PS1 mice by measuring expression levels of the microglia marker Iba1.	24724	24883
30442153	Our data show that the content of Iba1+ microglia was increased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, as compared with that of WT mice (p < 0.01, Fig.	24884	25027
30442153	7c, d).	25028	25035
30442153	KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1) attenuated the increase of Iba1+ microglia immunostaining (p < 0.01, Fig.	25036	25166
30442153	7c, d).	25028	25035
30442153	Both the RA and microglia activation results suggest that, while brains of APP/PS1 mice show increased glial responses, these responses are attenuated in the brains of KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice.	25175	25366
30442153	KCa3.1 deficiency in KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice attenuated the upregulation of COX-2 (Fig.	25367	25453
30442153	7e, f) and iNOS (Fig.	25454	25475
30442153	7e, g), compared with APP/PS1 mice.	25476	25511
30442153	Levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in brain homogenates from WT, KCa3.1−/−, APP/PS1, and KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 group mice were measured by ELISA experiments (Fig.	25512	25661
30442153	7h, i).	25662	25669
30442153	Levels of both TNF-α and IL-1β released were attenuated in the KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 group compared with the APP/PS1 group.	25670	25789
30442153	Together, these findings indicate that elimination of KCa3.1 ameliorated the pathological hallmarks of AD in KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice, such as neuronal loss, microglial activation, RA, and neuroinflammation.	25790	25995
30442153	In this study, the MWM spatial memory test was used to determine whether loss of KCa3.1 had any effect on cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice.	25996	26137
30442153	With the use of a hidden platform during the MWM test, 15-month-old APP/PS1 mice showed memory deficits, as compared with WT mice (p < 0.01, Fig.	26138	26283
30442153	8a).	26284	26288
30442153	Furthermore, the KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice showed improved spatial learning and memory, as compared with the APP/PS1 mice (Fig.	26289	26413
30442153	8a).	26284	26288
30442153	In the spatial probe trial without an escape platform, significantly more KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice were able to cross the target quadrant, as compared to APP/PS1 mice (p < 0.05, Fig.	26419	26599
30442153	8b), and spent more time and swam for greater distances in the target quadrant (p < 0.05, Fig.	26600	26694
30442153	8c, d).	26695	26702
30442153	In conclusion, the MWM test results indicate that APP/PS1 mice present significant spatial memory deficits and that elimination of KCa3.1 channels ameliorates these deficits.	26703	26877
30442153	The importance of KCa3.1 channels to CNS function is underscored by a series of studies implicating KCa3.1 in various diseases, including stroke/ischemia [32, 33], AD [11, 15], traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury.	26878	27102
30442153	These studies showed that upregulation of KCa3.1 activity can profoundly influence CNS pathology.	27103	27200
30442153	Here, we report that KCa3.1 expression was markedly associated with ER stress and UPR in both Aβ-stimulated primary astrocytes and brain lysates of AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mice.	27201	27381
30442153	Gene deletion or blockade of KCa3.1 attenuated SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and ER stress, which regulates the AKT/mTOR pathway in RA to protect neurons from RA-induced neurotoxicity.	27382	27563
30442153	Elimination of KCa3.1 can attenuate ER stress, neuronal loss, gliosis, neuroinflammation, and memory deficits observed in KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice.	27564	27709
30442153	These data suggest that KCa3.1 presents an effective therapeutic target in AD.	27710	27788
30442153	Astrocytes perform brain homeostatic maintenance within the CNS and communicate with neighboring neurons and glial cells via [Ca2+]i signals triggering the gliotransmitters release [3, 36–40].	27789	27981
30442153	SOCE channels, composed of STIM1 and Orai1 (pore-forming proteins), can be activated by the depletion of Ca2+ stores in the ER.	27982	28109
30442153	SOCE, which is regulated by STIM1/2 and Orai1, plays an essential role in the activation of non-excitable cells, including astrocytes and microglia, via triggering Ca2+ influx.	28110	28286
30442153	STIM1/2 and Orai1 were identified as key molecules of SOCE in cortical and spinal astrocytes.	28287	28380
30442153	SOCE plays an important role in the production of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interluekin-6 in spinal astrocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides.	28381	28543
30442153	Dysfunctional astrocytic Ca2+ signaling is involved in many pathological states, such as epilepsy and ischemia.	28544	28655
30442153	Vincent et al. reported that astrocytic Ca2+ homeostasis is disrupted in AD.	28656	28732
30442153	Disruption of Ca2+ signaling of astrocytes was found both in the transgenic mouse models of AD in vivo and in Aβ-stimulated primary astrocytes in vitro [5, 6, 42, 43].	28733	28900
30442153	ER stress plays an important role in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [44, 45].	28901	29019
30442153	Much evidence indicates a relationship between ER stress and Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in the post-mortem brain tissue of AD patients and AD mouse models [45, 46].	29020	29181
30442153	Aβ severely disrupts ER function and induces ER stress in neurons and glial cells [25, 47].	29182	29273
30442153	Stimulation with Aβ oligomers deregulated ER Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons and astrocytes, which resulted in misfolding of proteins in the ER.	29274	29414
30442153	Excessive and prolonged activation of ER stress may initiate apoptosis by regulation of several key proteins, including CHOP, caspase-12, and JNK, which can further aggravate Aβ cytotoxicity.	29415	29606
30442153	ER stress is reportedly linked with some inflammation signaling networks, suggesting that ER stress activation may be involved in the neuroinflammatory response.	29607	29768
30442153	In the present study, we demonstrated that Aβ induced ER stress in astrocytes in vitro and observed upregulation of CHOP and the ER-resident chaperone GRP78 [50, 51].	29769	29935
30442153	Gene deletion and pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 were shown to attenuate the upregulation of UPR hallmarks.	29936	30047
30442153	APP/PS1 mice present the prodromal phase of AD, reflecting memory and spatial learning deficits, as assessed by performance in the MWM test.	30048	30188
30442153	Soluble and plaque-associated Aβ peptides, which are present starting at 6 months of age in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, induce ER stress and sequent phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2a, which are closely associated with the pathogenesis of AD.	30189	30427
30442153	The results of the present study also suggest that elimination of KCa3.1 ameliorated the pathological hallmarks of AD in KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice, such as neuronal loss, microglial activation, and RA.	30428	30626
30442153	Although the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of memory deficits by elimination of KCa3.1 are not well known, they are likely associated with the decreased pathological markers noted in KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice, as compared with APP/PS1 mice.	30627	30872
30442153	Similar to AD patients, phosphorylation of GRP78 and eIF2α is upregulated in the brains of APP/PS1 mice.	30873	30977
30442153	APP/PS1 mice also showed decreased expression of NeuN and increased expression of Iba1 and GFAP, suggesting the presence of neuronal loss, microglial activation, and RA.	30978	31147
30442153	Brain slices of KCa3.1−/−/APP/PS1 mice showed significantly lower levels of these markers than those of APP/PS1 mice, indicating that KCa3.1 gene deletion might involve in ER stress and, thereby, attenuate neuronal loss and glia inflammation in AD mice.	31148	31401
30442153	Our data also demonstrated that KCa3.1 regulates ER stress via the downstream AKT/mTOR signaling pathway during RA in AD.	31402	31523
30442153	We observed that Aβ decreased the activation of AKT by decreasing AKT phosphorylation in primary astrocytes.	31524	31632
30442153	Interestingly, KCa3.1 elimination prevented Aβ-mediated loss of AKT activation via upregulation of AKT phosphorylation at Thr308.	31633	31762
30442153	Growing evidence indicates that the mTOR signaling pathway plays a vital role during apoptosis and autophagy.	31763	31872
30442153	Our results show that Aβ represses the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, p70 S6 kinase, and 4EBP1, and that a decrease in the phosphorylation of AKT led to UPR activation.	31873	32040
30442153	The postmortem brain samples from patients with and without AD were also evaluated.	32041	32124
30442153	The results indicate that KCa3.1 expression and activation of UPR-associated proteins are increased in the brains of AD patients.	32125	32254
30442153	Overall, these data indicate that KCa3.1 plays an important role in the process of Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER and that KCa3.1 upregulation involves in the activation of the UPR pathway, which subsequently leads to neurodegeneration in AD.	32255	32493
