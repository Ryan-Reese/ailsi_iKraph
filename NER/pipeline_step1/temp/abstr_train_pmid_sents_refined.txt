1353340	Late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy: molecular pathology in two siblings.	0	77
1353340	We report on a new allele at the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) locus causing late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).	78	194
1353340	In that allele arginine84, a residue that is highly conserved in the arylsulfatase gene family, is replaced by glutamine.	195	316
1353340	In contrast to alleles that cause early-onset MLD, the arginine84 to glutamine substitution is associated with some residual ARSA activity.	317	456
1353340	A comparison of genotypes, ARSA activities, and clinical data on 4 individuals carrying the allele of 81 patients with MLD examined, further validates the concept that different degrees of residual ARSA activity are the basis of phenotypical variation in MLD..	457	717
1671881	Two distinct mutations at a single BamHI site in phenylketonuria.	0	65
1671881	Classical phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).	66	192
1671881	The abolition of an invariant BamHI site located in the coding sequence of the PAH gene (exon 7) led to the recognition of two new point mutations at codon 272 and 273 (272gly----stop and 273ser----phe, respectively).	193	410
1671881	Both mutations were detected in north eastern France or Belgium and occurred on the background of RFLP haplotype 7 alleles.	411	534
1671881	The present study supports the view that the clinical heterogeneity in PKU is accounted for by the large variety of mutant genotypes associated with PAH deficiencies..	535	702
1848636	Debrisoquine phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta-2 receptor pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its enantiomers.	0	119
1848636	The metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine/sparteine type.	120	242
1848636	The two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), show different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EMs.	243	460
1848636	We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol.	461	556
1848636	The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia.	557	649
1848636	By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S-isomer, were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values, representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy.	650	916
1848636	Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o.	917	1074
1848636	Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher terbutaline dose (0.75 mg) on day 2.	1075	1185
1848636	Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R- and S-isomer), and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after metoprolol.	1186	1400
1848636	In PMs, metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%).	1401	1504
1848636	Higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R-/S-isomer ratios of unchanged drug.	1505	1625
1848636	There was a difference in metoprolol potency with higher racemic metoprolol IC50 values in PMs (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than EMs (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, P less than .001).	1626	1786

2422478	Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa.	0	92
2422478	Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord.	93	338
2422478	The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla, coinciding with the raphe magnus.	339	499
2422478	In spontaneously hypertensive, stroke-prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30-40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) injected intracerebroventricularly.	500	859
2422478	However, intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension.	860	1029
2422478	Further, 5,7-DHT lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection.	1030	1283
2422478	It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa-induced hypotension via descending projections, the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.	1284	1680
2491010	Molecular and phenotypic analysis of patients with deletions within the deletion-rich region of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene.	0	139
2491010	Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus.	140	322
2491010	This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9.	323	457
2491010	These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA.	458	608
2491010	Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper).	609	765
2491010	Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype.	766	882
2491010	Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries.	883	1054
2491010	Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame.	1055	1301
2491010	Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions.	1302	1424
2491010	This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by Malhotra et al. at the 5 ' end of the gene.	1425	1582
7468724	Cardiovascular complications associated with terbutaline treatment for preterm labor.	0	85
7468724	Severe cardiovascular complications occurred in eight of 160 patients treated with terbutaline for preterm labor.	86	199
7468724	Associated corticosteroid therapy and twin gestations appear to be predisposing factors.	200	288
7468724	Potential mechanisms of the pathophysiology are briefly discussed.	289	355
7668252	Cloning of human very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase and molecular characterization of its deficiency in two patients.	0	128
7668252	Two overlapping cDNA clones (1, 991 bp and 736 bp, respectively) encoding the precursor of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) were cloned and sequenced.	129	320
7668252	The cDNA inserts of these clones together encompass a region of 2, 177 bases, encoding the entire protein of 655 amino acids, including a 40-amino acid leader peptide and a 615-amino acid mature polypeptide.	321	528
7668252	PCR-amplified VLCAD cDNAs were sequenced in cultured fibroblasts from two VLCAD-deficient patients.	529	628
7668252	In both patients, a 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 in VLCAD cDNA was identified.	629	723
7668252	The deletion seems to occur due to exon skipping during processing of VLCAD pre-mRNA.	724	809
7668252	This is the first demonstration of a mutation causing VLCAD deficiency.	810	881
7668252	Quantitative cDNA expression of normal human VLCAD was performed in the patients fibroblasts, using vaccinia viral system, which demonstrated that the deficiency of the normal VLCAD protein causes impaired long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation activity in the patients fibroblasts.	882	1162
7668252	In patient fibroblasts, raising VLCAD activity to approximately 20% of normal control fibroblast activity raised palmitic acid beta-oxidation flux to the level found in control fibroblasts, which may offer important information for the rational design of future somatic gene therapy for VLCAD deficiency..	1163	1468
7905839	Human mu opiate receptor.	0	25
7905839	cDNA and genomic clones, pharmacologic characterization and chromosomal assignment.	26	109
7905839	A human mu opiate receptor cDNA has been identified from a cerebral cortical cDNA library using sequences from the rat mu opiate receptor cDNA.	110	253
7905839	The human mu opiate receptor (h mu OR1) shares 95% amino acid identity with the rat sequence.	254	347
7905839	The expressed mu OR1 recognized tested opiate drugs and opioid peptides in a sodium- and GTP-sensitive fashion with affinities virtually identical to those displayed by the rat mu opiate receptor.	348	544
7905839	Effects on cyclic AMP are similar to those noted for the rat mu opiate receptor.	545	625
7905839	An 18 kb genomic clone hybridizing with the h mu OR1 cDNA contains 63 and 489 bp exonic sequences flanked by splice donor/acceptor sequences.	626	767
7905839	Analysis of hybridization to DNA prepared from human rodent hybrid cell lines and chromosomal in situ hybridization studies indicate localization to 6q24-25.	768	925
7905839	An MspI polymorphism, producing a 3.7 kb band, may prove useful in assessing this gene's involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders involving opiatergic systems.	926	1086
8755918	Mutations associated with variant phenotypes in ataxia-telangiectasia.	0	70
8755918	We have identified 14 families with ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) in which mutation of the ATM gene is associated with a less severe clinical and cellular phenotype (approximately 10% -15% of A-T families identified in the United Kingdom).	71	308
8755918	In 10 of these families, all the homozygotes have a 137-bp insertion in their cDNA caused by a point mutation in a sequence resembling a splice-donor site.	309	464
8755918	The second A-T allele has a different mutation in each patient.	465	528
8755918	We show that the less severe phenotype in these patients is caused by some degree of normal splicing, which occurs as an alternative product from the insertion-containing allele.	529	707
8755918	The level of the 137-bp PCR product containing the insertion was lowest in two patients who showed a later onset of cerebellar ataxia.	708	842
8755918	A further four families who do not have this insertion have been identified.	843	919
8755918	Mutations detected in two of four of these are missense mutations, normally rare in A-T patients.	920	1017
8755918	The demonstration of mutations giving rise to a slightly milder phenotype in A-T raises the interesting question of what range of phenotypes might occur in individuals in whom both mutations are milder.	1018	1220
8755918	One possibility might be that individuals who are compound heterozygotes for ATM mutations are more common than we realize..	1221	1345
8829135	Nefiracetam (DM-9384) reverses apomorphine-induced amnesia of a passive avoidance response: delayed emergence of the memory retention effects.	0	142
8829135	Nefiracetam is a novel pyrrolidone derivative which attenuates scopolamine-induced learning and post-training consolidation deficits.	143	276
8829135	Given that apomorphine inhibits passive avoidance retention when given during training or in a defined 10-12h post-training period, we evaluated the ability of nefiracetam to attenuate amnesia induced by dopaminergic agonism.	277	502
8829135	A step-down passive avoidance paradigm was employed and nefiracetam (3 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) were given alone or in combination during training and at the 10-12h post-training period of consolidation.	503	716
8829135	Co-administration of nefiracetam and apomorphine during training or 10h thereafter produced no significant anti-amnesic effect.	717	844
8829135	However, administration of nefiracetam during training completely reversed the amnesia induced by apomorphine at the 10h post-training time and the converse was also true.	845	1016
8829135	These effects were not mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism as nefiracetam, at millimolar concentrations, failed to displace either [3H]SCH 23390 or [3H]spiperone binding from D1 or D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively.	1017	1243
8829135	It is suggested that nefiracetam augments molecular processes in the early stages of events which ultimately lead to consolidation of memory.	1244	1385
9294109	Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells.	0	113
9294109	Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults, is caused by (CTG) n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase (DM protein kinase; DMPK) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis.	114	348
9294109	To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis, we have compared the resting [Ca2 +] i, the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2 + transients, and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and DMPK [-/-] knockout mice.	349	656
9294109	In vitro-differentiated DMPK [-/-] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [Ca2 +] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2 + and Na + channels.	657	854
9294109	The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K +.	855	972
9294109	In addition, we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l-type Ca2 + channel.	973	1114
9294109	Neither the content nor the activity of Na +/K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase are affected by DMPK absence.	1115	1241
9294109	In conclusion, our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle..	1242	1384
9647766	cDNA sequence and chromosomal localization of the remaining three human nuclear encoded iron sulphur protein (IP) subunits of complex I: the human IP fraction is completed.	0	172
9647766	NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be fragmented in a flavoprotein (FP), iron-sulfur protein (IP), and hydrophobic protein (HP) subfraction.	173	364
9647766	The IP subfraction is hypothesized to be significant, since it contains important prosthetic groups highly conserved among species.	365	496
9647766	We cloned the cDNA of three remaining human NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits of this IP fraction: the NDUFS2 (49 kDa), NDUFS3 (30 kDa), and NDUFS6 (13 kDa) subunits.	497	669
9647766	All presented cDNAs include the complete open reading frame (ORF), which consist of 1392, 795, and 375 base pairs, coding for 463, 264, and 124 amino acids, respectively.	670	840
9647766	The latter show 96, 90, and 83% homology with the corresponding bovine translation products.	841	933
9647766	The 3' untranslated regions (UTR) are complete in all three cDNAs.	934	1000
9647766	Polymerase chain reaction performed with DNA isolated from somatic human-rodent cell hybrids containing defined human chromosomes as template gave a human-specific signal which mapped the NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 subunits to chromosomes 1 and 11, respectively.	1001	1254
9647766	In the case of the NDUFS6 subunit a pseudogene may be present since signals were seen in the lanes containing chromosomes 5 and 6.	1255	1385
9647766	The NDUFS2 contains a highly conserved protein kinase C phosphorylation site and the NDUFS3 subunit contains a highly conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site which make them strong candidates for future mutation detection studies in enzymatic complex I-deficient patients.	1386	1666
9672936	Pethidine-associated seizure in a healthy adolescent receiving pethidine for postoperative pain control.	0	104
9672936	A healthy 17-year-old male received standard intermittent doses of pethidine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for management of postoperative pain control.	105	273
9672936	Twenty-three h postoperatively he developed a brief self-limited seizure.	274	347
9672936	Both plasma pethidine and norpethidine were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation.	348	491
9672936	No other risk factors for CNS toxicity were identified.	492	547
9672936	This method allowed frequent self-dosing of pethidine at short time intervals and rapid accumulation of pethidine and norpethidine.	548	679
9672936	The routine use of pethidine via PCA even for a brief postoperative analgesia should be reconsidered.	680	781
9746003	Inappropriate use of carbamazepine and vigabatrin in typical absence seizures.	0	78
9746003	Carbamazepine and vigabatrin are contraindicated in typical absence seizures.	79	156
9746003	Of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only, eight were erroneously treated with carbamazepine either as monotherapy or as an add-on.	157	323
9746003	Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children.	324	382
9746003	Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic jerks, which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine.	383	549
9746003	Absences were aggravated in both cases where vigabatrin was added on to concurrent treatment.	550	643
9746003	Optimal control of the absences was achieved with sodium valproate, lamotrigine, or ethosuximide alone or in combination.	644	765
10491763	Hepatocyte nuclear factor-6: associations between genetic variability and type II diabetes and between genetic variability and estimates of insulin secretion.	0	158
10491763	The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-6 is an upstream regulator of several genes involved in the pathogenesis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young.	159	329
10491763	We therefore tested the hypothesis that variability in the HNF-6 gene is associated with subsets of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and estimates of insulin secretion in glucose tolerant subjects.	330	544
10491763	We cloned the coding region as well as the intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-6 gene.	547	631
10491763	We then examined them on genomic DNA in six MODY probands without mutations in the MODY1, MODY3 and MODY4 genes and in 54 patients with late-onset Type II diabetes by combined single strand conformational polymorphism-heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of identified variants.	632	925
10491763	An identified missense variant was examined in association studies and genotype-phenotype studies.	926	1024
10491763	We identified two silent and one missense (Pro75 Ala) variant.	1027	1089
10491763	In an association study the allelic frequency of the Pro75Ala polymorphism was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5) in 330 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus compared with 4.2% (2.4-6.0) in 238 age-matched glucose tolerant control subjects.	1090	1338
10491763	Moreover, in studies of 238 middle-aged glucose tolerant subjects, of 226 glucose tolerant offspring of Type II diabetic patients and of 367 young healthy subjects, the carriers of the polymorphism did not differ from non-carriers in glucose induced serum insulin or C-peptide responses.	1339	1626
10491763	Mutations in the coding region of the HNF-6 gene are not associated with Type II diabetes or with changes in insulin responses to glucose among the Caucasians examined.	1629	1797
10661407	Langerin, a novel C-type lectin specific to Langerhans cells, is an endocytic receptor that induces the formation of Birbeck granules.	0	134
10661407	We have identified a type II Ca2+-dependent lectin displaying mannose-binding specificity, exclusively expressed by Langerhans cells (LC), and named Langerin.	135	293
10661407	LC are uniquely characterized by Birbeck granules (BG), which are organelles consisting of superimposed and zippered membranes.	294	421
10661407	Here, we have shown that Langerin is constitutively associated with BG and that antibody to Langerin is internalized into these structures.	422	561
10661407	Remarkably, transfection of Langerin cDNA into fibroblasts created a compact network of membrane structures with typical features of BG.	562	698
10661407	Langerin is thus a potent inducer of membrane superimposition and zippering leading to BG formation.	699	799
10661407	Our data suggest that induction of BG is a consequence of the antigen-capture function of Langerin, allowing routing into these organelles and providing access to a nonclassical antigen-processing pathway.	800	1005
10788334	Founder mutations in the BRCA1 gene in Polish families with breast-ovarian cancer.	0	82
10788334	We have undertaken a hospital-based study, to identify possible BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations in the Polish population.	83	206
10788334	The study group consisted of 66 Polish families with cancer who have at least three related females affected with breast or ovarian cancer and who had cancer diagnosed, in at least one of the three affected females, at age < 50 years.	207	441
10788334	A total of 26 families had both breast and ovarian cancers, 4 families had ovarian cancers only, and 36 families had breast cancers only.	442	579
10788334	Genomic DNA was prepared from the peripheral blood leukocytes of at least one affected woman from each family.	580	690
10788334	The entire coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was screened for the presence of germline mutations, by use of SSCP followed by direct sequencing of observed variants.	691	854
10788334	Mutations were found in 35 (53%) of the 66 families studied.	855	915
10788334	All but one of the mutations were detected within the BRCA1 gene.	916	981
10788334	BRCA1 abnormalities were identified in all four families with ovarian cancer only, in 67% of 27 families with both breast and ovarian cancer, and in 34% of 35 families with breast cancer only.	982	1174
10788334	The single family with a BRCA2 mutation had the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome.	1175	1254
10788334	Seven distinct mutations were identified; five of these occurred in two or more families.	1255	1344
10788334	In total, recurrent mutations were found in 33 (94%) of the 35 families with detected mutations.	1345	1441
10788334	Three BRCA1 abnormalities - 5382insC, C61G, and 4153delA - accounted for 51%, 20%, and 11% of the identified mutations, respectively..	1442	1576
11009181	Apomorphine: an underutilized therapy for Parkinson's disease.	0	62
11009181	Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	63	158
11009181	While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study.	159	396
11009181	A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings.	397	720
11009181	Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off-time by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add-on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors.	721	967
11009181	Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of apomorphine efficacy.	968	1076
11009181	In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa-induced dyskinesias.	1077	1277
11009181	The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role.	1278	1452
11009181	Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson's disease, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.	1453	1623
11054569	Rab6c, a new member of the rab gene family, is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells.	0	94
11054569	A new Rab6 homolog cDNA, Rab6c, was discovered by a hypermethylated DNA fragment probe that was isolated from a human multidrug resistant (MDR) breast cancer cell line, MCF7/AdrR, by the methylation sensitive-representational difference analysis (MS-RDA) technique.	95	360
11054569	Rab6c was found to be under-expressed in MCF7/AdrR and MES-SA/Dx5 (a human MDR uterine sarcoma cell line) compared with their non-MDR parental cell lines.	361	515
11054569	MCF7/AdrR cells expressing the exogenous Rab6c exhibited less resistance to several anti-cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), taxol, vinblastine, and vincristine, than the control cells containing the empty vector.	516	734
11054569	Flow cytometry experiments confirmed that the transfectants' diminished resistance to DOX was caused by increased drug accumulation induced by the exogenous Rab6c.	735	898
11054569	These results indicate that Rab6c is involved in drug resistance in MCF7/AdrR cells.	899	983
11773892	End-stage renal disease (ESRD) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) using calcineurin-based immunotherapy: risk of development and treatment.	0	150
11773892	BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic.	151	251
11773892	Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has dramatically improved success rates.	252	345
11773892	Recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).	346	467
11773892	This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure (CRF) in OLTX patients.	468	587
11773892	METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834).	588	728
11773892	Our prospectively collected database was the source of information.	729	796
11773892	Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD, n=748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and ESRD, n=45.	797	936
11773892	Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of ESRD therapy, and survival from onset of ESRD.	937	1097
11773892	RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5%).	1098	1208
11773892	Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine.	1209	1491
11773892	Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively.	1492	1826
11773892	Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group.	1827	2026
11773892	Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants.	2027	2232
11773892	CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate.	2233	2325
11773892	The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only.	2326	2428
11773892	Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome.	2429	2559
11773892	However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD.	2560	2687
11773892	New strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication.	2688	2779
12442272	D90A-SOD1 mediated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a single founder for all cases with evidence for a Cis-acting disease modifier in the recessive haplotype.	0	156
12442272	More than 100 different heterozygous mutations in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease.	157	351
12442272	Uniquely, D90A-SOD1 has been identified in recessive, dominant and apparently sporadic pedigrees.	352	449
12442272	The phenotype of homozygotes is stereotyped with an extended survival, whereas that of affected heterozygotes varies.	450	567
12442272	The frequency of D90A-SOD1 is 50 times higher in Scandinavia (2.5%) than elsewhere, though ALS prevalence is not raised there.	568	694
12442272	Our earlier study indicated separate founders for recessive and dominant/sporadic ALS and we proposed a disease-modifying factor linked to the recessive mutation.	695	857
12442272	Here we have doubled our sample set and employed novel markers to characterise the mutation's origin and localise any modifying factor.	858	993
12442272	Linkage disequilibrium analysis indicates that D90A homozygotes and heterozygotes share a rare haplotype and are all descended from a single ancient founder (alpha 0.974) c.895 generations ago.	994	1187
12442272	Homozygotes arose subsequently only c.63 generations ago (alpha 0.878).	1188	1259
12442272	Recombination has reduced the region shared by recessive kindreds to 97-265 kb around SOD1, excluding all neighbouring genes.	1260	1385
12442272	We propose that a cis-acting regulatory polymorphism has arisen close to D90A-SOD1 in the recessive founder, which decreases ALS susceptibility in heterozygotes and slows disease progression.	1386	1577
14722929	Low frequency of deafness-associated GJB2 variants in Kenya and Sudan and novel GJB2 variants.	0	94
14722929	A large proportion of non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (NSARD) in many populations is caused by variants of the GJB2 gene.	95	227
14722929	Here, the frequency of GJB2 variants was studied in 406 and 183 apparently unrelated children from Kenya and Sudan, respectively, with mostly severe to profound non-syndromic deafness.	228	412
14722929	Nine (2.2 %) Kenyan and 12 (6.6 %) of the Sudanese children only were carriers of variants within the coding sequence of the GJB2 gene.	413	548
14722929	Variants in the 5'-adjacent region were detected in further 115 individuals.	549	625
14722929	A total of 10 novel variants was recognized, among them four variants in the adjacent 5'-region of the GJB2 coding exon 2 (g.3318-6T>A, g.3318-15C>T, g.3318-34C>T, g.3318-35T>G), a 6 base-pair deletion (g.3455_3460del [p.Asp46_Gln48delinsGlu]), a variant leading to a stop codon (g.3512C>A [p.Tyr65X]), synonymous variants (g.3395C>T [p.Thr26], g.3503C>T [p.Asn62], g.3627A>C [p.Arg104]), and one non-synonymous variant (g.3816C>A [p.Val167Met]).	626	1072
14722929	In addition, the previously described variants g.3352delG (commonly designated 30delG or 35 delG), g.3426G>A [p.Val37Ile], g.3697G>A [p.Arg127His], g.3774G>A [p.Val153Ile], and g.3795G>A [p.Gly160Ser] were identified.	1073	1290
14722929	With the exception of g.3318-34C>T and g.3352delG, all variants occurred heterozygously.	1291	1379
14722929	For most of the variants identified in the Kenyan and Sudanese study population, a causative association with NSARD appears to be unlikely.	1380	1519
14722929	Compared to many other ethnic groups, deafness-associated variants of the coding region of GJB2 are rare in Sudan and Kenya, suggesting a role of other genetic, or epigenetic factors as a cause for deafness in these countries.	1520	1746
15000256	Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the FMR1 gene in autistic and mentally retarded children in Japan.	0	118
15000256	Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in males, and patients with fragile X syndrome occasionally develop autism.	119	268
15000256	It is usually caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, but in a small number of patients deletions and point mutations have been identified.	269	467
15000256	We screened all 17 exons of the FMR1 gene for mutations in 90 autistic or mentally retarded children using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis.	468	663
15000256	No mutations were found in 76 male patients.	664	708
15000256	However, one female patient was heterozygous for a normal allele and a mutant allele with an A to C substitution at nucleotide 879 in exon 9.	709	850
15000256	This mutation was not found in 50 controls.	851	894
15000256	Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that a large proportion of the mutant transcripts were spliced aberrantly, causing premature termination of the protein synthesis.	895	1060
15000256	Although uncommon, point mutations in the FMR1 gene may be a cause of autism and mental retardation in Japanese patients.	1061	1182
15018851	Comparison of sequential cytomegalovirus isolates in a patient with lymphoma and failing antiviral therapy.	0	107
15018851	BACKGROUND: Long-term anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) treatments in immunocompromised patients are hampered by resistance to antiviral drugs.	108	244
15018851	Longitudinal changes in the resistance genotype may depend on changes in selective pressure and the complexity of CMV isolates.	245	372
15018851	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate longitudinal changes in the CMV resistance genotype and phenotype along with strain-specific variability in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in whom successive anti-CMV treatments failed.	373	588
15018851	STUDY DESIGN: The resistance phenotype and genotype of seven CMV isolates collected from one patient during a 2-year follow-up period were retrospectively analysed.	589	753
15018851	In parallel, we used glycoprotein B (gB) genotyping, and a- and UL10-13-sequence analysis to study CMV interstrain variability.	754	881
15018851	RESULTS: The patient was infected by at least three CMV strains plus variants of the parental strains.	882	984
15018851	Resistance to ganciclovir, cidofovir and foscarnet was successively detected during the follow-up period.	985	1090
15018851	UL97 protein kinase changes responsible for resistance to ganciclovir were initially detected at residues 591 and 592, and then at position 594.	1091	1235
15018851	Decreased sensitivity to foscarnet coincided with the appearance of amino acid substitution N495K in DNA polymerase, whereas cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir was due to the L501I substitution.	1236	1441
15018851	CONCLUSIONS: The CMV isolates obtained from our patient were complex mixtures of strains.	1442	1531
15018851	Changes in resistance genotypes depended on resistance selective pressure and were not linked to interstrain variation.	1532	1651
15033202	Nijmegen breakage syndrome in 13% of age-matched Czech children with primary microcephaly.	0	90
15033202	The Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive chromosomal instability disorder characterized by early growth retardation, congenital microcephaly, immunodeficiency, borderline mental development, and a high tendency to lymphoreticular malignancies.	91	354
15033202	Most Nijmegen breakage syndrome patients are of Slavonic origin, and all of them known so far carry a founder homozygous 5 nucleotide deletion in the NBS1 gene.	355	515
15033202	Microcephaly was present in 100% of Nijmegen breakage syndrome patients in a recent large international cooperative study.	516	638
15033202	The frequency of Nijmegen breakage syndrome among children with primary microcephaly was not known.	639	738
15033202	Early correct diagnosis of the syndrome is crucial for appropriate preventive care and therapy.	739	834
15033202	We tested 67 Czech patients of different ages with simple microcephaly for the presence of the most common mutation in the NBS1 gene.	835	968
15033202	Three new Nijmegen breakage syndrome cases were detected in this cohort, representing 4.5% of the cohort.	969	1074
15033202	All these newly diagnosed Nijmegen breakage syndrome patients were younger than 10 months at the time of diagnosis.	1075	1190
15033202	They were all born within a 2.5-year period.	1191	1235
15033202	Twenty-three of the 67 children in the cohort were born within this 2.5-year period, representing a 13% incidence of Nijmegen breakage syndrome.	1236	1380
15033202	Frequency of Nijmegen breakage syndrome heterozygotes among infants in the Czech Republic is 1: 130-158 and the birth rate is 90,000 per year, therefore in the time span of 2.5 years, three new Nijmegen breakage syndrome homozygotes are expected to be born.	1381	1638
15033202	Therefore we assume that by DNA testing of Czech primary microcephalic children it is possible to detect all Nijmegen breakage syndrome patients to be expected.	1639	1799
15033202	The age at correct diagnosis was lowered from 7.1 years at the time before DNA testing, to well under 1 year of age.	1800	1916
15033202	All new Nijmegen breakage syndrome patients could receive appropriate preventive care, which should significantly improve their life expectancy and prognosis.	1917	2075
15042318	Atrial fibrillation following chemotherapy for stage IIIE diffuse large B-cell gastric lymphoma in a patient with myotonic dystrophy (Steinert's disease).	0	154
15042318	The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B-cell gastric lymphoma and myotonic dystrophy, the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, and sudden atrial fibrillation following one cycle of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in the same patient.	155	419
15042318	Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy.	420	533
15042318	The cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient.	534	725
15064320	Compound heterozygous mutations in the SRD5A2 gene exon 4 in a male pseudohermaphrodite patient of Chinese origin.	0	114
15064320	The goal of this study was to perform 5-alpha-reductase type 2 gene (SRD5A2) analysis in a male pseudohermaphrodite (MPH) patient with normal testosterone (T) production and normal androgen receptor (AR) gene coding sequences.	115	341
15064320	A patient of Chinese origin with ambiguous genitalia at 14 months, a 46,XY karyotype, and normal T secretion under human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation underwent a gonadectomy at 20 months.	342	541
15064320	Exons 1-8 of the AR gene and exons 1-5 of the SRD5A2 gene were sequenced from peripheral blood DNA.	542	641
15064320	AR gene coding sequences were normal.	642	679
15064320	SRD5A2 gene analysis revealed 2 consecutive mutations in exon 4, each located in a different allele: 1) a T nucleotide deletion, which predicts a frameshift mutation from codon 219, and 2) a missense mutation at codon 227, where the substitution of guanine (CGA) by adenine (CAA) predicts a glutamine replacement of arginine (R227Q).	680	1013
15064320	Testes located in the inguinal canal showed a normal morphology for age.	1014	1086
15064320	The patient was a compound heterozygote for SRD5A2 mutations, carrying 2 mutations in exon 4.	1087	1180
15064320	The patient showed an R227Q mutation that has been described in an Asian population and MPH patients, along with a novel frameshift mutation, Tdel219.	1181	1331
15064320	Testis morphology showed that, during early infancy, the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme deficiency may not have affected interstitial or tubular development.	1332	1483
15069170	Four novel mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter gene in Japanese patients with Gitelman's syndrome.	0	119
15069170	BACKGROUND: Gitelman's syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from inactivating mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter (NCCT) gene.	120	289
15069170	To date, almost 90 mutations have been identified.	290	340
15069170	It is possible that there is a population-specific distribution of mutations.	341	418
15069170	In this study, we analysed mutations in the NCCT gene of seven Japanese patients with GS.	419	508
15069170	METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from patients with GS, their family members and healthy control subjects.	509	640
15069170	A mutation analysis of the NCCT gene was performed completely by direct automated sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA products.	641	786
15069170	In patients with a deletion or splice site mutation, we undertook cDNA sequence analysis.	787	876
15069170	RESULTS: We identified nine mutations.	877	915
15069170	Five of them [c.185C>T (Thr60Met), c.1712C>T (Ala569Val), c.1930C>T (Arg642Cys), c.2552T>A (Leu849His) and c.1932delC] have been reported in Japanese patients, but not in GS patients from other ethnic groups.	916	1124
15069170	The remaining four mutations [c.7A>T (Met1Leu), c.1181_1186+20del26, c.1811_1812delAT and IVS16+1G>A] were novel.	1125	1238
15069170	In cDNA derived from a patient with c.1181_1186+20del26, a deletion of exon 9 and a frameshift at the start of exon 10 were observed.	1239	1372
15069170	In cDNA derived from patients with IVS16+1G>A, an additional 96 bp insertion between exons 16 and 17 was observed.	1373	1487
15069170	Six out of seven patients were compound heterozygotes, and the remaining one carried a single heterozygous mutation.	1488	1604
15069170	CONCLUSIONS: We found four novel mutations in the NCCT gene in seven Japanese patients with GS.	1605	1700
15069170	Moreover, our study suggests that the distribution of mutations in the NCCT gene in Japanese GS patients potentially differs from that in other populations.	1701	1857
15086325	Identification of three F5 gene mutations associated with inherited coagulation factor V deficiency in two Chinese pedigrees.	0	125
15086325	To investigate the molecular defects in two Chinese pedigrees with inherited factor V (FV) deficiency.	126	228
15086325	A 37-year-old male (proband 1) and an 18-month-old boy (proband 2) were diagnosed as inherited coagulation FV deficiency by severely reduced plasma levels of FV activity and antigen.	229	411
15086325	All 25 exons and their flanking sequence of F5 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for both probands and the PCR products were directly sequenced.	412	577
15086325	Total RNA was extracted from the peripheral lymphocytes of proband 1 for detecting the changes at mRNA level.	578	687
15086325	The homozygous deletion IVS8 -2A>G was identified in the F5 gene of proband 1 and complementary DNA (cDNA) analysis revealed the abolishment of the canonical splicing site by the mutation and the activation of the cryptic acceptor site 24 bp upstream instead.	688	947
15086325	The insertion introduced eight additional amino acids (AA) into the FV protein.	948	1027
15086325	Two heterozygous mutations of F5 gene were discovered in proband 2.	1028	1095
15086325	The 2238-9del AG in exon 13 introduced a premature termination code at 689 AA and the substitution of G6410 by T in exon 23 lead to the missense mutation Gly2079Val.	1096	1261
15086325	Three F5 gene mutations, IVS8 -2A>G, 2238-9del AG and G6410T, have been identified in two Chinese pedigree with congenital FV deficiency, respectively.	1262	1413
15111599	CRYBA3/A1 gene mutation associated with suture-sparing autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract: a novel phenotype.	0	121
15111599	PURPOSE: To identify the genetic defect leading to the congenital nuclear cataract affecting a large five-generation Swiss family.	122	252
15111599	METHODS: Family history and clinical data were recorded.	253	309
15111599	The phenotype was documented by both slit lamp and Scheimpflug photography.	310	385
15111599	One cortical lens was evaluated by electron microscopy after cataract extraction.	386	467
15111599	Lenticular phenotyping and genotyping were performed independently with short tandem repeat polymorphism.	468	573
15111599	Linkage analysis was performed, and candidate genes were PCR amplified and screened for mutations on both strands using direct sequencing.	574	712
15111599	RESULTS: Affected individuals had a congenital nuclear lactescent cataract in both eyes.	713	801
15111599	Linkage was observed on chromosome 17 for DNA marker D17S1857 (lod score: 3.44 at theta = 0).	802	895
15111599	Direct sequencing of CRYBA3/A1, which maps to the vicinity, revealed an in-frame 3-bp deletion in exon 4 (279delGAG).	896	1013
15111599	This mutation involved a deletion of glycine-91, cosegregated in all affected individuals, and was not observed in unaffected individuals or in 250 normal control subjects from the same ethnic background.	1014	1218
15111599	Electron microscopy showed that cortical lens fiber morphology was normal.	1219	1293
15111599	CONCLUSIONS: The DeltaG91 mutation in CRYBA3/A1 is associated with an autosomal dominant congenital nuclear lactescent cataract.	1294	1422
15111599	A splice mutation (IVS3+1G/A) in this gene has been reported in a zonular cataract with sutural opacities.	1423	1529
15111599	These results indicate phenotypic heterogeneity related to mutations in this gene.	1530	1612
15122711	POLG mutations associated with Alpers' syndrome and mitochondrial DNA depletion.	0	80
15122711	Alpers' syndrome is a fatal neurogenetic disorder first described more than 70 years ago.	81	170
15122711	It is an autosomal recessive, developmental mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder characterized by deficiency in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) catalytic activity, refractory seizures, neurodegeneration, and liver disease.	171	403
15122711	In two unrelated pedigrees of Alpers' syndrome, each affected child was found to carry a homozygous mutation in exon 17 of the POLG locus that led to a Glu873Stop mutation just upstream of the polymerase domain of the protein.	404	630
15122711	In addition, each affected child was heterozygous for the G1681A mutation in exon 7 that led to an Ala467Thr substitution in POLG, within the linker region of the protein.	631	802
15130900	Urinary bladder cancer in Wegener's granulomatosis: risks and relation to cyclophosphamide.	0	91
15130900	OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer, and its relation to cyclophosphamide, in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.	92	238
15130900	METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified.	239	392
15130900	Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified.	393	517
15130900	Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk.	518	700
15130900	In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener's granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, were also estimated.	701	918
15130900	RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively.	919	1053
15130900	The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9).	1054	1186
15130900	Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69).	1187	1302
15130900	The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, and a history of bladder cancer was (non-significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.	1303	1557
15130900	CONCLUSION: The results indicate a dose-response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before Wegener's granulomatosis.	1558	1809
15177686	Altered replication timing of the HIRA/Tuple1 locus in the DiGeorge and Velocardiofacial syndromes.	0	99
15177686	DiGeorge and Velocardiofacial syndromes (DGS/VCFS) are endowed by a similar complex phenotype including cardiovascular, craniofacial, and thymic malformations, and are associated with heterozygous deletions of 22q11 chromosomal band.	100	333
15177686	The Typically Deleted Region in the 22q11.21 subband (here called TDR22) is very gene-dense, and the extent of the deletion has been defined precisely in several studies.	334	504
15177686	However, to date there is no evidence for a mechanism of haploinsufficiency that can fully explain the DGS/VCFS phenotype.	505	627
15177686	In this study, we show that the candidate gene HIRA/Tuple1 mapping on the non-deleted TDR22, in DGS/VCFS subjects presents a delayed replication timing.	628	780
15177686	Moreover, we observed an increase in the cell ratio showing the HIRA/Tuple1 locus localised toward the nuclear periphery.	781	902
15177686	It is known that replication timing and nuclear location are generally correlated to the transcription activity of the relative DNA region.	903	1042
15177686	We propose that the alteration in the replication/nuclear location pattern of the non-deleted TDR22 indicates an altered gene regulation hence an altered transcritpion in DGS/VCFS.	1043	1223
15184369	Ca2+ dependence of the Ca2+-selective TRPV6 channel.	0	52
15184369	Microfluorimetry and patch-clamp experiments were performed on TRPV6-expressing HEK cells to determine whether this Ca(2+)-sensing Ca(2+) channel is constitutively active.	53	224
15184369	Intact cells loaded with fura-2 had an elevated intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ((i)), which decreased to the same level such as in non-transfected cells if external Ca(2+) was chelated by EGTA.	225	427
15184369	Whole cell recordings from non-transfected HEK cells and cells expressing human TRPV6 revealed the presence of a basal inward current in both types of cells when the internal solution contained 0.1 mm EGTA and 100 nm (i) or if the cytosolic Ca(2+) buffering remained undisturbed in perforated patch-clamp experiments.	428	745
15184369	If recombinantly expressed TRPV6 forms open channels, one would expect Ca(2+)-induced current inhibition, because TRPV6 is negatively regulated by internal Ca(2+).	746	909
15184369	However, dialyzing solutions with high  such as 1 microm into TRPV6-expressing cells did not block the basal inward current, which was not different from the recordings from non-transfected cells.	910	1106
15184369	In contrast, dialyzing 0.5 mm EGTA into TRPV6-expressing cells readily activated Ca(2+) inward currents, which were undetectable in non-transfected cells.	1107	1261
15184369	Interestingly, monovalent cations permeated the TRPV6 channels under conditions where no Ca(2+) permeation was detectable, indicating that divalent cations block TRPV6 channels from the extracellular side.	1262	1467
15184369	Like human TRPV6, the truncated human TRPV6(Delta695-725), which lacks the C-terminal domain required for Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding, does not form constitutive active channels, whereas the human TRPV6(D542A), carrying a point mutation in the presumed pore region, does not function as a channel.	1468	1763
15184369	In summary, no constitutive open TRPV6 channels were detected in patch-clamp experiments from transfected HEK cells.	1764	1880
15184369	However, channel activity is highly regulated by intracellular and extracellular divalent cations.	1881	1979
15191352	Severe form of thyroid hormone resistance in a patient with homozygous/hemizygous mutation of T3 receptor gene.	0	111
15191352	Resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (RTH) is a rare disorder, usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.	112	226
15191352	Patients with RTH are usually euthyroid but can occasionally present with signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis or rarely with hypothyroidism.	227	368
15191352	Affected individuals are usually heterozygous for mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene (TR-beta).	369	481
15191352	We present a patient with RTH found to be homo-/hemizygous for a mutation in the TR-beta gene.	482	576
15191352	The single nucleotide substitution I280S (1123T-->G) was present either on both alleles or in a hemizygous form with complete deletion of the second allele.	577	733
15191352	The I280S mutation was recently reported in a heterozygous patient.	734	801
15191352	The severe phenotype with seriously impaired intellectual development, hyperkinetic behaviour, tachycardia, hearing and visual impairment is probably due to the dominant negative effect of the I280S mutant protein and the absence of any functional TR-beta.	802	1058
15198485	Evaluation of the Lys198Asn and -134delA genetic polymorphisms of the endothelin-1 gene.	0	88
15198485	Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and shows various pharmacological responses.	89	181
15198485	Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ET-1 gene (EDN1) have been reported to be associated with blood pressure (BP).	182	303
15198485	One is the Lys198Asn polymorphism, which showed a positive association with BP in overweight people.	304	404
15198485	Another is the 3A/4A polymorphism (-134delA) located in the 5'-untranslated region.	405	488
15198485	In this study, we investigated the expression of the Lys198Asn polymorphism in ET-1 in vitro, as well as the association between either of the two polymorphisms and the plasma ET-1 level.	489	676
15198485	We expressed both the major (Lys-type) and minor type (Asn-type) preproET-1 in three different cell lines, and measured the levels of ET-1 and big ET-1 in the culture supernatant.	677	856
15198485	There was no significant difference in the levels of ET-1 or big ET-1 between the Asn-type and Lys-type transfectant.	857	974
15198485	In the association study, the plasma levels of ET-1 in 54 hypertensive patients having an amino acid substitution from Lys to Asn at position 198 were not different from those of hypertensives without the substitution.	975	1193
15198485	However, we found a significant difference in ET-1 levels between individuals with the 3A/3A and 3A/4A genotypes.	1194	1307
15198485	Our transient expression study indicates that the Lys198Asn polymorphism may not directly affect ET-1 and big ET-1 production.	1308	1434
15198485	Another variant in the EDN1 gene in linkage disequilibrium with the Lys198Asn polymorphism may be responsible for the association with BP, or the interaction between the EDN1 Lys198Asn polymorphism and other factors such as obesity may be involved in the mechanisms elevating BP in vivo.	1435	1722
15200408	Lack of major involvement of human uroplakin genes in vesicoureteral reflux: implications for disease heterogeneity.	0	116
15200408	BACKGROUND: Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the retrograde flow of urine into the ureters and kidneys.	117	265
15200408	It affects about 1% of the young children and is thus one of the most common hereditary diseases.	266	363
15200408	Its associated nephropathy is an important cause of end-stage renal failure in children and adults.	364	463
15200408	Recent studies indicate that genetic ablation of mouse uroplakin (UP) III gene, which encodes a 47 kD urothelial-specific integral membrane protein forming urothelial plaques, causes VUR and hydronephrosis.	464	670
15200408	METHODS: To begin to determine whether mutations in UP genes might play a role in human VUR, we genotyped all four UP genes in 76 patients with radiologically proven primary VUR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of all their exons plus 50 to 150 bp of flanking intronic sequences.	671	981
15200408	RESULTS: Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, seven of which were missense, with no truncation or frame shift mutations.	982	1130
15200408	Since healthy relatives of the VUR probands are not reliable negative controls for VUR, we used a population of 90 race-matched, healthy individuals, unrelated to the VUR patients, as controls to perform an association study.	1131	1356
15200408	Most of the SNPs were not found to be significantly associated with VUR.	1357	1429
15200408	However, SNP1 of UP Ia gene affecting a C to T conversion and an Ala7Val change, and SNP7 of UP III affecting a C to G conversion and a Pro154Ala change, were marginally associated with VUR (both P= 0.08).	1430	1635
15200408	Studies of additional cases yielded a second set of data that, in combination with the first set, confirmed a weak association of UP III SNP7 in VUR (P= 0.036 adjusted for both subsets of cases vs. controls).	1636	1844
15200408	CONCLUSION: Such a weak association and the lack of families with simple dominant Mendelian inheritance suggest that missense changes of uroplakin genes cannot play a dominant role in causing VUR in humans, although they may be weak risk factors contributing to a complex polygenic disease.	1845	2135
15200408	The fact that no truncation or frame shift mutations have been found in any of the VUR patients, coupled with our recent finding that some breeding pairs of UP III knockout mice yield litters that show not only VUR, but also severe hydronephrosis and neonatal death, raises the possibility that major uroplakin mutations could be embryonically or postnatally lethal in humans.	2136	2512
15233872	Cardioprotective effect of tincture of Crataegus on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.	0	104
15233872	Tincture of Crataegus (TCR), an alcoholic extract of the berries of hawthorn (Crataegus oxycantha), is used in herbal and homeopathic medicine.	105	248
15233872	The present study was done to investigate the protective effect of TCR on experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats.	249	376
15233872	Pretreatment of TCR, at a dose of 0.5 mL/100 g bodyweight per day, orally for 30 days, prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and activity of marker enzymes observed in isoproterenol-induced rats (85 mg kg(-1) s. c. for 2 days at an interval of 24 h).	377	634
15233872	TCR prevented the isoproterenol-induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the rate of ADP-stimulated oxygen uptake and respiratory coupling ratio.	635	806
15233872	TCR protected against pathological changes induced by isoproterenol in rat heart.	807	888
15233872	The results show that pretreatment with TCR may be useful in preventing the damage induced by isoproterenol in rat heart.	889	1010
15241482	Paraoxonase 1 polymorphisms and survival.	0	41
15241482	The antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) has previously been suggested to confer protection against coronary heart disease (CHD), one of the main causes of death in the Western world.	42	228
15241482	Two coding polymorphisms, 55M/L and 192Q/R, and a promoter variant, -107C/T, has been extensively studied with respect to susceptibility to CHD.	229	373
15241482	In this study, we have investigated the impact of these three polymorphisms on mortality using a sample of 1932 Danish individuals aged 47-93 years, previously used in gene-longevity studies.	374	565
15241482	A cross-sectional study comparing the genotype distribution of the three polymorphisms separately as well as the haplotype distribution in different age groups did not reveal any difference.	566	756
15241482	However, a longitudinal follow-up study on survival in the same sample indicated that 192RR homozygotes have a poorer survival compared to QQ homozygotes (hazard rate: 1.38, P = 0.04).	757	941
15241482	We hereafter used an independent sample of 541 Danish individuals from the oldest cohort and confirmed the initial findings (hazard rate: 1.38, P = 0.09).	942	1096
15241482	In both samples, the effect was most pronounced in women.	1097	1154
15241482	Using self-reported data on ischemic heart disease to evaluate the impact of the PON 192Q/R polymorphism on susceptibility to CHD, we found only a nonsignificant trend of 192RR homozygosity in women being a risk factor.	1155	1374
15241482	Our results thus indicates that PON1 192RR homozygosity is associated with increased mortality in women in the second half of life and that this increased mortality is possibly related to CHD severity and survival after CHD rather than susceptibility to development of CHD.	1375	1648
15266215	Effects of the cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with arthritis.	0	181
15266215	There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events may be higher with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).	182	382
15266215	We evaluated cardiovascular event data for valdecoxib, a new COX-2-specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials.	383	599
15266215	The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial thrombotic) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, or naproxen 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration.	600	993
15266215	The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7934) and in users of low-dose (< or =325 mg daily) aspirin (n = 1051) and nonusers of aspirin (n = 6883).	994	1167
15266215	Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for valdecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo.	1168	1277
15266215	The risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each valdecoxib dose.	1278	1358
15266215	Thrombotic risk was consistently higher for users of aspirin users than nonusers of aspirin (placebo, 1.4% vs. 0%; valdecoxib, 1.7% vs. 0.2%; NSAIDs, 1.9% vs. 0.5%).	1359	1524
15266215	The rates of events in users of aspirin were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across valdecoxib doses.	1525	1633
15266215	Short- and intermediate-term treatment with therapeutic (10 or 20 mg daily) and supratherapeutic (40 or 80 mg daily) valdecoxib doses was not associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in controlled clinical trials.	1634	1961
15459183	CD72 polymorphisms associated with alternative splicing modify susceptibility to human systemic lupus erythematosus through epistatic interaction with FCGR2B.	0	158
15459183	We previously reported association of FCGR2B-Ile232Thr with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in three Asian populations.	159	281
15459183	Because polymorphism of CD72, another inhibitory receptor of B cells, was associated with murine SLE, we identified human CD72 polymorphisms, tested their association with SLE and examined genetic interaction with FCGR2B in the Japanese (160 SLE, 277 controls), Thais (87 SLE, 187 controls) and Caucasians (94 families containing SLE members).	282	625
15459183	Four polymorphisms and six rare variations were detected.	626	683
15459183	The former constituted two major haplotypes that contained one or two repeats of 13 nucleotides in intron 8 (designated as *1 and *2, respectively).	684	832
15459183	Although association with susceptibility to SLE was not detected, the *1 allele was significantly associated with nephritis among the Japanese patients (P=0.024).	833	995
15459183	RT-PCR identified a novel alternatively spliced (AS) transcript that was expressed at the protein level in COS-7 transfectants.	996	1123
15459183	The ratio of AS/common isoforms was strikingly increased in individuals with *2/*2 genotype when compared with *1/*1 (P=0.000038) or *1/*2 (P=0.0085) genotypes.	1124	1284
15459183	Using the two Asian cohorts, significant association of FCGR2B-232Thr/Thr with SLE was observed only in the presence of CD72-*1/*1 genotype (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.47-14.6, P=0.009 versus FCGR2B-232Ile/Ile plus CD72-*2/*2).	1285	1503
15459183	Minigene assays demonstrated that the 13-nucleotide repeat and 4 bp deletion within the same haplotype of intron 8 could regulate alternative splicing.	1504	1655
15459183	The AS isoform lacks exon 8, and is deduced to contain 49 amino acid changes in the membrane-distal portion of the extracellular domain, where considerable amino acid changes are known in CD72(c) allele associated with murine SLE.	1656	1886
15459183	These results indicated that the presence of CD72-*2 allele decreases risk for human SLE conferred by FCGR2B-232Thr, possibly by increasing the AS isoform of CD72.	1887	2050
15459975	Fine mapping and identification of a candidate gene SSH1 in disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.	0	107
15459975	Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is an uncommon autosomal dominant chronic keratinization disorder, characterized by multiple superficial keratotic lesions surrounded by a slightly raised keratotic border.	108	334
15459975	Thus far, although two loci for DSAP have been identified, the genetic basis and pathogenesis of this disorder have not been elucidated yet.	335	475
15459975	In this study, we performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in three Chinese affected families and localized the gene in an 8.0 cM interval defined by D12S330 and D12S354 on chromosome 12.	476	663
15459975	Upon screening 30 candidate genes, we identified a missense mutation, p.Ser63Asn in SSH1 in one family, a frameshift mutation, p.Ser19CysfsX24 in an alternative variant (isoform f) of SSH1 in another family, and a frameshift mutation, p.Pro27ProfsX54 in the same alternative variant in one non-familial case with DSAP.	664	982
15459975	SSH1 encodes a phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in actin dynamics.	983	1054
15459975	Our data suggested that cytoskeleton disorganization in epidermal cells is likely associated with the pathogenesis of DSAP.	1055	1178
15461822	Vaccine candidates derived from a novel infectious cDNA clone of an American genotype dengue virus type 2.	0	106
15461822	BACKGROUND: A dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2 Tonga/74) isolated from a 1974 epidemic was characterized by mild illness and belongs to the American genotype of DEN-2 viruses.	107	276
15461822	To prepare a vaccine candidate, a previously described 30 nucleotide deletion (Delta30) in the 3' untranslated region of DEN-4 has been engineered into the DEN-2 isolate.	277	447
15461822	METHODS: A full-length cDNA clone was generated from the DEN-2 virus and used to produce recombinant DEN-2 (rDEN-2) and rDEN2Delta30.	448	581
15461822	Viruses were evaluated for replication in SCID mice transplanted with human hepatoma cells (SCID-HuH-7 mice), in mosquitoes, and in rhesus monkeys.	582	729
15461822	Neutralizing antibody induction and protective efficacy were also assessed in rhesus monkeys.	730	823
15461822	RESULTS: The rDEN2Delta30 virus was ten-fold reduced in replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice when compared to the parent virus.	824	945
15461822	The rDEN-2 viruses were not infectious for Aedes mosquitoes, but both readily infected Toxorynchites mosquitoes.	946	1058
15461822	In rhesus monkeys, rDEN2Delta30 appeared to be slightly attenuated when compared to the parent virus as measured by duration and peak of viremia and neutralizing antibody induction.	1059	1240
15461822	A derivative of rDEN2Delta30, designated rDEN2Delta30-4995, was generated by incorporation of a point mutation previously identified in the NS3 gene of DEN-4 and was found to be more attenuated than rDEN2Delta30 in SCID-HuH-7 mice.	1241	1472
15461822	CONCLUSIONS: The rDEN2Delta30 and rDEN2Delta30-4995 viruses can be considered for evaluation in humans and for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine.	1473	1626
15464247	Influence of interleukin 12B (IL12B) polymorphisms on spontaneous and treatment-induced recovery from hepatitis C virus infection.	0	130
15464247	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Interleukin-12 (IL-12) governs the Th1-type immune response, affecting the spontaneous and treatment-induced recovery from HCV-infection.	131	285
15464247	We investigated whether the IL12B polymorphisms within the promoter region (4 bp insertion/deletion) and the 3'-UTR (1188-A/C), which have been reported to influence IL-12 synthesis, are associated with the outcome of HCV infection.	286	518
15464247	METHODS: We analyzed 186 individuals with spontaneous HCV clearance, 501 chronically HCV infected patients, and 217 healthy controls.	519	652
15464247	IL12B 3'-UTR and promoter genotyping was performed by Taqman-based assays with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and PCR-based allele-specific DNA-amplification, respectively.	653	833
15464247	RESULTS: The proportion of IL12B promoter and 3'-UTR genotypes did not differ significantly between the different cohorts.	834	956
15464247	However, HCV genotype 1-infected patients with high baseline viremia carrying the IL12B 3'-UTR 1188-C-allele showed significantly higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates (25.3% vs. 46% vs. 54.5% for A/A, A/C and C/C) due to reduced relapse rates (24.2% vs. 12% vs. zero % for A/A, A/C and C/C).	957	1259
15464247	CONCLUSIONS: IL12B 3'-UTR 1188-C-allele carriers appear to be capable of responding more efficiently to antiviral combination therapy as a consequence of a reduced relapse rate.	1260	1437
15464247	No association of IL12B polymorphisms and self-limited HCV infection could be demonstrated.	1438	1529
15485686	A novel SCN5A mutation manifests as a malignant form of long QT syndrome with perinatal onset of tachycardia/bradycardia.	0	121
15485686	OBJECTIVE: Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) with in utero onset of the rhythm disturbances is associated with a poor prognosis.	122	251
15485686	In this study we investigated a newborn patient with fetal bradycardia, 2:1 atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia soon after birth.	252	396
15485686	METHODS: Mutational analysis and DNA sequencing were conducted in a newborn.	397	473
15485686	The 2:1 atrioventricular block improved to 1:1 conduction only after intravenous lidocaine infusion or a high dose of mexiletine, which also controlled the ventricular tachycardia.	474	654
15485686	RESULTS: A novel, spontaneous LQTS-3 mutation was identified in the transmembrane segment 6 of domain IV of the Na(v)1.5 cardiac sodium channel, with a G-->A substitution at codon 1763, which changed a valine (GTG) to a methionine (ATG).	655	892
15485686	The proband was heterozygous but the mutation was absent in the parents and the sister.	893	980
15485686	Expression of this mutant channel in tsA201 mammalian cells by site-directed mutagenesis revealed a persistent tetrodotoxin-sensitive but lidocaine-resistant current that was associated with a positive shift of the steady-state inactivation curve, steeper activation curve and faster recovery from inactivation.	981	1292
15485686	We also found a similar electrophysiological profile for the neighboring V1764M mutant.	1293	1380
15485686	But, the other neighboring I1762A mutant had no persistent current and was still associated with a positive shift of inactivation.	1381	1511
15485686	CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the Na(v)1.5/V1763M channel dysfunction and possible neighboring mutants contribute to a persistent inward current due to altered inactivation kinetics and clinically congenital LQTS with perinatal onset of arrhythmias that responded to lidocaine and mexiletine.	1512	1815
15523499	Haplotype structure of the beta adrenergic receptor genes in US Caucasians and African Americans.	0	97
15523499	The beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) are G protein-coupled receptors activated by epinephrine and norepinephrine and are involved in a variety of their physiological functions.	98	277
15523499	Previously, three beta-AR genes (ADRB1, ADRB2 and ADRB3) were resequenced, identifying polymorphisms that were used in genetic association studies of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.	278	467
15523499	These studies have produced intriguing but inconsistent results, potentially because the known functional variants: ADRB1 Arg389Gly and Gly49Ser, ADRB2 Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, and ADRB3 Arg64Trp provided an incomplete picture of the total functional diversity at these genes.	468	742
15523499	Therefore, we created marker panels for each beta-AR gene that included the known functional markers and also other markers evenly spaced and with sufficient density to identify haplotype block structure and to maximize haplotype diversity.	743	983
15523499	A total of 27 markers were genotyped in 96 US Caucasians and 96 African Americans.	984	1066
15523499	In both populations and for each gene, a single block with little evidence of historical recombination was observed.	1067	1183
15523499	For each gene, haplotype captured most of the information content of each functional locus, even if that locus was not genotyped, and presumably haplotype would capture the signal from unknown functional loci whose alleles are of moderate abundance.	1184	1433
15523499	This study demonstrates the utility of using beta-AR gene haplotype maps and marker panels as tools for linkage studies on beta-AR function.	1434	1574
15579441	Hypoxia in renal disease with proteinuria and/or glomerular hypertension.	0	73
15579441	Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods have been available.	74	212
15579441	In this study, we developed a new hypoxia-responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia-responsive element of the 5' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia-sensing transgenic rat.	213	435
15579441	We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney.	436	540
15579441	With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model.	541	728
15579441	Expression of the hypoxia-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes.	729	1064
15579441	The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models.	1065	1175
15579441	Finally, we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive, ED-1-positive, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeled-positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model.	1176	1386
15579441	We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases.	1387	1510
15583840	Tumor associated antigen recognition by autologous serum in patients with breast cancer.	0	88
15583840	Breast cancer accounts for 30-40% of all deaths from cancers in females.	89	161
15583840	In an effort to identify tumor associated antigens that may be useful for immunotherapy, we utilized serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) technique to identify breast cancer-associated antigens.	162	389
15583840	SEREX screening of cDNA expression libraries derived from 3 breast cancer patients identified a total of 88 positive clones (bcg-1 to bcg-88), including 27 hitherto unknown sequences.	390	573
15583840	The cDNA sequences and mRNA expression patterns were characterized.	574	641
15583840	Seroreactivity of the SEREX clones were determined in sera from 75 breast cancer patients, 75 colon cancer patients, and 25 healthy donors.	642	781
15583840	Expression analysis on a cDNA panel from 17 different normal tissues by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) revealed tissue restricted mRNA expression of 2 of the 27 unknown antigens.	782	964
15583840	Bcg-72 is expressed only in breast, prostate and thymus, while bcg-84 is expressed at moderate levels in testis, spleen and breast.	965	1096
15583840	The other 25 unknown antigens were expressed in most other tissues.	1097	1164
15583840	Serologic assay revealed that 7 out of the 88 clones showed reactivity to at least one serum from either 75 breast or 75 colon cancer patients.	1165	1308
15583840	These clones did not react with sera from a panel of 25 healthy adult individuals.	1309	1391
15583840	Our results demonstrate the utility of the SEREX approach for the identification of potential tumor associated antigens in human breast cancer.	1392	1535
15599941	Polymorphic forms of prostate specific antigen and their interaction with androgen receptor trinucleotide repeats in prostate cancer.	0	133
15599941	BACKGROUND: Recent data has suggested that polymorphisms in the prostate specific antigen (PSA) may increase prostate cancer (PC) risk.	134	269
15599941	The PSA gene contains a G/A substitution in the androgen response element (ARE) 1 region.	270	359
15599941	The androgen receptor (AR) gene has polymorphic regions containing variable length glutamine and glycine repeats and these are believed to be associated with PC risk.	360	526
15599941	The effect on PC risks from PSA polymorphisms alone and synergistically with the AR gene was examined in this report.	527	644
15599941	METHODS: One hundred PC patients and an age matched cohort of 79 benign prostate hyperplasia and 67 population controls were entered in this study.	645	792
15599941	DNA was extracted from blood and PSA/ARE promoter region amplified by PCR.	793	867
15599941	PCR products were cut with Nhe 1 restriction enzyme to distinguish G/A alleles.	868	947
15599941	AR/CAG and GGC repeat length was detected by automated fluorescence from PCR products.	948	1034
15599941	RESULTS: We found a significantly higher PSA/GG distribution in PC (30%) than either benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (18%) or population controls (16%) (P = 0.025).	1035	1202
15599941	Furthermore the GG distribution within cases was even greater in younger men (< 65 years; 42%; P = 0.012).	1203	1309
15599941	Additionally, when PSA genotype was cross classified with CAG repeat, significantly more cases than both BPH and population controls were observed to have a short (< 22) CAG/GG genotype (P = 0.006).	1310	1508
15599941	CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PSA/ARE GG genotype confers an increased risk of PC especially among younger men.	1509	1633
15599941	Moreover, we confirm previous results that a short glutamine repeat in conjunction with GG genotype significantly increases the risk of malignant disease.	1634	1788
15602202	Recurrent acute interstitial nephritis induced by azithromycin.	0	63
15602202	A 14-year-old girl is reported with recurrent, azithromycin-induced, acute interstitial nephritis.	64	162
15602202	The second episode was more severe than the first; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy, renal function remained impaired.	163	317
15602202	Although most cases of antibiotic induced acute interstitial nephritis are benign and self-limited, some patients are at risk for permanent renal injury.	318	471
15609295	Compound heterozygosity for a novel nine-nucleotide deletion and the Asn45Ser missense mutation in the glycoprotein IX gene in a patient with Bernard-Soulier syndrome.	0	167
15609295	Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare inherited bleeding disorder due to quantitative or qualitative abnormalities in the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V complex, the major von Willebrand factor receptor.	168	378
15609295	The complex comprises four subunits, each encoded by a separate gene.	379	448
15609295	Several mutations have been described for each of the subunits, except for GPV, as a cause of BSS.	449	547
15609295	We describe here the genetic basis of the disorder in a child with BSS.	548	619
15609295	Flow-cytometric analysis of the patient's platelets showed a markedly reduced surface expression of all three glycoproteins of the GPIb/IX/V complex.	620	769
15609295	DNA sequencing analysis showed the patient to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in the GPIX gene, a novel nine-nucleotide deletion starting at position 1952 of the gene that changes asparagine 86 for alanine and eliminates amino acids 87, 88, and 89 (arginine, threonine, and proline) and a previously reported point mutation that changes the codon asparagine (AAC) for serine (AGC) at residue 45.	770	1178
15609295	Her mother was heterozygous for the Asn45Ser mutation, and her father, for the nine-nucleotide deletion.	1179	1283
15609295	Our findings suggest that the additive effects of both mutations in the GPIX gene are responsible for the BSS phenotype of the patient.	1284	1419
15630069	Glucose metabolism in patients with schizophrenia treated with atypical antipsychotic agents: a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal model analysis.	0	177
15630069	BACKGROUND: While the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus may be increasing in patients with schizophrenia treated with certain atypical antipsychotic agents, it remains unclear whether atypical agents are directly affecting glucose metabolism or simply increasing known risk factors for diabetes.	178	480
15630069	OBJECTIVE: To study the 2 drugs most clearly implicated (clozapine and olanzapine) and risperidone using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test.	481	642
15630069	DESIGN: A cross-sectional design in stable, treated patients with schizophrenia evaluated using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and the Bergman minimal model analysis.	643	834
15630069	SETTING: Subjects were recruited from an urban community mental health clinic and were studied at a general clinical research center.	835	968
15630069	Patients Fifty subjects signed informed consent and 41 underwent the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test.	969	1092
15630069	Thirty-six nonobese subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, matched by body mass index and treated with either clozapine, olanzapine, or risperidone, were included in the analysis.	1093	1290
15630069	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting plasma glucose and fasting serum insulin levels, insulin sensitivity index, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and glucose effectiveness.	1291	1476
15630069	RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of treatment with the identified atypical antipsychotic agent was 68.3 +/- 28.9 months (clozapine), 29.5 +/- 17.5 months (olanzapine), and 40.9 +/- 33.7 (risperidone).	1477	1678
15630069	Fasting serum insulin concentrations differed among groups (F(33) = 3.35; P = .047) (clozapine>olanzapine>risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone (t(33) = 2.32; P = .03) and olanzapine and risperidone (t(33) = 2.15; P = .04).	1679	1940
15630069	There was a significant difference in insulin sensitivity index among groups (F(33) = 10.66; P<.001) (clozapine<olanzapine<risperidone), with subjects who received clozapine and olanzapine exhibiting significant insulin resistance compared with subjects who were treated with risperidone (clozapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -4.29; P<.001; olanzapine vs risperidone, t(33) = -3.62; P = .001 [P<.001]).	1941	2340
15630069	The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance also differed significantly among groups (F(33) = 4.92; P = .01) (clozapine>olanzapine>risperidone) (clozapine vs risperidone, t(33) = 2.94; P = .006; olanzapine vs risperidone, t(33) = 2.42; P = .02).	2341	2597
15630069	There was a significant difference among groups in glucose effectiveness (F(30) = 4.18; P = .02) (clozapine<olanzapine<risperidone) with significant differences between clozapine and risperidone (t(30) = -2.59; P = .02) and olanzapine and risperidone (t(30) = -2.34, P = .03).	2598	2874
15630069	CONCLUSIONS: Both nonobese clozapine- and olanzapine-treated groups displayed significant insulin resistance and impairment of glucose effectiveness compared with risperidone-treated subjects.	2875	3067
15630069	Patients taking clozapine and olanzapine must be examined for insulin resistance and its consequences.	3068	3170
15649253	Primary malignant lymphoma of the brain: frequent abnormalities and inactivation of p14 tumor suppressor gene.	0	110
15649253	Ten primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL, brain lymphomas) were examined for p14 gene exon 1beta deletion, mutation and methylation by Southern blot analysis, nucleotide analysis of polymerase chain reaction clones and Southern blot-based methylation assay.	111	379
15649253	In Southern blot analysis, from the signal densities of the hybridized bands and their similarities to those of exons 2 and 3 in our previous quantitative study, we found that exon 1beta was homozygously deleted in four cases, hemizygously deleted in five cases and not deleted in one case.	380	670
15649253	Thus, the same deletion patterns covered the entire p14 gene for all cases except for one case, which suggested the hemizygous deletion of exons 1beta and 2 and homozygous deletion of exon 3.	671	862
15649253	In addition, although exon 1beta mutation is rare in various tumors, we detected a missense mutation (L50R) in one case with a hemizygous deletion.	863	1010
15649253	Methylation of the 5'CpG island of the p14 gene was not suggested for any case without homozygous deletion.	1011	1118
15649253	Our observation of frequent p14 gene abnormalities (90%) and inactivation (40-60%) was in striking contrast to the same pathological subtype of systemic lymphoma in which p14 gene abnormalities and inactivation were infrequent, suggesting a difference in carcinogenesis between PCNSL and systemic lymphoma.	1119	1425
15668505	Common BRCA2 variants and modification of breast and ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers.	0	100
15668505	The HH genotype of the nonconservative amino acid substitution polymorphism N372H in the BRCA2 gene was reported to be associated with a 1.3- to 1.5-fold increase in risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.	101	306
15668505	As these studies concerned sporadic cancer cases, we investigated whether N372H and another common variant located in the 5'-untranslated region (203G > A) of the BRCA2 gene modify breast or ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers.	307	545
15668505	The study includes 778 women carrying a BRCA1 germ-line mutation belonging to 403 families.	546	637
15668505	The two BRCA2 variants were analyzed by the TaqMan allelic discrimination technique.	638	722
15668505	Genotypes were analyzed by disease-free survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model.	723	820
15668505	We found no evidence of a significant modification of breast cancer penetrance in BRCA1 mutation carriers by either polymorphism.	821	950
15668505	In respect of ovarian cancer risk, we also saw no effect with the N372H variant but we did observe a borderline association with the 5'-untranslated region 203A allele (hazard ratio, 1.43; CI, 1.01-2.00).	951	1155
15668505	In contrast to the result of Healey et al. on newborn females and adult female controls, we found no departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the distribution of N372H alleles for our female BRCA1 carriers.	1156	1366
15668505	We conclude that if these single-nucleotide polymorphisms do modify the risk of cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers, their effects are not significantly larger than that of N372H previously observed in the general population.	1367	1590
15673851	The activation of spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of spinal cord ischemia.	0	195
15673851	We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats.	196	421
15673851	Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter.	422	509
15673851	In a microdialysis study, 10 muL of saline (group C; n = 8) or 30 mug of morphine (group M; n = 8) was injected intrathecally (IT) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of morphine (group SM; n = 8) or 10 muL of saline (group SC; n = 8) was injected IT 0.5 h after sham operation.	510	783
15673851	Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after IT injection).	784	920
15673851	Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis.	921	1071
15673851	After IT morphine, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C (P < 0.05).	1072	1219
15673851	This increase persisted for 8 hrs.	1220	1254
15673851	IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group.	1255	1406
15673851	These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate, which is involved in NMDA receptor activation.	1407	1564
15673851	We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via NMDA receptor activation.	1565	1675
15686794	Acute low back pain during intravenous administration of amiodarone: a report of two cases.	0	91
15686794	Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintenance of sinus rhythm.	92	238
15686794	We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent-onset atrial fibrillation, who experienced an acute devastating low back pain a few minutes after initiation of intravenous amiodarone loading.	239	437
15686794	Notably, this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical literature.	438	517
15686794	Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution.	518	645
15748645	Photochemoprevention of ultraviolet B signaling and photocarcinogenesis.	0	72
15748645	Exposure to solar radiation, particularly its ultraviolet (UV) B component, has a variety of harmful effects on human health.	73	198
15748645	Some of these effects include sunburn cell formation, basal and squamous cell cancers, melanoma, cataracts, photoaging of the skin, and immune suppression.	199	354
15748645	Amongst these various adverse effects of UV radiation, skin cancer is of the greatest concern.	355	449
15748645	Over the years, changes in lifestyle has led to a significant increase in the amount of UV radiation that people receive, and this consequently has led to a surge in the incidence of skin cancer.	450	645
15748645	The development of skin cancer is a complex multistage phenomenon involving three distinct stages exemplified by initiation, promotion and progression stages.	646	804
15748645	Each of these stages is mediated via alterations in various cellular, biochemical, and molecular changes.	805	910
15748645	Initiation, the first step in the carcinogenesis process is essentially an irreversible step in which genetic alterations occur in genes that ultimately leads to DNA modification and fixation of mutation.	911	1115
15748645	Tumor promotion is the essential process in cancer development involving clonal expansion of initiated cells giving rise to pre-malignant and then to malignant lesions, essentially by alterations in signal transduction pathways.	1116	1344
15748645	Tumor progression involves the conversion of pre-malignant and malignant lesions into an invasive and potentially metastatic malignant tumor.	1345	1486
15748645	All these processes for skin cancer development involve stimulation of DNA synthesis, DNA damage and proliferation, inflammation, immunosuppression, epidermal hyperplasia, cell cycle dysregulation, depletion of antioxidant defenses, impairment of signal transduction pathways, induction of cyclooxygenase, increase in prostaglandin synthesis, and induction of ornithine decarboxylase.	1487	1871
15748645	Photochemoprevention has been appreciated as a viable approach to reduce the occurrence of skin cancer and in recent years, the use of agents, especially botanical antioxidants, present in the common diet and beverages consumed by human population have gained considerable attention as photochemopreventive agents for human use.	1872	2200
15748645	Many such agents have also found a place in skin care products.	2201	2264
15748645	Although this is more common in oriental countries, its popularity is significantly growing in western countries.	2265	2378
15748645	In this article, we have summarized the available information of laboratory studies on UVB-mediated signaling that can be exploited as targets for photochemoprevention.	2379	2547
15748645	We suggest that the use of skin care products supplemented with proven chemopreventive agents in conjunction with the use of sunscreens along with educational efforts may be an effective strategy for reducing UV-induced photodamage and skin cancer in humans.	2548	2806
15748645	The mechanistic basis for the use of such products is discussed.	2807	2871
15749661	Two novel mutations, L490R and V561X, of the transferrin receptor 2 gene in Japanese patients with hemochromatosis.	0	115
15749661	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The low prevalence of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in Japan means that the genetic background of hemochromatosis in Japanese patients remains unclear.	116	299
15749661	In a previous report, we showed that 3 patients from one family had an AVAQ 594-597 deletion of the transferrin receptor (TfR2) gene.	300	433
15749661	This suggests that the TfR2 gene is involved in hemochromatosis in Japanese patients.	434	519
15749661	DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine patients clinically diagnosed with hemochromatosis were included in the study.	520	623
15749661	DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected with informed consent.	624	699
15749661	The HFE and TfR2 genes were analyzed by sequencing the coding region and splicing sites.	700	788
15749661	RESULTS: There were no mutations in the HFE gene.	789	838
15749661	In the TfR2 gene, 2 novel mutations, 1469T->G (L490R) and 1665delC (V561X), were found in 2 patients.	839	940
15749661	A known variation, 714C-> (I238M), was also found in the patient with L490R.	941	1017
15749661	The patient homozygous for both L490R and I238M presented with a mild manifestation of hemochromatosis at the age of 41 years.	1018	1144
15749661	His liver was cirrhotic with parenchymal iron deposits and the result of a glucose tolerance test was compatible with diabetes mellitus.	1145	1281
15749661	The patient homozygous for V561X had severe iron overload with the triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and skin pigmentation at the age of 58 years.	1282	1432
15749661	INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Taken together with the previous report, 5 of our 12 patients with hemochromatosis manifesting in middle age had mutations in the TfR2 gene.	1433	1605
15749661	Thus, TfR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis in Japan.	1606	1678
15754732	Novel somatic MEN1 gene alterations in sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism and correlation with clinical characteristics.	0	122
15754732	Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common endocrine disease that in more than 95% of cases is sporadic and only in some cases is caused by inherited disorders, isolated or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1 and 2).	123	353
15754732	Somatic mutations of MEN1 gene have also been described in sporadic parathyroid tumors.	354	441
15754732	In our study, we examined the presence of alterations in MEN1 gene in a series of 39 patients who had undergone surgery for sporadic pHPT (35 with parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, 4 with a carcinoma).	442	645
15754732	A genotype-phenotype correlation was also analysed.	646	697
15754732	After DNA extraction from paraffin-embedded tissues, we amplified by PCR and sequenced the exons 2-10 of the MEN1 gene.	698	817
15754732	Somatic MEN1 mutations were detected in 6 of the 35 patients with a benign parathyroid lesion examined (17.1%), whereas no alterations were found in the carcinomas.	818	982
15754732	Four novel MEN1 gene mutations were identified as follows: one frameshift mutation (222insT, exon 2), one frameshift deletion (912delTA, exon 5), one in-frame deletion (835del18, exon 4) and one missense mutation (P291A, exon 6).	983	1212
15754732	In addition, one missense mutation (L89R, exon 2) and one nonsense mutation (Q536X, exon 10) were previously reported.	1213	1331
15754732	Moreover, two polymorphisms were also found: one allele carried a R171Q polymorphism (1/39 tumors), while a D418D polymorphism (GAC/GAT) was found in 15 and 8 tumors in hetero (CT) and homozygosity (TT), respectively.	1332	1549
15754732	In no case (mutations and/or polymorphisms) did we find a genotype-phenotype correlation.	1550	1639
15754732	In conclusion, our data demonstrate the presence of somatic alterations of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene in about one fifth of benign sporadic parathyroid tumors.	1640	1803
15754732	The absence of a genotype-phenotype correlation, however, suggests the involvement of other genetic/epigenetic factors for the full expression of the disease.	1804	1962
15755837	Common dihydrofolate reductase 19-base pair deletion allele: a novel risk factor for preterm delivery.	0	102
15755837	BACKGROUND: Folate is critical for cell division, a major feature of in utero development.	103	193
15755837	Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is required to convert the folic acid used in supplements and for food fortification and the dihydrofolate produced by thymidylate synthase during DNA synthesis to the reduced folate forms used by the cell.	194	431
15755837	OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether a common, recently discovered deletion polymorphism in the DHFR gene is a risk factor for preterm delivery or low birth weight.	432	600
15755837	DESIGN: We studied 324 pregnant women from Camden, NJ.	601	655
15755837	Folate intake was computed from folate supplement intake plus the mean of two 24-h recalls completed during the course of pregnancy.	656	788
15755837	Genomic DNA was extracted from the women's leukocytes and genotyped.	789	857
15755837	RESULTS: Women with a deletion allele had a significantly greater risk of preterm delivery [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.0; 95% CI: 1.0, 8.8; P < 0.05] than did those without a deletion allele.	858	1051
15755837	Women with both a DHFR deletion allele and low folate intake (<400 microg/d from diet plus supplements) had a significantly greater risk of preterm delivery (AOR: 5.5; 95% CI: 1.5, 20.4; P = 0.01) and a significantly greater risk of having an infant with a low birth weight (AOR: 8.3; 95% CI: 1.8, 38.6; P = 0.01) than did women without a deletion allele and with a folate intake >/=400 microg/d.	1052	1448
15755837	CONCLUSIONS: The DHFR 19-base pair deletion allele may be a risk factor for preterm delivery.	1449	1542
15755837	In the presence of low dietary folate, the allele may also be a risk factor for low birth weight.	1543	1640
15755837	This may be a gene-environment interaction.	1641	1684
15770495	New mutations, hotspots, and founder effects in Brazilian patients with steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency type 2.	0	115
15770495	Mutations of the steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 (SRD5A2) gene in 46,XY subjects cause masculinization defects of varying degrees, due to reduced or impaired enzymatic activity.	116	293
15770495	In this study, sequence abnormalities of the SRD5A2 gene were assessed by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and automated sequencing analysis in DNA samples from 20 patients with suspected steroid 5alpha-reductase type 2 deficiency from 18 Brazilian families.	294	567
15770495	Eleven subjects presented SRD5A2 homozygous single-base mutations (two first cousins and four unrelated patients with G183S, two with R246W, one with del642T, one with G196S, and one with 217_218insC plus the A49T variant in heterozygosis), whereas four were compound heterozygotes (one with Q126R/IVS3+1G>A, one with Q126R/del418T, and two brothers with Q126R/G158R).	568	936
15770495	Three patients were heterozygous for A207D, G196S, and R266W substitutions.	937	1012
15770495	The V89L polymorphism was found in heterozygosis in one of them (with A207D) and in one case with an otherwise normal gene sequence.	1013	1145
15770495	The A49T variant was also detected in heterozygosis in the second case without other sequencing abnormalities.	1146	1256
15770495	Four patients harbor yet non-described SRD5A2 gene mutations: a single nucleotide deletion (del642T), a G158R amino acid substitution, a splice junction mutation (IVS3+1G>A), and the insertion of a cytosine (217_218insC) occurring at a CCCC motif.	1257	1504
15770495	This is the first report of a single-nucleotide insertion in the coding sequence of the SRD5A2 gene.	1505	1605
15770495	In addition to these new mutations, this investigation reveals the prevalence of G183S substitution among a subset of African-Brazilian patients and presents evidences of the recurrence of already known mutations.	1606	1819
15807692	Identification of novel type VII collagen gene mutations resulting in severe recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.	0	120
15807692	In this work, we studied the proband in a small nuclear family of Chinese and Dutch/German descent and identified two novel mutations in the type VII collagen gene leading to recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, Hallopeau-Siemens variant (HS-RDEB).	121	376
15807692	The maternal mutation is a single base pair deletion of a cytosine nucleotide in exon 26, designated 3472delC, resulting in a frameshift and a premature termination codon (PTC) within the same exon, 7 bp downstream of the site of the mutation.	377	620
15807692	The paternal mutation is a G-->A transition located at the 5' donor splice site within intron 51, designated IVS51 + 1G-->A.	621	745
15807692	This mutation leads to the activation of a cryptic splice site, 32 bp downstream of the mutation site and to subsequent aberrant out-of-frame splicing, resulting in two alternative mRNA transcripts and a downstream PTC.	746	965
15807692	To our knowledge, these two mutations have not been previously reported.	966	1038
15807692	These findings extend the body of evidence for compound heterozygous mutations leading to HS-RDEB and provide the basis for prenatal diagnosis in this family.	1039	1197
15811908	Pheochromocytoma unmasked by amisulpride and tiapride.	0	54
15811908	OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of pheochromocytoma in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride.	55	163
15811908	CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg.	164	337
15811908	Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment.	338	459
15811908	Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.	460	590
15811908	DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown.	591	751
15811908	In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and tiapride therapy.	752	905
15811908	CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of amisulpride- and tiapride-induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with pheochromocytoma.	906	1065
15811908	Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of tiapride and amisulpride.	1066	1189
15814629	The number of lymph node metastases in gastric cancer correlates with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism.	0	143
15814629	PURPOSE: In the present study, we aimed to substantiate the putative significance of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) on gastric cancer biology by investigating the influence of its gene polymorphism on gastric cancer progression.	144	379
15814629	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genomic DNA was purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or tissue specimens.	380	486
15814629	Amplified ACE gene fragments were separated on agarose gels.	487	547
15814629	D or I alleles were identified by the presence of 190- or 490-bp fragments, respectively.	548	637
15814629	Local expression of ACE was investigated by immunohistochemistry.	638	703
15814629	RESULTS: Twenty-four of 113 (21%) gastric cancer patients had the II, 57 (51%) the ID, and 32 (28%) the DD genotype.	704	820
15814629	The distribution of the ACE genotypes did not differ significantly from the control group of 189 patients without gastric cancer.	821	950
15814629	However, the ACE genotypes correlated with the number of lymph node metastases and the Unio Internationale Contra Cancrum (UICC) tumor stage.	951	1092
15814629	Patients with the II genotype had a highly significantly smaller number of lymph node metastases (P < 0.001) and a significantly lower UICC tumor stage (P = 0.01) than patients with the DD genotype.	1093	1291
15814629	No correlation was found between tumor type, tumor location, local tumor growth, distant metastases, and the ACE genotype.	1292	1414
15814629	The expression of ACE in gastric cancer was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 100 of 113 patients.	1415	1519
15814629	ACE was expressed by endothelial cells in all (100%) specimens and by tumor cells in 56 (56%) specimens.	1520	1624
15814629	CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ACE is expressed locally in gastric cancer and that the gene polymorphism influences metastatic behavior.	1625	1764
15817013	People aged over 75 in atrial fibrillation on warfarin: the rate of major hemorrhage and stroke in more than 500 patient-years of follow-up.	0	140
15817013	OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of major hemorrhage and stroke in people aged 76 and older with atrial fibrillation on adjusted-dose warfarin who had been recently been admitted to hospital.	141	338
15817013	DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study.	339	390
15817013	SETTING: A major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals.	391	461
15817013	PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients aged 76 and older admitted to a major healthcare network between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002, with atrial fibrillation on warfarin were enrolled.	462	658
15817013	MEASUREMENTS: Information regarding major bleeding episodes, strokes, and warfarin use was obtained from patients, relatives, primary physicians, and medical records.	659	825
15817013	RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients (42% men) with a mean age of 81.1 (range 76-94) were included in the analysis.	826	947
15817013	Total follow-up on warfarin was 530 years (mean 28 months).	948	1007
15817013	There were 53 major hemorrhages, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal bleeds.	1008	1137
15817013	The annual stroke rate after initiation of warfarin was 2.6%.	1138	1199
15817013	CONCLUSION: The rate of major hemorrhage was high in this old, frail group, but excluding fatalities, resulted in no long-term sequelae, and the stroke rate on warfarin was low, demonstrating how effective warfarin treatment is.	1200	1428
15820770	Vitamin D-binding protein gene polymorphism association with IA-2 autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes.	0	100
15820770	BACKGROUND: Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) is the main systemic transporter of 1.25(OH)2D3 and is essential for its cellular endocytosis.	101	239
15820770	There are two known polymorphisms in exon 11 of the DBP gene resulting in amino acid variants: GAT-->GAG substitution replaces aspartic acid by glutamic acid in codon 416; and ACG-->AAG substitution in codon 420 leads to an exchange of threonine for lysine.	240	497
15820770	These DBP variants lead to differences in the affinity for 1.25(OH)2D3.	498	569
15820770	Correlations between DBP alleles and type 1 diabetes have been described in different populations.	570	668
15820770	Therefore, we investigated the polymorphism in codon 416 of the DBP gene for an association with autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes.	669	804
15820770	DESIGN AND METHODS: The present analysis was a case control study.	805	871
15820770	110 patients, 68 controls, and 115 first-degree relatives were genotyped for the DBP polymorphism in codon 416.	872	983
15820770	DNA typing of DBP locus was performed by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (RFLP).	984	1088
15820770	RESULTS: The frequencies of the Asp/Glu and Glu/Glu were significantly increased in diabetic subjects with detectable IA-2 antibodies (P < 0.01).	1089	1234
15820770	On the contrary, the DBP Glu-containing genotype was not accompanied by differences in the prevalence of GAD65 antibodies.	1235	1357
15820770	These finding supports a role of the vitamin D endocrine system in the autoimmune process of type 1 diabetes.	1358	1467
15858223	Valproic acid I: time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers, liver toxicity, and valproic acid metabolite levels in rats.	0	123
15858223	A single dose of valproic acid (VPA), which is a widely used antiepileptic drug, is associated with oxidative stress in rats, as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of 15-F(2t)-isoprostane (15-F(2t)-IsoP).	124	334
15858223	To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA-associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA (500 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10, or 14 days.	335	582
15858223	Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, lipid hydroperoxides (LPO), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs).	583	750
15858223	Plasma and liver 15-F(2t)-IsoP were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of VPA treatment compared to control.	751	867
15858223	Liver LPO levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment (1.8-fold versus control, p < 0.05).	868	964
15858223	Liver and plasma TBARs were not increased until 14 days (2-fold vs. control, p < 0.05).	965	1052
15858223	Liver toxicity was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) and by histology.	1053	1168
15858223	Serum alpha-GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4, which corresponded to hepatotoxicity as shown by the increasing incidence of inflammation of the liver capsule, necrosis, and steatosis throughout the study.	1169	1387
15858223	The liver levels of beta-oxidation metabolites of VPA were decreased by day 14, while the levels of 4-ene-VPA and (E)-2,4-diene-VPA were not elevated throughout the study.	1388	1559
15858223	Overall, these findings indicate that VPA treatment results in oxidative stress, as measured by levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, which precedes the onset of necrosis, steatosis, and elevated levels of serum alpha-GST.	1560	1769
15859361	Safety of celecoxib in patients with adverse skin reactions to acetaminophen (paracetamol) and nimesulide associated or not with common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.	0	174
15859361	BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (paracetamol--P) and Nimesulide (N) are widely used analgesic-antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs.	175	299
15859361	The rate of adverse hypersensitivity reactions to these agents is generally low.	300	380
15859361	On the contrary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly involved in such reactions.	381	484
15859361	Celecoxib (CE) is a novel drug, with high selectivity and affinity for COX-2 enzyme.	485	569
15859361	OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the tolerability of CE in a group of patients with documented history of adverse cutaneous reactions to P and N associated or not to classic NSAIDs.	570	742
15859361	METHODS: We studied 9 patients with hypersensitivity to P and N with or without associated reactions to classic NSAIDs.	743	862
15859361	The diagnosis of P and N-induced skin reactions was based in vivo challenge.	863	939
15859361	The placebo was blindly administered at the beginning of each challenge.	940	1012
15859361	After three days, a cumulative dosage of 200 mg of CE in refracted doses were given.	1013	1097
15859361	After 2-3 days, a single dose of 200 mg was administered.	1098	1155
15859361	All patients were observed for 6 hours after each challenge, and controlled again after 24 hours to exclude delayed reactions.	1156	1282
15859361	The challenge was considered positive if one or more of the following appeared: erythema, rush or urticaria-angioedema.	1283	1402
15859361	RESULTS: No reaction was observed with placebo and eight patients (88.8%) tolerated CE.	1403	1490
15859361	Only one patient developed a moderate angioedema of the lips.	1491	1552
15859361	CONCLUSION: Only one hypersensitivity reaction to CE was documented among 9 P and N-highly NSAIDs intolerant patients.	1553	1671
15859361	Thus, we conclude that CE is a reasonably safe alternative to be used in subjects who do not tolerate P and N.	1672	1782
15867855	Genetic variants of the T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 1 but not the T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 gene are associated with asthma in an African American population.	0	162
15867855	BACKGROUND: The T-cell immunoglobulin mucin ( TIM ) proteins and their genetic variants have been suggested to play a role in regulating allergic diseases.	163	318
15867855	OBJECTIVE: Genetic association of the sequence variants for TIM-1 and TIM-3 genes with asthma in an African American population was investigated.	319	464
15867855	METHODS: Both case-control and family-based association analyses were performed for a total of 7 polymorphisms, including 3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 1 insertion/deletion polymorphism in the TIM-1 and 3 SNPs in the TIM-3 genes.	465	708
15867855	The exposure to hepatitis A virus as judged by seropositivity was also examined.	709	789
15867855	RESULTS: In the case-control design, the frequencies of the TT genotype for SNP rs2277025 and the homozygous deletion variant (157delMTTTVP) in the fourth exon of the TIM-1 gene were higher among patients with patients with asthma compared with the controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.779, P = .016; and OR, 3.09, P = .022, respectively).	790	1121
15867855	This association was substantiated by haplotype analysis of these and 2 additional SNPs (OR, 2.48; P = .004), and also by family-based tests for the allele and haplotype carrying 157delMTTTVP (P = .009 and P = .048, respectively).	1122	1352
15867855	Furthermore, this association seems to exist even in the hepatitis A virus-seronegative subjects in our data.	1353	1462
15867855	None of the 3 variants in TIM-3 genes yielded significant association with either asthma or asthma-related phenotypes.	1463	1581
15867855	CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the genetic variants of the TIM-1 but not the TIM-3 gene contribute to asthma susceptibility in this African-American population.	1582	1749
15893386	Succinylcholine-induced masseter muscle rigidity during bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body.	0	105
15893386	Masseter muscle rigidity during general anesthesia is considered an early warning sign of a possible episode of malignant hyperthermia.	106	241
15893386	The decision whether to continue or discontinue the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgery and severity of masseter muscle rigidity.	242	383
15893386	Here, we describe a case of severe masseter muscle rigidity (jaw of steel) after succinylcholine (Sch) administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body.	384	598
15893386	Anesthesia was continued uneventfully with propofol infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat malignant hyperthermia.	599	739
15897593	Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not doxorubicin.	0	131
15897593	PURPOSE: The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use.	132	372
15897593	Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.	373	471
15897593	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays.	472	851
15897593	Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done.	852	1053
15897593	RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin.	1054	1358
15897593	CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention.	1359	1678
15897593	Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane.	1679	1790
15897593	Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity.	1791	1978
15897593	If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy.	1979	2105
15951966	Screening for exonic copy number mutations at MSH2 and MLH1 by MAPH.	0	68
15951966	BACKGROUND: Exonic deletions in MSH2 and MLH1 are significant contributors to the mutation spectrum in HNPCC, and heterozygous changes in exon copy number are not detected by conventional mutation screening methods.	69	284
15951966	AIMS: We aimed to develop methods for screening copy number changes in all the exons of the MLH1 and MSH2 genes using a single multiplex amplifiable probe hybridisation (MAPH) assay.	285	467
15951966	METHODS: We developed a probe set consisting of probes from the 19 exons of MLH1 and 16 exons of MSH2, and 3 control probes, and applied it to screening for deletions and duplications using fluorescent detection of amplified fragments.	468	703
15951966	RESULTS: We tested 73 DNA samples from controls and 50 from HNPCC patients in whom no point mutations had been found, and detected 10 copy number changes among the patient samples.	704	884
15951966	A deletion of about 1.4 kb including exon 3 of MSH2 was confirmed by amplification of a junction fragment, and was shown to be the result of an unequal recombination between intronic Alu elements.	885	1081
15951966	CONCLUSIONS: MAPH can detect exonic copy number changes in MLH1 and MSH2 in DNA from HNPCC patients.	1082	1182
15951966	Since finding an exonic deletion or duplication makes full sequence analysis unnecessary, it may be most cost-effective to pre-screen samples by MAPH or MLPA before screening for point mutations.	1183	1378
15983230	Polymorphisms in the SLC2A2 (GLUT2) gene are associated with the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes: the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study.	0	166
15983230	Impaired insulin secretion is a fundamental defect in type 2 diabetes.	167	237
15983230	The aim of this study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes regulating insulin secretion (SLC2A2 [encoding GLUT2], GCK, TCF1 [encoding HNF-1alpha], HNF4A, GIP, and GLP1R) are associated with the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes in participants of the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study.	238	599
15983230	With the exception of SLC2A2, other genes were not associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes.	600	695
15983230	All four SNPs of SLC2A2 predicted the conversion to diabetes, and rs5393 (AA genotype) increased the risk of type 2 diabetes in the entire study population by threefold (odds ratio 3.04, 95% CI 1.34-6.88, P = 0.008).	696	912
15983230	The risk for type 2 diabetes in the AA genotype carriers was increased in the control group (5.56 [1.78-17.39], P = 0.003) but not in the intervention group.	913	1070
15983230	We conclude that the SNPs of SLC2A2 predict the conversion to diabetes in obese subjects with IGT.	1071	1169
15991002	Nicotine antagonizes caffeine- but not pentylenetetrazole-induced anxiogenic effect in mice.	0	92
15991002	RATIONALE: Nicotine and caffeine are widely consumed licit psychoactive drugs worldwide.	93	181
15991002	Epidemiological studies showed that they were generally used concurrently.	182	256
15991002	Although some studies in experimental animals indicate clear pharmacological interactions between them, no studies have shown a specific interaction on anxiety responses.	257	427
15991002	OBJECTIVES: The present study investigates the effects of nicotine on anxiety induced by caffeine and another anxiogenic drug, pentylenetetrazole, in mice.	428	583
15991002	The elevated plus-maze (EPM) test was used to evaluate the effects of drugs on anxiety.	584	671
15991002	METHODS: Adult male Swiss Webster mice (25-32 g) were given nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg s.c.) or saline 10 min before caffeine (70 mg/kg i.p.) or pentylenetetrazole (15 and 30 mg/kg i.p.) injections.	672	869
15991002	After 15 min, mice were evaluated for their open- and closed-arm time and entries on the EPM for a 10-min session.	870	984
15991002	Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups by using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test.	985	1094
15991002	RESULTS: Nicotine (0.05-0.25 mg/kg) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test, whereas caffeine (70 mg/kg) and pentylenetetrazole (30 mg/kg) produced an anxiogenic effect, apparent with decreases in open-arm time and entry.	1095	1338
15991002	Nicotine (0.25 mg/kg) pretreatment blocked the caffeine- but not pentylenetetrazole-induced anxiety.	1339	1439
15991002	Administration of each drug and their combinations did not produce any effect on locomotor activity.	1440	1540
15991002	CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of nicotine on caffeine-induced anxiety is specific to caffeine, instead of a non-specific anxiolytic effect.	1541	1712

16000134	A 38-year-old woman was admitted with superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis, which was refractory to anticoagulation therapy.	129	258
16000134	The plasma antithrombin activity was decreased and hardly compensated by concentrated antithrombin preparation due to high consumption rate.	259	399
16000134	However, successful anticoagulation was achieved by administration of direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban.	400	508
16000134	Family studies of antithrombin activity revealed that she had type I congenital antithrombin deficiency.	509	613
16000134	A novel heterozygous mutation in the gene for antithrombin (single nucleotide T insertion at 7916 and 7917, Glu 272 to stop in exon 4) was identified.	614	764
16000134	Argatroban administration would be effective in the treatment of congenital antithrombin deficiency with SMV thrombosis.	765	885
16005363	Identification of a novel WFS1 mutation (AFF344-345ins) in Japanese patients with Wolfram syndrome.	0	99
16005363	Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early onset diabetes mellitus, progressive optic atrophy, sensorineural deafness and diabetes insipidus.	100	279
16005363	Affected individuals may also have renal tract abnormalities as well as neurogical and psychiatric syndromes.	280	389
16005363	WFS1 encoding a transmembrane protein was identified as the gene responsible for WFS.	390	475
16005363	We report herein a Japanese family, of which two members had this syndrome.	476	551
16005363	In the WFS1 gene of these patients, we identified a novel mutation, a nine nucleotide insertion (AFF344-345ins).	552	664
16005363	In addition, one of these patients had preclinical hypopituitarism, which is an unusual feature of WFS.	665	768
16005363	As only the two family members homozygous for the mutation showed WFS, these data support the notion that this mutation is the cause of WFS.	769	909
16018252	Two novel mutations in SRY gene form Chinese sex reversal XY females.	0	69
16018252	The SRY gene (sex determining region on Y chromosome) acts as TDF and is required for regulating male sex determination.	70	190
16018252	SRY represents a transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of genes sharing the HMG-box motif (high-mobility group-box), which acts as DNA binding region.	191	353
16018252	Deletion and inactivating mutations of SRY are among the known causes of XY sex reversal.	354	443
16018252	Here, we described the screening of 10 patients who presented with 46,XY sex reversal for mutations in open reading frame (ORF) of SRY gene.	444	584
16018252	DNA was isolated from blood samples using standard techniques.	585	647
16018252	A 609 bp fragment from the central portion of the SRY gene was amplified, using primers XES-2 and XES-7.	648	752
16018252	The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into the pUCm-T vectors, and direct sequencing were carried out on an ABI 377-3 automated DNA sequencer to detect the mutation.	753	920
16018252	PCR-restriction enzyme digestion was applied to detect the results of DNA sequencing.	921	1006
16018252	In two patients,de novo mutations led to an amino acid substitution.	1007	1075
16018252	An A was replaced by a G in codon 38 upstream of the 5' border outside the HMG box of the SRY gene, resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamate by glycine.	1076	1244
16018252	Another heterozygous T to A transition at the nucleotide position +387 which encodes for a Tyrosine (Tyr) instead of a Term, whereas her father was proven to have the wild-type sequence.	1245	1431
16018252	These point mutations have been confirmed with PCR-restrict enzyme method.	1432	1506
16018252	As demonstrated by the Human Gene Mutation Database analysis,homology search, and review of the literature, these two mutations were not described previously and brought the total number of SRY gene nucleotide substitutions (missense/nonsense) to 45.	1507	1757
16018252	These findings indicated that these amino acid substitutions may be responsible for the sex reversal,not only inside the HMG-box but also outside the HMG-box.	1758	1916
16018252	The two novel mutations in SRY gene provided valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanism of the patient with 46,XY female sex reversal.	1917	2071
16046395	Allelic expression imbalance of human mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) caused by variant A118G.	0	89
16046395	As a primary target for opioid drugs and peptides, the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) plays a key role in pain perception and addiction.	90	222
16046395	Genetic variants of OPRM1 have been implicated in predisposition to drug addiction, in particular the single nucleotide polymorphism A118G, leading to an N40D substitution, with an allele frequency of 10-32%, and uncertain functions.	223	456
16046395	We have measured allele-specific mRNA expression of OPRM1 in human autopsy brain tissues, using A118G as a marker.	457	571
16046395	In 8 heterozygous samples measured, the A118 mRNA allele was 1.5-2.5-fold more abundant than the G118 allele.	572	681
16046395	Transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells of a cDNA representing only the coding region of OPRM1, carrying adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and thymidine in position 118, resulted in 1.5-fold lower mRNA levels only for OPRM1-G118, and more than 10-fold lower OPRM1 protein levels, measured by Western blotting and receptor binding assay.	682	1022
16046395	After transfection and inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D, analysis of mRNA turnover failed to reveal differences in mRNA stability between A118 and G118 alleles, indicating a defect in transcription or mRNA maturation.	1023	1254
16046395	These results indicate that OPRM1-G118 is a functional variant with deleterious effects on both mRNA and protein yield.	1255	1374
16046395	Clarifying the functional relevance of polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to a complex disorder such as drug addiction provides a foundation for clinical association studies.	1375	1559
16051693	Polymorphism of the PEMT gene and susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).	0	93
16051693	Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) catalyzes phosphatidylcholine synthesis.	94	186
16051693	PEMT knockout mice have fatty livers, and it is possible that, in humans, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) might be associated with PEMT gene polymorphisms.	187	351
16051693	DNA samples from 59 humans without fatty liver and from 28 humans with NAFLD were genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 8 of PEMT, which leads to a V175M substitution.	352	536
16051693	V175M is a loss of function mutation, as determined by transiently transfecting McArdle-RH7777 cells with constructs of wild-type PEMT open reading frame or the V175M mutant.	537	711
16051693	Met/Met at residue 175 (loss of function SNP) occurred in 67.9% of the NAFLD subjects and in only 40.7% of control subjects (P<0.03).	712	845
16051693	For the first time we report that a polymorphism of the human PEMT gene (V175M) is associated with diminished activity and may confer susceptibility to NAFLD.	846	1004
16112787	In vivo evidences suggesting the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity: protection by erdosteine.	0	137
16112787	The aims of this study were to examine vancomycin (VCM)-induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to investigate the role of erdosteine, an expectorant agent, which has also antioxidant properties, on kidney tissue against the possible VCM-induced renal impairment in rats.	138	456
16112787	Rats were divided into three groups: sham, VCM and VCM plus erdosteine.	457	528
16112787	VCM was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 200mgkg(-1) twice daily for 7 days.	529	616
16112787	Erdosteine was administered orally.	617	652
16112787	VCM administration to control rats significantly increased renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury) excretion but decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities.	653	905
16112787	Erdosteine administration with VCM injections caused significantly decreased renal MDA and urinary NAG excretion, and increased SOD activity, but not CAT activity in renal tissue when compared with VCM alone.	906	1114
16112787	Erdosteine showed histopathological protection against VCM-induced nephrotoxicity.	1115	1197
16112787	There were a significant dilatation of tubular lumens, extensive epithelial cell vacuolization, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in VCM-treated rats more than those of the control and the erdosteine groups.	1198	1407
16112787	Erdosteine caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage.	1408	1477
16112787	It is concluded that oxidative tubular damage plays an important role in the VCM-induced nephrotoxicity and the modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine reduces the VCM-induced kidney damage both at the biochemical and histological levels.	1478	1723
16116131	rTMS of supplementary motor area modulates therapy-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease.	0	92
16116131	The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in levodopa-induced dyskinesia are unclear.	93	181
16116131	Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson disease, the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a dyskinetic state induced by continuous apomorphine infusion.	182	494
16116131	rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce drug-induced dyskinesias, whereas 5-Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase.	495	630
16120104	A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 5'-untranslated region of the hPER2 gene is associated with diurnal preference.	0	119
16120104	The PERIOD2 (PER2) gene is a key component of the molecular mechanism that generates circadian rhythms in mammals.	120	234
16120104	A missense mutation in the human PER2 gene has previously been linked to advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS).	235	345
16120104	We have investigated three other single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the hPER2 gene, one downstream of the transcription start site (C-1228T), one in exon 2 in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) (C111G), and one missense mutation (G3853A) causing a glycine to glutamine substitution in the predicted protein.	346	654
16120104	Subjects selected from a group of 484 volunteers for extreme morning or evening preference, or intermediate diurnal preference were genotyped with regard to the three polymorphisms (n=35 for each group).	655	858
16120104	Whereas allele frequencies for the other two polymorphisms did not differ significantly between any of the groups, the 111G allele frequency was significantly higher in subjects with extreme morning preference (0.14) than in subjects with extreme evening preference (0.03) (Fisher's exact test, two-sided P value=0.031, odds ratio=5.67).	859	1196
16120104	No significant difference in 111G allele frequency was observed between either of these groups and subjects with intermediate diurnal preference.	1197	1342
16120104	Computer prediction indicated that the C111G polymorphism, which occurs 12 bases upstream from the translation start codon, might alter the secondary structure of the transcript.	1343	1521
16120104	The PER2 111G allele associates with morning preference and is a potential candidate allele for ASPS.	1522	1623
16152606	Carrier frequency of mutation 657del5 in the NBS1 gene in a population of Polish pediatric patients with sporadic lymphoid malignancies.	0	136
16152606	Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a human autosomal recessive disease characterized by genomic instability and enhanced cancer predisposition, in particular to lymphoma and leukemia.	137	321
16152606	Recently, significantly higher frequencies of heterozygous carriers of the Slavic founder NBS1 mutation, 657del5, were found in Russian children with sporadic lymphoid malignancies, and in Polish adults with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).	322	557
16152606	In addition, the substitution 643C>T (R215W) has also been found in excess among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).	558	688
16152606	In an attempt to asses the contribution of both mutations to the development of sporadic lymphoid malignancies, we analyzed DNA samples from a large group of Polish pediatric patients.	689	873
16152606	The NBS1 mutation 657del5 on one allele was found in 3 of 270 patients with ALL and 2 of 212 children and adolescents with NHL; no carrier was found among 63 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).	874	1068
16152606	No carriers of the variant R215W were detected in any studied group.	1069	1137
16152606	The relative frequency of the 657del5 mutation was calculated from a total of 6,984 controls matched by place of patient residence, of whom 42 were found to be carriers (frequency = 0.006).	1138	1327
16152606	In the analyzed population with malignancies, an increased odds ratio for the occurrence of mutation 657del5 was found in comparison with the control Polish population (OR range 1.48-1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.65).	1328	1552
16152606	This finding indicates that the frequency of the mutation carriers was indeed increased in patients with ALL and NHL (p < 0.05).	1553	1681
16152606	Nonetheless, NBS1 gene heterozygosity is not a major risk factor for lymphoid malignancies in childhood and adolescence.	1682	1802
16157158	A Cys 23-Ser 23 substitution in the 5-HT(2C) receptor gene influences body weight regulation in females with seasonal affective disorder: an Austrian-Canadian collaborative study.	0	179
16157158	Most females with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) exhibit atypical vegetative symptoms such as overeating, and weight gain when depressed.	180	320
16157158	The serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)) plays a key role in control of appetite and satiety.	321	410
16157158	A 5-HT(2C) Cys 23 Ser substitution, coded for by a single nucleotide polymorphism (Cys 23 Ser) within the 5-HT(2C) gene, has been shown to influence 5-HT(2C) function.	411	578
16157158	We hypothesized that Cys 23 Ser influences weight regulation in females with SAD.	579	660
16157158	Two independent samples from Austria (162 females with SAD, 119 controls), and Canada (90 females with SAD, 42 controls) were genotyped for Cys 23 Ser.	661	812
16157158	Influence on weight regulation was analyzed within patients with atypical features.	813	896
16157158	In Austrians, genotype distribution differed between patients and controls (p=0.044) and Cys 23 Ser was associated with weight (p=0.039), body mass index (BMI; p=0.038), and seasonal appetite change (p=0.031).	897	1106
16157158	All values were highest in Cys/Cys, intermediate in Cys/Ser, and lowest in Ser/Ser carriers.	1107	1199
16157158	In Canadian patients, Cys 23 Ser was associated with minimum lifetime BMI (p=0.046), with lowest values in Ser/Ser carriers.	1200	1324
16157158	Our data provide evidence that Cys 23 Ser mediates severity of weight regulation disturbances in females with SAD, and the gene-dose effect-like differences suggest a direct functional role of Cys 23 Ser in the behavioral regulation of body weight.	1325	1573
16158428	Delineation of the clinical phenotype associated with OPHN1 mutations based on the clinical and neuropsychological evaluation of three families.	0	144
16158428	Recent reports have demonstrated that mutations in the OPHN1 gene were responsible for a syndromic rather than non-specific mental retardation.	145	288
16158428	Abnormalities of the posterior fossa with cerebellar hypoplasia have been demonstrated in all male patients reported to date.	289	414
16158428	We report here a new family with X-linked mental retardation due to mutation in OPHN1 and present unpublished data about two families previously reported, concerning the facial and psychological phenotype of affected males and carrier females.	415	658
16158428	Our study confirms that cerebellar hypoplasia is a hallmark of this syndrome.	659	736
16158428	In addition, affected males display facial similarities that can help the diagnosis.	737	821
16158428	Most carrier females have mild mental retardation and subtle facial changes.	822	898
16167916	The effects of short-term raloxifene therapy on fibrinolysis markers: TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1.	0	91
16167916	BACKGROUND: Markers of fibrinolysis, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels were studied for the evaluation of short-term effects of raloxifene administration in postmenopausal women.	92	382
16167916	METHODS: Thirty-nine postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective, controlled clinical study.	383	518
16167916	Twenty-five women were given raloxifene hydrochloride (60 mg/day) plus calcium (500 mg/day).	519	611
16167916	Age-matched controls (n = 14) were given only calcium.	612	666
16167916	Plasma TAFI, tPA, and PAI-1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits.	667	805
16167916	Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon's test.	806	865
16167916	Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated.	866	951
16167916	RESULTS: Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations (16% change, P < 0.01), and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations (25% change, P < 0.05).	952	1187
16167916	A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of amenorrhea (P < 0.05; r = 0.33).	1188	1321
16167916	CONCLUSION: We suggest that the increased risk of venous thromboembolism due to raloxifene treatment may be related to increased tPA levels, but not TAFI levels.	1322	1483
16181814	Mono-allelic POLG expression resulting from nonsense-mediated decay and alternative splicing in a patient with Alpers syndrome.	0	127
16181814	Alpers syndrome is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder that affects children and young adults.	128	246
16181814	It is characterized by a progressive, fatal brain and liver disease.	247	315
16181814	This syndrome has been associated with mutations in POLG, the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol gamma).	316	437
16181814	Most patients with Alpers syndrome have been found to be compound heterozygotes, carrying two pathogenic mutations in trans at the POLG locus.	438	580
16181814	POLG is a nuclear-encoded gene whose protein product is imported into mitochondria, where it is essential for mtDNA replication and repair.	581	720
16181814	We studied the skin fibroblasts of a patient with Alpers syndrome having the genotype E873stop/A467T.	721	822
16181814	The E873stop mutation produces a premature termination codon (TAG) in exon 17.	823	901
16181814	The A467T mutation produces a threonine to alanine substitution at a highly conserved site in exon 7.	902	1003
16181814	The allele bearing the stop codon (E873-TAG) is predicted to produce a truncated, catalytically inactive polymerase.	1004	1120
16181814	However, only full-length pol gamma protein was detected by Western blot analysis.	1121	1203
16181814	Here, we show that transcripts containing this stop codon undergo nonsense-associated alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay.	1204	1339
16181814	More than 95% of the functional POLG mRNA was derived from the allele bearing the A467T mutation and less than 5% contained the E873stop mutation.	1340	1486
16181814	These events ensured that virtually all POLG protein in the cell was expressed from the A467T allele.	1487	1588
16181814	Therefore, the Alpers phenotype in this patient was a consequence of a single-copy gene dose of the A467T allele, and selective elimination of transcripts bearing the E873stop mutation.	1589	1774
16186368	Characterization of Bietti crystalline dystrophy patients with CYP4V2 mutations.	0	80
16186368	PURPOSE: Mutations of the CYP4V2 gene, a novel family member of the cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 4q35, have recently been identified in patients with Bietti crystalline dystrophy (BCD).	81	273
16186368	The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of mutations in this gene in BCD patients from Singapore, and to characterize their phenotype.	274	422
16186368	METHODS: Nine patients with BCD from six families were recruited into the study.	423	503
16186368	The 11 exons of the CYP4V2 gene were amplified from genomic DNA of patients by polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced.	504	628
16186368	Detailed characterization of the patients' phenotype was performed with fundal photography, visual field testing, fundal fluorescein angiography, and electroretinography (ERG).	629	805
16186368	RESULTS: Three pathogenic mutations were identified; two mutations, S482X and K386T, were novel and found in three patients.	806	930
16186368	The third mutation, a previously identified 15-bp deletion that included the 3' splice site for exon 7, was found in all nine patients, with six patients carrying the deletion in the homozygous state.	931	1131
16186368	Haplotype analysis in patients and controls indicated a founder effect for this deletion mutation in exon 7.	1132	1240
16186368	Clinical heterogeneity was present in the patients.	1241	1292
16186368	Compound heterozygotes for the deletion in exon 7 seemed to have more severe disease compared to patients homozygous for the deletion.	1293	1427
16186368	There was good correlation between clinical stage of disease and ERG changes, but age did not correlate with disease severity.	1428	1554
16186368	CONCLUSIONS: This study identified novel mutations in the CYP4V2 gene as a cause of BCD.	1555	1643
16186368	A high carrier frequency for the 15-bp deletion in exon 7 may exist in the Singapore population.	1644	1740
16186368	Phenotype characterization showed clinical heterogeneity, and age did not correlate with disease severity.	1741	1847
16200390	A genetic analysis of serotonergic biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes in migraine using a DNA pooling approach.	0	111
16200390	Migraine is a common debilitating primary headache disorder with significant mental, physical and social health implications.	112	237
16200390	The brain neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) is involved in nociceptive pathways and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine.	238	398
16200390	With few genetic studies investigating biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes governing the rate of 5-HT activity and their relationship to migraine, it was the objective of this study to assess genetic variants within the human tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genes in migraine susceptibility.	399	750
16200390	This objective was undertaken using a high-throughput DNA pooling experimental design, which proved to be a very accurate, sensitive and specific method of estimating allele frequencies for single nucleotide polymorphism, insertion deletion and variable number tandem repeat loci.	751	1031
16200390	Application of DNA pooling to a wide array of genetic loci provides greater scope in the assessment of population-based genetic association study designs.	1032	1186
16200390	Despite the application of this high-throughput genotyping method, negative results from the two-stage DNA pooling design used to screen loci within the TPH, AADC and MAOA genes did not support their role in migraine susceptibility.	1187	1419
16225977	Amisulpride related tic-like symptoms in an adolescent schizophrenic.	0	69
16225977	Tic disorders can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine and ziprasidone.	70	186
16225977	However, there are two case reports that show tic-like symptoms, including motor and phonic variants, occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine.	187	345
16225977	We present a 15-year-old girl schizophrenic who developed frequent involuntary eye-blinking movements after 5 months of amisulpride treatment (1000 mg per day).	346	506
16225977	The tic-like symptoms resolved completely after we reduced the dose of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day.	507	613
16225977	However, her psychosis recurred after the dose reduction.	614	671
16225977	We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of quetiapine.	672	737
16225977	She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function.	738	862
16225977	No more tic-like symptoms or other side effects have been reported.	863	930
16225977	Together with previously reported cases, our patient suggests that tic-like symptoms might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, clozapine, or amisulpride.	931	1154

16252083	Therefore, polymorphism of DNA repair genes may affect the process of carcinogenesis.	256	341
16252083	The importance of genetic variability of the components of mismatch repair (MMR) genes is well documented in colorectal cancer, but little is known about its role in breast cancer.	342	522
16252083	hMSH2 is one of the crucial proteins of MMR.	523	567
16252083	We performed a case-control study to test the association between two polymorphisms in the hMSH2 gene: an A --> G transition at 127 position producing an Asn --> Ser substitution at codon 127 (the Asn127Ser polymorphism) and a G --> A transition at 1032 position resulting in a Gly --> Asp change at codon 322 (the Gly322Asp polymorphism) and breast cancer risk and cancer progression.	568	953
16252083	Genotypes were determined in DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 150 breast cancer patients and 150 age-matched women (controls) by restriction fragment length polymorphism and allele-specific PCR.	954	1156
16252083	We did not observe any correlation between studied polymorphisms and breast cancer progression evaluated by node-metastasis, tumor size and Bloom-Richardson grading.	1157	1322
16252083	A strong association between breast cancer occurrence and the Gly/Gly phenotype of the Gly322Asp polymorphism (odds ratio 8.39; 95% confidence interval 1.44-48.8) was found.	1323	1496
16252083	Therefore, MMR may play a role in the breast carcinogenesis and the Gly322Asp polymorphism of the hMSH2 gene may be considered as a potential marker in breast cancer.	1497	1663
16277682	Segregation of a M404V mutation of the p62/sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) gene with polyostotic Paget's disease of bone in an Italian family.	0	138
16277682	Mutations of the p62/Sequestosome 1 gene (p62/SQSTM1) account for both sporadic and familial forms of Paget's disease of bone (PDB).	139	271
16277682	We originally described a methionine-->valine substitution at codon 404 (M404V) of exon 8, in the ubiquitin protein-binding domain of p62/SQSTM1 gene in an Italian PDB patient.	272	448
16277682	The collection of data from the patient's pedigree provided evidence for a familial form of PDB.	449	545
16277682	Extension of the genetic analysis to other relatives in this family demonstrated segregation of the M404V mutation with the polyostotic PDB phenotype and provided the identification of six asymptomatic gene carriers.	546	762
16277682	DNA for mutational analysis of the exon 8 coding sequence was obtained from 22 subjects, 4 PDB patients and 18 clinically unaffected members.	763	904
16277682	Of the five clinically ascertained affected members of the family, four possessed the M404V mutation and exhibited the polyostotic form of PDB, except one patient with a single X-ray-assessed skeletal localization and one with a polyostotic disease who had died several years before the DNA analysis.	905	1205
16277682	By both reconstitution and mutational analysis of the pedigree, six unaffected subjects were shown to bear the M404V mutation, representing potential asymptomatic gene carriers whose circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase were recently assessed as still within the normal range.	1206	1488
16277682	Taken together, these results support a genotype-phenotype correlation between the M404V mutation in the p62/SQSTM1 gene and a polyostotic form of PDB in this family.	1489	1655
16277682	The high penetrance of the PDB trait in this family together with the study of the asymptomatic gene carriers will allow us to confirm the proposed genotype-phenotype correlation and to evaluate the potential use of mutational analysis of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in the early detection of relatives at risk for PDB.	1656	1967
16288197	Genetic homogeneity for inherited congenital microcoria loci in an Asian Indian pedigree.	0	89
16288197	PURPOSE: Congenital microcoria is a rare autosomal dominant developmental disorder of the iris associated with myopia and juvenile open angle glaucoma.	90	241
16288197	Linkage to the chromosomal locus 13q31-q32 has previously been reported in a large French family.	242	339
16288197	In the current study, a three generation Asian Indian family with 15 congenital microcoria (pupils with a diameter <2 mm) affected members was studied for linkage to candidate microsatellite markers at the 13q31-q32 locus.	340	562
16288197	METHODS: Twenty-four members of the family were clinically examined and genomic DNA was extracted.	563	661
16288197	Microsatellite markers at 13q31-q32 were PCR amplified and run on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer and genotyped with the GeneScan analysis.	662	803
16288197	Two point and multipoint linkage analyses were performed using the MLINK and SUPERLINK programs.	804	900
16288197	RESULTS: Peak two point LOD scores of 3.5, 4.7, and 5.3 were found co-incident with consecutive markers D13S154, DCT, and D13S1280.	901	1032
16288197	Multipoint analysis revealed a 4 cM region encompassing D13S1300 to D13S1280 where the LOD remains just over 6.0 Thus we confirm localization of the congenital microcoria locus to chromosomal locus 13q31-q32.	1033	1241
16288197	In addition, eight individuals who had both microcoria and glaucoma were screened for glaucoma genes: myocilin (MYOC), optineurin (OPTN) and CYP1B1.	1242	1390
16288197	Using direct sequencing a point mutation (144 G>A) resulting in a Q48H substitution in exon 1 of the MYOC gene was observed in five of the eight glaucoma patients, but not in unaffected family members and 100 unrelated controls.	1391	1619
16288197	CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed the localization of the congenital microcoria locus (MCOR) to 13q31-q32 in a large Asian Indian family and conclude that current information suggests this is a single locus disorder and genetically homogeneous.	1620	1861
16288197	When combined with the initial linkage paper our haplotype and linkage data map the MCOR locus to a 6-7 cM region between D13S265 and D13S1280.	1862	2005
16288197	The DCT locus, a member of the tyrosinase family involved in pigmentation, maps within this region.	2006	2105
16288197	Data presented here supports the hypothesis that congenital microcoria is a potential risk factor for glaucoma, although this observation is complicated by the partial segregation of MYOC Q48H (1q24.3-q25.2), a mutation known to be associated with glaucoma in India.	2106	2372
16288197	Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis continues with the hope that characterizing the micocoria gene will lead to a better understanding of microcoria and glaucoma causation.	2373	2550
16288197	The relationship between microcoria, glaucoma, and the MYOC Q48H mutation in this family is discussed.	2551	2653
16288199	The promoter of inducible nitric oxide synthase implicated in glaucoma based on genetic analysis and nuclear factor binding.	0	124
16288199	PURPOSE: Nitric oxide has many beneficial functions in the human body at the right amounts, but it can also be hazardous if it is produced in amounts more than needed and has therefore been studied in relation to several neurological and non-neurological disorders.	125	390
16288199	In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate a connection between the inducible form of Nitric Oxide Synthase, iNOS, and the neuropathological disorder glaucoma, one of the major causes of blindness in the world.	391	599
16288199	In this study, we sought to establish the genetic association between iNOS and primary open angle glaucoma, POAG, and to find the functional element(s) connected with the pathogenesis of the disease.	600	799
16288199	METHODS: Two microsatellites, 1 insertion/deletion, and 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regulatory region of iNOS were genotyped in 200 POAG patients and 200 age-matched controls.	800	995
16288199	Also, the CCTTT-microsatellite was examined for its protein-binding capability in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, EMSA.	996	1124
16288199	RESULTS: There was a significant difference in allele distribution of the CCTTT-microsatellite, between patients and controls.	1125	1251
16288199	(CCTTT)14, which has been reported to have a higher activity in a reporter-construct, was significantly more abundant in POAG patients, while (CCTTT)10 and (CCTTT)13 were less common.	1252	1435
16288199	In EMSA, the (CCTTT)14 allele exhibited specific binding of nuclear proteins.	1436	1513
16288199	CONCLUSIONS: These results, together with other studies on this gene and the CCTTT-microsatellite, establish, for the first time, a genetic association of iNOS with POAG and suggest a regulatory function for the microsatellite.	1514	1741
16309808	Does domperidone potentiate mirtazapine-associated restless legs syndrome?	0	74
16309808	There is now evidence to suggest a central role for the dopaminergic system in restless legs syndrome (RLS).	75	183
16309808	For example, the symptoms of RLS can be dramatically improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists, whereas central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms.	184	367
16309808	To our knowledge, there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or aggravate symptoms of RLS.	368	536
16309808	Mirtazapine, the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), has been associated with RLS in several recent publications.	537	684
16309808	The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy.	685	844
16309808	Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine.	845	1019
16309808	Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine-associated RLS.	1020	1201
16309808	However, physicians should be aware of the possibility that mirtazapine can be associated with RLS in some individuals, especially those receiving concomitant dopamine D2 receptor antagonists.	1202	1394
16364460	Microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of hippocampus improves scopolamine-induced amnesia in adult male rats.	0	120
16364460	The effect of ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) on scopolamine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist)-induced amnesia in Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated.	121	276
16364460	Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus.	277	375
16364460	One week later, they received repeatedly vehicles (saline, DMSO, saline+DMSO), scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl saline/side; 30 min before training), ritanserin (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl DMSO/side; 20 min before training) and scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl; 30 min before ritanserin injection)+ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl DMSO) through cannulae each day.	376	740
16364460	Animals were tested for four consecutive days (4 trial/day) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged.	741	867
16364460	In the fifth day, the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor, motivational and visual systems.	868	1023
16364460	The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in scopolamine-treated group as compared to saline group.	1024	1183
16364460	Ritanserin-treated rats (4 microg/0.5 microl/side) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to DMSO-treated group.	1184	1327
16364460	However, scopolamine and ritanserin co-administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the scopolamine-treated rats.	1328	1504
16364460	Our findings show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine-induced amnesia.	1505	1637
16369751	5-Fluorouracil cardiotoxicity induced by alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine.	0	67
16369751	Cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment for malignancies.	68	172
16369751	We herein report the case of a 70-year-old man with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, in whom a high serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) was observed.	173	330
16369751	The patient, who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no cardiac history.	331	503
16369751	After admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng/ml.	504	733
16369751	Both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5-FU.	734	856
16369751	As the precordial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, the administration of 5-FU was abandoned.	857	1001
16369751	Instead, oral administration of S-1 (a derivative of 5-FU), at 200 mg/day twice a week, was instituted, because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradative of 5-FU into FBAL.	1002	1235
16369751	The serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng/ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration.	1236	1372
16369751	Thereafter, no cardiac symptoms were observed.	1373	1419
16369751	The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the S-1 treatment.	1420	1511
16369751	The experience of this case, together with a review of the literature, suggests that FBAL is related to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.	1512	1644
16369751	S-1 may be administered safely to patients with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.	1645	1721
16391785	Homozygous deletion and reduced expression of the DOCK8 gene in human lung cancer.	0	82
16391785	A homozygous deletion of the DOCK8 (dedicator of cytokinesis 8) locus at chromosome 9p24 was found in a lung cancer cell line by array-CGH analysis.	83	231
16391785	Cloning of the full-length DOCK8 cDNA led us to define that the DOCK8 gene encodes a protein consisting of 2,099 amino acids.	232	357
16391785	DOCK8 was expressed in a variety of human organs, including the lungs, and was also expressed in type II alveolar, bronchiolar epithelial and bronchial epithelial cells, which are considered as being progenitors for lung cancer cells.	358	592
16391785	DOCK8 expression was reduced in 62/71 (87%) primary lung cancers compared with normal lung tissue, and the reduction occurred irrespective of the histological type of lung cancer.	593	772
16391785	5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine and/or Trichostatin A treatments induced DOCK8 expression in lung cancer cell lines with reduced DOCK8 expression.	773	911
16391785	Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, were indicated to be involved in DOCK8 down-regulation in lung cancer cells.	912	1075
16391785	Further screening revealed homozygous deletions of the DOCK8 gene in a gastric and a breast cancer cell line.	1076	1185
16391785	DOCK family proteins have been shown to play roles in regulation of migration, morphology, adhesion and growth of cells.	1186	1306
16391785	Thus, the present results suggest that genetic and epigenetic inactivation of DOCK8 is involved in the development and/or progression of lung and other cancers by disturbing such regulations.	1307	1498
16410744	Genetic alterations in primary glioblastomas in Japan.	0	54
16410744	Current knowledge of genetic alterations in glioblastomas is based largely on genetic analyses of tumors from mainly caucasian patients in the United States and Europe.	55	223
16410744	In the present study, screening for several key genetic alterations was performed on 77 primary (de novo) glioblastomas in Japanese patients.	224	365
16410744	SSCP followed by DNA sequencing revealed TP53 mutations in 16 of 73 (22%) glioblastomas and PTEN mutations in 13 of 63 (21%) cases analyzed.	366	506
16410744	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed EGFR amplification in 25 of 77 (32%) cases and p16 homozygous deletion in 32 of 77 (42%) cases.	507	641
16410744	Quantitative microsatellite analysis revealed LOH 10q in 41 of 59 (69%) glioblastomas.	642	728
16410744	The frequencies of these genetic alterations were similar to those reported for primary glioblastomas at the population level in Switzerland.	729	870
16410744	As previously observed for glioblastomas in Europe, there was a positive association between EGFR amplification and p16 deletion (p=0.009), whereas there was an inverse association between TP53 mutations and p16 deletion (p=0.049) in glioblastomas in Japan.	871	1128
16410744	Multivariate analyses showed that radiotherapy was significantly predictive for longer survival of glioblastoma patients (p=0.002).	1129	1260
16410744	SSCP followed by DNA sequencing of the kinase domain (exons 18-21) of the EGFR gene revealed mutations in 2 ou of 69 (3%) glioblastomas in Japan and in 4 of 81 (5%) glioblastomas in Switzerland.	1261	1455
16410744	The allele frequencies of polymorphisms at codon 787 CAG/CAA (Gln/Gln) in glioblastomas in Japan were G/G (82.4%), G/A (10.8%), A/A (6.8%), corresponding to G 0.878 versus A 0.122, significantly different from those in glioblastomas in Switzerland: G/G (27.2%), G/A (28.4%), A/A (44.4%), corresponding to G 0.414 versus A 0.586 (p < 0.0001).	1456	1797
16410744	These results suggest that primary glioblastomas in Japan show genetic alterations similar to those in Switzerland, suggesting a similar molecular basis in caucasians and Asians, despite different genetic backgrounds, including different status of a polymorphism in the EGFR gene.	1798	2078
16412238	Peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor-gamma deficiency in a Canadian kindred with familial partial lipodystrophy type 3 (FPLD3).	0	134
16412238	BACKGROUND: Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3 (FPLD3, Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] 604367) results from heterozygous mutations in PPARG encoding peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.	135	351
16412238	Both dominant-negative and haploinsufficiency mechanisms have been suggested for this condition.	352	448
16412238	METHODS: We present a Canadian FPLD3 kindred with an affected mother who had loss of fat on arms and legs, but no increase in facial, neck, suprascapular or abdominal fat.	449	620
16412238	She had profound insulin resistance, diabetes, severe hypertriglyceridemia and relapsing pancreatitis, while her pre-pubescent daughter had normal fat distribution but elevated plasma triglycerides and C-peptide and depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.	621	884
16412238	RESULTS: The mother and daughter were each heterozygous for PPARG nonsense mutation Y355X, whose protein product in vitro was transcriptionally inactive with no dominant-negative activity against the wild-type receptor.	885	1104
16412238	In addition the mutant protein appeared to be markedly unstable.	1105	1169
16412238	CONCLUSION: Taken together with previous studies of human PPARG mutations, these findings suggest that PPAR-gamma deficiency due either to haploinsufficiency or to substantial activity loss due to dominant negative interference of the normal allele product's function can each contribute to the FPLD3 phenotype.	1170	1481
16418600	Genetic investigation of the TSPYL1 gene in sudden infant death syndrome.	0	73
16418600	BACKGROUND: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) constitutes the most frequent cause of death in the postperinatal period in Germany.	74	206
16418600	Recently, a lethal phenotype characterized by sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome (SIDDT) was identified to be caused by loss of function mutations in the TSPYL1 gene.	207	397
16418600	PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to reveal a possible role of TSPYL1 in SIDS.	398	475
16418600	METHODS: DNA samples of 126 SIDS cases and 261 controls were investigated.	476	550
16418600	RESULTS: We found five sequence variations, each of them causing an amino acid substitution.	551	643
16418600	No Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium and no significant difference in allele frequencies between patients and controls were observed for any variation.	644	791
16418600	In one female patient a p.F366L amino acid polymorphism was found heterozygous, which could not be displayed in controls.	792	913
16418600	A pathogenic implication of this substitution, which is conserved in primates and rodents, cannot be ruled out completely.	914	1036
16418600	Because SIDDT is the result of homozygous TSPYL1 mutations, this heterozygous exchange cannot solely explain the sudden death in this child.	1037	1177
16418600	The reported mutation associated with SIDDT (457_458insG) was not detectable in our cohort.	1178	1269
16418600	CONCLUSION: No association of sequence variations in the TSPYL1 gene and SIDS has been found in a German cohort.	1270	1382
16418600	Genetic analysis of TSPYL1 seems to be of limited significance in the differential diagnosis of SIDS without dysgenesis of the testes.	1383	1517
16506214	Genetic variation in the COX-2 gene and the association with prostate cancer risk.	0	82
16506214	COX-2 is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.	83	161
16506214	The prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are involved in inflammation and pain response in different tissues in the body.	162	279
16506214	Accumulating evidence from epidemiologic studies, chemical carcinogen-induced rodent models and clinical trials indicate that COX-2 plays a role in human carcinogenesis and is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue.	280	496
16506214	We examined whether sequence variants in the COX-2 gene are associated with prostate cancer risk.	497	594
16506214	We analyzed a large population-based case-control study, cancer prostate in Sweden (CAPS) consisting of 1,378 cases and 782 controls.	595	728
16506214	We evaluated 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the entire COX-2 gene in 94 subjects of the control group.	729	851
16506214	Five SNPs had a minor allele frequency of more than 5% in our study population and these were genotyped in all case patients and control subjects and gene-specific haplotypes were constructed.	852	1044
16506214	A statistically significant difference in allele frequency between cases and controls was observed for 2 of the SNPs (+3100 T/G and +8365 C/T), with an odds ratio of 0.78 (95% CI=0.64-0.96) and 0.65 (95% CI=0.45-0.94) respectively.	1045	1276
16506214	In the haplotype analysis, 1 haplotype carrying the variant allele from both +3100 T/G and +8365 C/T, with a population frequency of 3%, was also significantly associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer (p=0.036, global simulated p-value=0.046).	1277	1529
16506214	This study supports the hypothesis that inflammation is involved in prostate carcinogenesis and that sequence variation within the COX-2 gene influence the risk of prostate cancer.	1530	1710
16526029	Evaluation of RGS4 as a candidate gene for schizophrenia.	0	57
16526029	Several studies have suggested that the regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) may be a positional and functional candidate gene for schizophrenia.	58	208
16526029	Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located at the promoter region (SNP4 and SNP7) and the intron 1 (SNP18) of RGS4 have been verified in different ethnic groups.	209	379
16526029	Positive results have been reported in these SNPs with different numbers of SNP combinatory haplotypes.	380	483
16526029	In this study, these three SNP markers were genotyped in 218 schizophrenia pedigrees of Taiwan (864 individuals) for association analysis.	484	622
16526029	Among these three SNPs, neither SNP4, SNP7, SNP18 has shown significant association with schizophrenia in single locus association analysis, nor any compositions of the three SNP haplotypes has shown significantly associations with the DSM-IV diagnosed schizophrenia.	623	890
16526029	Our results fail to support the RGS4 as a candidate gene for schizophrenia when evaluated from these three SNP markers.	891	1010
16541406	Distinct patterns of germ-line deletions in MLH1 and MSH2: the implication of Alu repetitive element in the genetic etiology of Lynch syndrome (HNPCC).	0	151
16541406	A relatively high frequency of germ-line genomic rearrangements in MLH1 and MSH2 has been reported among Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC) patients from different ethnic populations.	152	323
16541406	To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we characterized the DNA breakpoints of 11 germ-line deletions, six for MLH1 and five for MSH2.	324	471
16541406	Distinct deletion patterns were found for the two genes.	472	528
16541406	The five cases of MSH2 deletions result exclusively from intragenic unequal recombination mediated by repetitive Alu sequences.	529	656
16541406	In contrast, five out of the six MLH1 deletions are due to recombinations involving sequences of no significant homology (P=0.015).	657	788
16541406	A detailed analysis of the DNA breakpoints in the two genes, previously characterized by other groups, validated the observation that Alu-mediated unequal recombination is the main type of deletion in MSH2 (n=34), but not in MLH1 (n=21) (P<0.0001).	789	1037
16541406	Plotting the distribution of known DNA breakpoints among the introns of the two genes showed that, the highest breakpoint density is co-localized with the highest Alu density.	1038	1213
16541406	Our study suggests that Alu is a promoting factor for the genomic recombinations in both MLH1 and MSH2, and the local Alu density may be involved in shaping the deletion pattern.	1214	1392
16574712	MDMA polydrug users show process-specific central executive impairments coupled with impaired social and emotional judgement processes.	0	135
16574712	In recent years working memory deficits have been reported in users of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy).	136	257
16574712	The current study aimed to assess the impact of MDMA use on three separate central executive processes (set shifting, inhibition and memory updating) and also on "prefrontal" mediated social and emotional judgement processes.	258	483
16574712	Fifteen polydrug ecstasy users and 15 polydrug non-ecstasy user controls completed a general drug use questionnaire, the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task (set shifting), Backward Digit Span procedure (memory updating), Inhibition of Return (inhibition), an emotional intelligence scale, the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX).	484	850
16574712	Compared with MDMA-free polydrug controls, MDMA polydrug users showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating, and also in social and emotional judgement processes.	851	1023
16574712	The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use.	1024	1106
16574712	These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational ecstasy use.	1107	1258
16574713	Memory function and serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism in ecstasy (MDMA) users.	0	93
16574713	Although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has been shown to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5-HT is involved, such as cognitive function.	94	399
16574713	Because 5-HT transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5-HT transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter promoter gene region (5-HTTLPR) when studying the effects of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning.	400	701
16574713	The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term abstention from MDMA, in subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR.	702	901
16574713	A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males.	902	996
16574713	Fifteen moderate MDMA users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy MDMA+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 ex-MDMA+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests.	997	1210
16574713	DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks (p = 0.04) but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/executive functioning (p = 0.59).	1211	1491
16574713	Heavy and ex-MDMA+ users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls.	1492	1578
16574713	In contrast, no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users.	1579	1661
16574713	No significant effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender was observed.	1662	1719
16574713	While the use of MDMA in quantities that may be considered "moderate" is not associated with impaired memory functioning, heavy use of MDMA use may lead to long lasting memory impairments.	1720	1908
16574713	No effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender on memory function or MDMA use was observed.	1909	1985
16575011	Tumor thymidylate synthase 1494del6 genotype as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients receiving fluorouracil-based adjuvant treatment.	0	146
16575011	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the value of germline and tumor thymidylate synthase (TS) genotyping as a prognostic marker in a series of colorectal cancer patients receiving adjuvant fluorouracil (FU) -based treatment.	147	385
16575011	PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine colorectal cancer patients homogeneously treated with FU plus levamisole or leucovorin in the adjuvant setting were included.	386	557
16575011	TS enhancer region, 3R G > C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and TS 1494del6 polymorphisms were assessed in both fresh-frozen normal mucosa and tumor.	558	714
16575011	Mutational analyses of TS and allelic imbalances were studied in all primary tumors and in 18 additional metachronic metastases.	715	843
16575011	TS protein immunostaining was assessed in an expanded series of 214 tumors.	844	919
16575011	Multivariate Cox models were adjusted for stage, differentiation, and location.	920	999
16575011	RESULTS: Tumor genotyping (frequency of allelic loss, 26%) showed that the 3R/3R genotype was associated with a better outcome (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.93; P = .020 for the recessive model).	1000	1210
16575011	3R G > C SNP genotyping did not add prognostic information.	1211	1270
16575011	Tumor TS 1494del6 allele (frequency of allelic loss, 36%) was protective (for each allele with the deletion, based on an additive model, HR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.82; P = .0034).	1271	1452
16575011	Both polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.71, P < .001), and the 3R/-6 base pair (bp) haplotype showed a significant overall survival benefit compared with the most prevalent haplotype 2R/+6bp (HR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.85; P = .017).	1453	1713
16575011	No TS point mutation was detected in primary tumors or metastases.	1714	1780
16575011	TS protein immunostaining was not associated with survival or any of the genotypes analyzed.	1781	1873
16575011	CONCLUSION: Tumor TS 1494del6 genotype may be a prognostic factor in FU-based adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer patients.	1874	2001
16596970	Pilocarpine seizures cause age-dependent impairment in auditory location discrimination.	0	88
16596970	Children who have status epilepticus have continuous or rapidly repeating seizures that may be life-threatening and may cause life-long changes in brain and behavior.	89	255
16596970	The extent to which status epilepticus causes deficits in auditory discrimination is unknown.	256	349
16596970	A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus.	350	484
16596970	Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day (P) 20, or a convulsant dose of pilocarpine on P20 or P45.	485	611
16596970	Pilocarpine on either day induced status epilepticus; status epilepticus at P45 resulted in CA3 cell loss and spontaneous seizures, whereas P20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous seizures.	612	802
16596970	Mature rats were trained with sound-source location and sound-silence discriminations.	803	889
16596970	Control (saline P20) rats acquired both discriminations immediately.	890	958
16596970	In status epilepticus (P20) rats, acquisition of the sound-source location discrimination was moderately impaired.	959	1073
16596970	Status epilepticus (P45) rats failed to acquire either sound-source location or sound-silence discriminations.	1074	1184
16596970	Status epilepticus in rat causes an age-dependent, long-term impairment in auditory discrimination.	1185	1284
16596970	This impairment may explain one cause of impaired auditory location discrimination in humans.	1285	1378
16611040	Gene therapy for cystic fibrosis airway disease- is clinical success imminent?	0	78
16611040	Cystic fibrosis (CF) was one of the first inherited disorders for which gene therapy was seriously considered as a realistic option for treatment, and as such, it has long provided a paradigm for gene therapy of inherited diseases.	79	310
16611040	However, despite the cloning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene in 1989, over 15 years later a practical gene therapy for CF has not eventuated.	311	484
16611040	There are a number of reasons for this, and analysis of the specific issues that have delayed the successful development of gene therapy for CF also provides general insights into the practical complexities involved in the development of gene therapy for inherited disorders.	485	760
16611040	The issues which have prevented the application of gene therapy for CF to date include the lack of suitable gene delivery technologies, the complexities of the interactions between the host and vector, the biology of the lung airways, and the nature of the pathology found in individuals with CF.	761	1057
16611040	We will discuss the history of CF gene therapy with specific reference to these and other issues that pre-occupy the field at present: namely, the question of what vectors appear to be suitable for airway gene delivery in CF, what cells must be targeted, how airway epithelium defences can be overcome or eluded to allow efficient gene delivery, how to ensure safe and long-term transgene expression and the need to identify relevant surrogate success measures that can be used to assess the outcome of gene therapy in CF patients.	1058	1589
16720068	Possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome related to concomitant treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam.	0	104
16720068	A 74-year-old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to insomnia, loss of appetite, exhaustion, and agitation.	105	248
16720068	Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1.2 mg alprazolam.	249	339
16720068	On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment, the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation, disorientation, and severe muscle rigidity with tremors.	340	506
16720068	The patient had a fever (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms.	507	649
16720068	Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase (2218 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (134 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (78 IU/L), and BUN (27.9 mg/ml) levels.	650	829
16720068	The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms.	830	900
16720068	7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient's serum CPK levels were normalized (175 IU/L).	901	999
16720068	This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), thus demonstrating that NMS-like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment.	1000	1181
16720068	The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's NMS-like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case.	1182	1395
16720068	The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected.	1396	1492
16720068	Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion.	1493	1651
16720068	Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from depression.	1652	1761
16781314	Ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome resulting from a new homozygous mutation, 888delC, in the desmosomal protein plakophilin 1.	0	136
16781314	We report an unusual case of an inherited disorder of the desmosomal protein plakophilin 1, resulting in ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome.	137	287
16781314	The affected 6-year-old boy had red skin at birth and subsequently developed skin fragility, progressive plantar keratoderma, nail dystrophy, and alopecia.	288	443
16781314	Skin biopsy revealed widening of intercellular spaces in the epidermis and a reduced number of small, poorly formed desmosomes.	444	571
16781314	Mutation analysis of the plakophilin 1 gene PKP1 revealed a homozygous deletion of C at nucleotide 888 within exon 5.	572	689
16781314	This mutation differs from the PKP1 gene pathology reported in 8 previously published individuals with this rare genodermatosis.	690	818
16781314	However, all cases show similar clinical features, highlighting the importance of functional plakophilin 1 in maintaining desmosomal adhesion in skin, as well as the role of this protein in aspects of ectodermal development.	819	1043
16801510	Drug-induced long QT syndrome in injection drug users receiving methadone: high frequency in hospitalized patients and risk factors.	0	132
16801510	BACKGROUND: Drug-induced long QT syndrome is a serious adverse drug reaction.	133	210
16801510	Methadone prolongs the QT interval in vitro in a dose-dependent manner.	211	282
16801510	In the inpatient setting, the frequency of QT interval prolongation with methadone treatment, its dose dependence, and the importance of cofactors such as drug-drug interactions remain unknown.	283	476
16801510	METHODS: We performed a systematic, retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all patients hospitalized over a 5-year period in a tertiary care hospital.	477	718
16801510	A total of 167 patients receiving methadone fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving methadone.	719	886
16801510	In addition to methadone dose, 15 demographic, biological, and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for QT prolongation.	887	1038
16801510	RESULTS: Among 167 methadone maintenance patients, the prevalence of QTc prolongation to 0.50 second((1/2)) or longer was 16.2% compared with 0% in 80 control subjects.	1039	1207
16801510	Six patients (3.6%) in the methadone group presented torsades de pointes.	1208	1281
16801510	QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with methadone daily dose (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0.20; P<.01).	1282	1412
16801510	Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31.8% of QTc variability to methadone dose, cytochrome P-450 3A4 drug-drug interactions, hypokalemia, and altered liver function.	1413	1598
16801510	CONCLUSIONS: QT interval prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent finding.	1599	1732
16801510	Methadone dose, presence of cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors, potassium level, and liver function contribute to QT prolongation.	1733	1860
16801510	Long QT syndrome can occur with low doses of methadone.	1861	1916
16810074	Mechanisms of hypertension induced by nitric oxide (NO) deficiency: focus on venous function.	0	93
16810074	Loss of endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide (NO) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction.	94	199
16810074	Experimental hypertension created by the removal of NO, however, involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activity.	200	340
16810074	These include augmented endothelin-1 (ET-1) release, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and elevated tissue oxidative stress.	341	478
16810074	We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle (venomotor) tone plays a role in Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA) hypertension through these mechanisms.	479	633
16810074	Rats were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor LNNA (0.5 g/L in drinking water) for 2 weeks.	634	728
16810074	Mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 +/- 2 mm Hg in control and 194 +/- 5 mm Hg in LNNA rats (P<0.05).	729	843
16810074	Carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction.	844	929
16810074	Maximal contraction to norepinephrine was modestly reduced in arteries from LNNA compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to ET-1 was significantly reduced (54% control).	930	1118
16810074	Maximum contraction of vena cava to norepinephrine (37% control) also was reduced but no change in response to ET-1 was observed.	1119	1248
16810074	Mean circulatory filling pressure, an in vivo measure of venomotor tone, was not elevated in LNNA hypertension at 1 or 2 weeks after LNNA.	1249	1387
16810074	The superoxide scavenger tempol (30, 100, and 300 micromol kg(-1), IV) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose-dependent decrease in LNNA rats (-18 +/- 8, -26 +/- 15, and -54 +/- 11 mm Hg).	1388	1604
16810074	Similarly, ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater fall in LNNA hypertensive rats (76 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared with control rats (35 +/- 10 mm Hg).	1605	1779
16810074	Carotid arteries, vena cava, and sympathetic ganglia from LNNA rats had higher basal levels of superoxide compared with those from control rats.	1780	1924
16810074	These data suggest that while NO deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in both arterial and venous vessels, the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension.	1925	2142
16820346	Atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat.	0	82
16820346	To assess the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin (atorva) on dexamethasone (dex)-induced hypertension, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with atorva 30 mg/kg/day or tap water for 15 days.	83	278
16820346	Dex increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 109 +/- 1.8 to 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg and plasma superoxide (5711 +/- 284.9 saline, 7931 +/- 392.8 U/ml dex, P < 0.001).	279	442
16820346	In this prevention study, SBP in the atorva + dex group was increased from 115 +/- 0.4 to 124 +/- 1.5 mmHg, but this was significantly lower than in the dex-only group (P' < 0.05).	443	623
16820346	Atorva reversed dex-induced hypertension (129 +/- 0.6 mmHg, vs. 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg P' < 0.05) and decreased plasma superoxide (7931 +/- 392.8 dex, 1187 +/- 441.2 atorva + dex, P < 0.0001).	624	810
16820346	Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was decreased in dex-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats (11.2 +/- 1.08 microm, 15.3 +/- 1.17 microm, respectively, P < 0.05).	811	975
16820346	Atorva affected neither plasma NOx nor thymus weight.	976	1029
16820346	Thus, atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat.	1030	1118
16838170	Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the HNF4alpha gene are associated with the conversion to type 2 diabetes mellitus: the STOP-NIDDM trial.	0	139
16838170	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) is a transcription factor, which is necessary for normal function of human liver and pancreatic islets.	140	288
16838170	We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HNF4A, encoding HNF4alpha, influenced the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes mellitus in subjects of the STOP-NIDDM trial.	289	510
16838170	This trial aimed at evaluating the effect of acarbose compared to placebo in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.	511	631
16838170	Eight SNPs covering the intragenic and alternate P2 promoter regions of HNF4A were genotyped in study samples using the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assays.	632	789
16838170	Three SNPs in the P2 promoter region (rs4810424, rs1884614, and rs2144908) were in almost complete association (D'>0.97, r (2)>0.95) and, therefore, only rs4810424 was included in further analyses.	790	987
16838170	Female carriers of the less frequent C allele of rs4810424 had a 1.7-fold elevated risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.66; P=0.020] for the conversion to diabetes compared to women with the common genotype after the adjustment for age, treatment group (placebo or acarbose), smoking, weight at baseline, and weight change.	988	1316
16838170	No association was found in men.	1317	1349
16838170	Haplotype analysis based on three SNPs (rs4810424, rs2071197, and rs3818247) representing the linkage disequilibrium blocks in our study population indicated that the conversion to type 2 diabetes mellitus was dependent on the number of risk alleles in different haplotypes in women.	1350	1633
16838170	Our results suggest that SNPs of HNF4A and their haplotypes predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus in female subjects of the STOP-NIDDM study population.	1634	1787
16840830	Two novel mutations in the MEN1 gene in subjects with multiple endocrine neoplasia-1.	0	85
16840830	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by parathyroid, enteropancreatic endocrine and pituitary adenomas as well as germline mutation of the MEN1 gene.	86	258
16840830	We describe 2 families with MEN1 with novel mutations in the MEN1 gene.	259	330
16840830	One family was of Turkish origin, and the index patient had primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) plus a prolactinoma; three relatives had PHPT only.	331	477
16840830	The index patient in the second family was a 46-yr-old woman of Chinese origin living in Taiwan.	478	574
16840830	This patient presented with a complaint of epigastric pain and watery diarrhea over the past 3 months, and had undergone subtotal parathyroidectomy and enucleation of pancreatic islet cell tumor about 10 yr before.	575	789
16840830	There was also a prolactinoma.	790	820
16840830	Sequence analysis of the MEN1 gene from leukocyte genomic DNA revealed heterozygous mutations in both probands.	821	932
16840830	The Turkish patient and her affected relatives all had a heterozygous A to G transition at codon 557 (AAG-->GAG) of exon 10 of MEN1 that results in a replacement of lysine by glutamic acid.	933	1122
16840830	The Chinese index patient and one of her siblings had a heterozygous mutation at codon 418 of exon 9 (GAC-->TAT) that results in a substitution of aspartic acid by tyrosine.	1123	1296
16840830	In conclusion, we have identified 2 novel missense mutations in the MEN1 gene.	1297	1375
16843501	DNA damage and repair in gastric cancer--a correlation with the hOGG1 and RAD51 genes polymorphisms.	0	100
16843501	The cell's susceptibility to mutagens and its ability to repair DNA lesions are important for cancer induction, promotion and progression.	101	239
16843501	Both the mutagens' sensitivity and the efficacy of DNA repair may be affected by variation in several genes, including DNA repair genes.	240	376
16843501	The hOGG1 gene encodes glycosylase of base excision repair and RAD51 specifies a key protein in homologues recombination repair.	377	505
16843501	Both can be involved in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions, which can contribute to stomach cancer.	506	606
16843501	In the present work we determined the level of basal and oxidative DNA damage and the kinetics of removal of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 gastric cancer patients and 30 healthy individuals.	607	845
16843501	The metrics from DNA damage and repair study were correlated with the genotypes of common polymorphisms of the hOGG1 and RAD51 genes: a G-->C transversion at 1245 position of the hOGG1 gene producing a Ser-->Cys substitution at the codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a G-->C substitution at position 135 (5'-untranslated region) of the RAD51 gene (the G135C polymorphism).	846	1226
16843501	DNA damage and repair were evaluated by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) assisted by DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (Nth) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), preferentially recognizing oxidized DNA bases.	1227	1470
16843501	The genotypes of the polymorphism were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR.	1471	1569
16843501	We observed a strong association between gastric cancer occurrence, impaired DNA repair in human lymphocytes and the G/C genotype of the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene.	1570	1744
16843501	Moreover, there was a strong correlation between that genotype and stomach cancer occurrence in subjects with high level of oxidatively damaged DNA.	1745	1893
16843501	We did not observe any correlation between the Ser1245Cys polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene and gastric cancer, including subjects with impaired DNA repair and/or high levels of endogenous oxidative DNA lesions.	1894	2102
16843501	Therefore, our result suggest that the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene may be linked with gastric cancer by the modulation of the cellular response to oxidative stress and this polymorphism may be a useful additional marker in this disease along with the genetic or/and environmental indicators of oxidative stress.	2103	2423

16849419	CONTEXT: Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) is a rare metabolic disorder, characterized by hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia with increased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)(2)D] resulting in hypercalciuria.	102	352
16849419	OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether mutations in the SLC34A3 gene, which encodes sodium-phosphate cotransporter type IIc, are responsible for the occurrence of HHRH.	353	532
16849419	DESIGN AND SETTING: Mutation analysis of exons and adjacent introns in the SLC34A3 gene was conducted at an academic research laboratory and medical center.	533	689
16849419	PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Members of two unrelated families with HHRH participated in the study.	690	792
16849419	RESULTS: Two affected siblings in one family were homozygous for a 101-bp deletion in intron 9.	793	888
16849419	Haplotype analysis of the SLC34A3 locus in the family showed that the two deletions are on different haplotypes.	889	1001
16849419	An unrelated individual with HHRH was a compound heterozygote for an 85-bp deletion in intron 10 and a G-to-A substitution at the last nucleotide in exon 7.	1002	1158
16849419	The intron 9 deletion (and likely the other two mutations) identified in this study causes aberrant RNA splicing.	1159	1272
16849419	Sequence analysis of the deleted regions revealed the presence of direct repeats of homologous sequences.	1273	1378
16849419	CONCLUSION: HHRH is caused by biallelic mutations in the SLC34A3 gene.	1379	1449
16849419	Haplotype analysis suggests that the two intron 9 deletions arose independently.	1450	1530
16849419	The identification of three independent deletions in introns 9 and 10 suggests that the SLC34A3 gene may be susceptible to unequal crossing over because of sequence misalignment during meiosis.	1531	1724
16867021	Antipsychotic-like profile of thioperamide, a selective H3-receptor antagonist in mice.	0	87
16867021	Experimental and clinical evidence points to a role of central histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.	88	209
16867021	The present study was designed to study the effect of histamine H(3)-receptor ligands on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, apomorphine-induced climbing behavior and amphetamine-induced locomotor activities in mice.	210	421
16867021	Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol (2 mg/kg p.o.), while apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg s.c.) and amphetamine (2 mg/kg s.c.) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities, respectively.	422	621
16867021	(R)-alpha-methylhistamine (RAMH) (5 microg i.c.v.) and thioperamide (THP) (15 mg/kg i.p.), per se did not cause catalepsy.	622	744
16867021	Administration of THP (3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h prior to haloperidol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the catalepsy times (P < 0.05).	745	894
16867021	However, pretreatment with RAMH significantly reversed such an effect of THP (15 mg/kg i.p.).	895	988
16867021	RAMH per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed but THP (15 mg/kg i.p.) per se had no effect on these parameters.	989	1150
16867021	On amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, THP (3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) reduced locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed (P < 0.05).	1151	1290
16867021	Pretreatment with RAMH (5 microg i.c.v.) could partially reverse such effects of THP (3.75 mg/kg i.p.).	1291	1394
16867021	Climbing behavior induced by apomorphine was reduced in animals treated with THP.	1395	1476
16867021	Such an effect was, however, reversed in presence of RAMH.	1477	1535
16867021	THP exhibited an antipsychotic-like profile by potentiating haloperidol-induced catalepsy, reducing amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and reducing apomorphine-induced climbing in mice.	1536	1720
16867021	Such effects of THP were reversed by RAMH indicating the involvement of histamine H(3)-receptors.	1721	1818
16867021	Findings suggest a potential for H(3)-receptor antagonists in improving the refractory cases of schizophrenia.	1819	1929
16867246	Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients.	0	119
16867246	AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor.	120	259
16867246	Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression.	260	525
16867246	In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients.	526	629
16867246	METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks.	630	922
16867246	The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction).	923	998
16867246	RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study.	999	1120
16867246	No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups.	1121	1348
16867246	CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.	1349	1595
16867246	Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS in Caucasians.	1596	1690
16920333	Anticonvulsant effect of eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093) on seizures induced by microperfusion of picrotoxin in the hippocampus of freely moving rats.	0	154
16920333	Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093, S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide) is a novel antiepileptic drug, now in Phase III clinical trials, designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety in comparison with the structurally related drugs carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC).	155	474
16920333	We have studied the effects of oral treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate on a whole-animal model in which partial seizures can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or seizure patterns.	475	694
16920333	In the animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin, the average number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2, and average seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4s.	695	845
16920333	Pre-treatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2h before picrotoxin microperfusion prevented seizures in the 75% of the rats.	846	962
16920333	Lower doses (3 and 10mg/kg) did not suppress seizures, however, after administration of 10mg/kg, significant reductions in seizures duration (24.3+/-6.8s) and seizure number (1.6+/-0.34) were found.	963	1161
16920333	No adverse effects of eslicarbazepine acetate were observed in the behavioral/EEG patterns studied, including sleep/wakefulness cycle, at the doses studied.	1162	1318
17003357	A haplotype-based analysis of the PTPN22 locus in type 1 diabetes.	0	66
17003357	A recent addition to the list of widely confirmed type 1 diabetes risk loci is the PTPN22 gene encoding a lymphoid-specific phosphatase (Lyp).	67	209
17003357	However, evidence supporting a role for PTPN22 in type 1 diabetes derives entirely from the study of just one coding single nucleotide polymorphism, 1858C/T.	210	367
17003357	In the current study, the haplotype structure of the PTPN22 region was determined, and individual haplotypes were tested for association with type 1 diabetes in family-based tests.	368	548
17003357	The 1858T risk allele occurred on only a single haplotype that was strongly associated with type 1 diabetes (P = 7.9 x 10(-5)).	549	676
17003357	After controlling for the effects of this allele, two other haplotypes were observed to be weakly associated with type 1 diabetes (P < 0.05).	677	818
17003357	Sequencing of the coding region of PTPN22 on these haplotypes revealed a novel variant (2250G/C) predicted to result in a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution.	819	979
17003357	Analysis of PTPN22 transcripts from a subject heterozygous for this variant indicated that it interfered with normal mRNA splicing, resulting in a premature termination codon after exon 17.	980	1169
17003357	These results support the conclusion that the 1858C/T allele is the major risk variant for type 1 diabetes in the PTPN22 locus, but they suggest that additional infrequent coding variants at PTPN22 may also contribute to type 1 diabetes risk.	1170	1412
17006606	A polymorphism of C-to-T substitution at -31 IL1B is associated with the risk of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in a Japanese population.	0	138
17006606	Proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms have been demonstrated to associate with gastric cancer risk, of which IL1B-31T/C and -511C/T changes have been well investigated due to the possibility that they may alter the IL1B transcription.	139	379
17006606	The signal transduction target upon interleukin 1 beta (IL1beta) stimulation, the nuclear factor of kappa B (NFkappaB) activation, supports cancer development, signal transduction in which is mediated by FS-7 cell-associated cell surface antigen (FAS) signaling.	380	642
17006606	Based on recent papers describing the prognostic roles of the polymorphisms and the NFkappaB functions on cancer development, we sought to determine if Japanese gastric cancer patients were affected by the IL1B -31/-511 and FAS-670 polymorphisms.	643	889
17006606	A case-control study was conducted on incident gastric adenocarcinoma patients (n=271) and age-gender frequency-matched control subjects (n=271).	890	1035
17006606	We observed strong linkage disequilibrium between the T allele at -511 and the C allele at -31 and between the C allele at -511 and the T allele at -31 in IL1B in both the cases and controls (R (2)=0.94).	1036	1240
17006606	Neither IL1B-31, -511 nor FAS-670 polymorphisms showed significantly different risks of gastric adenocarcinoma.	1241	1352
17006606	Though FAS-670 polymorphisms did not show any significant difference, the proportion of subjects with IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) increased according to stage (trend P=0.019).	1353	1526
17006606	In particular, subjects with stage IV had a two times higher probability of having either IL1B-31TT (or IL1B-511CC) genotype compared with stage I subjects.	1527	1683
17006606	These observations suggest that IL1B-31TT and IL1B-511CC are associated with disease progression.	1684	1781
17033686	A two base pair deletion in the PQBP1 gene is associated with microphthalmia, microcephaly, and mental retardation.	0	115
17033686	X-linked mental retardation has been traditionally divided into syndromic (S-XLMR) and non-syndromic forms (NS-XLMR), although the borderlines between these phenotypes begin to vanish and mutations in a single gene, for example PQBP1, can cause S-XLMR as well as NS-XLMR.	116	387
17033686	Here, we report two maternal cousins with an apparently X-linked phenotype of mental retardation (MR), microphthalmia, choroid coloboma, microcephaly, renal hypoplasia, and spastic paraplegia.	388	580
17033686	By multipoint linkage analysis with markers spanning the entire X-chromosome we mapped the disease locus to a 28-Mb interval between Xp11.4 and Xq12, including the BCOR gene.	581	755
17033686	A missense mutation in BCOR was described in a family with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, a phenotype showing substantial overlapping features with that described in the two cousins.	756	937
17033686	However, no mutation in the BCOR gene was found in both patients.	938	1003
17033686	Subsequent mutation analysis of PQBP1, located within the delineated linkage interval in Xp11.23, revealed a 2-bp deletion, c.461_462delAG, that cosegregated with the disease.	1004	1179
17033686	Notably, the same mutation is associated with the Hamel cerebropalatocardiac syndrome, another form of S-XLMR.	1180	1290
17033686	Haplotype analysis suggests a germline mosaicism of the 2-bp deletion in the maternal grandmother of both affected individuals.	1291	1418
17033686	In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time that mutations in PQBP1 are associated with an S-XLMR phenotype including microphthalmia, thereby further extending the clinical spectrum of phenotypes associated with PQBP1 mutations.	1419	1659
17035713	Chloroacetaldehyde as a sulfhydryl reagent: the role of critical thiol groups in ifosfamide nephropathy.	0	104
17035713	Chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide (IFO) and putatively responsible for renal damage following anti-tumor therapy with IFO.	105	269
17035713	Depletion of sulfhydryl (SH) groups has been reported from cell culture, animal and clinical studies.	270	371
17035713	In this work the effect of CAA on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture (hRPTEC) was investigated.	372	479
17035713	Toxicity of CAA was determined by protein content, cell number, LDH release, trypan blue exclusion assay and caspase-3 activity.	480	608
17035713	Free thiols were measured by the method of Ellman.	609	659
17035713	CAA reduced hRPTEC cell number and protein, induced a loss in free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers.	660	784
17035713	CAA but not acrolein inhibited the cysteine proteases caspase-3, caspase-8 and cathepsin B. Caspase activation by cisplatin was inhibited by CAA.	785	930
17035713	In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage.	931	1055
17035713	The effects of CAA on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate.	1056	1153
17035713	Acidification, which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors, could also attenuate effects of CAA on necrosis markers, thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells.	1154	1343
17035713	Thus, CAA directly reacts with cellular protein and non-protein thiols, mediating its toxicity on hRPTEC.	1344	1449
17035713	This effect can be reduced by acidification.	1450	1494
17035713	Therefore, urinary acidification could be an option to prevent IFO nephropathy in patients.	1495	1586
17059986	A novel splicing mutation in SLC12A3 associated with Gitelman syndrome and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.	0	112
17059986	We report a case of Gitelman syndrome (GS) in a dizygotic twin who presented at 12 years of age with growth delay, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia with inappropriate kaliuresis, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension with bilateral papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri).	113	401
17059986	The patient, her twin sister, and her mother also presented with cerebral cavernous malformations.	402	500
17059986	Based on the early onset and normocalciuria, Bartter syndrome was diagnosed first.	501	583
17059986	However, mutation analysis showed that the proband is a compound heterozygote for 2 mutations in SLC12A3: a substitution of serine by leucine at amino acid position 555 (p.Ser555Leu) and a novel guanine to cytosine transition at the 5' splice site of intron 22 (c.2633+1G>C), providing the molecular diagnosis of GS.	584	900
17059986	These mutations were not detected in 200 normal chromosomes and cosegregated within the family.	901	996
17059986	Analysis of complementary DNA showed that the heterozygous nucleotide change c.2633+1G>C caused the appearance of 2 RNA molecules, 1 normal transcript and 1 skipping the entire exon 22 (r.2521_2634del).	997	1199
17059986	Supplementation with potassium and magnesium improved clinical symptoms and resulted in catch-up growth, but vision remained impaired.	1200	1334
17059986	Three similar associations of Bartter syndrome/GS with pseudotumor cerebri were found in the literature, suggesting that electrolyte abnormalities and secondary aldosteronism may have a role in idiopathic intracranial hypertension.	1335	1566
17059986	This study provides further evidence for the phenotypical heterogeneity of GS and its association with severe manifestations in children.	1567	1704
17059986	It also shows the independent segregation of familial cavernomatosis and GS.	1705	1781
17065198	Analysis of skin cancer risk factors in immunosuppressed renal transplant patients shows high levels of UV-specific tandem CC to TT mutations of the p53 gene.	0	158
17065198	Immunosuppressed renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are predisposed to non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), predominantly squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs).	159	311
17065198	We have analyzed skin lesions from RTRs with aggressive tumors for p53 gene modifications, the presence of Human Papillomas Virus (HPV) DNA in relation to the p53 codon 72 genotype and polymorphisms of the XPD repair gene.	312	534
17065198	We detected 24 p53 mutations in 15/25 (60%) NMSCs, 1 deletion and 23 base substitutions, the majority (78%) being UV-specific C to T transitions at bipyrimidine sites.	535	702
17065198	Importantly, 35% (6/17) are tandem mutations, including 4 UV signature CC to TT transitions possibly linked to modulated DNA repair caused by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA).	703	892
17065198	We found 8 p53 mutations in 7/17 (41%) precancerous actinic keratosis (AK), suggesting that p53 mutations are early events in RTR skin carcinogenesis.	893	1043
17065198	Immunohistochemical analysis shows a good correlation between p53 accumulation and mutations.	1044	1137
17065198	HPV DNA was detected in 78% of skin lesions (60% Basal Cell Carcinomas, 82%AK and 79% SCCs).	1138	1230
17065198	Thus, immunosuppression has increased the risk of infections by HPVs, predominantly epidermodysplasia verruciformis, speculated to play a role in skin cancer development.	1231	1401
17065198	No association is found between HPV status and p53 mutation.	1402	1462
17065198	Moreover, p53 codon 72 or frequencies of three XPD genotypes of RTRs are comparable with control populations.	1463	1572
17065198	The p53 mutation spectrum, presenting a high level of CC to TT mutations, shows that the UV component of sunlight is the major risk factor and modulated DNA repair by immunosuppressive drug treatment may be significant in the skin carcinogenesis of RTRs.	1573	1827
17074608	Valproate-induced chorea and encephalopathy in atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia.	0	83
17074608	Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments.	84	276
17074608	In the classical form it presents as neonatal apnea, intractable seizures, and hypotonia, followed by significant psychomotor retardation.	277	415
17074608	An important subset of children with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner.	416	540

17083016	Genetic polymorphism of the binding domain of surfactant protein-A2 increases susceptibility to meningococcal disease.	0	118
17083016	BACKGROUND: Meningococcal disease occurs after colonization of the nasopharynx with Neisseria meningitidis.	119	226
17083016	Surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D are pattern-recognition molecules of the respiratory tract that activate inflammatory and phagocytic defences after binding to microbial sugars.	227	406
17083016	Variation in the genes of the surfactant proteins affects the expression and function of these molecules.	407	512
17083016	METHODS: Allele frequencies of SP-A1, SP-A2, and SP-D were determined by polymerase chain reaction in 303 patients with microbiologically proven meningococcal disease, including 18 patients who died, and 222 healthy control subjects.	513	746
17083016	RESULTS: Homozygosity of allele 1A1 of SP-A2 increased the risk of meningococcal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-42.4); carriage of 1A5 reduced the risk (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.97).	747	961
17083016	An analysis of the multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms in SP-A demonstrated that homozygosity for alleles encoding lysine (in 1A1) rather than glutamine (in 1A5) at amino acid 223 in the carbohydrate recognition domain was associated with an increased risk of meningococcal disease (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.4-31.5).	962	1277
17083016	Carriage of alleles encoding lysine at residue 223 was found in 61% of patients who died, compared with 35% of those who survived (OR adjusted for age, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.7).	1278	1452
17083016	Genetic variation of SP-A1 and SP-D was not associated with meningococcal disease.	1453	1535
17083016	CONCLUSIONS: Gene polymorphism resulting in the substitution of glutamine with lysine at residue 223 in the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-A2 increases susceptibility to meningococcal disease, as well as the risk of death.	1536	1765
17151160	Randomized comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone for the treatment of first-episode schizophrenia: 4-month outcomes.	0	122
17151160	OBJECTIVE: The authors compared 4-month treatment outcomes for olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders.	123	280
17151160	METHOD: One hundred twelve subjects (70% male; mean age=23.3 years [SD = 5.1]) with first-episode schizophrenia (75%), schizophreniform disorder (17%), or schizoaffective disorder (8%) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day) or risperidone (1-6 mg/day).	281	562
17151160	RESULTS: Response rates did not significantly differ between olanzapine (43.7%, 95% CI=28.8%-58.6%) and risperidone (54.3%, 95% CI=39.9%-68.7%).	563	707
17151160	Among those responding to treatment, more subjects in the olanzapine group (40.9%, 95% CI=16.8%-65.0%) than in the risperidone group (18.9%, 95% CI=0%-39.2%) had subsequent ratings not meeting response criteria.	708	919
17151160	Negative symptom outcomes and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications.	920	1024
17151160	Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1.4 (95% CI=1.2-1.6) with risperidone and 1.2 (95% CI=1.0-1.4) with olanzapine.	1025	1148
17151160	Significantly more weight gain occurred with olanzapine than with risperidone: the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17.3% (95% CI=14.2%-20.5%) with olanzapine and 11.3% (95% CI=8.4%-14.3%) with risperidone.	1149	1385
17151160	Body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24.3 (95% CI=22.8-25.7) versus 28.2 (95% CI=26.7-29.7) with olanzapine and 23.9 (95% CI=22.5-25.3) versus 26.7 (95% CI=25.2-28.2) with risperidone.	1386	1581
17151160	CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcomes with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine, and response may be more stable.	1582	1699
17151160	Olanzapine may have an advantage for motor side effects.	1700	1756
17151160	Both medications caused substantial rapid weight gain, but weight gain was greater with olanzapine.	1757	1856

17166870	Endoglin gene (ENG) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein which acts as an accessory receptor for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, and is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity.	251	458
17166870	A 6-base insertion in intron 7 (6bINS) of ENG has been reported to be associated with microvascular disturbance.	459	571
17166870	OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the relationship between 6bINS and the vascular complication pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in SSc in a French Caucasian population.	572	756
17166870	METHODS: Two hundred eighty SSc cases containing 29/280 having PAH diagnosed by catheterism were compared with 140 patients with osteoarthritis.	757	901
17166870	Genotyping was performed by polymerase-chain-reaction-based fluorescence and direct sequencing of genomic DNA.	902	1012
17166870	RESULTS: The polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.	1013	1073
17166870	We observed a significant lower frequency of 6bINS allele in SSc patients with associated PAH compared with controls [10.3 vs 23.9%, P = 0.01; odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.89], and a trend in comparison with SSc patients without PAH (10.3 vs 20.3%, P = 0.05; OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.19-1.08).	1074	1391
17166870	Genotypes carrying allele 6bINS were also less frequent in SSc patients with PAH than in controls (20.7 vs 42.9%, P = 0.02).	1392	1516
17166870	CONCLUSIONS: Thus the frequency of 6bINS differs between SSc patients with or without PAH, suggesting the implication of ENG in this devastating vascular complication of SSc.	1517	1691
17177139	A novel mutation (E333D) in the thyroid hormone beta receptor causing resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome.	0	109
17177139	Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome characterized by elevated serum thyroid hormones (TH), failure to suppress pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion, and variable peripheral tissue responsiveness to TH.	110	353
17177139	The disorder is associated with diverse mutations in the thyroid hormone beta receptor (TRbeta).	354	450
17177139	Here, we report a novel natural RTH mutation (E333D) located in the large carboxy-terminal ligand binding domain of TRbeta.	451	574
17177139	The mutation was identified in a 22-year-old French woman coming to medical attention because of an increasing overweight.	575	697
17177139	Biochemical tests showed elevated free thyroxine (T4: 20.8 pg/ml (normal, 8.5-18)) and triiodothyronine (T3: 5.7 pg/ml (normal, 1.4-4)) in the serum, together with an inappropriately nonsuppressed TSH level of 4.7 mU/ml (normal, 0.4-4).	698	934
17177139	Her father and her brother's serum tests also showed biochemical abnormalities consistent with RTH.	935	1034
17177139	Direct sequencing of the TRbeta gene revealed a heterozygous transition 1284A>C in exon 9 resulting in substitution of glutamic acid 333 by aspartic acid residue (E333D).	1035	1205
17177139	Further functional analyses of the novel TRbeta mutant were conducted.	1206	1276
17177139	We found that the E333D mutation neither significantly affected the affinity of the receptor for T3 nor modified heterodimer formation with retinoid X receptor (RXR) when bound to DNA.	1277	1461
17177139	However, in transient transfection assays, the E333D TRbeta mutant exhibited impaired transcriptional regulation on two distinct positively regulated thyroid response elements (F2- and DR4-TREs) as well as on the negatively regulated human TSHalpha promoter.	1462	1720
17177139	Moreover, a dominant inhibition of the wild-type TRbeta counterpart transactivation function was observed on both a positive (F2-TRE) and a negative (TSHalpha) promoter.	1721	1890
17177139	These results strongly suggest that the E333D TRbeta mutation is responsible for the RTH phenotype in the proposita's family.	1891	2016
17185386	Families with the risk allele of DISC1 reveal a link between schizophrenia and another component of the same molecular pathway, NDE1.	0	133
17185386	We have previously reported a robust association between an allelic haplotype of 'Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1' (DISC1) and schizophrenia in a nationwide collection of Finnish schizophrenia families.	134	333
17185386	This specific DISC1 allele was later identified to associate with visual working memory, selectively in males.	334	444
17185386	DISC1 association to schizophrenia has since been replicated in multiple independent study samples from different populations.	445	571
17185386	In this study, we conditioned our sample of Finnish families for the presence of the Finnish tentative risk allele for DISC1 and re-analyzed our genome-wide scan data of 443 markers on the basis of this stratification.	572	790
17185386	Two additional loci displayed an evidence of linkage (LOD > 3) and included a locus on 16p13, proximal to the gene encoding NDE1, which has been shown to biologically interact with DISC1.	791	978
17185386	Although none of the observed linkages remained significant after multiple test correction through simulation, further analysis of NDE1 revealed an association between a tag-haplotype and schizophrenia (P = 0.00046) specific to females, which proved to be significant (P = 0.011) after multiple test correction.	979	1290
17185386	Our finding would support the concept that initial gene findings in multifactorial diseases will assist in the identification of other components of complex genetic etiology.	1291	1465
17185386	Notably, this and other converging lines of evidence underline the importance of DISC1-related functional pathways in the etiology of schizophrenia.	1466	1614
17192049	Cytochrome p4501A1 gene variants as susceptibility marker for prostate cancer.	0	78
17192049	CYP1A1 activates environmental procarcinogens and catalyzes oxidative metabolism of estrogens and is likely to play an important role in the etiology of prostate cancer.	79	248
17192049	To evaluate this phenomenon, the association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (A to G transition in exon7 leading to amino acid substitution Ile462Val and T3801C at 3'UTR) of CYP1A1 gene in prostate cancer were analyzed in a case-control study of 100 individuals in South Indian population.	249	550
17192049	The estimated relative risk was significantly high for individuals with w1/m1 genotype at 3'UTR of CYP1A1 gene (OR-4.64; 95%CI = 1.51-14.86; P < 0.01) whereas the CYP1A1 Ile/Val genotype (w2/m2) on exon 7 was found to be associated with a decreased risk for prostate cancer (OR-0.17; 95%CI = 0.02-0.89; P=0.03).	551	862
17192049	A Stratified analysis of the genotypes with age of onset and tumor grade showed the w1/m1 genotype to be significantly associated with an early age of onset; however the tumor grades did not have significant association with the variant genotypes.	863	1110
17192049	Thus the present study indicates that individuals with the variant w1/m1 genotype exhibit an increased risk while those with w2/m2 genotype exhibit a decreased risk for prostate cancer.	1111	1296
17194457	Behavioral effects of pubertal anabolic androgenic steroid exposure in male rats with low serotonin.	0	100
17194457	The goal of this study was to assess the interactive effects of chronic anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) exposure and brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) depletion on behavior of pubertal male rats.	101	308
17194457	Serotonin was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA 100 mg/kg, every other day); controls received saline.	309	451
17194457	At puberty (P40), half the PCPA-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with testosterone (T, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week).	452	590
17194457	Behavioral measures included locomotion, irritability, copulation, partner preference, and aggression.	591	693
17194457	Animals were tested for aggression in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch).	694	810
17194457	Brain levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were determined using HPLC.	811	916
17194457	PCPA significantly and substantially depleted 5-HT and 5-HIAA in all brain regions examined.	917	1009
17194457	Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA.	1010	1132
17194457	Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression.	1133	1306
17194457	T alone had no effect on locomotion, irritability, or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression.	1307	1425
17194457	The most striking effect of combining T+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation.	1426	1622
17194457	Based on these data, it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5-HT may be especially prone to exhibit aggressive behavior.	1623	1766
17221831	The G51S purine nucleoside phosphorylase polymorphism is associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients.	0	123
17221831	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a polygenic and multifactorial complex disease, whose etiopathology is still unclear, however several genetic factors have shown to increase the risk of developing the disease.	124	328
17221831	Purine nucleotides and nucleosides play an important role in the brain.	329	400
17221831	Besides their role in neurotransmission and neuromodulation, they are involved in trophic factor release, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses.	401	545
17221831	These mediators may also have a pivotal role in the control of neurodegenerative processes associated with AD.	546	656
17221831	In this report the distribution of the exonic G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, resulting in the amino acid substitution serine to glycine at position 51 (G51S), was investigated in a large population of AD patients (n=321) and non-demented control (n=208).	657	968
17221831	The PNP polymorphism distribution was not different between patients and controls.	969	1051
17221831	The polymorphism distribution was also analyzed in AD patients stratified according to differential progressive rate of cognitive decline during a 2-year follow-up.	1052	1216
17221831	An increased representation of the PNP AA genotype was observed in AD patients with fast cognitive deterioration in comparison with that from patients with slow deterioration rate.	1217	1397
17221831	Our findings suggest that the G51S PNP polymorphism is associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline in AD patients, highlighting the important role of purine metabolism in the progression of this neurodegenerative disorder.	1398	1627
17255138	Risks and benefits of COX-2 inhibitors vs non-selective NSAIDs: does their cardiovascular risk exceed their gastrointestinal benefit?	0	133
17255138	A retrospective cohort study.	134	163
17255138	OBJECTIVES: The risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with COX-2 inhibitors may offset their gastrointestinal (GI) benefit compared with non-selective (NS) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).	164	371
17255138	We aimed to compare the risks of hospitalization for AMI and GI bleeding among elderly patients using COX-2 inhibitors, NS-NSAIDs and acetaminophen.	372	520
17255138	METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients > or =65 years of age who filled a prescription for NSAID or acetaminophen during 1999-2002.	521	702
17255138	Outcomes were compared using Cox regression models with time-dependent exposures.	703	784
17255138	RESULTS: Person-years of exposure among non-users of aspirin were: 75,761 to acetaminophen, 42,671 to rofecoxib 65,860 to celecoxib, and 37,495 to NS-NSAIDs.	785	942
17255138	Among users of aspirin, they were: 14,671 to rofecoxib, 22,875 to celecoxib, 9,832 to NS-NSAIDs and 38,048 to acetaminophen.	943	1067
17255138	Among non-users of aspirin, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of hospitalization for AMI/GI vs the acetaminophen (with no aspirin) group were: rofecoxib 1.27 (1.13, 1.42), celecoxib 0.93 (0.83, 1.03), naproxen 1.59 (1.31, 1.93), diclofenac 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and ibuprofen 1.05 (0.74, 1.51).	1068	1377
17255138	Among users of aspirin, they were: rofecoxib 1.73 (1.52, 1.98), celecoxib 1.34 (1.19, 1.52), ibuprofen 1.51 (0.95, 2.41), diclofenac 1.69 (1.35, 2.10), naproxen 1.35 (0.97, 1.88) and acetaminophen 1.29 (1.17, 1.42).	1378	1593
17255138	CONCLUSION: Among non-users of aspirin, naproxen seemed to carry the highest risk for AMI/GI bleeding.	1594	1696
17255138	The AMI/GI toxicity of celecoxib was similar to that of acetaminophen and seemed to be better than those of rofecoxib and NS-NSAIDs.	1697	1829
17255138	Among users of aspirin, both celecoxib and naproxen seemed to be the least toxic.	1830	1911
17277899	Polymorphic Alu insertions and the genetic structure of Iberian Basques.	0	72
17277899	Eight Alu sequences (ACE, TPA25, PV92, APO, FXIIIB, D1, A25 and B65) were analyzed in two samples from Navarre and Guipuzcoa provinces (Basque Country, Spain).	73	232
17277899	Alu data for other European, Caucasus and North African populations were compiled from the literature for comparison purposes to assess the genetic relationships of the Basques in a broader geographic context.	233	442
17277899	Results of both MDS plot and AMOVA revealed spatial heterogeneity among these three population clusters clearly defined by geography.	443	576
17277899	On the contrary, no substantial genetic heterogeneity was found between the Basque samples, or between Basques and other Europeans (excluding Caucasus populations).	577	741
17277899	Moreover, the genetic information obtained from Alu data conflicts with hypotheses linking the origin of Basques with populations from North Africa (Berbers) or from the Caucasus region (Georgia).	742	938
17277899	In order to explain the reduced genetic heterogeneity detected by Alu insertions among Basque subpopulations, values of the Wright's F(ST )statistic were estimated for both Alu markers and a set of short tandem repeats (STRs) in terms of two geographical scales: (1) the Basque Country, (2) Europe (including Basques).	939	1257
17277899	In the Basque area, estimates of Wahlund's effect for both genetic markers showed no statistical difference between Basque subpopulations.	1258	1396
17277899	However, when this analysis was performed on a European scale, F(ST) values were significantly higher for Alu insertions than for STR alleles.	1397	1539
17277899	From these results, we suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of the Basque gene pool identified in previous polymorphism studies is relatively recent and probably caused by a differential process of genetic admixture with non-Basque neighboring populations modulated by the effect of a linguistic barrier to random mating.	1540	1863
17297207	Quinine-induced arrhythmia in a patient with severe malaria.	0	60
17297207	It was reported that there was a case of severe malaria patient with jaundice who presented with arrhythmia (premature ventricular contraction) while getting quinine infusion was reported.	61	249
17297207	A man, 25 years old, was admitted to hospital with high fever, chill, vomiting, jaundice.	250	339
17297207	The patient was fully conscious, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse rate 100 x/minute, regular.	340	434
17297207	On admission, laboratory examination showed Plasmodium falciparum (++++), total bilirubin 8.25 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 4.36 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin 3.89 mg/dL, potassium 3.52 meq/L Patient was diagnosed as severe malaria with jaundice and got quinine infusion in dextrose 5% 500 mg/8 hour.	435	734
17297207	On the second day the patient had vomitus, diarrhea, tinnitus, loss of hearing.	735	814
17297207	After 30 hours of quinine infusion the patient felt palpitation and electrocardiography (ECG) recording showed premature ventricular contraction (PVC) > 5 x/minute, trigemini, constant type--sinoatrial block, positive U wave.	815	1040
17297207	He was treated with lidocaine 50 mg intravenously followed by infusion 1500 mg in dextrose 5%/24 hour and potassium aspartate tablet.	1041	1174
17297207	Quinine infusion was discontinued and changed with sulfate quinine tablets.	1175	1250
17297207	Three hours later the patient felt better, the frequency of PVC reduced to 4 - 5 x/minute and on the third day ECG was normal, potassium level was 3.34 meq/L.	1251	1409
17297207	He was discharged on 7th day in good condition.	1410	1457
17297207	Quinine, like quinidine, is a chincona alkaloid that has anti-arrhythmic property, although it also pro-arrhythmic that can cause various arrhythmias, including severe arrhythmia such as multiple PVC.	1458	1658
17297207	Administration of parenteral quinine must be done carefully and with good observation because of its pro-arrhythmic effect, especially in older patients who have heart diseases or patients with electrolyte disorder (hypokalemia) which frequently occurs due to vomiting and or diarrhea in malaria cases.	1659	1961
17304550	Disruption of a synaptotagmin (SYT14) associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities.	0	87
17304550	We report cytogenetic and molecular studies of a de novo, apparently balanced t(1;3)(q32.1;q25.1) identified in a 12-year-old female (designated DGAP128) with cerebral atrophy, macrocephaly seizures, and developmental delay.	88	312
17304550	A combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis demonstrated disruption of a synaptotagmin gene (SYT14) at the 1q32 breakpoint.	313	478
17304550	Expression of SYT14 in human brain was confirmed using Northern analysis.	479	552
17304550	Because members of the synaptotagmin family of proteins function as sensors that link changes in calcium levels with a variety of biological processes, including neurotransmission and hormone-responsiveness, SYT14 is an intriguing candidate gene for the abnormal development in this child.	553	842
17304550	This is the first known constitutional rearrangement of SYT14, and further systematic genetic analysis and clinical studies of DGAP128 may offer unique insights into the role of SYT14 in neurodevelopment.	843	1047
17344330	Syncope and QT prolongation among patients treated with methadone for heroin dependence in the city of Copenhagen.	0	114
17344330	BACKGROUND: Methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts to decrease illicit opioid use.	115	200
17344330	Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes (TdP) has been reported in methadone users.	201	323
17344330	As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of TdP in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone.	324	640
17344330	METHODS: In this cross-sectional study interview, ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult heroin addicts treated with methadone or buprenorphine on a daily basis.	641	826
17344330	Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen, 450 (approximately 52%) were included.	827	943
17344330	The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs.	944	992
17344330	All participants were interviewed about any experience of syncope.	993	1059
17344330	The association between opioid dose and QT, and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively.	1060	1236
17344330	RESULTS: Methadone dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0.140 ms/mg (p = 0.002).	1237	1327
17344330	No association between buprenorphine and QTc was found.	1328	1383
17344330	Among the subjects treated with methadone, 28% men and 32% women had prolonged QTc interval.	1384	1476
17344330	None of the subjects treated with buprenorphine had QTc interval >0.440 s((1/2)).	1477	1558
17344330	A 50 mg higher methadone dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for syncope.	1559	1665
17344330	CONCLUSIONS: Methadone is associated with QT prolongation and higher reporting of syncope in a population of heroin addicts.	1666	1790
17345627	Over-expression of BMP4 and BMP5 in a child with axial skeletal malformations and heterotopic ossification: a new syndrome.	0	123
17345627	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a highly conserved class of signaling molecules that induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation in vivo. Dysregulated expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is found in the cells of patients who have fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a genetic disorder of axial and appendicular skeletal malformation and progressive heterotopic ossification.	124	528
17345627	Loss of function mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein 5 (bmp5) gene leading to under-expression of BMP5 cause the murine short ear syndrome, characterized by small malformed ears and a broad range of axial skeletal malformations.	529	765
17345627	We found features reminiscent of both the short ear mouse and FOP in a child with malformed external ears, multiple malformations of the axial skeleton, and progressive heterotopic ossification in the neck and back.	766	981
17345627	We examined BMP mRNA expression in transformed lymphocytes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression by ELISA assays and immunohistochemistry.	982	1133
17345627	Elevated levels of BMP4 and BMP5 mRNA and protein were detected in the patient's cells while levels of BMP2 mRNA were unchanged.	1134	1262
17345627	Our data suggest that dysregulated expression of BMP4 and BMP5 genes is associated with an array of human axial skeletal abnormalities similar to the short ear mouse and FOP.	1263	1437
17395743	Identification of PVT1 as a candidate gene for end-stage renal disease in type 2 diabetes using a pooling-based genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism association study.	0	173
17395743	To identify genetic variants contributing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in type 2 diabetes, we performed a genome-wide analysis of 115,352 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pools of 105 unrelated case subjects with ESRD and 102 unrelated control subjects who have had type 2 diabetes for > or =10 years without macroalbuminuria.	174	514
17395743	Using a sliding window statistic of ranked SNPs, we identified a 200-kb region on 8q24 harboring three SNPs showing substantial differences in allelic frequency between case and control pools.	515	707
17395743	These SNPs were genotyped in individuals comprising each pool, and strong evidence for association was found with rs2720709 (P = 0.000021; odds ratio 2.57 [95% CI 1.66-3.96]), which is located in the plasmacytoma variant translocation gene PVT1.	708	953
17395743	We sequenced all exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter of PVT1 and identified 47 variants, 11 of which represented nonredundant markers with minor allele frequency > or =0.05.	954	1139
17395743	We subsequently genotyped these 11 variants and an additional 87 SNPs identified through public databases in 319-kb flanking rs2720709 ( approximately 1 SNP/3.5 kb); 23 markers were associated with ESRD at P < 0.01.	1140	1355
17395743	The strongest evidence for association was found for rs2648875 (P = 0.0000018; 2.97 [1.90-4.65]), which maps to intron 8 of PVT1.	1356	1485
17395743	Together, these results suggest that PVT1 may contribute to ESRD susceptibility in diabetes.	1486	1578
17491223	Assessment of a new non-invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.	0	118
17491223	BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.	119	230
17491223	OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m-Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia.	231	615
17491223	METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress test.	616	713
17491223	Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level.	714	816
17491223	In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT.	817	908
17491223	The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group.	909	1038
17491223	dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone.	1039	1147
17491223	RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%.	1148	1353
17491223	CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.	1354	1625
17549393	A novel IRF6 nonsense mutation (Y67X) in a German family with Van der Woude syndrome.	0	85
17549393	Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is the most common type of syndromic orofacial cleft, which accounts for approximately 2% of all cleft lip and palate cases.	86	239
17549393	It is characterised by variable association of lower lip pits, cleft lip and cleft palate, and hypodontia.	240	346
17549393	VWS arises as the result of mutations in the gene encoding interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6).	347	444
17549393	The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, with high penetrance and variable expressivity.	445	553
17549393	Very recently, mutations of the IRF6 gene in exons 2-9 have been found in VWS patients, suggesting that this gene plays an important role in orofacial development.	554	717
17549393	We report a novel mutation of the IRF6 gene in a German family.	718	781
17549393	Five out of the 12 persons affected were able to be investigated.	782	847
17549393	The mutation produced a stop codon within exon 4 of the IRF6 gene.	848	914
17549393	All 5 patients were heterozygous for a base substitution c.201C>A changing the tyrosine codon at amino acid position 67 into a stop codon (p.Y67X) in exon 4.	915	1072
17549393	The premature stop codon was responsible for a truncated protein lacking parts of the DNA- binding domain and the complete Smad-interferon regulatory factor-binding domain probably essential for interactions with the Smad transcription factors.	1073	1317
17595233	Mutations in pattern recognition receptor genes modulate seroreactivity to microbial antigens in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.	0	138
17595233	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A number of antibodies against microbial epitopes or self-antigens have been associated with Crohn's disease.	139	269
17595233	The development of antibodies reflects a loss of tolerance to intestinal bacteria that underlies Crohn's disease, resulting in an exaggerated adaptive immune response to these bacteria.	270	455
17595233	It was hypothesised that the development of antimicrobial antibodies is influenced by the presence of genetic variants in pattern recognition receptor genes.	456	613
17595233	The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of mutations in these innate immune receptor genes (nucleotide oligomerisation domain (NOD) 2/caspase recruitment domain (CARD) 15, NOD1/CARD4, TUCAN/CARDINAL/CARD8, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, TLR2, TLR1 and TLR6) on the development of antimicrobial and antiglycan antibodies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).	614	992
17595233	Materials and METHODS: A cohort of 1163 unrelated patients with IBD (874 Crohn's disease, 259 ulcerative colitis, 30 indeterminate colitis) and 312 controls were analysed for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (gASCA) IgG, anti-laminaribioside antibodies (ALCA) IgG, anti-chitobioside antibodies (ACCA) IgA, anti-mannobioside antibodies (AMCA) IgG and outer membrane porin (Omp) IgA and were genotyped for variants in NOD2/CARD15, TUCAN/CARDINAL/CARD8, NOD1/CARD4, TLR4, TLR1, TLR2 and TLR6.	993	1490
17595233	RESULTS: When compared with Crohn's disease patients without CARD15 mutations, the presence of at least one CARD15 variant in Crohn's disease patients more frequently led to gASCA positivity (66.1% versus 51.5%, p < 0.0001) and ALCA positivity (43.3% versus 34.9%, p = 0.018) and higher gASCA titers (85.7 versus 51.8 ELISA units, p < 0.0001), independent of ileal involvement.	1491	1868
17595233	A gene dosage effect, with increasing gASCA and ALCA positivity for patients carrying none, one and two CARD15 variants, respectively, was seen for both markers.	1869	2030
17595233	Similarly, Crohn's disease patients carrying NOD1/CARD4 indel had a higher prevalence of gASCA antibodies than wild-type patients (63.8% versus 55.2%, p = 0.014), also with a gene dosage effect.	2031	2225
17595233	An opposite effect was observed for the TLR4 D299G and TLR2 P631H variants, with a lower prevalence of ACCA antibodies (23.4% versus 35%, p = 0.013) and Omp antibodies (20.5% versus 34.6%, p = 0.009), respectively.	2226	2440
17595233	CONCLUSION: Variants in innate immune receptor genes were found to influence antibody formation against microbial epitopes.	2441	2564
17595233	In this respect, it is intriguing that an opposite effect of CARD15 and TLR4 variants was observed.	2565	2664
17595233	These findings may contribute to an understanding of the aetiology of the seroreactivity observed in IBD.	2665	2770
17600377	A novel compound, maltolyl p-coumarate, attenuates cognitive deficits and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo dementia models.	0	141
17600377	To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection, we newly synthesized maltolyl p-coumarate by the esterification of maltol and p-coumaric acid.	142	333
17600377	In the present study, we investigated whether maltolyl p-coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine-injected rats and in amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats.	334	509
17600377	Maltolyl p-coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats.	510	731
17600377	We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p-coumarate in vitro using SH-SY5Y cells.	732	830
17600377	Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p-coumarate, before exposed to amyloid beta peptide(1-42), glutamate or H2O2.	831	944
17600377	We found that maltolyl p-coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation.	945	1109
17600377	Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that maltolyl p-coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer's disease that is characterized by wide spread neuronal death and progressive decline of cognitive function.	1110	1370
17628794	Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) gene polymorphisms in urolithiasis.	0	75
17628794	Polymorphism in manganese superoxide dismutase gene (Mn-SOD) is a new approach to identify its probable association with urolithiasis.	76	210
17628794	Oxidative stress may be involved in the development of stone formation in the renal system.	211	302
17628794	MnSOD is one of the primary enzymes that directly scavenges potential harmful oxidizing species.	303	399
17628794	A valine (Val) to alanine (Ala) substitution at amino acid 16, occurring in the mitochondrial targeting sequence of the MnSOD gene, has been associated with an increase in urolithiasis risk.	400	590
17628794	This study was conducted to investigate the association of MnSOD gene polymorphism with the risk of urolithiasis.	591	704
17628794	We investigated the MnSOD in 66 stone-forming adults and 72 healthy volunteers.	705	784
17628794	DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyping was performed with PCR-based methods.	785	876
17628794	Then PCR products were cut by BsaW1.	877	913
17628794	Products were run on 3% agarose gel, 246 bp regions were 1-Ala-9, 164 and 82 bp products were determined as 2 Val-9.	914	1030
17628794	Chi-square test was used for comparison between patients and controls.	1031	1101
17628794	In the control group the homozygote Ala allele was significantly higher than in the patient group (P < 0.01).	1102	1211
17628794	The distribution of Ala/Val and homozygote Val alleles in the patient group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.05).	1212	1350
17628794	MnSOD genotype determination may provide a tool to identify individuals who are at risk of urolithiasis.	1351	1455
17628794	This experiment also provides data about antioxidant status and stone formation.	1456	1536
17634480	Common germline genetic variation in antioxidant defense genes and survival after diagnosis of breast cancer.	0	109
17634480	PURPOSE: The prognosis of breast cancer varies considerably among individuals, and inherited genetic factors may help explain this variability.	110	253
17634480	Of particular interest are genes involved in defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) because ROS are thought to cause DNA damage and contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer.	254	434
17634480	PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined associations between 54 polymorphisms that tag the known common variants (minor allele frequency > 0.05) in 10 genes involved in oxidative damage repair (CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GPX1, GPX4, GSR, TXN, TXN2, TXNRD1, and TXNRD2) and survival in 4,470 women with breast cancer.	435	735
17634480	RESULTS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GPX4 (rs713041 and rs757229) were associated with all-cause mortality even after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing (adjusted P = .0041 and P = .0035).	736	949
17634480	These SNPs are correlated with each other (r2 = 0.61).	950	1004
17634480	GPX4 rs713041 is located near the selenocysteine insertion sequence element in the GPX4 3' untranslated region, and the rare allele of this SNP is associated with an increased risk of death, with a hazard ratio of 1.27 per rare allele carried (95% CI, 1.13 to 11.43).	1005	1272
17634480	This effect was not attenuated after adjusting for tumor stage, grade, or estrogen receptor status.	1273	1372
17634480	We found that the common allele is preferentially expressed in normal lymphocytes, normal breast, and breast tumors compared with the rare allele, but there were no differences in total levels of GPX4 mRNA across genotypes.	1373	1596
17634480	CONCLUSION: These data provide strong support for the hypothesis that common variation in GPX4 is associated with prognosis after a diagnosis of breast cancer.	1597	1756
17671735	Coincidence of mutations in different connexin genes in Hungarian patients.	0	75
17671735	Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of hereditary prelingual sensorineural hearing impairment in Europe.	76	197
17671735	Several studies indicate that different members of the connexin protein family interact to form gap junctions in the inner ear.	198	325
17671735	Mutations in different connexin genes may accumulate and, consequently lead to hearing impairment.	326	424
17671735	Therefore, we screened 47 Hungarian GJB2- heterozygous (one mutation in coding exon of the GJB2 gene) patients with hearing impairment for DNA changes in two further connexin genes (GJB6 and GJB3) and in the 5' non-coding region of GJB2 including the splice sites.	425	689
17671735	Eleven out of 47 GJB2-heterozygous patients analyzed carried the splice site mutation -3170G>A in the 5'UTR region of GJB2.	690	813
17671735	One out of these 11 patients showed homozygous -3170G>A genotype in combination with p.R127H.	814	907
17671735	Next to the GJB2 mutations we noted 2 cases of deletion in GJB6 [Delta(GJB6-D13S1830)] and 3 (2 new and 1 described) base substitutions in GJB3 [c.357C>T, c.798C>T and c.94C>T (p.R32W)] which are unlikely disease-causing.	908	1129
17671735	Our results suggest the importance of routine screening for the rather frequent -3170G>A mutation (in addition to c.35delG) in patients with hearing impairment.	1130	1290
17683901	An improved tetra-primer PCR approach for the detection of the FGFR3 G380R mutation responsible for achondroplasia.	0	115
17683901	Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism and has an incidence of approximately 1/7500.	116	212
17683901	In more than 98% of cases, the disease is associated with a G to A or G to C substitution at nucleotide position 1138 (p.G380R) of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.	213	397
17683901	We have developed a sensitive single tube tetra-primer PCR assay to detect both the c.1138G>A and c.1138G>C mutations and can successfully distinguish DNA samples that are homozygous and heterozygous for the c.1138G>A mutation.	398	625
17683901	Titration studies showed that the assay could reliably detect one copy of the mutant allele in a mix of 100 wild-type alleles.	626	752
17683901	The assay has been tested in 50 healthy controls, 3 known patients with achondroplasia, and 5 amniotic fluids suspected of having achondroplasia and for whom we had previously determined the genotypes for the c.1138G>A mutation by PCR-RFLP.	753	993
17683901	We have observed complete concordance between methods.	994	1048
17683901	Our tetra-primer PCR assay is sensitive, low-cost, and easy to use method for FGFR3 p.G380R genotyping, which could be used even in "low-tech" laboratories.	1049	1205
17854040	Mutations associated with lamivudine-resistance in therapy-na  ve hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients with and without HIV co-infection: implications for antiretroviral therapy in HBV and HIV co-infected South African patients.	0	233
17854040	This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains in selected lamivudine-na  ve HBV carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection in South African patients.	234	466
17854040	Thirty-five lamivudine-na  ve HBV infected patients with or without HIV co-infection were studied: 15 chronic HBV mono-infected patients and 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients.	467	640
17854040	The latter group was further sub-divided into 13 occult HBV (HBsAg-negative) and 7 overt HBV (HBsAg- positive) patients.	641	761
17854040	HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HIV 1/2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL).	762	911
17854040	Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) primers, followed by direct sequencing across the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme.	912	1151
17854040	HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany).	1152	1256
17854040	HBV lamivudine-resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients.	1257	1400
17854040	To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine-resistant strains in therapy-na  ve HBV-HIV co-infected patients.	1401	1548
17854040	The HBV viral loads for mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively.	1549	1702
17854040	It remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (HAART) regimens become widely applied in South Africa, as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBV-HIV co-infected patients.	1703	2060
17879945	Estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir.	0	112
17879945	Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir.	113	234
17879945	Many patients, however, develop negative long-term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis.	235	333
17879945	We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice.	334	487
17879945	Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation.	488	608
17879945	In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir.	609	802
17879945	We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question.	803	892
17879945	Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone or vehicle (0.01% ethanol).	893	1096
17879945	Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h.	1097	1199
17879945	Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated.	1200	1266
17879945	E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment.	1267	1364
17879945	Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL.	1365	1472
17879945	Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression.	1473	1646
17879945	Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level.	1647	1727
17879945	E2 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry.	1728	1835
17879945	This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment.	1836	2044
17910065	A novel missense mutation in the paired domain of human PAX9 causes oligodontia.	0	80
17910065	PAX9 and MSX1 are transcription factors that play essential roles in craniofacial and limb development.	81	184
17910065	In humans, mutations in both genes are associated with nonsyndromic and syndromic oligodontia, respectively.	185	293
17910065	We screened one family with nonsyndromic oligodontia for mutations in PAX9 and MSX1.	294	378
17910065	Single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous C139T transition in PAX9 in the affected members of the family.	379	547
17910065	There were no mutations detected in the entire coding sequence of MSX1.	548	619
17910065	The C139T mutation, predicted to result in the substitution of an arginine by a tryptophan (R47W) in the N-terminal subdomain, affected conserved residues in the PAX9 paired domain.	620	801
17910065	To elucidate the pathogenic mechanism producing oligodontia phenotype caused by this mutation, we analyzed the binding of wild-type and mutant PAX9 paired domain protein to double-stranded DNA targets.	802	1003
17910065	The R47W mutation dramatically reduced DNA binding suggesting that the mutant protein with consequent haploinsufficiency results in a clinical phenotype.	1004	1157
17951029	Focal dermal hypoplasia resulting from a new nonsense mutation, p.E300X, in the PORCN gene.	0	91
17951029	BACKGROUND: Focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH) (OMIM 305600) is an X-linked dominant disorder of ecto-mesodermal development.	92	212
17951029	Also known as Goltz syndrome, FDH presents with characteristic linear streaks of hypoplastic dermis and variable abnormalities of bone, nails, hair, limbs, teeth and eyes.	213	384
17951029	The molecular basis of FDH involves mutations in the PORCN gene, which encodes an enzyme that allows membrane targeting and secretion of several Wnt proteins critical for normal tissue development.	385	582
17951029	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the molecular basis of FDH in a 2-year-old Thai girl who presented at birth with depressed, pale linear scars on the trunk and limbs, sparse brittle hair, syndactyly of the right middle and ring fingers, dental caries and radiological features of osteopathia striata.	583	877
17951029	METHODS: Sequencing of genomic DNA from the affected individual and both parents to search for pathogenic mutations in PORCN gene.	878	1008
17951029	RESULTS: DNA sequencing disclosed a heterozygous G>T substitution at nucleotide c.898 within exon 10 (NM_203475.1), converting a glutamic acid residue (GAA) to a premature termination codon (TAA).	1009	1205
17951029	This mutation, designated p.E300X, was not detected in DNA from either parent or in 100 control chromosomes.	1206	1314
17951029	CONCLUSION: Identification of this new de novo nonsense mutation confirms the diagnosis of FDH in this child and highlights the clinical importance of PORCN and Wnt signalling pathways in embryogenesis.	1315	1517
17959715	Polymorphic MLH1 and risk of cancer after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.	0	88
17959715	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Methylating agents are effective chemotherapy agents for Hodgkin lymphoma, but are associated with the development of second primary cancers.	89	256
17959715	Cytotoxicity of methylating agents is mediated primarily by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system.	257	354
17959715	Loss of MLH1, a major component of DNA MMR, results in tolerance to the cytotoxic effects of methylating agents and persistence of mutagenised cells at high risk of malignant transformation.	355	545
17959715	We hypothesised that a common substitution in the basal promoter of MLH1 (position -93, rs1800734) modifies the risk of cancer after methylating chemotherapy.	546	704
17959715	METHODS: 133 patients who developed cancer following chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (n = 133), 420 patients diagnosed with de novo myeloid leukaemia, 242 patients diagnosed with primary Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1177 healthy controls were genotyped for the MLH1 -93 polymorphism by allelic discrimination polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism assay.	705	1091
17959715	Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for cancer risk by MLH1 -93 polymorphism status, and stratified by previous exposure to methylating chemotherapy, were calculated using unconditional logistic regression.	1092	1303
17959715	RESULTS: Carrier frequency of the MLH1 -93 variant was higher in patients who developed therapy related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) (75.0%, n = 12) or breast cancer (53.3%.	1304	1480
17959715	n = 15) after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma compared to patients without previous methylating exposure (t-AML, 30.4%, n = 69; breast cancer patients, 27.2%, n = 22).	1481	1662
17959715	The MLH1 -93 variant allele was also over-represented in t-AML cases when compared to de novo AML cases (36.9%, n = 420) and healthy controls (36.3%, n = 952), and was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing t-AML (odds ratio 5.31, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 20.15), but only in patients previously treated with a methylating agent.	1663	2021
17959715	CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that the common polymorphism at position -93 in the core promoter of MLH1 defines a risk allele for the development of cancer after methylating chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.	2022	2247
17959715	However, replication of this finding in larger studies is suggested.	2248	2316
17965424	Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients: results of the etoricoxib vs diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial (EDGE-II).	0	189
17965424	OBJECTIVE: A randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	190	377
17965424	PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054).	378	569
17965424	Use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was allowed.	570	634
17965424	The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences (AEs).	635	791
17965424	General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data.	792	885
17965424	Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0-4 point scale).	886	988
17965424	RESULTS: Mean (SD; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively.	989	1144
17965424	The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)).	1145	1359
17965424	The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension-related and oedema-related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with diclofenac (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema).	1360	1615
17965424	Etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy (PGADS mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively).	1616	1745
17965424	CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg. Discontinuations from renovascular AEs, although less common than discontinuations from GI AEs, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.	1746	2029
17975693	Anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin in rats.	0	62
17975693	INTRODUCTION: The possible anxiogenic effects of fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, were investigated in adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex, weighing 150-200 g. METHODS: The drugs were given orally, in doses of 50 mg/kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day.	63	394
17975693	The tests included open-field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze, social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding latency behaviour.	395	559
17975693	RESULTS: The results indicate that ciprofloxacin- and norfloxacin-treated rats showed anxious behaviour in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied.	560	724
17975693	However, ciprofloxacin- and norfloxacin-treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameters.	725	857
17975693	CONCLUSION: The present experimental findings substantiate the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin.	858	995
18046082	Identification of apolipoprotein E Guangzhou (arginine 150 proline), a new variant associated with lipoprotein glomerulopathy.	0	126
18046082	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease characterized by thrombus-like substances in markedly dilated glomerular capillaries and elevated plasma levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE).	127	334
18046082	Previous studies have shown that genetic disorders of apoE may contribute to the pathogenesis of LPG, but LPG may not be caused by apoE gene mutations in Chinese patients.	335	506
18046082	This study investigated the association of a new variant of apoE with LPG in a Chinese family.	507	601
18046082	METHODS: The apoE gene in a family with 4 LPG patients was sequenced.	602	671
18046082	The polymerase chain reaction product of coding region of apoE exon 4 was cloned into pMD 18-T vector and then sequenced.	672	793
18046082	RESULTS: A novel point mutation in exon 4 of the apoE gene was identified in all 4 LPG patients and 1 asymptomatic family member.	794	923
18046082	Sequence analysis confirmed a nucleotide G to C point mutation in exon 4 (base 308) of the apoE gene in all patients and the asymptomatic family member.	924	1076
18046082	This missense mutation denotes amino acid substitution of the proline residue for arginine residue at position 150 of apoE.	1077	1200
18046082	Those patients were all heterozygotes with apoE Guangzhou.	1201	1259
18046082	One of 2 grandsons was a heterozygous carrier of apoE Guangzhou, although he did not have proteinuria.	1260	1362
18046082	CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that apoE (arginine 150 proline) is a novel apoE variant that etiologically related to LPG.	1363	1500
18046082	This variant (apoE Guangzhou) may cause a marked molecular conformational change of the apoE and thus impair its binding ability to lipids.	1501	1640
18050247	Identification of novel susceptibility genes in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus using a uniquely designed candidate gene pathway platform.	0	151
18050247	OBJECTIVE: Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents a unique subgroup of patients for genetic study.	152	271
18050247	The present study was undertaken to identify susceptibility genes contributing to SLE, using a novel candidate gene pathway microarray platform to investigate gene expression in patients with childhood-onset SLE and both of their parents.	272	510
18050247	METHODS: Utilizing bioinformatic tools, a platform of 9,412 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1,204 genes was designed and validated.	511	654
18050247	Molecular inversion probes and high-throughput SNP technologies were used for assay development.	655	751
18050247	Seven hundred fifty three subjects, corresponding to 251 full trios of childhood-onset SLE families, were genotyped and analyzed using transmission disequilibrium testing (TDT) and multitest corrections.	752	955
18050247	RESULTS: Family-based TDT showed a significant association of SLE with a N673S polymorphism in the P-selectin gene (SELP) (P = 5.74 x 10(-6)) and a C203S polymorphism in the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 gene (IRAK1) (P = 9.58 x 10(-6)).	956	1206
18050247	These 2 SNPs had a false discovery rate for multitest correction of <0.05, and therefore a >95% probability of being considered as proven.	1207	1345
18050247	Furthermore, 7 additional SNPs showed q values of <0.5, suggesting association with SLE and providing a direction for followup studies.	1346	1481
18050247	These additional genes notably included TNFRSF6 (Fas) and IRF5, supporting previous findings of their association with SLE pathogenesis.	1482	1618
18050247	CONCLUSION: SELP and IRAK1 were identified as novel SLE-associated genes with a high degree of significance, suggesting new directions in understanding the pathogenesis of SLE.	1619	1795
18050247	The overall design and results of this study demonstrate that the candidate gene pathway microarray platform used provides a novel and powerful approach that is generally applicable in identifying genetic foundations of complex diseases.	1796	2033
18165598	The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release, cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model.	0	148
18165598	BACKGROUND: In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites, long-acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation.	149	291
18165598	In the present study, we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and cyclooxygenase (COX) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects.	292	506
18165598	METHODS: Subjects (n = 114) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h.	507	740
18165598	Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery.	741	812
18165598	After extraction, a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) measurements.	813	933
18165598	RESULTS: The bupivacaine/rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain, as assessed by a visual analog scale, compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h. However, the bupivacaine/placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups.	934	1295
18165598	Moreover, bupivacaine significantly increased COX-2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine/placebo group.	1296	1417
18165598	Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments, indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX-2, but not COX-1.	1418	1584
18165598	CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX-2 gene expression after tissue injury, which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates.	1585	1793
18166824	Genetic investigation of four meiotic genes in women with premature ovarian failure.	0	84
18166824	OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether mutations of meiotic genes, such as disrupted meiotic cDNA (DMC1), MutS homolog (MSH4), MSH5, and S. cerevisiae homolog (SPO11), were associated with premature ovarian failure (POF).	85	326
18166824	DESIGN: Case-control study.	327	354
18166824	METHODS: Blood sampling, karyotype, hormonal dosage, ultrasound, and ovarian biopsy were carried out on most patients.	355	473
18166824	However, the main outcome measure was the sequencing of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples of 41 women with POF and 36 fertile women (controls).	474	625
18166824	RESULTS: A single heterozygous missense mutation, substitution of a cytosine residue with thymidine in exon 2 of MSH5, was found in two Caucasian women in whom POF developed at 18 and 36 years of age.	626	826
18166824	This mutation resulted in replacement of a non-polar amino acid (proline) with a polar amino acid (serine) at position 29 (P29S).	827	956
18166824	Neither 36 control women nor 39 other patients with POF possessed this genetic perturbation.	957	1049
18166824	Another POF patient of African origin showed a homozygous nucleotide change in the tenth of DMC1 gene that led to an alteration of the amino acid composition of the protein (M200V).	1050	1231
18166824	CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of infertility observed in the DMC1 homozygote mutation carrier and in both patients with a heterozygous substitution in exon 2 of the MSH5 gene provide indirect evidence of the role of genes involved in meiotic recombination in the regulation of ovarian function.	1232	1522
18166824	MSH5 and DMC1 mutations may be one explanation for POF, albeit uncommon.	1523	1595
18179903	Mutation analysis of CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, and RAPSN genes in multiple pterygium syndrome/fetal akinesia patients.	0	115
18179903	Multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS) comprise a group of multiple congenital anomaly disorders characterized by webbing (pterygia) of the neck, elbows, and/or knees and joint contractures (arthrogryposis).	116	319
18179903	MPS are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous but are traditionally divided into prenatally lethal and nonlethal (Escobar) types.	320	456
18179903	Previously, we and others reported that recessive mutations in the embryonal acetylcholine receptor g subunit (CHRNG) can cause both lethal and nonlethal MPS, thus demonstrating that pterygia resulted from fetal akinesia.	457	678
18179903	We hypothesized that mutations in acetylcholine receptor-related genes might also result in a MPS/fetal akinesia phenotype and so we analyzed 15 cases of lethal MPS/fetal akinesia without CHRNG mutations for mutations in the CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, and rapsyn (RAPSN) genes.	679	952
18179903	No CHRNA1, CHRNB1, or CHRND mutations were detected, but a homozygous RAPSN frameshift mutation, c.1177-1178delAA, was identified in a family with three children affected with lethal fetal akinesia sequence.	953	1160
18179903	Previously, RAPSN mutations have been reported in congenital myasthenia.	1161	1233
18179903	Functional studies were consistent with the hypothesis that whereas incomplete loss of rapsyn function may cause congenital myasthenia, more severe loss of function can result in a lethal fetal akinesia phenotype.	1234	1447
18189233	RNASEL and RNASEL-inhibitor variation and prostate cancer risk in Afro-Caribbeans.	0	82
18189233	BACKGROUND: Afro-Caribbeans from Tobago are at high risk of developing prostate cancer.	83	170
18189233	This elevated risk of prostate cancer is shared by populations of African ancestry living in diverse environments in the Western hemisphere.	171	311
18189233	Variation in the ribonuclease L (RNASEL) gene has recently been reported to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.	312	444
18189233	However, whether RNASEL variation contributes to the increased risk of prostate cancer observed in populations of African ancestry remains unclear.	445	592
18189233	METHODS: We resequenced the positional candidate gene RNASEL in 48 prostate cancer cases and genotyped the previously reported R462Q and D541E polymorphisms in 230 prostate cancer cases and 458 controls.	593	796
18189233	We also examined the inhibitor of RNASEL (ABCE1) for variation associated with prostate cancer risk.	797	897
18189233	RESULTS: We found no evidence of association between R462Q and D541E polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in our case/control analysis.	898	1035
18189233	A novel variant (K294E) was identified in a single heterozygous individual with prostate cancer.	1036	1132
18189233	We also observed a 20 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism 1,109 bp upstream of the initiation codon, but this variant was not associated with prostate cancer.	1133	1290
18189233	We identified 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABCE1 gene, only 3 of which had a minor allele frequency >5%.	1291	1408
18189233	A common A/G transition -1,071 bp from the transcriptional start site was genotyped and showed no evidence of association with prostate cancer.	1409	1552
18189233	CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that common variation in the putative prostate cancer susceptibility gene, RNASEL, or its inhibitor does not contribute significantly to prostate cancer risk in this Afro-Caribbean population.	1553	1778
18310445	Bone morphogenetic protein-4 interacts with activin and GnRH to modulate gonadotrophin secretion in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs.	0	121
18310445	We have shown previously that, in sheep primary pituitary cells, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP)-4 inhibits FSHbeta mRNA expression and FSH release.	122	272
18310445	In contrast, in mouse LbetaT2 gonadotrophs, others have shown a stimulatory effect of BMPs on basal or activin-stimulated FSHbeta promoter-driven transcription.	273	433
18310445	As a species comparison with our previous results, we used LbetaT2 cells to investigate the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotrophin mRNA and secretion modulated by activin and GnRH.	434	609
18310445	BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSH production, but enhanced the activin+GnRH-induced stimulation of FSHbeta mRNA and FSH secretion, without any effect on follistatin mRNA.	610	779
18310445	BMP-4 reduced LHbeta mRNA up-regulation in response to GnRH (+/-activin) and decreased GnRH receptor expression, which would favour FSH, rather than LH, synthesis and secretion.	780	957
18310445	In contrast to sheep pituitary gonadotrophs, which express only BMP receptor types IA (BMPRIA) and II (BMPRII), LbetaT2 cells also express BMPRIB.	958	1104
18310445	Smad1/5 phosphorylation induced by BMP-4, indicating activation of BMP signalling, was the same whether BMP-4 was used alone or combined with activin+/-GnRH.	1105	1262
18310445	We hypothesized that activin and/or GnRH pathways may be modulated by BMP-4, but neither the activin-stimulated phosphorylation of Smad2/3 nor the GnRH-induced ERK1/2 or cAMP response element-binding phosphorylation were modified.	1263	1493
18310445	However, the GnRH-induced activation of p38 MAPK was decreased by BMP-4.	1494	1566
18310445	This was associated with increased FSHbeta mRNA levels and FSH secretion, but decreased LHbeta mRNA levels.	1567	1674
18310445	These results confirm 1.	1675	1699
18310445	BMPs as important modulators of activin and/or GnRH-stimulated gonadotrophin synthesis and release and 2. important species differences in these effects, which could relate to differences in BMP receptor expression in gonadotrophs.	1700	1931
18356633	An evaluation of amikacin nephrotoxicity in the hematology/oncology population.	0	79
18356633	Amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empirical double gram-negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infections.	80	231
18356633	Strategies of extended-interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population.	232	447
18356633	To evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center.	448	639
18356633	Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended-interval amikacin.	640	837
18356633	The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed.	838	1016
18356633	The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00).	1017	1156
18356633	Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended-interval group (P = 0.002).	1157	1282
18356633	The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups.	1283	1434
18356633	Efficacy could not be assessed.	1435	1466
18366737	The FH mutation database: an online database of fumarate hydratase mutations involved in the MCUL (HLRCC) tumor syndrome and congenital fumarase deficiency.	0	156
18366737	BACKGROUND: Fumarate hydratase (HGNC approved gene symbol - FH), also known as fumarase, is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, involved in fundamental cellular energy production.	157	349
18366737	First described by Zinn et al in 1986, deficiency of FH results in early onset, severe encephalopathy.	350	452
18366737	In 2002, the Multiple Leiomyoma Consortium identified heterozygous germline mutations of FH in patients with multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, (MCUL: OMIM 150800).	453	625
18366737	In some families renal cell cancer also forms a component of the complex and as such has been described as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC: OMIM 605839).	626	802
18366737	The identification of FH as a tumor suppressor was an unexpected finding and following the identification of subunits of succinate dehydrogenase in 2000 and 2001, was only the second description of the involvement of an enzyme of intermediary metabolism in tumorigenesis.	803	1074
18366737	DESCRIPTION: The FH mutation database is a part of the TCA cycle gene mutation database (formerly the succinate dehydrogenase gene mutation database) and is based on the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) system.	1075	1299
18366737	The variants included in the database were derived from the published literature and annotated to conform to current mutation nomenclature.	1300	1439
18366737	The FH database applies HGVS nomenclature guidelines, and will assist researchers in applying these guidelines when directly submitting new sequence variants online.	1440	1605
18366737	Since the first molecular characterization of an FH mutation by Bourgeron et al in 1994, a series of reports of both FH deficiency patients and patients with MCUL/HLRRC have described 107 variants, of which 93 are thought to be pathogenic.	1606	1845
18366737	The most common type of mutation is missense (57%), followed by frameshifts & nonsense (27%), and diverse deletions, insertions and duplications.	1846	1991
18366737	Here we introduce an online database detailing all reported FH sequence variants.	1992	2073
18366737	CONCLUSION: The FH mutation database strives to systematically unify all current genetic knowledge of FH variants.	2074	2188
18366737	We believe that this knowledge will assist clinical geneticists and treating physicians when advising patients and their families, will provide a rapid and convenient resource for research scientists, and may eventually assist in gaining novel insights into FH and its related clinical syndromes.	2189	2485
18385794	Identification of novel mutations and sequence variants in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes in patients with anophthalmia/microphthalmia.	0	129
18385794	PURPOSE: Mutations in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes have been reported in patients with anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia.	130	248
18385794	In this study, we evaluated 34 anophthalmic/microphthalmic patient DNA samples (two sets of siblings included) for mutations and sequence variants in SOX2 and CHX10.	249	414
18385794	METHODS: Conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) was used for the initial SOX2 and CHX10 screening of 34 affected individuals (two sets of siblings), five unaffected family members, and 80 healthy controls.	415	633
18385794	Patient samples containing heteroduplexes were selected for sequence analysis.	634	712
18385794	Base pair changes in SOX2 and CHX10 were confirmed by sequencing bidirectionally in patient samples.	713	813
18385794	RESULTS: Two novel heterozygous mutations and two sequence variants (one known) in SOX2 were identified in this cohort.	814	933
18385794	Mutation c.310 G>T (p. Glu104X), found in one patient, was in the region encoding the high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain and resulted in a change from glutamic acid to a stop codon.	934	1125
18385794	The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p. Pro184ArgfsX19) in the region encoding the activation domain, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the coding sequence.	1126	1363
18385794	The shortened protein products may result in the loss of function.	1364	1430
18385794	In addition, a novel nucleotide substitution c.*557G>A was identified in the 3'-untranslated region in one patient.	1431	1546
18385794	The relationship between the nucleotide change and the protein function is indeterminate.	1547	1636
18385794	A known single nucleotide polymorphism (c. *469 C>A, SNP rs11915160) was also detected in 2 of the 34 patients.	1637	1748
18385794	Screening of CHX10 identified two synonymous sequence variants, c.471 C>T (p.Ser157Ser, rs35435463) and c.579 G>A (p. Gln193Gln, novel SNP), and one non-synonymous sequence variant, c.871 G>A (p. Asp291Asn, novel SNP).	1749	1967
18385794	The non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in healthy controls, suggesting non-causality.	1968	2063
18385794	CONCLUSIONS: These results support the role of SOX2 in ocular development.	2064	2138
18385794	Loss of SOX2 function results in severe eye malformation.	2139	2196
18385794	CHX10 was not implicated with microphthalmia/anophthalmia in our patient cohort.	2197	2277
18410548	Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene mutation analysis in children and adolescents with sporadic pituitary adenomas.	0	136
18410548	OBJECTIVE: Pituitary adenomas occur rarely in childhood and adolescence.	137	209
18410548	Pituitary adenoma predisposition (PAP) has been recently associated with germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene.	210	366
18410548	The aim of the study was to examine the proportion of germline AIP mutations in apparently sporadic paediatric pituitary adenomas.	367	497
18410548	DESIGN: Genomic DNA was analysed for mutations in the AIP gene, by PCR amplification and direct sequencing.	498	605
18410548	PATIENTS: A population-based cohort consisting of 36 apparently sporadic paediatric pituitary adenoma patients, referred to two medical centres in Italy, was included in the study.	606	786
18410548	Patients were either less than 18 years at diagnosis, or showed clinical evidence of adenoma development before the age of 18 years.	787	919
18410548	RESULTS: A heterozygous in-frame deletion Y248del (c.742_744delTAC) was identified in one GH-secreting adenoma patient.	920	1039
18410548	Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of tumour DNA revealed the loss of the wild-type allele.	1040	1134
18410548	First degree relatives carrying the mutation were clinically unaffected.	1135	1207
18410548	CONCLUSIONS: While mutations were absent in non-GH-secreting adenoma patients, germline AIP mutations can be found in children and adolescents with GH-secreting tumours, even in the absence of family history.	1208	1416
18410548	The present study reports the AIP mutation analysis results on patients of a single ethnic origin.	1417	1515
18410548	Clearly, further studies are needed to improve our knowledge on the role of AIP in paediatric pituitary adenomas.	1516	1629
18439317	Association between promoter -1607 polymorphism of MMP1 and lumbar disc disease in Southern Chinese.	0	100
18439317	BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix of the intervertebral disc.	101	233
18439317	A SNP for guanine insertion/deletion (G/D), the -1607 promoter polymorphism, of the MMP1 gene was found significantly affecting promoter activity and corresponding transcription level.	234	418
18439317	Hence it is a good candidate for genetic studies in DDD.	419	475
18439317	METHODS: Southern Chinese volunteers between 18 and 55 years were recruited from the population.	476	572
18439317	DDD in the lumbar spine was defined by MRI using Schneiderman's classification.	573	652
18439317	Genomic DNA was isolated from the leukocytes and genotyping was performed using the Sequenom platform.	653	755
18439317	Association and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium checking were assessed by Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test.	756	865
18439317	RESULTS: Our results showed substantial evidence of association between -1607 promoter polymorphism of MMP1 and DDD in the Southern Chinese subjects.	866	1015
18439317	D allelic was significantly associated with DDD (p value = 0.027, odds ratio = 1.41 with 95% CI = 1.04-1.90) while Genotypic association on the presence of D allele was also significantly associated with DDD (p value = 0.046, odds ratio = 1.50 with 95% CI = 1.01-2.24).	1016	1285
18439317	Further age stratification showed significant genotypic as well as allelic association in the group of over 40 years (genotypic: p value = 0.035, odds ratio = 1.617 with 95% CI = 1.033-2.529; allelic: p value = 0.033, odds ratio = 1.445 with 95% CI = 1.029-2.029).	1286	1550
18439317	Disc bulge, annular tears and the Schmorl's nodes were not associated with the D allele.	1551	1639
18439317	CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that individuals with the presence of D allele for the -1607 promoter polymorphism of MMP1 are about 1.5 times more susceptible to develop DDD when compared with those having G allele only.	1640	1857
18439317	Further association was identified in individuals over 40 years of age.	1858	1929
18439317	Disc bulge, annular tear as well as Schmorl's nodes were not associated with this polymorphism.	1930	2025
18439803	Acute effects of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine-induced seizure in rats.	0	126
18439803	The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (VPU) in comparison to its parent compound, valproic acid (VPA).	127	408
18439803	VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg.	409	606
18439803	In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA.	607	842
18439803	Pretreatment with either VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate.	843	1009
18439803	In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level.	1010	1179
18439803	Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate.	1180	1446
18439803	Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals.	1447	1700
18439803	Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated.	1701	1786
18457324	Genetic polymorphisms in the carbonyl reductase 3 gene CBR3 and the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene NQO1 in patients who developed anthracycline-related congestive heart failure after childhood cancer.	0	207
18457324	BACKGROUND: Exposure to anthracyclines as part of cancer therapy has been associated with the development of congestive heart failure (CHF).	208	348
18457324	The potential role of genetic risk factors in anthracycline-related CHF remains to be defined.	349	443
18457324	Thus, in this study, the authors examined whether common polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in the pharmacodynamics of anthracyclines (in particular, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate:quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene NQO1 and the carbonyl reductase 3 gene CBR3) had an impact on the risk of anthracycline-related CHF.	444	779
18457324	METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted within a cohort of 1979 patients enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who received treatment with anthracyclines and had available DNA.	780	977
18457324	Thirty patients with CHF (cases) and 115 matched controls were genotyped for polymorphisms in NQO1 (NQO1*2) and CBR3 (the CBR3 valine [V] to methionine [M] substitution at position 244 [V244M]).	978	1172
18457324	Enzyme activity assays with recombinant CBR3 isoforms (CBR3 V244 and CBR3 M244) and the anthracycline substrate doxorubicin were used to investigate the functional impact of the CBR3 V244M polymorphism.	1173	1375
18457324	RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for sex and primary disease recurrence were used to test for associations between the candidate genetic polymorphisms (NQO1*2 and CBR3 V244M) and the risk of CHF.	1376	1578
18457324	Analyses indicated no association between the NQO1*2 polymorphism and the risk of anthracycline-related CHF (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; P=.97).	1579	1718
18457324	There was a trend toward an association between the CBR3 V244M polymorphism and the risk of CHF (OR, 8.16; P=.056 for G/G vs A/A; OR, 5.44; P=.092 for G/A vs A/A).	1719	1882
18457324	In line, recombinant CBR3 V244 (G allele) synthesized 2.6-fold more cardiotoxic doxorubicinol per unit of time than CBR3 M244 (A allele; CBR3 V244 [8.26+/-3.57 nmol/hour.mg] vs CBR3 M244 [3.22+/-0.67 nmol/hour.mg]; P=.01).	1883	2105
18457324	CONCLUSIONS: The functional CBR3 V244M polymorphism may have an impact on the risk of anthracycline-related CHF among childhood cancer survivors by modulating the intracardiac formation of cardiotoxic anthracycline alcohol metabolites.	2106	2341
18457324	Larger confirmatory case-control studies are warranted.	2342	2397
18470323	Anticipation in familial lattice corneal dystrophy type I with R124C mutation in the TGFBI (BIGH3) gene.	0	104
18470323	PURPOSE: To report the clinical, ophthalmic, and genetic characteristics for lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCDI) in a Chilean family.	105	242
18470323	METHODS: Six affected family members were examined clinically including visual acuity, color cornea photography, applanation tonography, and fundoscopy.	243	395
18470323	Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes from six affected and three unaffected members of a family with lattice corneal dystrophy type I.	396	546
18470323	Exon 4 of the transforming growth factor-induced gene (TGFBI) was screened for the most frequent mutation, R124C, in the proband by sequencing.	547	690
18470323	We also designed a rapid polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method to analyze the same mutation, amplifying exon 4 and digesting with PstI restriction enzyme.	691	892
18470323	Using this strategy, we analyzed the mutation in six affected and three healthy family members.	893	988
18470323	RESULTS: Three generations of family members were positively diagnosed with lattice corneal dystrophy.	989	1091
18470323	Six participants demonstrated LCD1 in both eyes, most of whom were symmetric.	1092	1169
18470323	Age at onset of symptoms was variable (3-42 years old).	1170	1225
18470323	Moreover, in this family, the age of onset of the disease decreased in succeeding generations, which could be interpreted as anticipation.	1226	1364
18470323	Visual acuity varied from 1.0 to 0.13.	1365	1403
18470323	Two patients, ages 69 and 44 years old, demonstrated a degree of severity "Bad" according to best-corrected vision and corneal commitment.	1404	1542
18470323	The exon 4 sequence of TGFBI of the proband exhibits the heterozygous single-nucleotide mutation, C417T, leading to amino acid substitution (R124C) in the encoded TGF-induced protein.	1543	1726
18470323	Using PCR-RFLP, we confirmed the heterozygous mutation in six affected family members and excluded it in three healthy members.	1727	1854
18470323	CONCLUSIONS: The R124C mutation in TGFBI cosegregated with LCD type I in the investigated family.	1855	1952
18470323	This is the first report of a molecular analysis of LCD type I in Chilean patients.	1953	2036
18470323	The early onset affected persons in the fourth generation raises the possibility of anticipation.	2037	2134
18483878	Exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout (VIP-/-) mice with cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis.	0	154
18483878	Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways.	155	267
18483878	VIP(-/-) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis.	268	414
18483878	Given VIP's role as an anti-inflammatory mediator, we hypothesized that VIP(-/-) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cystitis.	415	572
18483878	A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type (WT) and VIP(-/-) mice with or without CYP-induced cystitis (150 mg/kg; i.p.; 48 h).	573	799
18483878	Four binary comparisons were made: WT control versus CYP treatment (48 h), VIP(-/-) control versus CYP treatment (48 h), WT control versus VIP(-/-) control, and WT with CYP treatment (48 h) versus VIP(-/-) with CYP treatment (48 h).	800	1032
18483878	The genes presented represent (1) greater than 1.5-fold change in either direction and (2) the p value is less than 0.05 for the comparison being made.	1033	1184
18483878	Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme-linked immunoassays including IL-1beta and CXCL1.	1185	1286
18483878	CYP treatment significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased expression of CXCL1 and IL-1beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP(-/-) mice, but expression in VIP(-/-) mice with CYP treatment was significantly (p < or = 0.001) greater (4.2- to 13-fold increase) than that observed in WT urinary bladder (3.6- to 5-fold increase).	1287	1611
18483878	The data suggest that in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation, inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with CYP.	1612	1750
18483878	This shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways.	1751	1925
18503483	Recovery of tacrolimus-associated brachial neuritis after conversion to everolimus in a pediatric renal transplant recipient--case report and review of the literature.	0	167
18503483	TAC has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for solid organ transplantation in pediatrics.	168	272
18503483	Neurotoxicity is a potentially serious toxic effect.	273	325
18503483	It is characterized by encephalopathy, headaches, seizures, or neurological deficits.	326	411
18503483	Here, we describe an eight-and-a-half-yr-old male renal transplant recipient with right BN.	412	503
18503483	MRI demonstrated hyperintense T2 signals in the cervical cord and right brachial plexus roots indicative of both myelitis and right brachial plexitis.	504	654
18503483	Symptoms persisted for three months despite TAC dose reduction, administration of IVIG and four doses of methylprednisolone pulse therapy.	655	793
18503483	Improvement and eventually full recovery only occurred after TAC was completely discontinued and successfully replaced by everolimus.	794	927
18507837	Effects of common germline genetic variation in cell cycle control genes on breast cancer survival: results from a population-based cohort.	0	139
18507837	INTRODUCTION: Somatic alterations have been shown to correlate with breast cancer prognosis and survival, but less is known about the effects of common inherited genetic variation.	140	320
18507837	Of particular interest are genes involved in cell cycle pathways, which regulate cell division.	321	416
18507837	METHODS: We examined associations between common germline genetic variation in 13 genes involved in cell cycle control (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2 [p33], CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A [p21, Cip1], CDKN1B [p27, Kip1], CDKN2A [p16], CDKN2B [p15], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]) and survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer participating in the SEARCH (Studies of Epidemiology and Risk factors in Cancer Heredity) breast cancer study.	417	862
18507837	DNA from up to 4,470 women was genotyped for 85 polymorphisms that tag the known common polymorphisms (minor allele frequency    > 0.05) in the genes.	863	1013
18507837	The genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for association with survival using Cox regression analysis.	1014	1121
18507837	RESULTS: The rare allele of the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2479717 is associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 per rare allele carried, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001), which was not attenuated after adjusting for tumour stage, grade, and treatment.	1122	1433
18507837	This SNP is part of a large linkage disequilibrium block, which contains CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC.	1434	1556
18507837	We evaluated the association of survival and somatic expression of these genes in breast tumours using expression microarray data from seven published datasets.	1557	1717
18507837	Elevated expression of the C6orf49 transcript was associated with breast cancer survival, adding biological interest to the finding.	1718	1850
18507837	CONCLUSION: It is possible that CCND3 rs2479717, or another variant it tags, is associated with prognosis after a diagnosis of breast cancer.	1851	1992
18507837	Further study is required to validate this finding.	1993	2044
18541230	Protective effects of antithrombin on puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats.	0	82
18541230	We investigated the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors, in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis, which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syndrome.	83	288
18541230	Antithrombin (50 or 500 IU/kg/i.v.) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg/kg/i.v.).	289	450
18541230	Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematological abnormalities.	451	556
18541230	Puromycin aminonucleoside-induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed.	557	649
18541230	Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats, while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin-treated rats.	650	873
18541230	In addition, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells.	874	1008
18541230	Furthermore, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased.	1009	1112
18541230	These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome.	1113	1250
18541230	Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome.	1251	1343
18544179	Omitting fentanyl reduces nausea and vomiting, without increasing pain, after sevoflurane for day surgery.	0	106
18544179	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently.	107	266
18544179	Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia.	267	374
18544179	METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients.	375	572
18544179	Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl.	573	720
18544179	RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013).	721	1010
18544179	Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012).	1011	1084
18544179	Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting.	1085	1191
18544179	Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034).	1192	1514
18544179	Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl.	1515	1600
18544179	Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane-sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia.	1601	1755
18544179	CONCLUSION: As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery.	1756	2017
18593936	Curcumin decreases specificity protein expression in bladder cancer cells.	0	74
18593936	Curcumin is the active component of tumeric, and this polyphenolic compound has been extensively investigated as an anticancer drug that modulates multiple pathways and genes.	75	250
18593936	In this study, 10 to 25 micromol/L curcumin inhibited 253JB-V and KU7 bladder cancer cell growth, and this was accompanied by induction of apoptosis and decreased expression of the proapoptotic protein survivin and the angiogenic proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1).	251	561
18593936	Because expression of survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1 are dependent on specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors, we also investigated the effects of curcumin on Sp protein expression as an underlying mechanism for the apoptotic and antiangiogenic activity of this compound.	562	836
18593936	The results show that curcumin induced proteasome-dependent down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in 253JB-V and KU7 cells.	837	959
18593936	Moreover, using RNA interference with small inhibitory RNAs for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, we observed that curcumin-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent genes, such as bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin D1, was also due, in part, to loss of Sp proteins.	960	1230
18593936	Curcumin also decreased bladder tumor growth in athymic nude mice bearing KU7 cells as xenografts and this was accompanied by decreased Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 protein levels in tumors.	1231	1410
18593936	These results show for the first time that one of the underlying mechanisms of action of curcumin as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent is due, in part, to decreased expression of Sp transcription factors in bladder cancer cells.	1411	1637
18657397	Detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in anesthetized rats.	0	100
18657397	Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research.	101	176
18657397	In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats.	177	359
18657397	Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup.	360	459
18657397	After a short period of basal activity recording, epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl penicillin-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded.	460	675
18657397	Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced epileptiform activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis.	676	836
18657397	Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands.	837	1026
18657397	Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and epileptiform activity).	1027	1319
18657397	Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental epilepsies.	1320	1577
18672102	GATA4 mutations in 486 Chinese patients with congenital heart disease.	0	70
18672102	Recent studies have reported germline mutations in GATA4 gene in some types of congenital heart disease (CHD).	71	181
18672102	However, the prevalence of GATA4 mutations in CHD and the correlation between the GATA4 genotype and CHD phenotype have not been extensively studied.	182	331
18672102	We screened germline mutations in the coding exons and the flanking intron sequences of the GATA4 gene in 486 CHD patients by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and confirmed the mutations by sequencing.	332	559
18672102	Nine distinct mutations including one small deletion mutation (46delS), two small insertion mutations (118-119insA and 125-126insAA), and six non-synonymous mutations (A6V, P163S, E359K, P407Q, S429T and A442V) were identified in 12 of the 486 patients (nine with ventricular septal defect, two with Tetralogy of Fallot, and one with endocardial cushion defect).	560	922
18672102	Of them, two patients carrying E359K mutation were from two generations in one family with ventricular septal defect (VSD).	923	1046
18672102	Interestingly, a nucleotide insertion of c.1146+25insA in exon 6 was detected in five VSD patients, but not in 486 normal healthy controls.	1047	1186
18672102	Our findings are useful in understanding the prevalence of GATA4 mutations and the correlation between the GATA4 genotype and the CHD phenotype in Chinese patients.	1187	1351
18674790	High fat diet-fed obese rats are highly sensitive to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.	0	88
18674790	Often, chemotherapy by doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy.	89	222
18674790	Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.	223	341
18674790	This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway.	342	528
18674790	In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.	529	752
18674790	A LD(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese (OB) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity.	753	1015
18674790	Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (ND) and OB hearts.	1016	1180
18674790	Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in ND versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in OB), (5) decreased mitochondrial AMP-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP/ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration.	1181	1744
18674790	Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK/STAT3 pathway.	1745	1859
18674790	In conclusion, HFD-induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway.	1860	2097

18681856	OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and genetic features of a Thai family with non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism (NAH) caused by an activating germline mutation in the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) gene.	145	339
18681856	PATIENTS: Three affected individuals from the same family (a father and his two children) were studied.	340	443
18681856	Clinical and imaging findings were reviewed and compared.	444	501
18681856	GENETIC ANALYSIS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and mutation analysis of the entire coding sequence of the TSHR gene was performed in both children and their parents by direct DNA sequencing.	502	722
18681856	RESULTS: A heterozygous germline T to C transition in exon 10 of the TSHR gene (c.1358T-->C) resulting in the substitution of methionine (ATG) by threonine (ACG) at codon 453 (p.M453T) was identified in the father and his two children.	723	958
18681856	They presented with different clinical severity and variable age of onset.	959	1033
18681856	In addition to hyperthyroidism, ventriculomegaly and bilateral shortening of the fifth metacarpal bones and the middle phalanges of the fifth fingers were consistently found in all affected individuals.	1034	1236
18681856	CONCLUSIONS: Ventriculomegaly and bilateral shortening of the fifth metacarpal bones and the middle phalanges of the fifth fingers might be characteristic features of NAH because of an activating TSHR germline mutation.	1237	1456
18681856	In addition, the shortening of the middle phalanges of the fifth fingers has never been previously described, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of the disease.	1457	1616
18779591	Identification of a gain-of-function mutation of the prolactin receptor in women with benign breast tumors.	0	107
18779591	There is currently no known genetic disease linked to prolactin (Prl) or its receptor (PrlR) in humans.	108	211
18779591	Given the essential role of this hormonal system in breast physiology, we reasoned that genetic anomalies of Prl/PrlR genes may be related to the occurrence of breast diseases with high proliferative potential.	212	422
18779591	Multiple fibroadenomas (MFA) are benign breast tumors which appear most frequently in young women, including at puberty, when Prl has well-recognized proliferative actions on the breast.	423	609
18779591	In a prospective study involving 74 MFA patients and 170 control subjects, we identified four patients harboring a heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 6 of the PrlR gene, encoding Ile(146)-->Leu substitution in its extracellular domain.	610	862
18779591	This sole substitution was sufficient to confer constitutive activity to the receptor variant (PrlR(I146L)), as assessed in three reconstituted cell models (Ba/F3, HEK293 and MCF-7 cells) by Prl-independent (i) PrlR tyrosine phosphorylation, (ii) activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling, (iii) transcriptional activity toward a Prl-responsive reporter gene, and (iv) cell proliferation and protection from cell death.	863	1323
18779591	Constitutive activity of PrlR(I146L) in the breast sample from a patient was supported by increased STAT5 signaling.	1324	1440
18779591	This is a unique description of a functional mutation of the PrlR associated with a human disease.	1441	1539
18779591	Hallmarks of constitutive activity were all reversed by a specific PrlR antagonist, which opens potential therapeutic approaches for MFA, or any other disease that could be associated with this mutation in future.	1540	1753
18808529	Isoproterenol induces primary loss of dystrophin in rat hearts: correlation with myocardial injury.	0	99
18808529	The mechanism of isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage is unknown, but a mismatch of oxygen supply vs. demand following coronary hypotension and myocardial hyperactivity is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed.	100	347
18808529	Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by isoproterenol.	348	484
18808529	Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins.	485	817
18808529	We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to isoproterenol subcutaneous administration.	818	918
18808529	Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.	919	1098
18808529	The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin.	1099	1183
18808529	Subsequently, after lysis of myofilaments, gamma-sarcoglycan, beta-dystroglycan, beta1-integrin, and laminin alpha-2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown, as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process.	1184	1399
18808529	In conclusion, administration of isoproterenol to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin, the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte.	1400	1638
18808529	These changes, related to ischaemic injury, explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by isoproterenol.	1639	1844
18945288	R58fs mutation in the HGD gene in a family with alkaptonuria in the UAE.	0	72
18945288	This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of alkaptonuria in the UAE population and to identify the genotype of affected individuals.	73	217
18945288	In a 3 stage sampling technique 2981 pupils from Government schools in Al Ain and private schools in Dubai were selected to take part in the study, of whom 2857 provided urine samples.	218	402
18945288	Urine collected was analysed for homogentisic acid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.	403	494
18945288	Genomic DNA was isolated from the white blood cells of all family members of the affected case following standard established protocols.	495	631
18945288	Specific PRC primers were designed to amplify all 14 exons of the HGD gene with the flanking intronic sequences including the splice site sequences.	632	780
18945288	2857 children returned a viable urine sample, of which one was highly positive for homogentisic acid.	781	882
18945288	All 12 members of this girl's family were studied and one, a 22 year old brother, was found to excrete HGA.	883	990
18945288	Another, a sister who had not provided a urine sample, was discovered by genetic testing.	991	1080
18945288	There were no complaints of joint pain or other symptoms in any member of this family.	1081	1167
18945288	Parents were first cousins.	1168	1195
18945288	We found a single nucleotide deletion c.342delA, located in exon 3, which resulted in a frameshift at amino acid position 58 (p.Arg58fs or p.R58fs).	1196	1344
18945288	Alkaptonuria may be more common than it is thought to be with an allele prevalence estimated at 0.0107 (95% CI 0.000392-0.03473).	1345	1474
18945288	The R58fs mutation is old, perhaps having occurred several thousand years ago, and has spread over a large geographical area.	1475	1600
19037252	Mutations in phospholipase C epsilon 1 are not sufficient to cause diffuse mesangial sclerosis.	0	95
19037252	Diffuse mesangial sclerosis occurs as an isolated abnormality or as a part of a syndrome.	96	185
19037252	Recently, mutations in phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) were found to cause a nonsyndromic, autosomal recessive form of this disease.	186	320
19037252	Here we describe three children from one consanguineous kindred of Pakistani origin with diffuse mesangial sclerosis who presented with congenital or infantile nephrotic syndrome.	321	500
19037252	Homozygous mutations in PLCE1 (also known as KIAA1516, PLCE, or NPHS3) were identified following genome-wide mapping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.	501	653
19037252	All affected children were homozygous for a four-basepair deletion in exon 3, which created a premature translational stop codon.	654	783
19037252	Analysis of the asymptomatic father of two of the children revealed that he was also homozygous for the same mutation.	784	902
19037252	We conclude this nonpenetrance may be due to compensatory mutations at a second locus and that mutation within PLCE1 is not always sufficient to cause diffuse mesangial sclerosis.	903	1082
19048115	Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) defects are common in human ovarian serous carcinomas and co-occur with TP53 mutations.	0	109
19048115	Ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC) is the most common and lethal histologic type of ovarian epithelial malignancy.	110	220
19048115	Mutations of TP53 and dysfunction of the Brca1 and/or Brca2 tumor-suppressor proteins have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of a large fraction of OSCs, but frequent somatic mutations in other well-established tumor-suppressor genes have not been identified.	221	492
19048115	Using a genome-wide screen of DNA copy number alterations in 36 primary OSCs, we identified two tumors with apparent homozygous deletions of the NF1 gene.	493	647
19048115	Subsequently, 18 ovarian carcinoma-derived cell lines and 41 primary OSCs were evaluated for NF1 alterations.	648	757
19048115	Markedly reduced or absent expression of Nf1 protein was observed in 6 of the 18 cell lines, and using the protein truncation test and sequencing of cDNA and genomic DNA, NF1 mutations resulting in deletion of exons and/or aberrant splicing of NF1 transcripts were detected in 5 of the 6 cell lines with loss of NF1 expression.	758	1085
19048115	Similarly, NF1 alterations including homozygous deletions and splicing mutations were identified in 9 (22%) of 41 primary OSCs.	1086	1213
19048115	As expected, tumors and cell lines with NF1 defects lacked mutations in KRAS or BRAF but showed Ras pathway activation based on immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated MAPK (primary tumors) or increased levels of GTP-bound Ras (cell lines).	1214	1462
19048115	The TP53 tumor-suppressor gene was mutated in all OSCs with documented NF1 mutation, suggesting that the pathways regulated by these two tumor-suppressor proteins often cooperate in the development of ovarian carcinomas with serous differentiation.	1463	1711
19067809	Hemodynamic parameters and heart rate variability during a tilt test in relation to gene polymorphism of renin-angiotensin and serotonin system.	0	144
19067809	PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the renin-angiotensin system and serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms in relation to hemodynamic parameters and heart rate variability during a head-up tilt test (HUT) in patients with vasovagal syncope.	145	398
19067809	METHODS: DNA was collected from 191 patients (mean age 44+/-18 years, 61 men, 130 women).	399	488
19067809	The following gene polymorphisms were determined in genomic DNA: angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism (I/D ACE), angiotensinogen gene polymorphism (M 235), angiotensin II receptor type 1 (ATR1) polymorphism (A 11666C), and polymorphism of serotonin transporter gene (5HTTLPR).Heart rate variability during HUT was assessed in 5-minute intervals by low frequency, high frequency, standard deviation of the normal-to-normal (SDNN), and root mean square successive difference parameters.	489	998
19067809	RESULTS: AA genotype of A 1166C polymorphism was associated with lower minimal systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during HUT compared with other genotypes (minimal SBP: AA 59.6+/-21,8, AC 79.9+/-22.7, CC 65.4+/-22.7 mmHg, P=0.007), (minimal DBP: AA 36.4+/-22.7, AC 52.3+/-22.9, CC 45.4+/-19.5 mmHg, P=0.007).AA genotype was also associated with higher SDNN compared to other genotypes in the early phase of HUT (SDNN in 5 minutes of tilt: AA 59.7+/-24.6, AC 50.6+/-20.6, CC 46.0+/-13.2, P=0.01) and at syncope occurrence (SDNN: AA 71.0+/-20.9, AC 58.2+/-17.9, CC 58+/-10, P=0.04) CONCLUSION: AA genotype of A 1166C polymorphism in the ATR1 gene may be associated with hypotension and decline in sympathetic tone during HUT.	999	1752
19067809	Its role in genetic predisposition to vasovagal syncope cannot be excluded.	1753	1828
19082493	Combination of polymorphisms within 5' and 3' untranslated regions of thymidylate synthase gene modulates survival in 5 fluorouracil-treated colorectal cancer patients.	0	168
19082493	In the present study we explored the effect of three polymorphisms of the TS gene on overall and progression- free survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients subjected to 5FU chemotherapy.	169	359
19082493	A 28 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), a G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and a deletion of 6 bp at position 1494 were studied.	360	507
19082493	The possible combined effect of these DNA polymorphisms on the clinical outcome of patients was also evaluated.	508	619
19082493	A retrospective study was carried out on paraffin-embedded sections from 113 patients diagnosed of advanced CRC.	620	732
19082493	TS genotyping methods were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VNTR and PCR, followed by restriction length fragment polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for SNP and ins/del 6 bp.	733	899
19082493	To study the combined effect of TS polymorphisms, four categories were defined accordingly to the level of expression attributed to SNP and ins/del 6 bp genotypes: C_allele 6-, C_6+/6+, G_allele6- and G_6+/6+.	900	1109
19082493	VNTR and ins/del 6 bp genotypes varied with tumour anatomical site: 2R/2R genotype was rare in left-sided tumours (7.0% vs. 26.3% of right-sided and 24.1% of rectal cancers; P<0.01), where the variant allele 6- was very frequent (69.0%).	1110	1347
19082493	Instead, most patients with right-sided tumours were wild-type homozygous 6+/6+ (63.9%) (P<0.01).	1348	1445
19082493	Heterozygous 6+/6- genotype was more frequent among tumours classified as C (50.0%) and D (76.5%) Dukes stages (P=0.05).	1446	1566
19082493	None of the studied polymorphisms alone affected overall or progression-free survival (PFS).	1567	1659
19082493	C_6+/6+ and G_6+/6+ combined genotypes were respectively associated to the best and worst PFS (P=0.03 when compared with each other), while combinations carrying the allele 6- determined an intermediate evolution that might be indicative of a variable response to chemotherapy.	1660	1937
19082493	The rate of Dukes B stage tumours was unexpectedly high (59.1%) among patients with the unfavourable G_6+/6+ combination.	1938	2059
19082493	In our study the combination of high TS expression genotypes G_6+/6+ identifies a group of high risk within CRC patients treated with 5FU.	2060	2198
19101703	Study of a Taiwanese family with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.	0	68
19101703	BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late onset autosomal dominant muscle disorder.	69	174
19101703	OPMD is caused by a short trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding an expanded polyalanine tract in the polyadenylate binding-protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene.	175	332
19101703	We identified and characterized a PABPN1 mutation in a Taiwanese family with OPMD.	333	415
19101703	METHODS: The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of all subjects were evaluated in a Taiwanese OPMD family.	416	528
19101703	Genetic alterations in the PABPN1 gene were identified using PCR and DNA sequencing.	529	613
19101703	RESULTS: Ten subjects with OPMD (6 symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic) within the Taiwanese family carried a novel mutation in the PABPN1 gene.	614	753
19101703	The normal (GCG)6(GCA)3GCG sequence was replaced by (GCG)6(GCA)(GCG)4(GCA)3GCG due to an insertion of (GCG)4GCA into the normal allele in the Taiwanese OPMD subjects.	754	920
19101703	CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a single GCG expansion in most of OPMD patients in the literature, an insertion of (GCG)4GCA in the PABPN1 gene was found in the Taiwanese OPMD subjects.	921	1102
19101703	The identification of this mutation appears to support the molecular mechanism of unequal cross-over of two PABPN1 alleles.	1103	1226
19108278	The biological properties of the optical isomers of propranolol and their effects on cardiac arrhythmias.	0	105
19108278	1.	106	108
19108278	The optical isomers of propranolol have been compared for their beta-blocking and antiarrhythmic activities.2.	109	219
19108278	In blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline, (+)-propranolol had less than one hundredth the potency of (-)-propranolol.	220	374
19108278	At dose levels of (+)-propranolol which attenuated the responses to isoprenaline, there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram.3.	375	540
19108278	The metabolic responses to isoprenaline in dogs (an increase in circulating glucose, lactate and free fatty acids) were all blocked by (-)-propranolol.	541	692
19108278	(+)-Propranolol had no effect on fatty acid mobilization but significantly reduced the increments in both lactate and glucose.4.	693	821
19108278	Both isomers of propranolol possessed similar depressant potency on isolated atrial muscle taken from guinea-pigs.5.	822	938
19108278	The isomers of propranolol exhibited similar local anaesthetic potencies on an isolated frog nerve preparation at a level approximately three times that of procaine.	939	1104
19108278	The racemic compound was significantly less potent than either isomer.6.	1105	1177
19108278	Both isomers of propranolol were capable of preventing adrenaline-induced cardiac arrhythmias in cats anaesthetized with halothane, but the mean dose of (-)-propranolol was 0.09+/-0.02 mg/kg whereas that of (+)-propranolol was 4.2+/-1.2 mg/kg.	1178	1421
19108278	At the effective dose level of (+)-propranolol there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram.	1422	1550
19108278	Blockade of arrhythmias with both isomers was surmountable by increasing the dose of adrenaline.7.	1551	1649
19108278	Both isomers of propranolol were also capable of reversing ventricular tachycardia caused by ouabain in anaesthetized cats and dogs.	1650	1782
19108278	The dose of (-)-propranolol was significantly smaller than that of (+)-propranolol in both species but much higher than that required to produce evidence of beta-blockade.8.	1783	1956
19108278	The implications of these results are discussed.	1957	2005
19160446	P2RX7: A bipolar and unipolar disorder candidate susceptibility gene?	0	69
19160446	The chromosomal region 12q24 has been previously implicated by linkage studies of both bipolar disorder and unipolar mood disorder and we have reported two pedigrees segregating both bipolar disorder and Darier's disease that show linkage across this region.	70	328
19160446	The gene P2RX7 is located in this chromosomal region and has been recently reported as a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder and unipolar depression.	329	483
19160446	The non-synonymous SNP rs2230912 (resulting in amino-acid polymorphism Q460R) showed the strongest association and has been postulated to be pathogenically relevant.	484	649
19160446	We have investigated this gene in a large UK case-control sample (bipolar I disorder N = 687, unipolar recurrent major depression N = 1,036, controls N = 1,204).	650	811
19160446	Neither rs2230912 nor any of 8 other SNPs genotyped across P2RX7 was found to be associated with mood disorder in general, nor specifically with bipolar or unipolar disorder.	812	986
19160446	Further, sequencing of our two chromosome 12-linked bipolar-Darier families showed no evidence of rare variants at P2RX7 that could explain the linkage.	987	1139
19160446	Our data do not provide support for rs2230912 or the other polymorphisms studied within the P2RX7 locus, being involved in susceptibility to mood disorders.	1140	1296
19207031	Growth hormone dose in growth hormone-deficient adults is not associated with IGF-1 gene polymorphisms.	0	103
19207031	AIMS: Several SNPs and a microsatellite cytosine-adenine repeat promoter polymorphism of the IGF-1 gene have been reported to be associated with circulating IGF-1 serum concentrations.	104	288
19207031	Variance in IGF-1 concentrations due to genetic variations may affect different response to growth hormone (GH) treatment, resulting in different individually required GH-doses in GH-deficient patients.	289	491
19207031	The aim of this study was to test if the IGF-1 gene polymorphisms are associated with the GH-dose of GH-deficient adults.	492	613
19207031	MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of nine tagging SNPs, five additionally selected SNPs and a cytosine-adenine repeat polymorphism were determined in 133 German adult patients (66 men, 67 women; mean age 45.4 years +/- 13.1 standard deviation; majority Caucasian) with GH-deficiency (GHD) of different origin, derived from the prospective Pfizer International Metabolic Study (KIMS) Pharmacogenetics Study.	614	1015
19207031	Patients received GH-treatment for 12 months with finished dose-titration of GH and centralized IGF-1 measurements.	1016	1131
19207031	GH-dose after 1 year of treatment, IGF-1 concentrations, IGF-1-standard deviation score (SDS), the IGF-1:GH ratio and anthropometric data were analyzed by genotype.	1132	1296
19207031	RESULTS: Except for rs1019731, which showed a significant difference of IGF-1-SDS by genotypes (p = 0.02), all polymorphisms showed no associations with the GH-doses, IGF-1 concentrations, IGF-1-SDS and IGF-1:GH ratio after adjusting for the confounding variables gender, age and BMI.	1297	1581
19207031	CONCLUSION: IGF-1 gene polymorphisms were not associated with the responsiveness to exogenous GH in GHD.	1582	1686
19207031	Therefore, genetic variations of the IGF-1 gene seem not to be major influencing factors of the GH-IGF-axis causing variable response to exogenous GH-treatment.	1687	1847
19208385	Osteogenesis imperfecta type III with intracranial hemorrhage and brachydactyly associated with mutations in exon 49 of COL1A2.	0	127
19208385	Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heritable bone disorder characterized by fractures with minimal trauma.	128	233
19208385	Intracranial hemorrhage has been reported in a small number of OI patients.	234	309
19208385	Here we describe three patients, a boy (aged 15 years) and two girls (aged 17 and 7 years) with OI type III who suffered intracranial hemorrhage and in addition had brachydactyly and nail hypoplasia.	310	509
19208385	In all of these patients, OI was caused by glycine mutations affecting exon 49 of the COL1A2 gene, which codes for the most carboxy-terminal part of the triple-helical domain of the collagen type I alpha 2 chain.	510	722
19208385	These observations suggest that mutations in this region of the collagen type I alpha 2 chain carry a high risk of abnormal limb development and intracranial bleeding.	723	890
19234905	Comparison of unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy findings in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease.	0	108
19234905	A prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) refractory to medical treatment was designed.	109	335
19234905	Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 58.4 +/- 6.8 years; 7 men, 3 women) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease (mean disease time, 8.4 +/- 3.5 years), disabling motor fluctuations (Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3-5 in off-drug phases) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias were selected.	336	624
19234905	All patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dosing were analysed.	625	712
19234905	Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and four in the subthalamic nucleus (STN).	713	822
19234905	Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn_Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living (ADL) score in 'on'- and 'off'-drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery.	823	1069
19234905	There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months.	1070	1208
19234905	Levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group.	1209	1285
19234905	Changes in UPDRS, Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups.	1286	1375
19234905	Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups.	1376	1426
19234905	Complications were observed in two patients: one had a left homonymous hemianopsia after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with Valproate 1000 mg/day.	1427	1675
19234905	The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced PD refractory to medical treatment.	1676	1848

19276632	In contrast to disorders of sexual differentiation caused by lack of androgen production or inhibited androgen action, defects affecting development of the bipotent genital anlagen have rarely been investigated in humans.	113	334
19276632	We have previously documented that the transcription factor FOXF2 is highly expressed in human foreskin.	335	439
19276632	Moreover, Foxf2 knockout mice present with cleft palate in combination with hypoplasia of the genital tubercle.	440	551
19276632	We hypothesized that humans with disorders of sex development (DSD) in combination with cleft palate could have mutations in the FOXF2 gene.	552	692
19276632	Eighteen children with DSD and cleft palate were identified in the L beck DSD database (about 1,500 entries).	693	802
19276632	Genomic DNA sequence analysis of the FOXF2 gene was performed and compared with 10 normal female and 10 normal male controls, respectively.	803	942
19276632	Two heterozygous DNA sequence variations were solely present in one single patient each but in none of the 20 normal controls: a duplication of GCC (c.97GCC[9]+[10]) resulting in an extra alanine within exon 1 and a 25*G>A substitution in the 3'-untranslated region.	943	1209
19276632	Two patients carried a c.262G>A sequence variation predicting for an Ala88Thr exchange which was also detected in 2 normal controls.	1210	1342
19276632	Two silent mutations, c.1272C>T (Ser424Ser) and c.1284T>C (Tyr428Tyr), respectively, occurred in the coding region of exon 2, again in both patients and normal controls.	1343	1512
19276632	In conclusion, the majority of the detected sequence alterations were polymorphisms without obvious functional relevance.	1513	1634
19276632	However, it cannot be excluded that the 2 unique DNA sequence alterations could have affected FOXF2 on the mRNA or protein level thus contributing to the observed disturbances in genital and palate development.	1635	1845
19306381	Neuregulin-1 beta and neuregulin-1 alpha differentially affect the migration and invasion of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.	0	139
19306381	Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the most common malignancy associated with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1).	140	268
19306381	These Schwann cell lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerve and soft tissue, frequently precluding surgical resection.	269	406
19306381	Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior.	407	482
19306381	We have shown that MPNSTs express neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta isoforms, which promote Schwann cell migration during development, and NRG-1 alpha isoforms, whose effects on Schwann cells are poorly understood.	483	689
19306381	Hypothesizing that NRG-1 beta and/or NRG-1 alpha promote MPNST invasion, we found that NRG-1 beta promoted MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin but not on collagen type I or fibronectin.	690	927
19306381	The NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 were present in MPNST invadopodia (processes mediating invasion), partially colocalized with focal adhesion kinase and the laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin and coimmunoprecipitated with beta(1)-integrin.	928	1168
19306381	NRG-1 beta stimulated human and murine MPNST cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor.	1169	1348
19306381	Both baseline and NRG-1 beta-induced migration were erbB-dependent and required the action of MEK 1/2, SAPK/JNK, PI-3 kinase, Src family kinases and ROCK-I/II.	1349	1508
19306381	In contrast, NRG-1 alpha had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST lines and inhibited the migration of others.	1509	1636
19306381	While NRG-1 beta potently and persistently activated Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases, NRG-1 alpha did not activate Akt and activated these other kinases with kinetics distinct from those evident in NRG-1 beta-stimulated cells.	1637	1877
19306381	These findings suggest that NRG-1 beta enhances MPNST migration and that NRG-1 beta and NRG-1 alpha differentially modulate this process.	1878	2015
19319147	Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage.	0	125
19319147	Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (W-ICH) is a severe type of stroke.	126	206
19319147	There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W-ICH.	207	264
19319147	Using a mouse model, we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume.	265	428
19319147	Male CD-1 mice were treated with warfarin (2 mg/kg over 24 h), resulting in a mean (+/-s.d.) International Normalized Ratio of 3.5+/-0.9.	429	566
19319147	First, we showed that an intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice.	567	673
19319147	Second, a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum.	674	782
19319147	Forty-five minutes later, the animals were randomly treated with PCC (100 U/kg) or saline i.v. (n=12 per group).	783	895
19319147	Twenty-four hours after hemorrhage induction, hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay.	896	1019
19319147	The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC-treated animals (6.5+/-3.1 microL) compared with saline controls (15.3+/-11.2 microL, P=0.015).	1020	1168
19319147	In the saline group, 45% of the mice developed large hematomas (i.e., >15 microL).	1169	1251
19319147	In contrast, such extensive lesions were never found in the PCC group.	1252	1322
19319147	We provide experimental data suggesting PCC to be an effective acute treatment for W-ICH in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume.	1323	1458
19319147	Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W-ICH.	1459	1563
19346865	Reversible inferior colliculus lesion in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy: magnetic resonance findings on diffusion-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging.	0	177
19346865	OBJECTIVE: This is to present reversible inferior colliculus lesions in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging.	178	393
19346865	MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (age range; 43-78 years).	394	573
19346865	They had been taking metronidazole (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs.	574	706
19346865	Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI (8/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (4/8), FLAIR (7/8), and T2-weighted image (8/8).	707	905
19346865	Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration.	906	1028
19346865	Findings of initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images.	1029	1248
19346865	RESULTS: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8/8), inferior colliculus (6/8), corpus callosum (2/8), pons (2/8), medulla (1/8), and bilateral cerebral white matter (1/8).	1249	1500
19346865	High-signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map (3/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map.	1501	1705
19346865	All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted.	1706	1895
19346865	CONCLUSIONS: Reversible inferior colliculus lesions could be considered as the characteristic for metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, next to the dentate nucleus involvement.	1896	2072
19365571	Macular corneal dystrophy in a Chinese family related with novel mutations of CHST6.	0	84
19365571	PURPOSE: To identify mutations in the carbohydrate sulfotransferase gene (CHST6) for a Chinese family with macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) and to investigate the histopathological changes in the affected cornea.	85	296
19365571	METHODS: A corneal button of the proband was obtained by penetrating keratoplasty.	297	379
19365571	The half button and ultrathin sections from the other half button were examined with special stains under a light microscope (LM) and an electron microscope (EM) separately.	380	553
19365571	Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 11 family members, and the coding region of CHST6 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.	554	715
19365571	The PCR products were analyzed by direct sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion.	716	801
19365571	RESULTS: The positive reaction to colloidal iron stain (extracellular blue accumulations in the stroma) was detected under light microscopy.	802	942
19365571	Transmission electron microscopy revealed the enlargement of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles.	943	1079
19365571	The compound heterozygous mutations, c.892C>T and c.1072T>C, were identified in exon 3 of CHST6 in three patients.	1080	1194
19365571	The two transversions resulted in the substitution of a stop codon for glutamine at codon 298 (p.Q298X) and a missense mutation at codon 358, tyrosine to histidine (p.Y358H).	1195	1369
19365571	The six unaffected family individuals carried alternative heterozygous mutations.	1370	1451
19365571	These two mutations were not detected in any of the 100 control subjects.	1452	1525
19365571	CONCLUSIONS: Those novel compound heterozygous mutations were thought to contribute to the loss of CHST6 function, which induced the abnormal metabolism of keratan sulfate (KS) that deposited in the corneal stroma.	1526	1740
19365571	It could be proved by the observation of a positive stain reaction and the enlarged collagen fibers as well as hyperplastic fibroblasts under microscopes.	1741	1895
19370764	Identification and molecular characterization of six novel mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase gamma subunit (GNPTG) gene in patients with mucolipidosis III gamma.	0	189
19370764	Mucolipidosis type III (MLIII) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting lysosomal hydrolase trafficking.	190	298
19370764	In a study of 10 patients from seven families with a clinical phenotype and enzymatic diagnosis of MLIII, six novel GNPTG gene mutations were identified.	299	452
19370764	These included missense (p.T286M) and nonsense (p.W111X) mutations and a transition in the obligate AG-dinucleotide of the intron 8 acceptor splice site (c.610-2A>G).	453	619
19370764	Three microdeletions were also identified, two of which (c.611delG and c.640_667del28) were located within the coding region whereas one (c.609+28_610-16del) was located entirely within intron 8.	620	815
19370764	RT-PCR analysis of the c.610-2A>G transition demonstrated that the change altered splicing, leading to the production of two distinct aberrantly spliced forms, viz.	816	980
19370764	the skipping of exon 9 (p.G204_K247del) or the retention of introns 8 and 9 (p.G204VfsX28).	981	1072
19370764	RT-PCR analysis, performed on a patient homozygous for the intronic deletion (c.609+28_610-16del), failed to detect any GNPTG RNA transcripts.	1073	1215
19370764	To determine whether c.609+28_610-16del allele-derived transcripts were subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), patient fibroblasts were incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin.	1216	1418
19370764	An RT-PCR fragment retaining 43 bp of intron 8 was consistently detected suggesting that the 33-bp genomic deletion had elicited NMD.	1419	1552
19370764	Quantitative real-time PCR and GNPTG western blot analysis confirmed that the homozygous microdeletion p.G204VfsX17 had elicited NMD resulting in failure to synthesize GNPTG protein.	1553	1735
19370764	Analysis of the sequences surrounding the microdeletion breakpoints revealed either intrinsic repetitivity of the deleted region or short direct repeats adjacent to the breakpoint junctions.	1736	1926
19370764	This is consistent with these repeats having mediated the microdeletions via replication slippage and supports the view that the mutational spectrum of the GNPTG gene is strongly influenced by the properties of the local DNA sequence environment.	1927	2173
19394258	The first founder DGUOK mutation associated with hepatocerebral mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome.	0	101
19394258	Deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) deficiency is a frequent cause of mitochondrial DNA depletion associated with a hepatocerebral phenotype.	102	235
19394258	In this study, we describe a new splice site mutation in the DGUOK gene and the clinical, radiologic, and genetic features of these DGUOK patients.	236	383
19394258	This new DGUOK homozygous mutation (c.444-62C>A) was identified in three patients from two North-African consanguineous families with combined respiratory chain deficiencies and mitochondrial DNA depletion in the liver.	384	603
19394258	Brain MRIs are normal in DGUOK patients in the literature.	604	662
19394258	Interestingly, we found subtentorial abnormal myelination and moderate hyperintensity in the bilateral pallidi in our patients.	663	790
19394258	This new mutation creates a cryptic splice site in intron 3 (in position -62) and is predicted to result in a larger protein with an in-frame insertion of 20 amino acids.	791	961
19394258	In silico analysis of the putative impact of the insertion shows serious clashes in protein conformation: this insertion disrupts the alpha5 helix of the dGK kinase domain, rendering the protein unable to bind purine deoxyribonucleosides.	962	1200
19394258	In addition, a common haplotype that segregated with the disease in both families was detected by haplotype reconstruction with 10 markers (microsatellites and SNPs), which span 4.6 Mb of DNA covering the DGUOK locus.	1201	1418
19394258	In conclusion, we report a new DGUOK splice site mutation that provide insight into a critical protein domain (dGK kinase domain) and the first founder mutation in a North-African population.	1419	1610
19445921	Cardioprotective effect of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.	0	101
19445921	The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic acid A on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.	102	253
19445921	Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously.	254	349
19445921	Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured.	350	443
19445921	Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed.	444	555
19445921	Isoproterenol-treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart.	556	836
19445921	These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure, maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure, and elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and ST-segment.	837	1045
19445921	In addition, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP/O was observed in isoproterenol-treated rats.	1046	1203
19445921	Administration of salvianolic acid A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function.	1204	1401
19445921	The protective role of salvianolic acid A against isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination.	1402	1547
19445921	The results of our study suggest that salvianolic acid A possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction.	1548	1725
19463742	Melanocortin-4 receptor activation inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity and promotes insulin signaling.	0	108
19463742	The melanocortin system is crucial to regulation of energy homeostasis.	109	180
19463742	The melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R) modulates insulin signaling via effects on c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).	181	294
19463742	The melanocortin agonist NDP-MSH dose-dependently inhibited JNK activity in HEK293 cells stably expressing the human MC4R; effects were reversed by melanocortin receptor antagonist.	295	476
19463742	NDP-MSH time- and dose-dependently inhibited IRS-1(ser307) phosphorylation, effects also reversed by a specific melanocortin receptor antagonist.	477	622
19463742	NDP-MSH augmented insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in vitro.	623	689
19463742	The melanocortin agonist melanotan II increased insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in the rat hypothalamus in vivo. NDP-MSH increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in hypothalamic GT1-1 cells.	690	890
19463742	The current study shows that the melanocortinergic system interacts with insulin signaling via novel effects on JNK activity.	891	1016
19484664	Angiotensin converting enzyme gene polymorphism in Turkish asthmatic patients.	0	78
19484664	Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways.	79	135
19484664	Several candidate genes have been identified with a potential role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene.	136	289
19484664	We aimed to investigate the frequency of an ACE gene polymorphism in Turkish asthmatic patients and to determine its impact on clinical parameters and disease severity.	290	458
19484664	Ninety-seven asthmatic patients (M/F 25/72, mean age 39 +/- 13 years) and 96 healthy subjects (M/F 26/70, mean age 38 +/- 12 years) were included.	459	605
19484664	At baseline, all participants completed a questionnaire on demographics, symptoms, triggering factors, severity of asthma, and the presence of atopism.	606	757
19484664	Blood samples were obtained from all patients and genomic DNA was isolated.	758	833
19484664	The frequency of the ACE genotypes (I = insertion and D = deletion) among asthmatics and controls were compared: asthmatics showed a 40.2% prevalence of the DD genotype (n = 39), ID was 45.4% (n = 44), and II was 14.4% (n = 14.4).	834	1064
19484664	In the control subjects, the frequency of DD was 18.8% (n = 18), ID was 50% (n = 48) and II was 31.3% (n = 30).	1065	1176
19484664	The DD ACE genotype was significantly more frequent in asthmatics compared with controls (p < 0.001).	1177	1278
19484664	Asthmatics with the ID ACE genotype showed a higher frequency of drug allergies, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.08).	1279	1419
19484664	Asthmatics with the DD genotype appeared to have a higher incidence of asthmatic episode exacerbations due to viral infections, but again this was not statistically significant (p = 0.08).	1420	1608
19484664	Patients with mild or moderate-severe asthma had similar frequencies of these mutations.	1609	1697
19484664	We found a higher frequency of the ACE DD gene mutation in Turkish asthmatic patients compared with non-asthmatics, suggesting that this ACE gene polymorphism may be a risk factor for asthma but does not increase the severity of the disease.	1698	1939
19508969	Hypomorphic mutations in meckelin (MKS3/TMEM67) cause nephronophthisis with liver fibrosis (NPHP11).	0	100
19508969	BACKGROUND: Nephronophthisis (NPHP), a rare recessive cystic kidney disease, is the most frequent genetic cause of chronic renal failure in children and young adults.	101	267
19508969	Mutations in nine genes (NPHP1-9) have been identified.	268	323
19508969	NPHP can be associated with retinal degeneration (Senior-Loken syndrome), brainstem and cerebellar anomalies (Joubert syndrome), or liver fibrosis.	324	471
19508969	METHODS: To identify a causative gene for the subset of patients with associated liver fibrosis, the authors performed a genome wide linkage search in a consanguineous family with three affected patients using 50K SNP microarrays and homozygosity mapping.	472	727
19508969	RESULTS: The authors obtained a significant maximum parametric LOD (logarithm of odds) score of Z(max) = 3.72 on chromosome 8q22 and identified a homozygous missense mutation in the gene MKS3/TMEM67.	728	927
19508969	When examining a worldwide cohort of 62 independent patients with NPHP and associated liver fibrosis we identified altogether four novel mutations (p.W290L, p.C615R, p.G821S, and p.G821R) in five of them.	928	1132
19508969	Mutations of MKS3/TMEM67, found recently in Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) type 3 and Joubert syndrome (JBTS) type 6, are predominantly truncating mutations.	1133	1288
19508969	In contrast, the mutations detected here in patients with NPHP and associated liver fibrosis are exclusively missense mutations.	1289	1417
19508969	This suggests that they may represent hypomorphic alleles, leading to a milder phenotype compared with the more severe MKS or JBTS phenotype.	1418	1559
19508969	Additionally, mutation analysis for MKS3/TMEM67 in 120 patients with JBTS yielded seven different (four novel) mutations in five patients, four of whom also presented with congenital liver fibrosis.	1560	1758
19508969	CONCLUSIONS: Hypomorphic MKS3/TMEM67 mutations cause NPHP with liver fibrosis (NPHP11).	1759	1846
19508969	This is the first report of MKS3 mutations in patients with no vermian agenesis and without neurological signs.	1847	1958
19508969	Thus NPHP, JBTS, and MKS represent allelic disorders.	1959	2012
19536134	TAK1 is an essential regulator of BMP signalling in cartilage.	0	62
19536134	TGFbeta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAPKKK family, controls diverse functions ranging from innate and adaptive immune system activation to vascular development and apoptosis.	63	252
19536134	To analyse the in vivo function of TAK1 in cartilage, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of Tak1 driven by the collagen 2 promoter.	253	395
19536134	Tak1(col2) mice displayed severe chondrodysplasia with runting, impaired formation of secondary centres of ossification, and joint abnormalities including elbow dislocation and tarsal fusion.	396	587
19536134	This phenotype resembled that of bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)1 and Gdf5-deficient mice.	588	689
19536134	BMPR signalling was markedly impaired in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes as evidenced by reduced expression of known BMP target genes as well as reduced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinases.	690	896
19536134	TAK1 mediates Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues.	897	963
19536134	These findings provide the first in vivo evidence in a mammalian system that TAK1 is required for BMP signalling and functions as an upstream activating kinase for Smad1/5/8 in addition to its known role in regulating MAP kinase pathways.	964	1202
19536134	Our experiments reveal an essential role for TAK1 in the morphogenesis, growth, and maintenance of cartilage.	1203	1312
19549709	Efficacy of everolimus (RAD001) in patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors.	0	148
19549709	BACKGROUND: Treatment options are scarce in pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.	149	257
19549709	RAD001, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), has shown phase I efficacy in NSCLC.	258	365
19549709	METHODS: Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC patients, with two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens, one platinum based (stratum 1) or both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stratum 2), received RAD001 10 mg/day until progression or unacceptable toxicity.	366	653
19549709	Primary objective was overall response rate (ORR).	654	704
19549709	Analyses of markers associated with the mTOR pathway were carried out on archival tumor from a subgroup using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct mutation sequencing.	705	873
19549709	RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled, 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum.	874	953
19549709	ORR was 4.7% (7.1% stratum 1; 2.3% stratum 2).	954	1000
19549709	Overall disease control rate was 47.1%.	1001	1040
19549709	Median progression-free survivals (PFSs) were 2.6 (stratum 1) and 2.7 months (stratum 2).	1041	1130
19549709	Common > or =grade 3 events were fatigue, dyspnea, stomatitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.	1131	1223
19549709	Pneumonitis, probably or possibly related, mainly grade 1/2, occurred in 25%.	1224	1301
19549709	Cox regression analysis of IHC scores found that only phospho AKT (pAKT) was a significant independent predictor of worse PFS.	1302	1428
19549709	CONCLUSIONS: RAD001 10 mg/day was well tolerated, showing modest clinical activity in pretreated NSCLC.	1429	1532
19549709	Evaluation of RAD001 plus standard therapy for metastatic NSCLC continues.	1533	1607
19565319	Adenosine A(2A) receptor gene (ADORA2A) variants may increase autistic symptoms and anxiety in autism spectrum disorder.	0	120
19565319	Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous disorders presenting with increased rates of anxiety.	121	225
19565319	The adenosine A(2A) receptor gene (ADORA2A) is associated with panic disorder and is located on chromosome 22q11.23.	226	342
19565319	Its gene product, the adenosine A(2A) receptor, is strongly expressed in the caudate nucleus, which also is involved in ASD.	343	467
19565319	As autistic symptoms are increased in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and large 22q11.2 deletions and duplications have been observed in ASD individuals, in this study, 98 individuals with ASD and 234 control individuals were genotyped for eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ADORA2A.	468	769
19565319	Nominal association with the disorder was observed for rs2236624-CC, and phenotypic variability in ASD symptoms was influenced by rs3761422, rs5751876 and rs35320474.	770	936
19565319	In addition, association of ADORA2A variants with anxiety was replicated for individuals with ASD.	937	1035
19565319	Findings point toward a possible mediating role of ADORA2A variants on phenotypic expression in ASD that need to be replicated in a larger sample.	1036	1182
19624920	Clusters of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis cases, Europe.	0	73
19624920	Molecular surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) was implemented in Europe as case reporting in 2005.	74	194
19624920	For all new MDR TB cases detected from January 2003 through June 2007, countries reported case-based epidemiologic data and DNA fingerprint patterns of MDR TB strains when available.	195	377
19624920	International clusters were detected and analyzed.	378	428
19624920	From 2003 through mid-2007 in Europe, 2,494 cases of MDR TB were reported from 24 European countries.	429	530
19624920	Epidemiologic and molecular data were linked for 593 (39%) cases, and 672 insertion sequence 6110 DNA fingerprint patterns were reported from 19 countries.	531	686
19624920	Of these patterns, 288 (43%) belonged to 18 European clusters; 7 clusters (242/288 cases, 84%) were characterized by strains of the Beijing genotype family, including the largest cluster (175/288 cases, 61%).	687	895
19624920	Both clustering and the Beijing genotype were associated with strains originating in eastern European countries.	896	1008
19624920	Molecular cluster detection contributes to identification of transmission profile, risk factors, and control measures.	1009	1127
19631624	Learning and memory deficits in ecstasy users and their neural correlates during a face-learning task.	0	102
19631624	It has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance.	103	208
19631624	In addition, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).	209	420
19631624	Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls.	421	640
19631624	To address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users (Nestor, L., Roberts, G., Garavan, H., Hester, R., 2008.	641	853
19631624	Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users.	854	967
19631624	Neuroimage 40, 1328-1339).	968	994
19631624	Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users.	995	1102
19631624	A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy-specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions.	1103	1329
19631624	Ecstasy-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and left posterior cingulated cortex.	1330	1462
19631624	In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate.	1463	1639
19631624	These results elucidated ecstasy-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use.	1640	1746
19631624	These ecstasy-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy.	1747	1891
19672862	Protein kinase C alpha-dependent signaling mediates endometrial cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis.	0	101
19672862	Endometrial cancer is the most common invasive gynecologic malignancy, yet molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying its etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly characterized.	102	293
19672862	We sought to define a functional role for the protein kinase C (PKC) isoform, PKCalpha, in an established cell model of endometrial adenocarcinoma.	294	441
19672862	Ishikawa cells depleted of PKCalpha protein grew slower, formed fewer colonies in anchorage-independent growth assays and exhibited impaired xenograft tumor formation in nude mice.	442	622
19672862	Consistent with impaired growth, PKCalpha knockdown increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21(Cip1/WAF1) (p21) and p27(Kip1) (p27).	623	781
19672862	Despite the absence of functional phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein in Ishikawa cells, PKCalpha knockdown reduced Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 and concomitantly inhibited phosphorylation of the Akt target, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta).	782	1048
19672862	PKCalpha knockdown also resulted in decreased basal ERK phosphorylation and attenuated ERK activation following EGF stimulation.	1049	1177
19672862	p21 and p27 expression was not increased by treatment of Ishikawa cells with ERK and Akt inhibitors, suggesting that PKCalpha regulates CDK expression independently of Akt and ERK.	1178	1358
19672862	Immunohistochemical analysis of Grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma revealed aberrant PKCalpha expression, with foci of elevated PKCalpha staining, not observed in normal endometrium.	1359	1542
19672862	These studies demonstrate a critical role for PKCalpha signaling in endometrial tumorigenesis by regulating expression of CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 and activation of Akt and ERK-dependent proliferative pathways.	1543	1755
19672862	Thus, targeting PKCalpha may provide novel therapeutic options in endometrial tumors.	1756	1841
19681452	Bilateral haemorrhagic infarction of the globus pallidus after cocaine and alcohol intoxication.	0	96
19681452	Cocaine is a risk factor for both ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke.	97	164
19681452	We present the case of a 31-year-old man with bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus after excessive alcohol and intranasal cocaine use.	165	304
19681452	Drug-related globus pallidus infarctions are most often associated with heroin.	305	384
19681452	Bilateral basal ganglia infarcts after the use of cocaine, without concurrent heroin use, have never been reported.	385	500
19681452	In our patient, transient cardiac arrhythmia or respiratory dysfunction related to cocaine and/or ethanol use were the most likely causes of cerebral hypoperfusion.	501	665
19707748	Seizures associated with levofloxacin: case presentation and literature review.	0	79
19707748	PURPOSE: We present a case of a patient who developed seizures shortly after initiating treatment with levofloxacin and to discuss the potential drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in this case, as well as in other cases, of levofloxacin-induced seizures.	80	377
19707748	METHODS: Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE, Cochrane and Ovid.	378	467
19707748	The main search terms utilized were case report and levofloxacin.	468	533
19707748	The search was limited to studies published in English.	534	589
19707748	RESULTS: Six cases of levofloxacin-induced seizures have been reported in the literature.	590	679
19707748	Drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP1A2 by levofloxacin are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases.	680	814
19707748	CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians are exhorted to pay close attention when initiating levofloxacin therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP1A2 substrates.	815	1000
19721134	The antiarrhythmic effect and possible ionic mechanisms of pilocarpine on animal models.	0	88
19721134	This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pilocarpine and explore the underlying ionic mechanism, using both aconitine-induced rat and ouabain-induced guinea pig arrhythmia models.	89	278
19721134	Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free-calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in isolated myocytes.	279	396
19721134	The current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed onset of arrhythmias, decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, reduced arrhythmia score, and increased the survival time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs.	397	646
19721134	[Ca(2+)](i) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine.	647	761
19721134	Moreover, M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide) partially abolished the beneficial effects of pilocarpine.	762	945
19721134	These data suggest that pilocarpine produced antiarrhythmic actions on arrhythmic rat and guinea pig models induced by aconitine or ouabain via stimulating the cardiac M(3)-mAChR.	946	1125
19721134	The mechanism may be related to the improvement of Ca(2+) handling.	1126	1193
19759529	The glycine transporter-1 inhibitor SSR103800 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic-like profile in normal and transgenic mice.	0	137
19759529	Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission.	138	229
19759529	However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor produce schizophrenic-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor.	230	462
19759529	As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor.	463	681
19759529	Among them are glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine (a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor) levels in the synapse.	682	890
19759529	This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of SSR103800, with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity, involving either drug challenge (ie, amphetamine and MK-801) or transgenic mice (ie, NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)).	891	1151
19759529	Results showed that SSR103800 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) mice.	1152	1361
19759529	In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.).	1362	1529
19759529	Importantly, both classical (haloperidol) and atypical (olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity.	1530	1693
19759529	However, unlike these latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o.	1694	1807
19759529	Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, SSR103800, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.	1808	2080
19779499	Novel CACNA1S mutation causes autosomal dominant hypokalemic periodic paralysis in a South American family.	0	107
19779499	Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder, which is characterized by periodic attacks of muscle weakness associated with a decrease in the serum potassium level.	108	302
19779499	A major disease-causing gene for HypoPP has been identified as CACNA1S, which encodes the skeletal muscle calcium channel alpha-subunit with four transmembrane domains (I-IV), each with six transmembrane segments (S1-S6).	303	524
19779499	To date, all CACNA1S mutations identified in HypoPP patients are located within the voltage-sensor S4 segment.	525	635
19779499	In this study we report a novel CACNA1S mutation in a new region of the protein, the S3 segment of domain III.	636	746
19779499	We characterized a four-generation South American family with HypoPP.	747	816
19779499	Genetic analysis identified a novel V876E mutation in all HypoPP patients in the family, but not in normal family members or 160 control people.	817	961
19779499	Clinical analysis indicates that mutation V876E is associated with a severe outcome as characterized by a very early age of onset, complete penetrance and a severe prognosis including death.	962	1152
19779499	These results identify a new mutation in CACNA1S and expand the spectrum of CACNA1S mutations associated with HypoPP.	1153	1270
19789368	Vitamin D receptor expression is associated with PIK3CA and KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer.	0	96
19789368	Vitamin D is associated with decreased risks of various cancers, including colon cancer.	97	185
19789368	The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a transcription factor, which plays an important role in cellular differentiation and inhibition of proliferation.	186	332
19789368	A link between VDR and the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway has been suggested.	333	475
19789368	However, the prognostic role of VDR expression or its relationship with PIK3CA or KRAS mutation remains uncertain.	476	590
19789368	Among 619 colorectal cancers in two prospective cohort studies, 233 (38%) tumors showed VDR overexpression by immunohistochemistry.	591	722
19789368	We analyzed for PIK3CA and KRAS mutations and LINE-1 methylation by Pyrosequencing, microsatellite instability (MSI), and DNA methylation (epigenetic changes) in eight CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-specific promoters [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1] by MethyLight (real-time PCR).	723	1050
19789368	VDR overexpression was significantly associated with KRAS mutation (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.16) and PIK3CA mutation (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-3.47), both of which persisted in multivariate logistic regression analysis.	1051	1318
19789368	VDR was not independently associated with body mass index, family history of colorectal cancer, tumor location (colon versus rectum), stage, tumor grade, signet ring cells, CIMP, MSI, LINE-1 hypomethylation, BRAF, p53, p21, beta-catenin, or cyclooxygenase-2.	1319	1577
19789368	VDR expression was not significantly related with patient survival, prognosis, or clinical outcome.	1578	1677
19789368	In conclusion, VDR overexpression in colorectal cancer is independently associated with PIK3CA and KRAS mutations.	1678	1792
19789368	Our data support potential interactions between the VDR, RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, and possible influence by KRAS or PIK3CA mutation on therapy or chemoprevention targeting VDR.	1793	1976

19825989	The d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))/Ca(2+)/protein kinase C (PKC)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates cholangiocarcinoma growth.	210	364
19825989	We evaluated the role of HRH3 in the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma growth.	365	442
19825989	Expression of HRH3 in intrahepatic and extrahepatic cell lines, normal cholangiocytes, and human tissue arrays was measured.	443	567
19825989	In Mz-ChA-1 cells stimulated with (R)-(alpha)-(-)-methylhistamine dihydrobromide (RAMH), we measured (a) cell growth, (b) IP(3) and cyclic AMP levels, and (c) phosphorylation of PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase isoforms.	568	796
19825989	Localization of PKCalpha was visualized by immunofluorescence in cell smears and immunoblotting for PKCalpha in cytosol and membrane fractions.	797	940
19825989	Following knockdown of PKCalpha, Mz-ChA-1 cells were stimulated with RAMH before evaluating cell growth and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 phosphorylation.	941	1113
19825989	In vivo experiments were done in BALB/c nude mice.	1114	1164
19825989	Mice were treated with saline or RAMH for 44 days and tumor volume was measured.	1165	1245
19825989	Tumors were excised and evaluated for proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of PKCalpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF receptor 2, and VEGF receptor 3.	1246	1428
19825989	HRH3 expression was found in all cells.	1429	1468
19825989	RAMH inhibited the growth of cholangiocarcinoma cells.	1469	1523
19825989	RAMH increased IP(3) levels and PKCalpha phosphorylation and decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation.	1524	1618
19825989	RAMH induced a shift in the localization of PKCalpha expression from the cytosolic domain into the membrane region of Mz-ChA-1 cells.	1619	1752
19825989	Silencing of PKCalpha prevented RAMH inhibition of Mz-ChA-1 cell growth and ablated RAMH effects on ERK1/2 phosphorylation.	1753	1876
19825989	In vivo, RAMH decreased tumor growth and expression of VEGF and its receptors; PKCalpha expression was increased.	1877	1990
19825989	RAMH inhibits cholangiocarcinoma growth by PKCalpha-dependent ERK1/2 dephosphorylation.	1991	2078
19825989	Modulation of PKCalpha by histamine receptors may be important in regulating cholangiocarcinoma growth.	2079	2182
19841052	Smoking of crack cocaine as a risk factor for HIV infection among people who use injection drugs.	0	97
19841052	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of HIV infection.	98	215
19841052	Given the increasing use of crack cocaine, we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for HIV infection.	216	356
19841052	METHODS: We included data from people participating in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment, lived in the greater Vancouver area, were HIV-negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow-up study visit.	357	650
19841052	To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time, we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods: May 1, 1996-Nov. 30, 1999 (period 1), Dec. 1, 1999-Nov. 30, 2002 (period 2), and Dec. 1, 2002-Dec. 30, 2005 (period 3).	651	960
19841052	RESULTS: Overall, 1048 eligible injection drug users were included in our study.	961	1041
19841052	Of these, 137 acquired HIV infection during follow-up.	1042	1096
19841052	The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11.6% in period 1 to 39.7% in period 3.	1097	1231
19841052	After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time (period 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-1.85; period 2: HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01-2.80; and period 3: HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.06-7.11).	1232	1552
19841052	INTERPRETATION: Smoking of crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for HIV seroconversion among people who were injection drug users.	1553	1703
19841052	This finding points to the urgent need for evidence-based public health initiatives targeted at people who smoke crack cocaine.	1704	1831
19880293	Polymorphisms in the FOXP3 gene in Han Chinese psoriasis patients.	0	66
19880293	BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common dermatological disorder, in which autoimmunity plays an important role.	67	172
19880293	CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (T-regs) have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases.	173	298
19880293	T-regs express the fork head/winged helix transcription factor, FOXP3, which appears to be of key importance in the development and function of T-regs.	299	450
19880293	Studies have found that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FOXP3 gene contribute to susceptibility to some autoimmune disorders.	451	590
19880293	However, information about FOXP3 gene in psoriasis is limited.	591	653
19880293	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the association between FOXP3 gene SNPs and susceptibility to psoriasis in a Han Chinese population.	654	786
19880293	METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control study, 524 patients with psoriasis and 549 psoriasis-free controls were recruited according to age and gender.	787	939
19880293	We investigated four SNPs in the FOXP3 gene (-6054, deletion/ATT; -3279, A/C; -924, A/G; IVS9+459, A/G) in psoriatic patients, and assessed allele and genotype frequencies in psoriatic patients (237 females, 287 males) and normal controls (272 females, 277 males).	940	1204
19880293	The polymorphisms were genotyped using the PCR sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) technique and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.	1205	1362
19880293	RESULTS: We found that increased risk of psoriasis was associated with the FOXP3 -3279 AC genotype (adjusted OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.01-1.74) and the combined AC+AA genotype (adjusted OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.78), compared with the -3279 CC genotype.	1363	1609
19880293	We also found that an increased risk of psoriasis was associated with the FOXP3 IVS9+459 GG genotype (adjusted OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.41-3.58).	1610	1750
19880293	However, the combined GA+GG genotype showed no such tendency (adjusted OR=1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), compared with the IVS9+459 AA genotype.	1751	1890
19880293	There was no evidence of an increased risk associated with the FOXP3-6054 deletion/ATT or FOXP3-924 A/G genotype.	1891	2004
19880293	In combined genotype analyses, the FOXP3-3279 AC+AA genotype was more obviously associated in males (adjusted OR=1.60, 95% CI=1.11-2.31) and severe psoriasis patients (PASI score >20; adjusted OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.41-2.75).	2005	2225
19880293	Meanwhile, the FOXP3 IVS9+459 GA+GG genotype was also associated with severe psoriasis patients (adjusted OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.21-2.36).	2226	2359
19880293	CONCLUSIONS: FOXP3 polymorphisms appear to contribute to the risk of psoriasis in a Han Chinese population.	2360	2467
19880293	Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.	2468	2520

19881468	The genetic polymorphism rs1052133, which leads to substitution of the amino acid at codon 326 from Ser to Cys, shows functional differences, namely a decrease in enzyme activity in hOGG1-Cys326.	205	400
19881468	Although several studies have investigated the association between rs1052133 and lung cancer susceptibility, the effect of this locus on lung cancer according to histology remains unclear.	401	589
19881468	We therefore conducted a case-control study with 515 incident lung cancer cases and 1030 age- and sex-matched controls without cancer, and further conducted a meta-analysis.	590	763
19881468	In overall analysis, the homozygous Cys/Cys genotype showed a significant association with lung cancer compared to Ser allele carrier status (odds ratio (OR)=1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-1.69).	764	968
19881468	By histology-based analysis, the Cys/Cys genotype showed a significantly positive association with small-cell carcinoma (OR=2.40, 95% CI=1.32-4.49) and marginally significant association with adenocarcinoma (OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.98-1.77).	969	1204
19881468	A meta-analysis of previous and our present study revealed that this polymorphism is positively associated with adenocarcinoma, although suggestive associations were also found for squamous- and small-cell lung cancers.	1205	1424
19881468	These results indicate that rs1052133 contributes to the risk of adenocarcinoma of lung.	1425	1513
19889778	Differential impact of immune escape mutations G145R and P120T on the replication of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus e antigen-positive and -negative strains.	0	165
19889778	Immune escape variants of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) represent an emerging clinical challenge, because they can be associated with vaccine escape, HBV reactivation, and failure of diagnostic tests.	166	364
19889778	Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals.	365	511
19889778	We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine (LAM) and/or HBeAg negativity.	512	815
19889778	Replication-competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance (rtM204I or rtL180M/rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg-positive and an HBeAg-negative background with precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants.	816	1045
19889778	The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM-resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild-type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication.	1046	1271
19889778	Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of LAM-resistant clones.	1272	1395
19889778	However, the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity (PC/BCP), sP120T, and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type HBV.	1396	1559
19889778	In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro.	1560	1741
19889778	These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants, supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns.	1742	2009
19891556	Clopidogrel pharmacogenomics and risk of inadequate platelet inhibition: US FDA recommendations.	0	96
19891556	Antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel is the current standard of care for coronary artery disease patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention.	97	252
19891556	However, approximately 25% of patients experience a subtherapeutic antiplatelet response.	253	342
19891556	Clopidogrel is a prodrug that undergoes hepatic biotransformation by CYP2C19 into its active metabolite.	343	447
19891556	Several studies have reported that, compared with wild-type individuals, CYP2C19 variant allele carriers exhibit a significantly lower capacity to metabolize clopidogrel into its active metabolite and inhibit platelet activation, and are therefore at significantly higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events.	448	758
19891556	Consequently, the US FDA has recently changed clopidogrel's prescribing information to highlight the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on clopidogrel pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical response.	759	959
19891556	Future studies remain necessary to develop effective personalized therapeutic strategies for CYP2C19 variant allele carriers and other individuals at risk for clopidogrel nonresponsiveness.	960	1149
19914299	Fluoxetine improves the memory deficits caused by the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil.	0	88
19914299	Cancer patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deteriorations in cognition.	89	219
19914299	A widely used chemotherapeutic agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function.	220	373
19914299	In particular this anti mitotic drug could reduce cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain.	374	488
19914299	In contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the SSRI antidepressant Fluoxetine.	489	623
19914299	In this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic (two week) treatment with 5-FU and (three weeks) with Fluoxetine either separately or in combination with 5-FU were tested on adult Lister hooded rats.	624	832
19914299	Behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test (CER) which showed that animals treated with 5-FU had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls.	833	1043
19914299	A separate group of animals was tested using a hippocampal dependent spatial working memory test, the object location recognition test (OLR).	1044	1185
19914299	Animals treated only with 5-FU showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the OLR task but co administration of Fluoxetine improved their performance.	1186	1351
19914299	5-FU chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls.	1352	1505
19914299	This reduction was eliminated when Fluoxetine was co administered with 5-FU.	1506	1582
19914299	Fluoxetine on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behaviour.	1583	1661
19914299	These findings suggest that 5-FU can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant Fluoxetine.	1662	1890
19957053	Phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces frontal lobe oxygenation following anesthesia-induced hypotension.	0	106
19957053	BACKGROUND: Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia-induced hypotension.	107	189
19957053	We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension.	190	324
19957053	METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP).	325	560
19957053	Heart rate (HR), MAP, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were registered.	561	680
19957053	RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S(c)O(2).	681	806
19957053	After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +/- SD).	807	914
19957053	However, a 14% (from 70 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 7%) reduction in S(c)O(2) (P < 0.05) followed with no change in CO (3.7 +/- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.9 l min(-1)).	915	1062
19957053	The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP (53 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 8 mmHg; P < 0.001), restored CO (3.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.3 l min(-1)), and preserved S(c)O(2).	1063	1243
19957053	CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S(c)O(2) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO.	1244	1461
19996135	High-dose tranexamic Acid is associated with nonischemic clinical seizures in cardiac surgical patients.	0	104
19996135	BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures.	105	306
19996135	These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage.	307	469
19996135	The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery.	470	630
19996135	METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures.	631	736
19996135	Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies.	737	888
19996135	RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients.	889	1051
19996135	All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities.	1052	1129
19996135	All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures.	1130	1343
19996135	All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass.	1344	1406
19996135	No evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their seizures was apparent.	1407	1512
19996135	CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high-dose TXA in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients.	1513	1726
20005218	A potential regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of the Klotho gene may be associated with essential hypertension in the Chinese Han population.	0	165
20005218	BACKGROUND: Mice with defects in the Klotho gene exhibit multiple aging phenotypes including arteriosclerosis.	166	276
20005218	We hypothesised that the G-395A polymorphism in the promoter region of the human Klotho gene may contribute to the prevalence of Essential Hypertension (EH).	277	434
20005218	METHODS: We investigate whether the G-395A polymorphism of Klotho is associated with EH in a population consisting of 215 patients with EH and 220 non-hypertensive subjects.	435	608
20005218	We also tested whether a G/A substitution at the G-395A site affected the transcription level in vitro through the dual-luciferase reporter assay.	609	755
20005218	RESULTS: Differences in the genotype distributions of the G-395A polymorphism between the EH and non-hypertension groups are statistically significant (P=0.032).	756	917
20005218	There are differential effects of age, gender and smoking status on the association of the G-395A polymorphism with EH; the G-395A polymorphism is significantly associated with EH in subjects over 60years old, in females and in nonsmokers.	918	1157
20005218	A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds ratio for EH in the -395A allele carriers as compared with the control group was 0.593 (P=0.024) after adjusting for current traditional risk factors.	1158	1372
20005218	The dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that the -395A carrier of a 498-bp DNA fragment (containing the G-395A site) upstream of the Klotho gene has higher relative luciferase activity than the -395G carrier.	1373	1585
20005218	CONCLUSIONS: The G-395A polymorphism of the human Klotho gene is associated with EH and may be a potential regulatory site.	1586	1709
20034406	Chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 are increased in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus.	0	119
20034406	BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation occurs after seizures and is implicated in epileptogenesis.	120	209
20034406	CCR2 is a chemokine receptor for CCL2 and their interaction mediates monocyte infiltration in the neuroinflammatory cascade triggered in different brain pathologies.	210	375
20034406	In this work CCR2 and CCL2 expression were examined following status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine injection.	376	495
20034406	METHODS: SE was induced by pilocarpine injection.	496	545
20034406	Control rats were injected with saline instead of pilocarpine.	546	608
20034406	Five days after SE, CCR2 staining in neurons and glial cells was examined using imunohistochemical analyses.	609	717
20034406	The number of CCR2 positive cells was determined using stereology probes in the hippocampus.	718	810
20034406	CCL2 expression in the hippocampus was examined by molecular assay.	811	878
20034406	RESULTS: Increased CCR2 was observed in the hippocampus after SE.	879	944
20034406	Seizures also resulted in alterations to the cell types expressing CCR2.	945	1017
20034406	Increased numbers of neurons that expressed CCR2 was observed following SE.	1018	1093
20034406	Microglial cells were more closely apposed to the CCR2-labeled cells in SE rats.	1094	1174
20034406	In addition, rats that experienced SE exhibited CCR2-labeling in populations of hypertrophied astrocytes, especially in CA1 and dentate gyrus.	1175	1317
20034406	These CCR2+ astroctytes were not observed in control rats.	1318	1376
20034406	Examination of CCL2 expression showed that it was elevated in the hippocampus following SE.	1377	1468
20034406	CONCLUSION: The data show that CCR2 and CCL2 are up-regulated in the hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced SE.	1469	1579
20034406	Seizures also result in changes to CCR2 receptor expression in neurons and astrocytes.	1580	1666
20034406	These changes might be involved in detrimental neuroplasticity and neuroinflammatory changes that occur following seizures.	1667	1790
20046642	Metallothionein induction reduces caspase-3 activity and TNFalpha levels with preservation of cognitive function and intact hippocampal neurons in carmustine-treated rats.	0	171
20046642	Hippocampal integrity is essential for cognitive functions.	172	231
20046642	On the other hand, induction of metallothionein (MT) by ZnSO(4) and its role in neuroprotection has been documented.	232	348
20046642	The present study aimed to explore the effect of MT induction on carmustine (BCNU)-induced hippocampal cognitive dysfunction in rats.	349	482
20046642	A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (15/group): The control group injected with single doses of normal saline (i.c.v) followed 24 h later by BCNU solvent (i.v).	483	684
20046642	The second group administered ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v, once) then BCNU solvent (i.v) after 24 h.	685	810
20046642	Third group received BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) 24 h after injection with normal saline (i.c.v).	811	907
20046642	Fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v) then BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) after 24 h.	908	1044
20046642	The obtained data revealed that BCNU administration resulted in deterioration of learning and short-term memory (STM), as measured by using radial arm water maze, accompanied with decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content.	1045	1321
20046642	Also, BCNU administration increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents as well as caspase-3 activity in addition to histological alterations.	1322	1524
20046642	ZnSO(4) pretreatment counteracted BCNU-induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of MDA and TNFalpha as well as the activity of caspase-3.	1525	1719
20046642	The histological features were improved in hippocampus of rats treated with ZnSO(4) + BCNU compared to only BCNU-treated animals.	1720	1849
20046642	In conclusion, MT induction halts BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity as it prevented GR inhibition and GSH depletion and counteracted the increased levels of TNFalpha, MDA and caspase-3 activity with subsequent preservation of cognition.	1850	2086
20080916	Promoter insertion/deletion in the IRF5 gene is highly associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus in distinct populations, but exerts a modest effect on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	0	227
20080916	OBJECTIVE: We examined the genetic association of the promoter insertion/deletion (indel) in IRF5 gene with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in distinct populations and assessed its role in gene expression.	228	436
20080916	METHODS: Four IRF5 polymorphisms were genotyped in 1488 SLE patients and 1466 controls.	437	524
20080916	Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).	525	641
20080916	RESULTS: The promoter indel and rs2070197 had independent genetic effects, which accounted for the association of rs2004640 and rs10954213.	642	781
20080916	Gene expression analysis revealed that rs10954213 exerted the greatest influence on IRF5 transcript levels.	782	889
20080916	CONCLUSION: We corroborated the association of the promoter indel with SLE in 5 different populations and revealed that rs10954213 is the main single-nucleotide polymorphism responsible for altered IRF5 expression in PBMC.	890	1112
20105310	Association of adipocyte genes with ASP expression: a microarray analysis of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue in morbidly obese subjects.	0	144
20105310	BACKGROUND: Prevalence of obesity is increasing to pandemic proportions.	145	217
20105310	However, obese subjects differ in insulin resistance, adipokine production and co-morbidities.	218	312
20105310	Based on fasting plasma analysis, obese subjects were grouped as Low Acylation Stimulating protein (ASP) and Triglyceride (TG) (LAT) vs High ASP and TG (HAT).	313	471
20105310	Subcutaneous (SC) and omental (OM) adipose tissues (n = 21) were analysed by microarray, and biologic pathways in lipid metabolism and inflammation were specifically examined.	472	647
20105310	METHODS: LAT and HAT groups were matched in age, obesity, insulin, and glucose, and had similar expression of insulin-related genes (InsR, IRS-1).	648	794
20105310	ASP related genes tended to be increased in the HAT group and were correlated (factor B, adipsin, complement C3, p < 0.01 each).	795	923
20105310	Differences between LAT and HAT group were almost exclusively in SC tissue, with little difference in OM tissue.	924	1036
20105310	Increased C5L2 (p < 0.01), an ASP receptor, in HAT suggests a compensatory ASP pathway, associated with increased TG storage.	1037	1162
20105310	RESULTS: HAT adipose tissue demonstrated increased lipid related genes for storage (CD36, DGAT1, DGAT2, SCD1, FASN, and LPL), lipolysis (HSL, CES1, perilipin), fatty acid binding proteins (FABP1, FABP3) and adipocyte differentiation markers (CEBPalpha, CEBPbeta, PPARgamma).	1163	1437
20105310	By contrast, oxidation related genes were decreased (AMPK, UCP1, CPT1, FABP7).	1438	1516
20105310	HAT subjects had increased anti-inflammatory genes TGFB1, TIMP1, TIMP3, and TIMP4 while proinflammatory PIG7 and MMP2 were also significantly increased; all genes, p < 0.025.	1517	1691
20105310	CONCLUSION: Taken together, the profile of C5L2 receptor, ASP gene expression and metabolic factors in adipose tissue from morbidly obese HAT subjects suggests a compensatory response associated with the increased plasma ASP and TG.	1692	1924
20126413	U87MG decoded: the genomic sequence of a cytogenetically aberrant human cancer cell line.	0	89
20126413	U87MG is a commonly studied grade IV glioma cell line that has been analyzed in at least 1,700 publications over four decades.	90	216
20126413	In order to comprehensively characterize the genome of this cell line and to serve as a model of broad cancer genome sequencing, we have generated greater than 30x genomic sequence coverage using a novel 50-base mate paired strategy with a 1.4kb mean insert library.	217	483
20126413	A total of 1,014,984,286 mate-end and 120,691,623 single-end two-base encoded reads were generated from five slides.	484	600
20126413	All data were aligned using a custom designed tool called BFAST, allowing optimal color space read alignment and accurate identification of DNA variants.	601	754
20126413	The aligned sequence reads and mate-pair information identified 35 interchromosomal translocation events, 1,315 structural variations (>100 bp), 191,743 small (<21 bp) insertions and deletions (indels), and 2,384,470 single nucleotide variations (SNVs).	755	1008
20126413	Among these observations, the known homozygous mutation in PTEN was robustly identified, and genes involved in cell adhesion were overrepresented in the mutated gene list.	1009	1180
20126413	Data were compared to 219,187 heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms assayed by Illumina 1M Duo genotyping array to assess accuracy: 93.83% of all SNPs were reliably detected at filtering thresholds that yield greater than 99.99% sequence accuracy.	1181	1435
20126413	Protein coding sequences were disrupted predominantly in this cancer cell line due to small indels, large deletions, and translocations.	1436	1572
20126413	In total, 512 genes were homozygously mutated, including 154 by SNVs, 178 by small indels, 145 by large microdeletions, and 35 by interchromosomal translocations to reveal a highly mutated cell line genome.	1573	1779
20126413	Of the small homozygously mutated variants, 8 SNVs and 99 indels were novel events not present in dbSNP.	1780	1884
20126413	These data demonstrate that routine generation of broad cancer genome sequence is possible outside of genome centers.	1885	2002
20126413	The sequence analysis of U87MG provides an unparalleled level of mutational resolution compared to any cell line to date.	2003	2124
20129423	Fatal carbamazepine induced fulminant eosinophilic (hypersensitivity) myocarditis: emphasis on anatomical and histological characteristics, mechanisms and genetics of drug hypersensitivity and differential diagnosis.	0	216
20129423	The most severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine have been observed in the haemopoietic system, the liver and the cardiovascular system.	217	355
20129423	A frequently fatal, although exceptionally rare side effect of carbamazepine is necrotizing eosinophilic (hypersensitivity) myocarditis.	356	492
20129423	We report a case of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to administration of carbamazepine.	493	587
20129423	Acute hypersensitivity myocarditis was not suspected clinically, and the diagnosis was made post-mortem.	588	692
20129423	Histology revealed diffuse infiltration of the myocardium by eosinophils and lymphocytes with myocyte damage.	693	802
20129423	Clinically, death was due to cardiogenic shock.	803	850
20129423	To best of our knowledge this is the second case of fatal carbamazepine induced myocarditis reported in English literature.	851	974
20143913	Large deletion involving exon 5 of the arylsulfatase B gene caused apparent homozygosity in a mucopolysaccharidosis type VI patient.	0	132
20143913	Apparent homozygosity for the mutation p.R315X present on exon 5 of the arylsulfatase B (ARSB) gene in a mucopolysaccharidosis type VI patient was solved in this study by further testing for a second mutation.	133	342
20143913	Patient cDNA analysis revealed that the entire exon 5 of the ARSB gene was lacking; this new mutation was identified as c.899-1142del.	343	477
20143913	As the genomic DNA sequencing excluded the presence of splicing mutations, polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed for polymorphisms listed in the NCBI SNP database for the ARSB gene.	478	670
20143913	This allowed the mutation at the genomic DNA level to be identified as g.99367-102002del; this gross deletion, involving the entire exon 5 of the gene and parts of introns 4 and 5 led to a frameshift starting at amino acid 300 and resulting in a protein with 39% amino acids different from the normal enzyme.	671	979
20143913	We stress that extensive DNA analysis needs to be performed in case of apparent homozygosity to avoid potential errors in genetic counseling.	980	1121

20226780	Chordin-like 1 and 2 (CHL1 and 2) are two members of this group that have been described in human, mouse, and chick.	259	375
20226780	However, in vivo roles for CHL1 and 2 in early development are unknown due to lack of loss-of-function analysis.	376	488
20226780	Here we identify and characterize zebrafish, Danio rerio, CHL (Chl).	489	557
20226780	The chl gene is on a region of chromosome 21 syntenic with the area of murine chromosome 7 bearing the CHL2 gene.	558	671
20226780	Inability to identify a separate zebrafish gene corresponding to the mammalian CHL1 gene suggests that Chl may serve roles in zebrafish distributed between CHL1 and CHL2 in other species.	672	859
20226780	Chl is a maternal factor that is also zygotically expressed later in development and has spatiotemporal expression patterns that differ from but overlap those of zebrafish chordin (Chd), suggesting differences but also possible overlap in developmental roles of the two proteins.	860	1139
20226780	Chl, like Chd, dorsalizes embryos upon overexpression and is cleaved by BMP1, which antagonizes this activity.	1140	1250
20226780	Loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that Chl serves as a BMP antagonist with functions that overlap and are redundant with those of Chd in forming the dorsoventral axis.	1251	1425
20331935	A cross-sectional evaluation of the effect of risperidone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on bone mineral density in boys.	0	134
20331935	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia on trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents.	135	316
20331935	METHOD: Medically healthy 7- to 17-year-old males chronically treated, in a naturalistic setting, with risperidone were recruited for this cross-sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007.	317	558
20331935	Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted.	559	625
20331935	The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review, and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record.	626	754
20331935	Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.	755	947
20331935	RESULTS: Hyperprolactinemia was present in 49% of 83 boys (n = 41) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2.9 years.	948	1064
20331935	Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia.	1065	1172
20331935	As expected, bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity.	1173	1246
20331935	After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores, serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius (P < .03).	1247	1437
20331935	Controlling for relevant covariates, we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius (P = .03) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine (P < .05).	1438	1665
20331935	These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non-Hispanic white patients.	1666	1764
20331935	Of 13 documented fractures, 3 occurred after risperidone and SSRIs were started, and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia.	1765	1900
20331935	CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to link risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents.	1901	2045
20331935	Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues.	2046	2202
20335448	A novel point mutation in helix 10 of the human glucocorticoid receptor causes generalized glucocorticoid resistance by disrupting the structure of the ligand-binding domain.	0	174
20335448	CONTEXT: Generalized glucocorticoid resistance syndrome is a rare familial or sporadic condition characterized by partial insensitivity to glucocorticoids, caused by mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene.	175	392
20335448	Most of the reported cases are adults, demonstrating symptoms associated with mineralocorticoid and/or adrenal androgen excess caused by compensatively increased secretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone.	393	600
20335448	PATIENT: We identified a new 2-yr-old female case of generalized glucocorticoid resistance syndrome.	601	701
20335448	The patient (TJ) presented with a generalized seizure associated with hypoglycemia and hypokalemia.	702	801
20335448	She also had hypertension and premature pubarche, whereas dexamethasone effectively suppressed these clinical manifestations.	802	927
20335448	RESULTS: The patient's GR gene had a heterozygotic mutation (G-->A) at nucleotide position 2141 (exon 8), which resulted in substitution of arginine by glutamine at amino acid position 714 in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the GR alpha.	928	1168
20335448	Molecular analysis revealed that the mutant receptor had significantly impaired transactivation activity with a 2-fold reduction in affinity to ligand.	1169	1320
20335448	It showed attenuated transactivation of the activation function (AF)-2 and reduced binding to a p160 nuclear receptor coactivator.	1321	1451
20335448	Computer-based structural analysis revealed that replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 714 transmitted a conformational change to the LBD and the AF-2 transactivation surface, resulting in a decreased binding affinity to ligand and to the LXXLL coactivator motif.	1452	1726
20335448	CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone treatment is effective in controlling the premature pubarche, hypoglycemia, hypertension, and hypokalemia in this child case, wherein arginine 714 plays a key role in the proper formation of the ligand-binding pocket and the AF-2 surface of the GR alpha LBD.	1727	2012
20401977	The human AHR: identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms from six ethnic populations.	0	93
20401977	BACKGROUND: The effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related dioxin-like chemicals are mediated through binding-dependent activation of the cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).	94	290
20401977	The human AHR is a low-affinity receptor relative to most rodents, but some reports suggest that there may be individuals with polymorphic high-affinity receptors, thereby possibly increasing the sensitivity to dioxins in such people.	291	525
20401977	METHODS: Although no polymorphisms have been reported in the ligand binding region of the AHR in the over 100 reported sequences, we sequenced 108 additional human AHR genes in an effort to further identify single single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the open reading frames of the AHR locus.	526	827
20401977	The DNA was sequenced from six ethnic populations that included Japanese, Chinese, European/Caucasian, African-American, South East Asian, and Hispanic.	828	980
20401977	RESULTS: Six exonic SNPs were identified; four had been described as previously reported and two seem to be novel.	981	1095
20401977	Four of the SNPs identified lead to amino acid changes in the AHR protein and two of the SNPs lead to synonymous substitutions.	1096	1223
20401977	An additional four SNPs have been reported elsewhere that were not identified in the current analysis.	1224	1326
20401977	With these new sequences, more than 200 human AHR gene sequences have been analyzed for SNPs.	1327	1420
20401977	CONCLUSION: The results indicate a very limited presence of polymorphisms in the core ligand binding region of the human AHR.	1421	1546
20401977	Other regions, such as the transactivation domain, seem to be slightly more polymorphic in the human population and the impact on functionality should be further examined.	1547	1718
20415560	Vitamin E reduces cardiovascular disease in individuals with diabetes mellitus and the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype.	0	112
20415560	AIMS: Individuals with both diabetes mellitus (DM) and the Haptoglobin (Hp) 2-2 genotype are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.	113	250
20415560	As the antioxidant function of the Hp 2-2 protein is impaired, we sought to test the pharmacogenomic hypothesis that antioxidant vitamin E supplementation would provide cardiovascular protection to Hp 2-2 DM individuals.	251	471
20415560	MATERIALS & METHODS: We determined the Hp genotype on DM participants from two trials (HOPE and ICARE) and assessed the effect of vitamin E by Hp genotype on their common prespecified outcome, the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death.	472	737
20415560	Data was analyzed with a fixed-effect model.	738	782
20415560	These results were input into a simulation model, the Evidence Based Medicine Integrator, in order to estimate their long-term implications in a real-world population from Kaiser Permanente (CA, USA).	783	983
20415560	RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the two trials demonstrated a significant overall reduction in the composite end point in Hp 2-2 DM individuals with vitamin E (odds ratio: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.40-0.86; p = 0.006).	984	1186
20415560	There was a statistically significant interaction between the Hp genotype and vitamin E on the composite end point.	1187	1302
20415560	In these trials, Hp typing of 69 DM individuals and treating those with the Hp 2-2 with vitamin E prevented one myocardial infarct, stroke or cardiovascular death.	1303	1466
20415560	Lifelong administration of vitamin E to Hp 2-2 DM individuals in the Kaiser population would increase their life expectancy by 3 years.	1467	1602
20415560	CONCLUSION: A pharmacogenomic strategy of screening DM individuals for the Hp genotype and treating those with Hp 2-2 with vitamin E appears to be highly clinically effective.	1603	1778
20428796	Effect of the abrogation of TGF-beta1 by antisense oligonucleotides on the expression of TGF-beta-isoforms and their receptors I and II in isolated fibroblasts from keloid scars.	0	178
20428796	Disequilibrium of dermal wound repair can result in continued accumulation of ECM and excessive scar formation.	179	290
20428796	In susceptible genetically predisposed individuals, keloid formation can be observed.	291	376
20428796	Keloid disease represents a benign dermal fibroproliferative tumor that is unique to humans.	377	469
20428796	TGF-beta is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disease which is still not fully understood.	470	579
20428796	The isoforms TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2 have profibrotic properties, whereas TGF-beta3 may have antifibrotic functions.	580	696
20428796	TGF-beta exerts its influence by binding to type I and type II TGF-beta receptors, thereby forming a complex and activating specific downstream effector molecules.	697	860
20428796	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TGF-beta1 targeting by antisense oligonucleotides on the RNA synthesis and protein expression of TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors in keloid-derived fibroblasts.	861	1081
20428796	In tissue samples with normal fibroblasts (NFs) serving as control samples, expression of TGF-beta1 and -beta2 was decreased when compared to keloid fibroblasts (KFs), while expression of TGF-beta3 and of TGF-betaRII was significantly higher in NFs.	1082	1331
20428796	In the ELISA assay, abrogation of TGF-beta1 led to a significant decrease in TGF-beta1 and -beta2 (p<0.05).	1332	1439
20428796	Expression of TGF-beta2 mRNA was reduced.	1440	1481
20428796	Expression of TGF-beta3 mRNA revealed contrary patterns in KFs from different patients while expression of TGF-betaRI was found to be equal during the measurement period.	1482	1652
20428796	TGF-betaRII mRNA expression was increased after 48 and 72 h respectively.	1653	1726
20428796	There is growing evidence for a regulatory mechanism between TGF-beta1 and its receptors.	1727	1816
20428796	Our findings support this theory by suggesting interrelations between the different TGF-beta isoforms and their receptors.	1817	1939
20428796	Abnormal response of KFs to TGF-betamight reflect a modification in the regulatory pathway that occurs at the receptor level or during intracellular trans-duction.	1940	2103
20428796	Improving the understanding of TGF-beta in keloid disease could lead to the development of clinically useful therapeutic modalities for treatment of keloid disease or even allow identification of preventive strategies.	2104	2322
20431083	Antithrombotic drug use, cerebral microbleeds, and intracerebral hemorrhage: a systematic review of published and unpublished studies.	0	134
20431083	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds (MB) are potential risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it is unclear if they are a contraindication to using antithrombotic drugs.	135	327
20431083	Insights could be gained by pooling data on MB frequency stratified by antithrombotic use in cohorts with ICH and ischemic stroke (IS)/transient ischemic attack (TIA).	328	495
20431083	METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with stroke or TIA to compare the presence of MB in: (1) antithrombotic users vs nonantithrombotic users with ICH; (2) antithrombotic users vs nonusers with IS/TIA; and (3) ICH vs ischemic events stratified by antithrombotic use.	496	814
20431083	We also analyzed published and unpublished follow-up data to determine the risk of ICH in antithrombotic users with MB.	815	934
20431083	RESULTS: In a pooled analysis of 1460 ICH and 3817 IS/TIA, MB were more frequent in ICH vs IS/TIA in all treatment groups, but the excess increased from 2.8 (odds ratio; range, 2.3-3.5) in nonantithrombotic users to 5.7 (range, 3.4-9.7) in antiplatelet users and 8.0 (range, 3.5-17.8) in warfarin users (P difference=0.01).	935	1258
20431083	There was also an excess of MB in warfarin users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.4; P<0.001) but none in warfarin users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.7; P=0.33; P difference=0.01).	1259	1458
20431083	There was a smaller excess of MB in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.3; P<0.001), but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7; P<0.001; P difference=0.25).	1459	1688
20431083	In pooled follow-up data for 768 antithrombotic users, presence of MB at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent ICH (OR, 12.1; 95% CI, 3.4-42.5; P<0.001).	1689	1878
20431083	CONCLUSIONS: The excess of MB in warfarin users with ICH compared to other groups suggests that MB increase the risk of warfarin-associated ICH.	1879	2023
20431083	Limited prospective data corroborate these findings, but larger prospective studies are urgently required.	2024	2130
20477932	Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats: involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress, and prevention by topiramate.	0	145
20477932	Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced-behaviour is poorly understood.	146	359
20477932	Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms.	360	528
20477932	Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats.	529	816
20477932	NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased.	817	1036
20477932	Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex.	1037	1194
20477932	In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase.	1195	1336
20477932	These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine.	1337	1487
20477932	Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed, showing novel neuroprotective properties.	1488	1580
20510337	Coenzyme Q10 treatment ameliorates acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mice.	0	74
20510337	The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg).	75	226
20510337	Coenzyme Q10 treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for 6 consecutive days, starting 1 day before cisplatin administration.	227	354
20510337	Coenzyme Q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cisplatin.	355	472
20510337	Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration.	473	866
20510337	Also, histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment.	867	975
20510337	Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the cisplatin-induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kappaB, caspase-3 and p53 in renal tissue.	976	1186
20510337	It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice.	1187	1356
20523265	Association study of complement factor H, C2, CFB, and C3 and age-related macular degeneration in a Han Chinese population.	0	123
20523265	PURPOSE: Genes in the complement pathway, including complement factor H (CFH), C2/BF, and C3, have been reported to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).	124	298
20523265	Genetic variants, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in these genes were geno-typed for a case-control association study in a mainland Han Chinese population.	299	462
20523265	METHODS: One hundred and fifty-eight patients with wet AMD, 80 patients with soft drusen, and 220 matched control subjects were recruited among Han Chinese in mainland China.	463	637
20523265	Seven SNPs in CFH and two SNPs in C2, CFB', and C3 were genotyped using the ABI SNaPshot method.	638	734
20523265	A deletion of 84,682 base pairs covering the CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes was detected by direct polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis.	735	875
20523265	RESULTS: Four SNPs, including rs3753394 (P = 0.0276), rs800292 (P = 0.0266), rs1061170 (P = 0.00514), and rs1329428 (P = 0.0089), in CFH showed a significant association with wet AMD in the cohort of this study.	876	1087
20523265	A haplotype containing these four SNPs (CATA) significantly increased protection of wet AMD with a P value of 0.0005 and an odds ratio of 0.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.60).	1088	1268
20523265	Unlike in other populations, rs2274700 and rs1410996 did not show a significant association with AMD in the Chinese population of this study.	1269	1410
20523265	None of the SNPs in CFH showed a significant association with drusen, and none of the SNPs in CFH, C2, CFB, and C3 showed a significant association with either wet AMD or drusen in the cohort of this study.	1411	1617
20523265	The CFHR1 and CFHR3 deletion was not polymorphic in the Chinese population and was not associated with wet AMD or drusen.	1618	1739
20523265	CONCLUSION: This study showed that SNPs rs3753394 (P = 0.0276), rs800292 (P = 0.0266), rs1061170 (P = 0.00514), and rs1329428 (P = 0.0089), but not rs7535263, rs1410996, or rs2274700, in CFH were significantly associated with wet AMD in a mainland Han Chinese population.	1740	2011
20523265	This study showed that CFH was more likely to be AMD susceptibility gene at Chr.1q31 based on the finding that the CFHR1 and CFHR3 deletion was not polymorphic in the cohort of this study, and none of the SNPs that were significantly associated with AMD in a white population in C2, CFB, and C3 genes showed a significant association with AMD.	2012	2355
20534142	Association of obesity risk SNPs in PCSK1 with insulin sensitivity and proinsulin conversion.	0	93
20534142	BACKGROUND: Prohormone convertase 1 is involved in maturation of peptides.	94	168
20534142	Rare mutations in gene PCSK1, encoding this enzyme, cause childhood obesity and abnormal glucose homeostasis with elevated proinsulin concentrations.	169	318
20534142	Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene, rs6232 and rs6235, are associated with obesity.	319	430
20534142	We studied whether these SNPs influence the prediabetic traits insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, or glucose intolerance.	431	560
20534142	METHODS: We genotyped 1498 German subjects for SNPs rs6232 and rs6235 within PCSK1.	561	644
20534142	The subjects were metabolically characterized by oral glucose tolerance test with glucose, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide measurements.	645	784
20534142	A subgroup of 512 subjects underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.	785	858
20534142	RESULTS: The minor allele frequencies were 25.8% for SNP rs6235 and 6.0% for rs6232.	859	943
20534142	After adjustment for sex and age, we found no association of SNPs rs6235 and rs6232 with BMI or other weight-related traits (all p >or= 0.07).	944	1086
20534142	Both minor alleles, adjusted for sex, age, BMI and insulin sensitivity were associated with elevated AUCproinsulin and AUCproinsulin/AUCinsulin (rs6235: p(additive) model <or= 0.009, effect sizes 8/8%, rs6232: pdominant model <or= 0.01, effect sizes 10/21%).	1087	1345
20534142	Insulin secretion was not affected by the variants (different secretion parameters, all p >or= 0.08).	1346	1447
20534142	The minor allele of SNP rs6232 was additionally associated with 15% higher OGTT-derived and 19% higher clamp-derived insulin sensitivity (pdom <or= 0.0047), 4.5% lower HOMAIR (pdom = 0.02) and 3.5% lower 120-min glucose (pdom = 0.0003) independently of BMI and proinsulin conversion.	1448	1731
20534142	SNP rs6235 was not associated with parameters of glucose metabolism.	1732	1800
20534142	CONCLUSIONS: Like rare mutations in PCSK1, the more common variants tested determine glucose-stimulated proinsulin conversion, but not insulin secretion.	1801	1954
20534142	In addition, rs6232, encoding the amino acid exchange N221D, influences insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.	1955	2071
20534762	Two novel mutations of the TSH-beta subunit gene underlying congenital central hypothyroidism undetectable in neonatal TSH screening.	0	133
20534762	CONTEXT: Patients with TSH-beta subunit defects and congenital hypothyroidism are missed by TSH-based neonatal screening.	134	255
20534762	OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to report the molecular consequences of a novel splice-junction mutation and a novel missense mutation in the TSH-beta subunit gene found in two patients with congenital central hypothyroidism and conventional treatment-resistant anemia.	256	522
20534762	RESULTS: Patient 1 had a homozygous G to A nucleotide change at the 5' donor splice site of exon/intron 2.	523	629
20534762	This resulted in a silent change at codon 34 of the mature protein.	630	697
20534762	In vitro splicing assays showed that the mutant minigene dramatically affected pre-mRNA processing, causing exon 2 to be completely skipped.	698	838
20534762	The putative product from a new out-of-frame translational start point in exon 3 is expected to yield a nonsense 25-amino-acid peptide.	839	974
20534762	In patient 2, sequence analysis revealed a compound heterozygosis for the already reported 313delT (C105Vfs114X) mutation and for a second novel mutation in exon 3, substituting G for A at cDNA nucleotide position 323, resulting in a C88Y change.	975	1221
20534762	This cysteine residue is conserved among all dimeric pituitary and placental glycoprotein hormone-beta subunits.	1222	1334
20534762	Data from in silico analysis confirmed that the C88Y mutation would affect subunit conformation.	1335	1431
20534762	Indeed, two different bioinformatics approaches, PolyPhen and SIFT analysis, predicted C88Y to be a damaging substitution.	1432	1554
20534762	CONCLUSIONS: In isolated TSH deficiency, the exact molecular diagnosis is mandatory for diagnosis of isolated pituitary deficiency, delineation of prognosis, and genetic counseling.	1555	1736

20540798	BACKGROUND: The phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene was reported as a susceptibility gene to stroke.	92	190
20540798	The genetic effect might be attributed to its role in modulating the atherogenic process in the carotid arteries.	191	304
20540798	Using carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque index as phenotypes, the present study sought to determine the influence of this gene on subclinical atherosclerosis.	305	476
20540798	METHODS: Carotid ultrasonography was performed on 1013 stroke-free subjects who participated in the health screening programs (age 52.6 +/- 12.2; 47.6% men).	477	634
20540798	Genotype distribution was compared among the high-risk (plaque index > or = 4), low-risk (index = 1-3), and reference (index = 0) groups.	635	772
20540798	We analyzed continuous IMT data and further dichotomized IMT data using mean plus one standard deviation as the cutoff level.	773	898
20540798	Because the plaque prevalence and IMT values displayed a notable difference between men and women, we carried out sex-specific analyses in addition to analyzing the overall data.	899	1077
20540798	Rs702553 at the PDE4D gene was selected because it conferred a risk for young stroke in our previous report.	1078	1186
20540798	Previous young stroke data (190 cases and 211 controls) with an additional 532 control subjects without ultrasonic data were shown as a cross-validation for the genetic effect.	1187	1363
20540798	RESULTS: In the overall analyses, the rare homozygote of rs702553 led to an OR of 3.1 (p = 0.034) for a plaque index > or = 4.	1364	1490
20540798	When subjects were stratified by sex, the genetic effect was only evident in men but not in women.	1491	1589
20540798	Comparing male subjects with plaque index > or = 4 and those with plaque index = 0, the TT genotype was over-represented (27.6% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.008).	1590	1740
20540798	For dichotomized IMT data in men, the TT genotype had an OR of 2.1 (p = 0.032) for a thicker IMT at the common carotid artery compared with the (AA + AT) genotypes.	1741	1905
20540798	In women, neither IMT nor plaque index was associated with rs702553.	1906	1974
20540798	Similarly, SNP rs702553 was only significant in young stroke men (OR = 1.8, p = 0.025) but not in women (p = 0.27).	1975	2090
20540798	CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates a sex-differential effect of PDE4D on IMT, plaque index and stroke, which highlights its influence on various aspects of atherogenesis.	2091	2270
20558148	Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol-induced catalepsy.	0	129
20558148	The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system.	130	347
20558148	Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility.	348	581
20558148	However, the nature of this immobility is still unclear.	582	638
20558148	The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats.	639	856
20558148	Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl).	857	1141
20558148	The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar.	1142	1371
20558148	Accordingly, intracollicular microinjection of NMDA increased the latency to step down the bar.	1372	1467
20558148	These findings suggest that glutamate-mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol-induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity.	1468	1657
20583543	Molecular diagnosis of 46,XY DSD and identification of a novel 8 nucleotide deletion in exon 1 of the SRD5A2 gene.	0	114
20583543	Phenotypic presentation of 46,XY DSD depends on the underlying defects.	115	186
20583543	Defect in androgen action on the target tissues or production of active metabolite share common morphological features.	187	306
20583543	Molecular study may help differentiating these abnormalities with precision.	307	383
20583543	Mutational analysis of androgen receptor (AR) and SRD5A2 genes was performed in 29 patients with 46,XY DSD, by PCR-SSCP.	384	504
20583543	The amplicons that showed an aberrant migration in SSCP were subjected to sequencing.	505	590
20583543	Interestingly, six patients from 4 unrelated families (a pair of sibs, uncle/nephew and other two isolated) were identified with mutations in SRD5A2 gene.	591	745
20583543	In five patients p.R246Q missense mutation was detected, of which four were homozygous and one was compound heterozygous: g.80_87delT CGCGAAG (p.A27fsX132) and p.R246Q.	746	914
20583543	Another patient with isolated micropenis harbored a heterozygous p.G196S missense mutation.	915	1006
20583543	No AR gene mutation was detected.	1007	1040
20583543	In conclusion, our study suggests that p.R246Q mutation is common amongst patients with SRD5A2 gene defect from the Northern states of India.	1041	1182
20583543	Also, it records a novel deletion in exon 1 of SRD5A2 gene in a patient with severe hypospadias.	1183	1279
20588063	Permeability, ultrastructural changes, and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis.	0	145
20588063	BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria starts.	146	238
20588063	Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes.	239	525
20588063	METHODS: Using immune stainings, semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope.	526	632
20588063	Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers.	633	704
20588063	Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested.	705	752
20588063	RESULTS: By day 2, some patchy foot process effacement, but no proteinuria, appeared.	753	838
20588063	The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas.	839	907
20588063	The other proteins showed few changes, which were limited to diseased areas.	908	984
20588063	By day 4, foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage.	985	1103
20588063	Nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a-actinin remained unchanged.	1104	1205
20588063	ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect.	1206	1258
20588063	CONCLUSIONS: PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4, despite relatively mild proteinuria.	1259	1369
20588063	This was preceded by altered nephrin expression, supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology.	1370	1470
20588063	The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting roles in PAN, whereas a-actinin was unchanged.	1471	1586
20606392	Atypical GH insensitivity syndrome and severe insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency resulting from compound heterozygous mutations of the GH receptor, including a novel frameshift mutation affecting the intracellular domain.	0	226
20606392	BACKGROUND/AIMS: GH insensitivity and IGF deficiency may result from aberrations of the GH receptor (GHR).	227	333
20606392	We describe a 4-year-old child with modest growth failure and normal serum concentrations of GH-binding protein (GHBP), but clinical evidence of GH insensitivity.	334	496
20606392	METHOD: Serum and DNA samples from the proband and his parents were analyzed.	497	574
20606392	RESULTS: The child had a height of -4 SD, elevated serum GH concentrations, abnormally low serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations and normal GHBP concentrations.	575	736
20606392	DNA analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for mutations of GHR, including a previously reported R211H mutation and a novel duplication of a nucleotide in exon 9 (899dupC), the latter resulting in a frameshift and a premature stop codon.	737	977
20606392	Treatment with recombinant DNA-derived IGF-I resulted in growth acceleration.	978	1055
20606392	CONCLUSION: Mutations affecting the intracellular domain of the GHR can result in GH insensitivity and IGF deficiency, despite normal serum concentrations of GHBP.	1056	1219
20606392	The presence of clinical and biochemical evidence of GH resistance is sufficient to consider the possibility of aberrations of the GHR, even in the presence of normal serum GHBP concentrations.	1220	1413
20621845	Elevation of ADAM10, ADAM17, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression with media degeneration features CaCl2-induced thoracic aortic aneurysm in a rat model.	0	143
20621845	PURPOSE: This study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) by calcium chloride (CaCl(2))-induced arterial injury and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in TAA formation.	144	461
20621845	METHODS: Thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed to 0.5M CaCl(2) or normal saline (NaCl).	462	566
20621845	After 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and CaCl(2)-treated, CaCl(2)-untreated (n=12) and NaCl-treated aortic segments (n=12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments.	567	751
20621845	MMP-TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi-quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry.	752	874
20621845	RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters among CaCl(2)-treated, non-CaCl(2)-treated and NaCl-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n=6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition (n=12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl(2)-treated segments.	875	1192
20621845	MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl(2)-treated segments (all p<0.01), with trends of elevation in CaCl(2)-untreated segments, as compared with NaCl-treated segments.	1193	1391
20621845	Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (all p<0.01) in intima and media for CaCl(2)-treated segments.	1392	1558
20621845	TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments.	1559	1644
20621845	CONCLUSION: This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl(2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.	1645	1867
20651814	Lack of association between ADRA2B-4825 gene insertion/deletion polymorphism and migraine in Chinese Han population.	0	116
20651814	OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to estimate the association between susceptibility to migraine and the 12-nucleotide insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism in promoter region of alpha(2B)-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2B).	117	343
20651814	METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in Chinese Han population, including 368 cases of migraine and 517 controls.	344	466
20651814	Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples, and DNA fragments containing the site of polymorphism were amplified by PCR.	467	589
20651814	Data were adjusted for sex, age, migraine history and family history, and analyzed using a logistic regression model.	590	707
20651814	RESULTS: There was no association between indel polymorphism and migraine, at either the allele or the genotype level.	708	826
20651814	CONCLUSION: These findings do not support a functional significance of ADRA2B indel polymorphism at position -4825 relative to the start codon in the far upstream region of the promoter in the present migraine subjects.	827	1046
20682662	Lack of association of C-C chemokine receptor 5 DD32 deletion status with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, and disease severity.	0	164
20682662	OBJECTIVE: C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) plays an important role in inflammation.	165	248
20682662	A 32 base-pair (DD32) deletion in the CCR5 gene leads to a nonfunctional receptor.	249	331
20682662	This deletion has been reported to have a protective effect on the development and progression of several autoimmune diseases.	332	458
20682662	We investigated whether the DD32 deletion is associated with disease susceptibility in a population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and lupus nephritis (LN); and whether it is associated with disease severity.	459	716
20682662	METHODS: DNA samples from 405 RA patients, 97 SLE patients, 113 LN patients, and 431 healthy controls were genotyped for the CCR5 DD32 deletion.	717	861
20682662	Differences in genotype frequencies were tested between patients and controls.	862	940
20682662	Association of genotypes with disease severity was analyzed.	941	1001
20682662	RESULTS: Genotype frequencies of each group were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.	1002	1081
20682662	The genotype frequencies of patients did not differ significantly from controls (CCR5/DD32, DD32/DD32: RA 18.3% and 1.2%, respectively; SLE 17.5% and 2.1%; LN 13.3% and 1.8%; controls 20.0% and 2.8%).	1082	1282
20682662	However, there was a trend for lower DD32 deletion allele frequency in LN patients compared to controls (p = 0.08).	1283	1398
20682662	There was no significant association between the CCR5 status and disease severity in RA, SLE, or LN.	1399	1499
20682662	CONCLUSION: Although an association with LN cannot be excluded, the CCR5 DD32 deletion does not seem to be a disease susceptibility genotype for RA, SLE, or LN.	1500	1660
20682662	No significant effect of the DD32 deletion on disease severity was demonstrated.	1661	1741
20705401	Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine-induced psychosis in a Japanese population.	0	104
20705401	BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.	105	250
20705401	The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist.	251	506
20705401	In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats.	507	668
20705401	These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders.	669	876
20705401	The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia.	877	986
20705401	Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis.	987	1095
20705401	METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population.	1096	1338
20705401	The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients.	1339	1448
20705401	RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis.	1449	1557
20705401	Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction.	1558	1634
20705401	In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced psychosis patients, respectively.	1635	1853
20705401	CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population.	1854	1974
20708777	Association of DNA polymorphisms within the CYP11B2/CYP11B1 locus and postoperative hypertension risk in the patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas.	0	154
20708777	OBJECTIVES: Hypertension often persists after adrenalectomy for primary aldosteronism.	155	241
20708777	Traditional factors associated with postoperative hypertension were evaluated, but whether genetic determinants were involved remains poorly understood.	242	394
20708777	The aim of this study was to investigate the association of DNA polymorphisms within steroid synthesis genes (CYP11B2, CYP11B1) and the postoperative resolution of hypertension in Chinese patients undergoing adrenalectomy for aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA).	395	658
20708777	METHODS: Ninety-three patients with APA were assessed for postoperative resolution of hypertension.	659	758
20708777	All patients were genotyped for rs1799998 (C-344 T), intron 2 conversion, rs4539 (A2718G) within CYP11B2 and rs6410 (G22 5A), rs6387 (A2803G) within CYP11B1.	759	916
20708777	The associations between CYPB11B2/CYP11B1 polymorphisms and persistent postoperative hypertension were assessed by multivariate analysis.	917	1054
20708777	RESULTS: CYP11B2-CYP11B1 haplotype was associated with persistent postoperative hypertension in Chinese patients undergoing adrenalectomy with APA (P = .006).	1055	1213
20708777	Specifically, the rs4539 (AA) polymorphism was associated with persistent postoperative hypertension (P = .002).	1214	1326
20708777	Multivariate logistic regression revealed the common haplotypes H1 (AGACT), H2 (AGAWT), and H3 (AGAWC) were associated with the persistent postoperative hypertension (P = .01, 0.03, 0.005 after Bonferroni correction).	1327	1544
20708777	Additional predictors of persistent postoperative hypertension included duration of hypertension (P <.0005), family history of hypertension (P = .001), and elevated systolic blood pressure (P = .015).	1545	1745
20708777	CONCLUSIONS: The rs4539 (AA), H1, H2, and H3 are genetic predictors for postoperative persistence of hypertension for Chinese patients treated by adrenalectomy with APA.	1746	1915
20708777	DNA polymorphisms at CYP11B2/B1 locus may confer susceptibility to postoperative hypertension of patients with APA.	1916	2031
20709368	The fibrinogen gamma 10034C>T polymorphism is not associated with Peripheral Arterial Disease.	0	94
20709368	Conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin plays an essential role in hemostasis and results in stabilization of the fibrin clot.	95	216
20709368	Fibrinogen consists of three pairs of non-identical polypeptide chains, encoded by different genes (fibrinogen alpha [FGA], fibrinogen beta [FGB] and fibrinogen gamma [FGG]).	217	391
20709368	A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region of the FGG gene (FGG 10034C>T, rs2066865) has been associated with deep venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction.	392	588
20709368	Aim of the present study was to analyze the role of this polymorphism in peripheral arterial disease (PAD).	589	696
20709368	The study was designed as case-control study including 891 patients with documented PAD and 777 control subjects.	697	810
20709368	FGG genotypes were determined by exonuclease (TaqMan) assays.	811	872
20709368	FGG genotype frequencies were not significantly different between PAD patients (CC: 57.3%, CT: 36.7%, TT: 5.8%) and control subjects (CC: 60.9%, CT: 33.5%, TT 5.6%; p=0.35).	873	1046
20709368	In a multivariate logistic regression analysis including age, sex, smoking, diabetes, arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, the FGG 10034 T variant was not significantly associated with the presence of PAD (Odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.84 - 1.37; p = 0.60).	1047	1328
20709368	The FGG 10034C>T polymorphism was furthermore not associated with age at onset of PAD.	1329	1415
20709368	We conclude that the thrombophilic FGG 10034 T gene variant does not contribute to the genetic susceptibility to PAD.	1416	1533
20722491	Safety of capecitabine: a review.	0	33
20722491	IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Fluoropyrimidines, in particular 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), have been the mainstay of treatment for several solid tumors, including colorectal, breast and head and neck cancers, for > 40 years.	34	248

20801104	Association study of polymorphisms in the promoter region of DRD4 with schizophrenia, depression, and heroin addiction.	0	119
20801104	This study investigated the possible association between three functional polymorphisms in the promoter region of the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene and schizophrenia, depression, and heroin addiction.	120	323
20801104	Genomic DNA was isolated from the venous blood leukocytes of 322 unrelated patients with schizophrenia, 156 patients with depression, 300 patients with heroin addiction, and 300 healthy unrelated individuals.	324	532
20801104	Polymorphisms in the promoter region of DRD4 (-120 bp duplication, -616C/G, and -521C/T) were genotyped using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis.	533	694
20801104	Genotype and allele were analyzed using SPSS 11.5 software.	695	754
20801104	Results of this analysis indicated that there is a strong finding of -120 bp duplication allele frequencies with schizophrenia (p=0.008) and weak finding with -1240 L/S and for paranoid schizophrenia (p=0.022).	755	965
20801104	Interestingly, there is a stronger finding with -521 C/T allele frequencies with heroin dependence (p=0.0002).	966	1076
20801104	These observations strongly suggest that the -120-bp duplication polymorphism of DRD4 is associated with schizophrenia and that the -521 C/T polymorphism is associated with heroin addiction.	1077	1267
20801540	Hepatic but not brain iron is rapidly chelated by deferasirox in aceruloplasminemia due to a novel gene mutation.	0	113
20801540	BACKGROUND _#38; AIMS: Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease associated with brain and liver iron accumulation which typically presents with movement disorders, retinal degeneration, and diabetes mellitus.	114	356
20801540	Ceruloplasmin is a multi-copper ferroxidase that is secreted into plasma and facilitates cellular iron export and iron binding to transferrin.	357	499
20801540	RESULTS: A novel homozygous ceruloplasmin gene mutation, c.2554+1G>T, was identified as the cause of aceruloplasminemia in three affected siblings.	500	647
20801540	Two siblings presented with movement disorders and diabetes.	648	708
20801540	Complementary DNA sequencing showed that this mutation causes skipping of exon 14 and deletion of amino acids 809-852 while preserving the open reading frame.	709	867
20801540	Western blotting of liver extracts and sera of affected patients showed retention of the abnormal protein in the liver.	868	987
20801540	Aceruloplasminemia was associated with severe brain and liver iron overload, where hepatic mRNA expression of the iron hormone hepcidin was increased, corresponding to the degree of iron overload.	988	1184
20801540	Hepatic iron concentration normalized after 3 and 5months of iron chelation therapy with deferasirox, which was also associated with reduced insulin demands.	1185	1342
20801540	During short term treatment there was no clinical or imaging evidence for significant effects on brain iron overload.	1343	1460
20801540	CONCLUSIONS: Aceruloplasminemia can show an incomplete clinical penetrance but is invariably associated with iron accumulation in the liver and in the brain.	1461	1618
20801540	Iron accumulation in aceruloplasminemia is a result of defective cellular iron export, where hepcidin regulation is appropriate for the degree of iron overload.	1619	1779
20801540	Iron chelation with deferasirox was effective in mobilizing hepatic iron but has no effect on brain iron.	1780	1885
20828385	Cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects of temsirolimus in refractory mantle cell lymphoma.	0	90
20828385	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	91	181
20828385	Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and their prognosis is poor.	182	281
20828385	However, a 38% remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor.Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment, and a progression-free survival of 10 months.	282	574
20828385	In this case, lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy.	575	673
20828385	Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells.	674	861
20828385	Apart from this cytostatic effect, temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression.	862	1005
20828385	Moreover, numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post-necrotic tissue repair, were found after 6-month temsirolimus therapy.	1006	1153
20828385	Thus, temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects.This dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory MCL resistant to conventional chemotherapy.	1154	1411
20846357	A novel mutation in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) in a child with clinical and histological features of keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome.	0	147
20846357	BACKGROUND: Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare congenital ectodermal disorder, caused by heterozygous missense mutation in GJB2, encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26.	148	343
20846357	The commonest mutation is the p.Asp50Asn mutation, and only a few other mutations have been described to date.	344	454
20846357	AIM: To report the fatal clinical course and characterize the genetic background of a premature male neonate with the clinical and histological features of KID syndrome.	455	624
20846357	METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and used for PCR amplification of the GJB2 gene.	625	730
20846357	Direct sequencing was used for mutation analysis.	731	780
20846357	RESULTS: The clinical features included hearing impairment, ichthyosiform erythroderma with hyperkeratotic plaques, palmoplantar keratoderma, alopecia of the scalp and eyelashes, and a thick vernix caseosa-like covering of the scalp.	781	1014
20846357	On histological analysis, features characteristic of KID syndrome, such as acanthosis and papillomatosis of the epidermis with basket-weave hyperkeratosis, were seen.	1015	1181
20846357	The skin symptoms were treated successfully with acitretin 0.5 mg/kg.	1182	1251
20846357	The boy developed intraventricular and intracerebral haemorrhage, leading to hydrocephalus.	1252	1343
20846357	His condition was further complicated by septicaemia and meningitis caused by infection with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.	1344	1502
20846357	Severe respiratory failure followed, and the child died at 46 weeks of gestational age (13 weeks postnatally).	1503	1613
20846357	Sequencing of the GJB2 gene showed that the child was heterozygous for a novel nucleotide change, c.263C>T, in exon 2, leading to a substitution of alanine for valine at position 88 (p.Ala88Val).	1614	1809
20846357	CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a new heterozygous de novo mutation in the Cx26 gene (c.263C>T; p.Ala88Val) leading to KID syndrome.	1810	1949
20854438	SLURP1 mutation-impaired T-cell activation in a family with mal de Meleda.	0	74
20854438	BACKGROUND: Mal de Meleda (MDM) is palmoplantar erythrokeratoderma with an autosomal recessive inheritance and is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding SLURP-1 (lymphocyte antigen 6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1).	75	326
20854438	SLURP-1 is an allosteric agonist to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and it regulates epidermal homeostasis.	327	447
20854438	In addition, murine studies have shown that nAchR signalling is important for the regulation of T-cell function.	448	560
20854438	Among the family members, patients with the homozygous SLURP1 (previously known as ARS component B) mutation are prone to melanoma and viral infection, which might link to defective T-cell function as well as a derangement of epidermal homeostasis.	561	809
20854438	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of the SLURP1 gene mutation with T-cell activation in a Taiwanese family with MDM.	810	935
20854438	To test that SLURP-1 is essential for T-cell activation.	936	992
20854438	METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from a Taiwanese MDM family bearing the G to A substitution in nucleotide 256 in the SLURP1 gene, corresponding to a glycine to arginine substitution at amino acid 86 (G86R) in the SLURP-1 protein.	993	1262
20854438	PBMCs from homozygotes and wild-type controls were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies and the level of T-cell activation was determined by the stimulation index.	1263	1435
20854438	RESULTS: PBMCs with the heterozygous and homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation had defective T-cell activation.	1436	1542
20854438	This was restored by the addition of 0 5 ug mL(-1) recombinant human SLURP-1 protein.	1543	1628
20854438	CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MDM with the homozygous SLURP-1 G86R mutation may have an impaired T-cell activation.	1629	1741
20854438	The presence of wild-type SLURP-1 is essential for normal T-cell activation.	1742	1818
20859899	Syncope caused by hyperkalemia during use of a combined therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and spironolactone.	0	132
20859899	A 76 year-old woman with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting and prior myocardial infarction was transferred to the emergency room with loss of consciousness due to marked bradycardia caused by hyperkalemia.	133	349
20859899	The concentration of serum potassium was high, and normal sinus rhythm was restored after correction of the serum potassium level.	350	480
20859899	The cause of hyperkalemia was considered to be several doses of spiranolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, in addition to the long-term intake of ramipril, an ACE inhibitor.	481	654
20859899	This case is a good example of electrolyte imbalance causing acute life-threatening cardiac events.	655	754
20859899	Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of hyperkalemia, especially in elderly patients using ACE/ARB in combination with potassium sparing agents and who have mild renal disturbance.	755	944
20949073	Alternative splicing at a NAGNAG acceptor site as a novel phenotype modifier.	0	77
20949073	Approximately 30% of alleles causing genetic disorders generate premature termination codons (PTCs), which are usually associated with severe phenotypes.	78	231
20949073	However, bypassing the deleterious stop codon can lead to a mild disease outcome.	232	313
20949073	Splicing at NAGNAG tandem splice sites has been reported to result in insertion or deletion (indel) of three nucleotides.	314	435
20949073	We identified such a mechanism as the origin of the mild to asymptomatic phenotype observed in cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the E831X mutation (2623G>T) in the CFTR gene.	436	617
20949073	Analyses performed on nasal epithelial cell mRNA detected three distinct isoforms, a considerably more complex situation than expected for a single nucleotide substitution.	618	790
20949073	Structure-function studies and in silico analyses provided the first experimental evidence of an indel of a stop codon by alternative splicing at a NAGNAG acceptor site.	791	960
20949073	In addition to contributing to proteome plasticity, alternative splicing at a NAGNAG tandem site can thus remove a disease-causing UAG stop codon.	961	1107
20949073	This molecular study reveals a naturally occurring mechanism where the effect of either modifier genes or epigenetic factors could be suspected.	1108	1252
20949073	This finding is of importance for genetic counseling as well as for deciding appropriate therapeutic strategies.	1253	1365
20959502	Cerebrospinal fluid penetration of high-dose daptomycin in suspected Staphylococcus aureus meningitis.	0	102
20959502	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with suspected MSSA meningitis treated with high-dose daptomycin assessed with concurrent serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations.	103	337
20959502	CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old male presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and presumed health-care-associated pneumonia shown on chest radiograph.	338	507
20959502	Treatment was empirically initiated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.	508	603
20959502	Blood cultures revealed S. aureus susceptible to oxacillin.	604	663
20959502	Empiric antibiotic treatment was narrowed to nafcillin on day 4.	664	728
20959502	On day 8, the patient developed acute renal failure (serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, increased from 1.2 mg/dL the previous day and 0.8 mg/dL on admission).	729	880
20959502	The patient's Glasgow Coma Score was 3, with normal findings shown on computed tomography scan of the head 72 hours following an episode of cardiac arrest on day 10.	881	1046
20959502	The patient experienced relapsing MSSA bacteremia on day 9, increasing the suspicion for a central nervous system (CNS) infection.	1047	1177
20959502	Nafcillin was discontinued and daptomycin 9 mg/kg daily was initiated for suspected meningitis and was continued until the patient's death on day 16.	1178	1327
20959502	Daptomycin serum and CSF trough concentrations were 11.21 ug/mL and 0.52 ug/mL, respectively, prior to the third dose.	1328	1446
20959502	Lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for MSSA.	1447	1542
20959502	Creatine kinase levels were normal prior to daptomycin therapy and were not reassessed.	1543	1630
20959502	DISCUSSION: Daptomycin was initiated in our patient secondary to possible nafcillin-induced acute interstitial nephritis and relapsing bacteremia.	1631	1777
20959502	At a dose of 9 mg/kg, resultant penetration of 5% was higher than in previous reports, more consistent with inflamed meninges.	1778	1904
20959502	CONCLUSIONS: High-dose daptomycin may be an alternative option for MSSA bacteremia with or without a CNS source in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate standard therapy.	1905	2081
20959502	Further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted.	2082	2161
20973483	In vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A2A/A1 receptor antagonist in animal models of Parkinson's disease.	0	112
20973483	The in vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in several animal models of Parkinson's disease is described.	113	254
20973483	Discovery and scale-up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail, highlighting optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10.0% to 30.5%.	255	417
20973483	Compound 1 is a potent A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in vitro (A(2A) K(i) = 4.1 nM; A(1) K(i) = 17.0 nM) that has excellent activity, after oral administration, across a number of animal models of Parkinson's disease including mouse and rat models of haloperidol-induced catalepsy, mouse model of reserpine-induced akinesia, rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion model of drug-induced rotation, and MPTP-treated non-human primate model.	418	855
21042587	Familial glucocorticoid receptor haploinsufficiency by non-sense mediated mRNA decay, adrenal hyperplasia and apparent mineralocorticoid excess.	0	144
21042587	Primary glucocorticoid resistance (OMIM 138040) is a rare hereditary disease that causes a generalized partial insensitivity to glucocorticoid action, due to genetic alterations of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).	145	359
21042587	Investigation of adrenal incidentalomas led to the discovery of a family (eight affected individuals spanning three generations), prone to cortisol resistance, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, arterial hypertension and hypokalemia.	360	589
21042587	This phenotype exacerbated over time, cosegregates with the first heterozygous nonsense mutation p.R469[R,X] reported to date for the GR, replacing an arginine (CGA) by a stop (TGA) at amino-acid 469 in the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor.	590	858
21042587	In vitro, this mutation leads to a truncated 50-kDa GR lacking hormone and DNA binding capacity, devoid of hormone-dependent nuclear translocation and transactivation properties.	859	1037
21042587	In the proband's fibroblasts, we provided evidence for the lack of expression of the defective allele in vivo.	1038	1148
21042587	The absence of detectable mutated GR mRNA was accompanied by a 50% reduction in wild type GR transcript and protein.	1149	1265
21042587	This reduced GR expression leads to a significantly below-normal induction of glucocorticoid-induced target genes, FKBP5 in fibroblasts.	1266	1402
21042587	We demonstrated that the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid signaling dysfunction involved GR haploinsufficiency due to the selective degradation of the mutated GR transcript through a nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay that was experimentally validated on emetine-treated propositus' fibroblasts.	1403	1698
21042587	GR haploinsufficiency leads to hypertension due to illicit occupation of renal mineralocorticoid receptor by elevated cortisol rather than to increased mineralocorticoid production reported in primary glucocorticoid resistance.	1699	1926
21042587	Indeed, apparent mineralocorticoid excess was demonstrated by a decrease in urinary tetrahydrocortisone-tetrahydrocortisol ratio in affected patients, revealing reduced glucocorticoid degradation by renal activity of the 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, a GR regulated gene.	1927	2209
21042587	We propose thus that GR haploinsufficiency compromises glucocorticoid sensitivity and may represent a novel genetic cause of subclinical hypercortisolism, incidentally revealed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and mineralocorticoid-independent hypertension.	2210	2464
21054465	Mutational analysis of CYP2C8 in hypertensive patients using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography.	0	111
21054465	WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: CYP2C8 is involved in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase pathway.	112	209
21054465	Arachidonic acid metabolites such as epoxyeicosatrienenoic acids and hydroxyeicosatetrenoic acids, produced may have a role in hypertension.	210	350
21054465	We aimed to develop a medium through-put method for screening samples of known and new mutations of CYP2C8 using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC).	351	522
21054465	METHODS: DNA samples from 200 subjects (hypertensive patients and healthy controls) were screened for SNPs in CYP2C8 using DHPLC.	523	652
21054465	Genotypes and allelic frequencies of CYP2C8 between the healthy controls and patients with hypertension were compared.	653	771
21054465	RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: Six variants were detected and two were new; T deletion at 5063 and substitution of C to T at 33468 in exon 8.	772	907
21054465	Differences in variant frequencies were detected between the controls and hypertensive patients.	908	1004
21054465	The controls have significantly higher prevalence of C35322C compared to the patients.	1005	1091
21054465	The functional significance of the SNP at 35322 requires further study.	1092	1163
21054465	Having homozygous C35322C could be a protective factor for hypertension.	1164	1236
21054465	WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography is useful for population screening to identify new and existing SNPs.	1237	1384
21054465	A higher frequency of the C35322T SNP was observed among hypertensive patients than control subjects.	1385	1486
21054465	This potentially important observation requires confirmation and the clinical significance assessed.	1487	1587
21070631	The dopamine b-hydroxylase -1021C/T polymorphism is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in the Epistasis Project.	0	125
21070631	BACKGROUND: The loss of noradrenergic neurones of the locus coeruleus is a major feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD).	126	243
21070631	Dopamine b-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyses the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline.	244	327
21070631	Interactions have been reported between the low-activity -1021T allele (rs1611115) of DBH and polymorphisms of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, IL1A and IL6, contributing to the risk of AD.	328	521
21070631	We therefore examined the associations with AD of the DBH -1021T allele and of the above interactions in the Epistasis Project, with 1757 cases of AD and 6294 elderly controls.	522	698
21070631	METHODS: We genotyped eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the three genes, DBH, IL1A and IL6.	699	804
21070631	We used logistic regression models and synergy factor analysis to examine potential interactions and associations with AD.	805	927
21070631	RESULTS: We found that the presence of the -1021T allele was associated with AD: odds ratio = 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.4, p = 0.005).	928	1073
21070631	This association was nearly restricted to men < 75 years old: odds ratio = 2.2 (1.4-3.3, 0.0004).	1074	1171
21070631	We also found an interaction between the presence of DBH -1021T and the -889TT genotype (rs1800587) of IL1A: synergy factor = 1.9 (1.2-3.1, 0.005).	1172	1319
21070631	All these results were consistent between North Europe and North Spain.	1320	1391
21070631	CONCLUSIONS: Extensive, previous evidence (reviewed here) indicates an important role for noradrenaline in the control of inflammation in the brain.	1392	1540
21070631	Thus, the -1021T allele with presumed low activity may be associated with misregulation of inflammation, which could contribute to the onset of AD.	1541	1688
21070631	We suggest that such misregulation is the predominant mechanism of the association we report here.	1689	1787
21080147	Novel CRELD1 gene mutations in patients with atrioventricular septal defect.	0	76
21080147	BACKGROUND: Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs) occur as clinical defects of several different syndromes, as autosomal dominant defects, and as sporadically occurring malformations.	77	262
21080147	Consequently, there is genetic heterogeneity, but until recently, little is known about the genes involving in the pathogenesis of AVSD.	263	399
21080147	CRELD1 gene, a novel cell adhesion molecule, is a candidate gene for AVSD.	400	474
21080147	METHODS: This study included 133 patients with AVSD and 200 healthy controls.	475	552
21080147	Peripheral blood samples were collected and genomic DNA was extracted from the leukocytes.	553	643
21080147	CRELD1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers.	644	722
21080147	The sequences of PCR products were compared between the patients and controls.	723	801
21080147	RESULTS: In a patient, a C-to-G transition was identified at nucleotide 857 in exon 8 that resulted in a substitution of alanine for proline at amino acid 286 in the first calcium-binding EGF domain.	802	1001
21080147	This patient had an isolated partial AVSD and the mutation was inherited from her mother.	1002	1091
21080147	Another mutation was detected in a patient with a partial AVSD and evidence of Down syndrome.	1092	1185
21080147	The heterozygous c.973G>A transition in exon 9 resulted in a substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at amino acid 325 (E325K) in the second calcium-binding EGF domain.	1186	1355
21080147	CONCLUSIONS: Two novel CRELD1 mutations were identified in the calcium-binding EGF domain in patients with AVSD.	1356	1468
21080147	CRELD1 is likely to be an AVSD-susceptibility gene and CRELD1 mutations may increase the risk of developing a heart defect rather than being a direct causative mutation.	1469	1638
21126715	A Taiwanese boy with congenital generalized lipodystrophy caused by homozygous Ile262fs mutation in the BSCL2 gene.	0	115
21126715	Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by a near-complete absence of adipose tissue from birth or early infancy.	116	292
21126715	Mutations in the BSCL2 gene are known to result in CGL2, a more severe phenotype than CGL1, with earlier onset, more extensive fat loss and biochemical changes, more severe intellectual impairment, and more severe cardiomyopathy.	293	522
21126715	We report a 3-month-old Taiwanese boy with initial presentation of a lack of subcutaneous fat, prominent musculature, generalized eruptive xanthomas, and extreme hypertriglyceridemia.	523	706
21126715	Absence of mechanical adipose tissue in the orbits and scalp was revealed by head magnetic resonance imaging.	707	816
21126715	Hepatomegaly was noticed, and histological examination of a liver biopsy specimen suggested severe hepatic steatosis and periportal necrosis.	817	958
21126715	However, echocardiography indicated no sign of cardiomyopathy and he showed no distinct intellectual impairment that interfered with daily life.	959	1103
21126715	About 1 year later, abdominal computed tomography revealed enlargement of kidneys.	1104	1186
21126715	He had a homozygous insertion of a nucleotide, 783insG (Ile262fs mutation), in exon 7 of the BSCL2 gene.	1187	1291
21126715	We reviewed the genotype of CGL cases from Japan, India, China and Taiwan, and found that BSCL2 is a major causative gene for CGL in Asian.	1292	1431
21130517	Detection of EGFR mutations in plasma DNA from lung cancer patients by mass spectrometry genotyping is predictive of tumor EGFR status and response to EGFR inhibitors.	0	167
21130517	AIMS: EGFR mutations now guide the clinical use of EGFR-targeted therapy in lung cancer.	168	256
21130517	However, standard EGFR mutation analysis requires a minimum amount of tumor tissue, which may not be available in certain situations.	257	390
21130517	In this study, we combined a mass spectrometry genotyping assay (Sequenom) with a mutant-enriched PCR (ME-PCR) to detect EGFR mutations in free plasma DNA from patients with lung cancer.	391	577
21130517	METHOD: DNAs were extracted from 31 plasma samples from 31 patients and analyzed by both methods for EGFR Exon 19 deletion and EGFR L858R mutation.	578	725
21130517	Results in plasma DNA samples were compared with EGFR mutation status obtained in tumor DNA (18/31 EGFR mutant).	726	838
21130517	The relationship of EGFR mutation status in tumor and/or plasma samples to overall survival was assessed.	839	944
21130517	RESULTS: The EGFR mutation status in plasma DNA was identical to the primary tumor in 61% of patients (19/31).	945	1055
21130517	By mass spectrometry genotyping, the plasma samples contained mutant DNA corresponding to 5/14 EGFR Exon 19 deletions and 3/4 EGFR L858R mutations previously diagnosed in the matched tumors.	1056	1246
21130517	Two samples were positive in plasma DNA but negative in primary tumor tissue.	1247	1324
21130517	Results were similar for samples studied by ME-PCR.	1325	1376
21130517	For patients treated with erlotinib, overall survival was correlated with the presence of EGFR mutation in plasma and/or tumor tissue (p=0.002), with the two patients positive only in plasma DNA showing responses and favorable outcomes.	1377	1613
21130517	CONCLUSION: The detection of EGFR mutations in plasma DNA samples by mass spectrometry genotyping and ME-PCR is feasible.	1614	1735
21130517	A positive EGFR result in plasma DNA has a high predictive value for tumor EGFR status and for favorable clinical course on EGFR-targeted therapy and could therefore be useful in guiding clinical decisions in patients with insufficient or unavailable tumor specimens.	1736	2003
21135151	Impact of CCR5delta32 host genetic background and disease progression on HIV-1 intrahost evolutionary processes: efficient hypothesis testing through hierarchical phylogenetic models.	0	183
21135151	The interplay between C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) host genetic background, disease progression, and intrahost HIV-1 evolutionary dynamics remains unclear because differences in viral evolution between hosts limit the ability to draw conclusions across hosts stratified into clinically relevant populations.	184	499
21135151	Similar inference problems are proliferating across many measurably evolving pathogens for which intrahost sequence samples are readily available.	500	646
21135151	To this end, we propose novel hierarchical phylogenetic models (HPMs) that incorporate fixed effects to test for differences in dynamics across host populations in a formal statistical framework employing stochastic search variable selection and model averaging.	647	909
21135151	To clarify the role of CCR5 host genetic background and disease progression on viral evolutionary patterns, we obtain gp120 envelope sequences from clonal HIV-1 variants isolated at multiple time points in the course of infection from populations of HIV-1-infected individuals who only harbored CCR5-using HIV-1 variants at all time points.	910	1250
21135151	Presence or absence of a CCR5 wt/DD32 genotype and progressive or long-term nonprogressive course of infection stratify the clinical populations in a two-way design.	1251	1416
21135151	As compared with the standard approach of analyzing sequences from each patient independently, the HPM provides more efficient estimation of evolutionary parameters such as nucleotide substitution rates and d(N)/d(S) rate ratios, as shown by significant shrinkage of the estimator variance.	1417	1707
21135151	The fixed effects also correct for nonindependence of data between populations and results in even further shrinkage of individual patient estimates.	1708	1857
21135151	Model selection suggests an association between nucleotide substitution rate and disease progression, but a role for CCR5 genotype remains elusive.	1858	2005
21135151	Given the absence of clear d(N)/d(S) differences between patient groups, delayed onset of AIDS symptoms appears to be solely associated with lower viral replication rates rather than with differences in selection on amino acid fixation.	2006	2242
21163864	The M235T polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene in South Indian patients of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	0	107
21163864	INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex disorder and genetically transmitted cardiac disease with a diverse clinical course.	108	253
21163864	The objective of the present study was to examine the association of the T704C polymorphism of exon 2 of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene with HCM in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh.	254	448
21163864	Subjects and methods.	449	470
21163864	One-hundred and fifty HCM (90 sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [SHCM] and 60 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [FHCM]) patients and 165 age- and sex-matched normal healthy controls without known hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were included in the study.	471	746
21163864	DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes and the region of interest in the AGT gene bearing a missense mutation methionine to threonine substitution at codon 235 (M235T) of exon 2, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).	747	980
21163864	The PCR products were subjected to restriction digestion with the enzyme SfaNI.	981	1060
21163864	RESULTS: Significant differences were detected in genotypic distribution (p = 0.04) as well as the allelic frequency (p = 0.003) between the SHCM patients and controls.	1061	1229
21163864	The polymorphism did not show any association with FHCM.	1230	1286
21163864	CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the T allele of the AGT gene is significantly associated with SHCM in a South Indian population from Andhra Pradesh.	1287	1440
21163864	However, we did not find significant association of this polymorphism with FHCM.	1441	1521
21219851	A novel mutation screening system for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, vascular type by high-resolution melting curve analysis in combination with small amplicon genotyping using genomic DNA.	0	182
21219851	Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type (vEDS) (MIM #130050) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by type III procollagen gene (COL3A1) mutations.	183	331
21219851	Most COL3A1 mutations are detected by using total RNA from patient-derived fibroblasts, which requires an invasive skin biopsy.	332	459
21219851	High-resolution melting curve analysis (hrMCA) has recently been developed as a post-PCR mutation scanning method which enables simple, rapid, cost-effective, and highly sensitive mutation screening of large genes.	460	674
21219851	We established a hrMCA method to screen for COL3A1 mutations using genomic DNA.	675	754
21219851	PCR primers pairs for COL3A1 (52 amplicons) were designed to cover all coding regions of the 52 exons, including the splicing sites.	755	887
21219851	We used 15 DNA samples (8 validation samples and 7 samples of clinically suspected vEDS patients) in this study.	888	1000
21219851	The eight known COL3A1 mutations in validation samples were all successfully detected by the hrMCA.	1001	1100
21219851	In addition, we identified five novel COL3A1 mutations, including one deletion (c.2187delA) and one nonsense mutation (c.2992C>T) that could not be determined by the conventional total RNA method.	1101	1297
21219851	Furthermore, we established a small amplicon genotyping (SAG) method for detecting three high frequency coding-region SNPs (rs1800255:G>A, rs1801184:T>C, and rs2271683:A>G) in COL3A1 to differentiate mutations before sequencing.	1298	1526
21219851	The use of hrMCA in combination with SAG from genomic DNA enables rapid detection of COL3A1 mutations with high efficiency and specificity.	1527	1666
21219851	A better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation in COL3A1 using this method will lead to improve in diagnosis and treatment.	1667	1804
21238926	Brat promotes stem cell differentiation via control of a bistable switch that restricts BMP signaling.	0	102
21238926	Drosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained by Dpp signaling and the Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos) translational repressors.	103	244
21238926	Upon division, Dpp signaling is extinguished, and Nos is downregulated in one daughter cell, causing it to switch to a differentiating cystoblast (CB).	245	396
21238926	However, downstream effectors of Pum-Nos remain unknown, and how CBs lose their responsiveness to Dpp is unclear.	397	510
21238926	Here, we identify Brain Tumor (Brat) as a potent differentiation factor and target of Pum-Nos regulation.	511	616
21238926	Brat is excluded from GSCs by Pum-Nos but functions with Pum in CBs to translationally repress distinct targets, including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs.	617	763
21238926	Regulation of both targets simultaneously lowers cellular responsiveness to Dpp signaling, forcing the cell to become refractory to the self-renewal signal.	764	920
21238926	Mathematical modeling elucidates bistability of cell fate in the Brat-mediated system, revealing how autoregulation of GSC number can arise from Brat coupling extracellular Dpp regulation to intracellular interpretation.	921	1141
21325775	A novel apolipoprotein E mutation, ApoE Osaka (Arg158 Pro), in a dyslipidemic patient with lipoprotein glomerulopathy.	0	118
21325775	Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease characterized by the presence of thrombuslike deposition in markedly dilated glomerular capillaries and is often accompanied by an increased serum apolipoprotein E (apoE) level.	119	347
21325775	Several gene mutations of apoE have been reported to be associated with LPG.	348	424
21325775	In the current study, we report an LPG patient with a novel apoE mutation, apoE Osaka.	425	511
21325775	The patient was a 45-year-old man who was hospitalized due to nephrotic syndrome.	512	593
21325775	Light and electron microscopic observations of renal biopsy clearly showed characteristic findings of LPG, including lamellate thrombi in the lumen of dilated glomerular capillaries.	594	776
21325775	His apoE phenotype was apoE3/2 and he had mild dyslipidemia with a mid-band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.	777	891
21325775	It is intriguing that the serum apoE level was within normal limits.	892	960
21325775	We determined the sequence of the apoE gene using direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products.	961	1077
21325775	ApoE gene analysis showed a nucleotide substitution of G to C at codon 158 of exon 4.	1078	1163
21325775	This mutation denoted an amino acid substitution of arginine residue for the proline residue at position 158 of apoE.	1164	1281
21325775	The result of PCR associated with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis also suggested that this mutation is heterozygous.	1282	1416
21325775	It is possible that apoE Osaka mutation causes a conformational change of apoE protein and affects the interaction between abnormal apoE-containing lipoproteins and the endothelial cells of glomerular capillaries.	1417	1630
21325775	The precise mechanism of LPG related with apoE Osaka, however, remains to be elucidated.	1631	1719
21405999	Mutation screening of the GUCA1B gene in patients with autosomal dominant cone and cone rod dystrophy.	0	102
21405999	Background: Heterozygous mutations in GUCA1A (MIM # 600364) have been identified to cause autosomal dominantly inherited cone dystrophy, cone rod dystrophy and macular dystrophy.	103	281
21405999	However, the role of GUCA1B gene mutations in inherited retinal disease has been controversial.	282	377
21405999	We therefore performed a mutation analysis of the GUCA1B gene in a clinically well characterized group of patients of European and North-American geographical origin with autosomal dominantly inherited cone dystrophy and cone rod dystrophy.	378	618
21405999	Material and Methods: Twenty-four unrelated patients diagnosed with cone dystrophy or cone rod dystrophy according to standard diagnostic criteria and a family history consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance were included in the study.	619	872
21405999	Mutation analysis of all coding exons of the GUCA1B gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and subsequent DNA sequencing.	873	1032
21405999	Results: Three different sequence variants, c.-17T>C, c.171T>C, c.465G>T were identified.	1033	1122
21405999	The sequence variant c.465G>T encodes a conservative amino acid substitution, p.Glu155Asp, located in EF-hand 4, the calcium binding site of GCAP2 protein.	1123	1278
21405999	All sequence variants were previously reported in healthy subjects.	1279	1346
21405999	Conclusion: The absence of clearly pathogenic mutations in the selected patient group suggests that the GUCA1B gene is a minor cause for retinal degenerations in Europeans or North-Americans.	1347	1538
21615796	Interleukin-17F gene polymorphism in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia.	0	83
21615796	INTRODUCTION: IL-17F is a novel inflammatory cytokine and plays an important role in some autoimmune diseases.	84	194
21615796	We investigated the association between chronic ITP and the frequency of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs763780 (7488T/C), which causes a His-to-Arg substitution at amino acid 161.	195	380
21615796	PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 102 patients (men/women, 40/62; median age, 42) diagnosed with chronic ITP and 188 healthy controls (men/women, 78/110; median age, 38).	381	551
21615796	Genotyping was determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique.	552	673
21615796	RESULTS: Compared with the control group, patients with chronic ITP had a significantly lower frequency of the IL-17F 7488CC genotype (0% vs. 4.8%, P<0.05).	674	830
21615796	The number of IL-17F 7488C alleles among the patients with chronic ITP was also significantly lower than in the control group (8.7% vs. 15.2% OR=0.48, 95%CI=0.27-0.84, P=0.016).	831	1008
21615796	Furthermore, patients with the IL-17F 7488TT genotype showed a severe thrombocytopenic state (platelet count<10 10(9) /L) at diagnosis than those with the IL-17F 7488TC genotype (20.9% vs. 0%, P=0.04).	1009	1210
21615796	CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the IL-17F 7488 T allele is significantly associated with the development of chronic ITP, suggesting a role for IL-17F in the pathogenesis of chronic ITP.	1211	1405
21666969	Roles of G1359A polymorphism of the cannabinoid receptor gene (CNR1) on weight loss and adipocytokines after a hypocaloric diet.	0	128
21666969	BACKGROUND: A intragenic biallelic polymorphism (1359 G/A) of the CB1 gene resulting in the substitution of the G to A at nucleotide position 1359 in codon 435 (Thr), was reported as a common polymorphism in Caucasian populations.	129	359
21666969	Intervention studies with this polymorphism have not been realized.	360	427
21666969	OBJECTIVE: We decided to investigate the role of the polymorphism (G1359A) of CB1 receptor gene on adipocytokines response and weight loss secondary to a lifestyle modification (Mediterranean hypocaloric diet and exercise) in obese patients.	428	669
21666969	DESIGN: A population of 94 patients with obesity was analyzed.	670	732
21666969	Before and after 3 months on a hypocaloric diet, an anthropometric evaluation, an assessment of nutritional intake and a biochemical analysis were performed.	733	890
21666969	The statistical analysis was performed for the combined G1359A and A1359A as a group and wild type G1359G as second group, with a dominant model.	891	1036
21666969	Results: Forty seven patients (50%) had the genotype G1359G (wild type group) and 47 (50%) patients G1359A (41 patients, 43.6%) or A1359A (6 patients, 6.4%) (mutant type group) had the genotype.	1037	1231
21666969	In wild and mutant type groups, weight, body mass index, fat mass, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure decreased.	1232	1357
21666969	In mutant type group, resistin (4.15 1.7 ng/ml vs. 3.90 2.1 ng/ml: P < 0.05), leptin (78.4 69 ng/ml vs 66.2 32 ng/ml: P < 0.05) and IL-6 (1.40 1.9 pg/ml vs 0.81 1.5 pg/ml: P < 0.05) levels decreased after dietary treatment.	1358	1581
21666969	CONCLUSION: The novel finding of this study is the association of the mutant allele (A1359) with a decrease of resistin, leptin and interleukin-6 secondary to weight loss.	1582	1753
21682595	XRCC1 Arg399Gln gene polymorphism and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in the Polish population.	0	104
21682595	It has been shown that DNA repair is reduced in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and that the X-ray repair cross-complementing (XRCC1) Arg399Gln (rs25487) polymorphism may contribute to DNA repair.	105	318
21682595	We evaluated the frequency of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln substitution in patients with SLE (n=265) and controls (n=360) in a sample of the Polish population.	319	469
21682595	The odds ratio (OR) for SLE patients with the Gln/Gln versus Gln/Arg or Arg/Arg genotypes was 1.553 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.9573-2.520; p=0.0729).	470	624
21682595	OR for the Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg versus Arg/Arg genotype was 1.551 (95% CI=1.122-2.144, p=0.0077).	625	720
21682595	The OR for the 399 Gln allele in patients with SLE was 1.406 (95% CI=1.111-1.779, p=0.0045).	721	813
21682595	There was also a statistically significant p-value of the (2) test for the trend observed in the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism (ptrend=0.0048).	814	956
21682595	We also found a significant contribution of the Gln/Gln or Arg/Gln versus Arg/Arg genotype to the presence of either the malar rash or photosensitivity manifestations of SLE OR=2.241 (1.328-3.781, p=0.0023, pcorr=0.0414).	957	1178
21682595	Moreover, the meta-analysis of Taiwanese Han Chinese, Brazilian, and Polish populations showed that the Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg genotype and Gln allele were associated with SLE incidence.	1179	1361
21682595	OR for the Gln/Gln or Gln/Arg versus Arg/Arg genotype was 1.440 (95% CI=1.15-1.80, p=0.0019) and OR for the Gln allele was 1.27 (95% CI=1.08-1.51, p=0.0051).	1362	1519
21682595	Our studies may confirm that the XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism may increase the risk of incidence of SLE and the occurrence of some SLE manifestations.	1520	1670
21684788	Large contiguous gene deletions in Sjogren-Larsson syndrome.	0	60
21684788	Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity and mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of fatty aldehyde to fatty acid.	61	326
21684788	More than 70 mutations have been identified in SLS patients, including small deletions or insertions, missense mutations, splicing defects and complex nucleotide changes.	327	497
21684788	We now describe 2 SLS patients whose disease is caused by large contiguous gene deletions of the ALDH3A2 locus on 17p11.2.	498	620
21684788	The deletions were defined using long distance inverse PCR and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization.	621	735
21684788	A 24-year-old SLS female was homozygous for a 352-kb deletion involving ALDH3A2 and 4 contiguous genes including ALDH3A1, which codes for the major soluble protein in cornea.	736	910
21684788	Although lacking corneal disease, she showed severe symptoms of SLS with uncommon deterioration in oral motor function and loss of ambulation.	911	1053
21684788	The other 19-month-old female patient was a compound heterozygote for a 1.44-Mb contiguous gene deletion and a missense mutation (c.407C>T, P136L) in ALDH3A2.	1054	1212
21684788	These studies suggest that large gene deletions may account for up to 5% of the mutant alleles in SLS.	1213	1315
21684788	Geneticists should consider the possibility of compound heterozygosity for large deletions in patients with SLS and other inborn errors of metabolism, which has implications for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.	1316	1533
21695597	MHC region and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in African American women.	0	78
21695597	The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is a key contributor to the genetic basis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	79	221
21695597	Although SLE affects African Americans disproportionately compared to European Americans, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the MHC region in relationship to SLE in African Americans.	222	415
21695597	We conducted a screening of the MHC region for 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the deletion of the C4A gene in a SLE case-control study (380 cases, 765 age-matched controls) nested within the prospective Black Women's Health Study.	416	664
21695597	We also genotyped 1,509 ancestral informative markers throughout the genome to estimate European ancestry to control for population stratification due to population admixture.	665	840
21695597	The most strongly associated SNP with SLE was the rs9271366 (odds ratio, OR = 1.70, p = 5.6 10(-5)) near the HLA-DRB1 gene.	841	964
21695597	Conditional haplotype analysis revealed three other SNPs, rs204890 (OR = 1.86, p = 1.2 10(-4)), rs2071349 (OR = 1.53, p = 1.0 10(-3)), and rs2844580 (OR = 1.43, p = 1.3 10(-3)), to be associated with SLE independent of the rs9271366 SNP.	965	1202
21695597	In univariate analysis, the OR for the C4A deletion was 1.38, p = 0.075, but after simultaneous adjustment for the other four SNPs the odds ratio was 1.01, p = 0.98.	1203	1368
21695597	A genotype score combining the four newly identified SNPs showed an additive risk according to the number of high-risk alleles (OR = 1.67 per high-risk allele, p < 0.0001).	1369	1541
21695597	Our strongest signal, the rs9271366 SNP, was also associated with higher risk of SLE in a previous Chinese genome-wide association study (GWAS).	1542	1686
21695597	In addition, two SNPs found in a GWAS of European ancestry women were confirmed in our study, indicating that African Americans share some genetic risk factors for SLE with European and Chinese subjects.	1687	1890
21695597	In summary, we found four independent signals in the MHC region associated with risk of SLE in African American women.	1891	2009
21750150	Homozygously deleted gene DACH1 regulates tumor-initiating activity of glioma cells.	0	84
21750150	Loss or reduction in function of tumor suppressor genes contributes to tumorigenesis.	85	170
21750150	Here, by allelic DNA copy number analysis using single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping array and mass spectrometry, we report homozygous deletion in glioblastoma multiformes at chromosome 13q21, where DACH1 gene is located.	171	397
21750150	We found decreased cell proliferation of a series of glioma cell lines by forced expression of DACH1.	398	499
21750150	We then generated U87TR-Da glioma cells, where DACH1 expression could be activated by exposure of the cells to doxycycline.	500	623
21750150	Both ex vivo cellular proliferation and in vivo growth of s.c. transplanted tumors in mice are reduced in U87TR-Da cells with DACH1 expression (U87-DACH1-high), compared with DACH1-nonexpressing U87TR-Da cells (U87-DACH1-low).	624	850
21750150	U87-DACH1-low cells form spheroids with CD133 and Nestin expression in serum-free medium but U87-DACH1-high cells do not.	851	972
21750150	Compared with spheroid-forming U87-DACH1-low cells, adherent U87-DACH1-high cells display lower tumorigenicity, indicating DACH1 decreases the number of tumor-initiating cells.	973	1149
21750150	Gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveal that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2/bFGF) is transcriptionally repressed by DACH1, especially in cells cultured in serum-free medium.	1150	1357
21750150	Exogenous bFGF rescues spheroid-forming activity and tumorigenicity of the U87-DACH1-high cells, suggesting that loss of DACH1 increases the number of tumor-initiating cells through transcriptional activation of bFGF.	1358	1575
21750150	These results illustrate that DACH1 is a distinctive tumor suppressor, which does not only suppress growth of tumor cells but also regulates bFGF-mediated tumor-initiating activity of glioma cells.	1576	1773
21879313	Genotype rs8099917 near the IL28B gene and amino acid substitution at position 70 in the core region of the hepatitis C virus are determinants of serum apolipoprotein B-100 concentration in chronic hepatitis C.	0	210
21879313	The life cycle of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is closely related to host lipoprotein metabolism.	211	307
21879313	Serum levels of lipid are associated with the response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy, while single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the human interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene locus and amino acid substitutions in the core region of the HCV have been reported to affect the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy in chronic hepatitis with HCV genotype 1b infection.	308	698
21879313	The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between serum lipid and factors that are able to predict the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RB therapy, with specific focus on apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) in 148 subjects with chronic HCV G1b infection.	699	950
21879313	Our results demonstrated that both the aa 70 substitution in the core region of the HCV and the rs8099917 SNP located proximal to the IL28B were independent factors in determining serum apoB-100 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.	951	1199
21879313	A significant association was noted between higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 1.1 10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) and the subjects having Arg70.	1200	1348
21879313	A significant association was also observed between subjects carrying the rs8099917 TT responder genotype and higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 6.4 10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 4.2 10(-3)).	1349	1539
21879313	Our results suggest that apoB-100 and LDL cholesterol are markers of impaired cellular lipoprotein pathways and/or host endogenous interferon response to HCV in chronic HCV infection.	1540	1723
21879313	In particular, serum apoB-100 concentration might be an informative marker for judging changes in HCV-associated intracellular lipoprotein metabolism in patients carrying the rs8099917 responder genotype.	1724	1928
21903317	Autosomal dominant mutation in the signal peptide of renin in a kindred with anemia, hyperuricemia, and CKD.	0	108
21903317	Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in renin (REN) cause renal tubular dysgenesis, which is characterized by death in utero due to kidney failure and pulmonary hypoplasia.	109	290
21903317	The phenotype resembles the fetopathy caused by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker intake during pregnancy.	291	435
21903317	Recently, heterozygous REN mutations were shown to result in early-onset hyperuricemia, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).	436	565
21903317	To date, only 3 different heterozygous REN mutations have been published.	566	639
21903317	We report mutation analysis of the REN gene in 39 kindreds with hyperuricemia and CKD who previously tested negative for mutations in the UMOD (uromodulin) and HNF1B (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b) genes.	640	843
21903317	We identified one kindred with a novel thymidine to cytosine mutation at position 28 in the REN complementary DNA, corresponding to a tryptophan to arginine substitution at amino acid 10, which is found within the signal sequence (c.28T>C; p.W10R).	844	1092
21903317	On this basis, we conclude that REN mutations are rare events in patients with CKD.	1093	1176
21903317	Within the kindred, we found affected individuals over 4 generations who carried the novel REN mutation and were characterized by significant anemia, hyperuricemia, and CKD.	1177	1350
21903317	Anemia was severe and disproportional to the degree of decreased kidney function.	1351	1432
21903317	Because all heterozygous REN mutations that have been described are localized in the signal sequence, screening of the REN gene for patients with CKD with hyperuricemia and anemia may best be focused on sequencing of exon 1, which encodes the signal peptide.	1433	1691
21904390	Two novel mutations of the PAX6 gene causing different phenotype in a cohort of Chinese patients.	0	97
21904390	PURPOSE: Aniridia (AN) is a rare congenital panocular disorder caused by the mutations of the paired box homeotic gene 6(PAX6) gene.	98	230
21904390	The PAX6 gene is also involved in other anterior segment malformations including Peters anomaly.	231	327
21904390	We studied the PAX6 gene mutations in a cohort of affected individuals with different clinical phenotype including AN, coloboma of iris and choroid, or anterior segment malformations.	328	511
21904390	PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six unrelated families and 10 sporadic patients were examined clinically.	512	607
21904390	After informed consent was obtained, genomic DNA was extracted from the venous blood of all participants.	608	713
21904390	Mutation screening of all exons of the PAX6 gene was performed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA fragments.	714	829
21904390	Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed to detect large deletions.	830	926
21904390	RESULTS: By clinical examination, the patients and the pedigrees were divided into the following three groups: AN, coloboma of iris and choroids, and the anterior segment malformations including peters anomaly.	927	1137
21904390	Sequencing of the PAX6 gene, three intragenic mutations including a novel heterozygous splicing-site mutations c.357-3C>G (p.Ser119fsX) were identified in the patients of the AN group.	1138	1322
21904390	A novel missense mutation c.643T>C (p.S216P) was detected in the anterior segment malformation group.	1323	1424
21904390	The mutation p.S216P located in the homeodomain region of the PAX6 caused the phenotype of Peters anomaly in family A6 with different expressing.	1425	1570
21904390	Through MLPA analysis, a large deletion including the whole PAX6 gene and DKFZ p686k1684 gene was detected in one sporadic patient from the AN group.	1571	1720
21904390	Neither intragenic mutation nor large deletion was identified in the group with coloboma of iris and choroid.	1721	1830
21904390	CONCLUSION: Our findings further confirmed that different kind of mutations might cause different ocular phenotype, and clearly clinical phenotype classification might increase the mutation detection rate of the PAX6 gene.	1831	2053
21976953	Identification of a novel FBN1 gene mutation in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome.	0	86
21976953	PURPOSE: To identify the mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome (MFS).	87	199
21976953	METHODS: Patients and family members were given complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations.	200	311
21976953	Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of venous blood of six individuals in the family and 170 healthy Chinese individuals.	312	439
21976953	All of the 65 coding exons and their flanking intronic boundaries of FBN1 were amplified in the proband by polymerase chain reaction and followed by direct sequencing.	440	607
21976953	The mutation identified in the proband was screened in the other family members and the 170 healthy Chinese individuals by direct sequencing.	608	749
21976953	Protein conservation analysis was performed in six species using an online ClustalW tool.	750	839
21976953	Protein structure was modeled based on the Protein data bank and mutated in DeepView v4.0.1 to predict the functional consequences of the mutation.	840	987
21976953	RESULTS: A novel heterozygous c.3703T>C change in exon 29 of FBN1 was detected in the proband, which resulted in the substitution of serine by proline at codon 1235 (p.S1235P).	988	1164
21976953	This mutation was also present in two family members but absent in the other, unaffected family members and the 170 healthy Chinese individuals.	1165	1309
21976953	The mutant residue located in the calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like#15 domain is highly conserved among mammalian species and could probably induce conformation change of the domain.	1310	1503
21976953	CONCLUSIONS: We indentified a novel p.S1235P mutation in FBN1, which is the causative mutation for MFS in this family.	1504	1622
21976953	Our result expands the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and contributes to the study of the molecular pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome.	1623	1750
22051099	Variation in the CXCR1 gene (IL8RA) is not associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis.	0	99
22051099	BACKGROUND: The chemokine receptor 1 CXCR-1 (or IL8R-alpha) is a specific receptor for the interleukin 8 (IL-8), which is chemoattractant for neutrophils and has an important role in the inflammatory response.	100	309
22051099	The polymorphism rs2234671 at position Ex2+860G>C of the CXCR1 gene causes a conservative amino acid substitution (S276T).	310	432
22051099	This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) seemed to be functional as it was associated with decreased lung cancer risk.	433	552
22051099	Previous studies of our group found association of haplotypes in the IL8 and in the CXCR2 genes with the multifactorial disease chronic periodontitis.	553	703
22051099	In this study we investigated the polymorphism rs2234671 in 395 Brazilian subjects with and without chronic periodontitis.	704	826
22051099	FINDINGS: Similar distribution of the allelic and genotypic frequencies were observed between the groups (p>0.05).	827	941
22051099	CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism rs2234671 in the CXCR1 gene was not associated with the susceptibility to chronic periodontitis in the studied Brazilian population.	942	1104
22711886	TNFR-associated factor 2 deficiency in B lymphocytes predisposes to chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma in mice.	0	132
22711886	We have previously shown that transgenic (tg) mice expressing in B lymphocytes both BCL-2 and a TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) mutant lacking the really interesting new gene and zinc finger domains (TRAF2DN) develop small lymphocytic lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia with high incidence (Zapata et al. 2004.	133	451
22711886	Proc.	452	457
22711886	Nat.	458	462
22711886	Acad.	463	468
22711886	Sci.	469	473
22711886	USA 101: 16600-16605).	474	496
22711886	Further analysis of the expression of TRAF2 and TRAF2DN in purified B cells demonstrated that expression of both endogenous TRAF2 and tg TRAF2DN was negligible in Traf2DN-tg B cells compared with wild-type mice.	497	708
22711886	This was the result of proteasome-dependent degradation, and rendered TRAF2DN B cells as bona fide TRAF2-deficient B cells.	709	832
22711886	Similar to B cells with targeted Traf2 deletion, Traf2DN-tg mice show expanded marginal zone B cell population and have constitutive p100 NF-kappaB2 processing.	833	993
22711886	Also, TRAF3, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and Bcl-X(L) expression levels were increased, whereas cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2 levels were drastically reduced compared with those found in wild-type B cells.	994	1215
22711886	Moreover, consistent with previous results, we also show that TRAF2 was required for efficient JNK and ERK activation in response to CD40 engagement.	1216	1365
22711886	However, TRAF2 was deleterious for BCR-mediated activation of these kinases.	1366	1442
22711886	In contrast, TRAF2 deficiency had no effect on CD40-mediated p38 MAPK activation but significantly reduced BCR-mediated p38 activation.	1443	1578
22711886	Finally, we further confirm that TRAF2 was required for CD40-mediated proliferation, but its absence relieved B cells of the need for B cell activating factor for survival.	1579	1751
22711886	Altogether, our results suggest that TRAF2 deficiency cooperates with BCL-2 in promoting chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma in mice, possibly by specifically enforcing marginal zone B cell accumulation, increasing X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis expression, and rendering B cells independent of B cell activating factor for survival.	1752	2106
22808010	Defining an EPOR- regulated transcriptome for primary progenitors, including Tnfr-sf13c as a novel mediator of EPO- dependent erythroblast formation.	0	149
22808010	Certain concepts concerning EPO/EPOR action modes have been challenged by in vivo studies: Bcl-x levels are elevated in maturing erythroblasts, but not in their progenitors; truncated EPOR alleles that lack a major p85/PI3K recruitment site nonetheless promote polycythemia; and Erk1 disruption unexpectedly bolsters erythropoiesis.	150	482
22808010	To discover novel EPO/EPOR action routes, global transcriptome analyses presently are applied to interrogate EPO/EPOR effects on primary bone marrow-derived CFUe-like progenitors.	483	662
22808010	Overall, 160 EPO/EPOR target transcripts were significantly modulated 2-to 21.8-fold.	663	748
22808010	A unique set of EPO-regulated survival factors included Lyl1, Gas5, Pim3, Pim1, Bim, Trib3 and Serpina 3g.	749	855
22808010	EPO/EPOR-modulated cell cycle mediators included Cdc25a, Btg3, Cyclin-d2, p27-kip1, Cyclin-g2 and CyclinB1-IP-1.	856	968
22808010	EPO regulation of signal transduction factors was also interestingly complex.	969	1046
22808010	For example, not only Socs3 plus Socs2 but also Spred2, Spred1 and Eaf1 were EPO-induced as negative-feedback components.	1047	1168
22808010	Socs2, plus five additional targets, further proved to comprise new EPOR/Jak2/Stat5 response genes (which are important for erythropoiesis during anemia).	1169	1323
22808010	Among receptors, an atypical TNF-receptor Tnfr-sf13c was up-modulated    >5-fold by EPO.	1324	1412
22808010	Functionally, Tnfr-sf13c ligation proved to both promote proerythroblast survival, and substantially enhance erythroblast formation.	1413	1545
22808010	The EPOR therefore engages a sophisticated set of transcriptome response circuits, with Tnfr-sf13c deployed as one novel positive regulator of proerythroblast formation.	1546	1715
22836123	Late-onset scleroderma renal crisis induced by tacrolimus and prednisolone: a case report.	0	90
22836123	Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a rare complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc) but can be severe enough to require temporary or permanent renal replacement therapy.	91	258
22836123	Moderate to high dose corticosteroid use is recognized as a major risk factor for SRC.	259	345
22836123	Furthermore, there have been reports of thrombotic microangiopathy precipitated by cyclosporine in patients with SSc.	346	463
22836123	In this article, we report a patient with SRC induced by tacrolimus and corticosteroids.	464	552
22836123	The aim of this work is to call attention to the risk of tacrolimus use in patients with SSc.	553	646
22859398	Variation in IL10 and other genes involved in the immune response and in oxidation and prostate cancer recurrence.	0	114
22859398	BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association of variation in genes involved in immune response, including IL10, production and detoxification of reactive oxygen species, and repair of oxidative DNA damage with risk of recurrence after surgery for localized prostate cancer.	115	383
22859398	METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of men who had a radical prostatectomy in 1993 to 2001.	384	489
22859398	A total of 484 recurrence cases and 484 controls were matched on age, race, and pathologic stage and grade.	490	597
22859398	Germline DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded unaffected lymph nodes.	598	671
22859398	We genotyped candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in IL10, CRP, GPX1, GSR, GSTP1, hOGG1, IL1B, IL1RN, IL6, IL8, MPO, NOS2, NOS3, SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, TLR4, and TNF and tagging SNPs in IL10, CRP, GSR, IL1RN, IL6, NOS2, and NOS3.	672	907
22859398	We used conditional logistic regression to estimate OR and 95% confidence intervals (CI).	908	997
22859398	RESULTS: The minor allele (A) in IL10 rs1800872, known to produce less interleukin-10 (IL-10), was associated with a higher risk of recurrence (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.00-3.10), and the minor allele (G) in rs1800896, known to produce more IL-10, was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.91).	998	1319
22859398	We also observed associations for candidate SNPs in CRP, GSTP1, and IL1B.	1320	1393
22859398	A common IL10 haplotype and 2 common NOS2 haplotypes were associated with recurrence.	1394	1479
22859398	CONCLUSION: Variation in IL10, CRP, GSTP1, IL1B, and NOS2 was associated with prostate cancer recurrence independent of pathologic prognostic factors.	1480	1630
22859398	IMPACT: This study supports that genetic variation in immune response and oxidation influence prostate cancer recurrence risk and suggests genetic variation in these pathways may inform prognosis.	1631	1827
23069675	Critical role of neuronal pentraxin 1 in mitochondria-mediated hypoxic-ischemic neuronal injury.	0	96
23069675	Developing brain is highly susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury leading to severe neurological disabilities in surviving infants and children.	97	246
23069675	Previously, we have reported induction of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a novel neuronal protein of long-pentraxin family, following HI neuronal injury.	247	397
23069675	Here, we investigated how this specific signal is propagated to cause the HI neuronal death.	398	490
23069675	We used wild-type (WT) and NP1 knockout (NP1-KO) mouse hippocampal cultures, modeled in vitro following exposure to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), and in vivo neonatal (P9-10) mouse model of HI brain injury.	491	701
23069675	Our results show induction of NP1 in primary hippocampal neurons following OGD exposure (4-8 h) and in the ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions at 24-48 h post-HI compared to the contralateral side.	702	907
23069675	We also found increased PTEN activity concurrent with OGD time-dependent (4-8 h) dephosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and GSK-3b (Ser9).	908	1041
23069675	OGD also caused a time-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of Bad (Ser136), and Bax protein levels.	1042	1147
23069675	Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation analyses revealed increased mitochondrial translocation of Bad and Bax proteins from cytoplasm following OGD (4 h) and simultaneously increased release of Cyt C from mitochondria followed by activation of caspase-3.	1148	1421
23069675	NP1 protein was immunoprecipitated with Bad and Bax proteins; OGD caused increased interactions of NP1 with Bad and Bax, thereby, facilitating their mitochondrial translocation and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (D (m)).	1422	1659
23069675	This NP1 induction preceded the increased mitochondrial release of cytochrome C (Cyt C) into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and OGD time-dependent cell death in WT primary hippocampal neurons.	1660	1858
23069675	In contrast, in NP1-KO neurons there was no translocation of Bad and Bax from cytosol to the mitochondria, and no evidence of D (m) loss, increased Cyt C release and caspase-3 activation following OGD; which resulted in significantly reduced neuronal death.	1859	2116
23069675	Our results indicate a regulatory role of NP1 in Bad/Bax-dependent mitochondrial release of Cyt C and caspase-3 activation.	2117	2240
23069675	Together our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which NP1 regulates mitochondria-driven hippocampal cell death; suggesting NP1 as a potential therapeutic target against HI brain injury in neonates.	2241	2445
23285048	Context- and cell-dependent effects of Delta-like 4 targeting in the bone marrow microenvironment.	0	98
23285048	Delta-like 4 (Dll4) is a ligand of the Notch pathway family which has been widely studied in the context of tumor angiogenesis, its blockade shown to result in non-productive angiogenesis and halted tumor growth.	99	311
23285048	As Dll4 inhibitors enter the clinic, there is an emerging need to understand their side effects, namely the systemic consequences of Dll4:Notch blockade in tissues other than tumors.	312	494
23285048	The present study focused on the effects of systemic anti-Dll4 targeting in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment.	495	609
23285048	Here we show that Dll4 blockade with monoclonal antibodies perturbs the BM vascular niche of sub-lethally irradiated mice, resulting in increased CD31(+), VE-Cadherin(+) and c-kit(+) vessel density, and also increased megakaryocytes, whereas CD105(+), VEGFR3(+), SMA(+) and lectin(+) vessel density remained unaltered.	610	928
23285048	We investigated also the expression of angiocrine genes upon Dll4 treatment in vivo, and demonstrate that IGFbp2, IGFbp3, Angpt2, Dll4, DHH and VEGF-A are upregulated, while FGF1 and CSF2 are reduced.	929	1129
23285048	In vitro treatment of endothelial cells with anti-Dll4 reduced Akt phosphorylation while maintaining similar levels of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation.	1130	1273
23285048	Besides its effects in the BM vascular niche, anti-Dll4 treatment perturbed hematopoiesis, as evidenced by increased myeloid (CD11b(+)), decreased B (B220(+)) and T (CD3(+)) lymphoid BM content of treated mice, with a corresponding increase in myeloid circulating cells.	1274	1544
23285048	Moreover, anti-Dll4 treatment also increased the number of CFU-M and -G colonies in methylcellulose assays, independently of Notch1.	1545	1677
23285048	Finally, anti-Dll4 treatment of donor BM improved the hematopoietic recovery of lethally irradiated recipients in a transplant setting.	1678	1813
23285048	Together, our data reveals the hematopoietic (BM) effects of systemic anti-Dll4 treatment result from qualitative vascular changes and also direct hematopoietic cell modulation, which may be favorable in a transplant setting.	1814	2039
23791840	Superoxide dismutase 1 overexpression in mice abolishes maternal diabetes-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in diabetic embryopathy.	0	135
23791840	OBJECTIVE: Both oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) are causal events in diabetic embryopathy.	136	256
23791840	We tested whether oxidative stress causes ER stress.	257	309
23791840	STUDY DESIGN: Wild-type (WT) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-overexpressing day 8.75 embryos from nondiabetic WT control with SOD1 transgenic male and diabetic WT female with SOD1 transgenic male were analyzed for ER stress markers: C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), calnexin, eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase (PERK), binding immunoglobulin protein, protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, kinases inositol-requiring protein-1a (IRE1a), and the X-box binding protein (XBP1) messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing.	310	883
23791840	RESULTS: Maternal diabetes significantly increased the levels of CHOP, calnexin, phosphorylated (p)-eIF2a, p-PERK, and p-IRE1a; triggered XBP1 mRNA splicing; and enhanced ER chaperone gene expression in WT embryos.	884	1098
23791840	SOD1 overexpression blocked these diabetes-induced ER stress markers.	1099	1168
23791840	CONCLUSION: Mitigating oxidative stress via SOD1 overexpression blocks maternal diabetes-induced ER stress in vivo.	1169	1284
23864035	Bortezomib and dexamethasone as salvage therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: analysis of long-term clinical outcomes.	0	143
23864035	Bortezomib (bort)-dexamethasone (dex) is an effective therapy for relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM).	144	258
23864035	This retrospective study investigated the combination of bort (1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks) and dex (20 mg on the day of and the day after bort) as salvage treatment in 85 patients with R/R MM after prior autologous stem cell transplantation or conventional chemotherapy.	259	552
23864035	The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2.	553	603
23864035	Eighty-seven percent of the patients had received immunomodulatory drugs included in some line of therapy before bort-dex.	604	726
23864035	The median number of bort-dex cycles was 6, up to a maximum of 12 cycles.	727	800
23864035	On an intention-to-treat basis, 55 % of the patients achieved at least partial response, including 19 % CR and 35 % achieved at least very good partial response.	801	962
23864035	Median durations of response, time to next therapy and treatment-free interval were 8, 11.2, and 5.1 months, respectively.	963	1085
23864035	The most relevant adverse event was peripheral neuropathy, which occurred in 78 % of the patients (grade II, 38 %; grade III, 21 %) and led to treatment discontinuation in 6 %.	1086	1262
23864035	With a median follow up of 22 months, median time to progression, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 8.9, 8.7, and 22 months, respectively.	1263	1430
23864035	Prolonged PFS and OS were observed in patients achieving CR and receiving bort-dex a single line of prior therapy.	1431	1545
23864035	Bort-dex was an effective salvage treatment for MM patients, particularly for those in first relapse.	1546	1647
23949582	The cytogenetic action of ifosfamide, mesna, and their combination on peripheral rabbit lymphocytes: an in vivo/in vitro cytogenetic study.	0	139
23949582	Ifosfamide (IFO) is an alkylating nitrogen mustard, administrated as an antineoplasmic agent.	140	233
23949582	It is characterized by its intense urotoxic action, leading to hemorrhagic cystitis.	234	318
23949582	This side effect of IFO raises the requirement for the co-administration with sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (Mesna) aiming to avoid or minimize this effect.	319	478
23949582	IFO and Mesna were administrated separately on rabbit's lymphocytes in vivo, which were later developed in vitro.	479	592
23949582	Cytogenetic markers for sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), proliferation rate index (PRI) and Mitotic Index were recorded.	593	715
23949582	Mesna's action, in conjunction with IFO reduces the frequency of SCEs, in comparison with the SCEs recordings obtained when IFO is administered alone.	716	866
23949582	In addition to this, when high concentrations of Mesna were administered alone significant reductions of the PRI were noted, than with IFO acting at the same concentration on the lymphocytes.	867	1058
23949582	Mesna significantly reduces IFO's genotoxicity, while when administered in high concentrations it acts in an inhibitory fashion on the cytostatic action of the drug.	1059	1224
23952588	Risk factors and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysians with Parkinson's disease.	0	113
23952588	Chronic pulsatile levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia.	114	240
23952588	We studied the prevalence and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysian patients with PD.	241	358
23952588	METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 95 patients with PD on uninterrupted levodopa therapy for at least 6 months.	359	486
23952588	The instrument used was the UPDRS questionnaires.	487	536
23952588	The predictors of dyskinesia were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.	537	630
23952588	RESULTS: The mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years.	631	674
23952588	The mean onset age was 58.5 + 9.8 years.	675	715
23952588	The median disease duration was 6 (7) years.	716	760
23952588	Dyskinesia was present in 44% (n = 42) with median levodopa therapy of 3 years.	761	840
23952588	There were 64.3% Chinese, 31% Malays, and 3.7% Indians and other ethnic groups.	841	920
23952588	Eighty-one percent of patients with dyskinesia had clinical fluctuations.	921	994
23952588	Patients with dyskinesia had lower onset age ( p < 0.001), longer duration of levodopa therapy ( p < 0.001), longer disease duration ( p < 0.001), higher total daily levodopa dose ( p < 0.001), and higher total UPDRS scores ( p = 0.005) than patients without dyskinesia.	995	1265
23952588	The three significant predictors of dyskinesia were duration of levodopa therapy, onset age, and total daily levodopa dose.	1266	1389
23952588	CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in our patients was 44%.	1390	1473
23952588	The most significant predictors were duration of levodopa therapy, total daily levodopa dose, and onset age.	1474	1582
24014394	A homozygous mutation in LYRM7/MZM1L associated with early onset encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and severe reduction of mitochondrial complex III activity.	0	157
24014394	Mutations in nuclear genes associated with defective complex III (cIII) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are rare, having been found in only two cIII assembly factors and, as private changes in single families, three cIII structural subunits.	158	406
24014394	Recently, human LYRM7/MZM1L, the ortholog of yeast MZM1, has been identified as a new assembly factor for cIII.	407	518
24014394	In a baby patient with early onset, severe encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and profound, isolated cIII deficiency in skeletal muscle, we identified a disease-segregating homozygous mutation (c.73G>A) in LYRM7/MZM1L, predicting a drastic change in a highly conserved amino-acid residue (p.Asp25Asn).	519	817
24014394	In a mzm1D yeast strain, the expression of a mzm1(D25N) mutant allele caused temperature-sensitive respiratory growth defect, decreased oxygen consumption, impaired maturation/stabilization of the Rieske Fe-S protein, and reduced complex III activity and amount.	818	1080
24014394	LYRM7/MZM1L is a novel disease gene, causing cIII-defective, early onset, severe mitochondrial encephalopathy.	1081	1191
24036311	CTR9/PAF1c regulates molecular lineage identity, histone H3K36 trimethylation and genomic imprinting during preimplantation development.	0	136
24036311	Genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming is required for successful preimplantation development.	137	229
24036311	Inappropriate or deficient chromatin regulation can result in defective lineage specification and loss of genomic imprinting, compromising normal development.	230	388
24036311	Here we report that two members of the RNA polymerase II associated factor, homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) complex (PAF1 complex) components, Ctr9 and Rtf1, are required during mammalian preimplantation development.	389	608
24036311	We demonstrate that Ctr9-deficient embryos fail to correctly specify lineages at the blastocyst stage.	609	711
24036311	Expression of some lineage specific factors is markedly reduced in Ctr9 knockdown embryos, including Eomes, Elf5 and Sox2, while others are inappropriately expressed (Oct4, Nanog, Gata6, Fgf4 and Sox17).	712	915
24036311	We also show that several imprinted genes (Mest, Peg3, Snrpn and Meg3) are aberrantly expressed although allele specific DNA methylation is not altered.	916	1068
24036311	We document a loss of histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) in Ctr9-deficient embryos and confirm that knockdown of either Setd2 or Rtf1 results in similar phenotypes.	1069	1245
24036311	These findings show that the PAF1 complex is required for mammalian development, likely through regulation of H3K36me3, and indicate functional conservation of the PAF1 complex from yeast to mammals in vivo.	1246	1453
24055495	Long-term oral galactose treatment prevents cognitive deficits in male Wistar rats treated intracerebroventricularly with streptozotocin.	0	137
24055495	Basic and clinical research has demonstrated that dementia of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) type is associated with dysfunction of the insulin-receptor (IR) system followed by decreased glucose transport via glucose transporter GLUT4 and decreased glucose metabolism in brain cells.	138	425
24055495	An alternative source of energy is d-galactose (the C-4-epimer of d-glucose) which is transported into the brain by insulin-independent GLUT3 transporter where it might be metabolized to glucose via the Leloir pathway.	426	644
24055495	Exclusively parenteral daily injections of galactose induce memory deterioration in rodents and are used to generate animal aging model, but the effects of oral galactose treatment on cognitive functions have never been tested.	645	872
24055495	We have investigated the effects of continuous daily oral galactose (200 mg/kg/day) treatment on cognitive deficits in streptozotocin-induced (STZ-icv) rat model of sAD, tested by Morris Water Maze and Passive Avoidance test, respectively.	873	1112
24055495	One month of oral galactose treatment initiated immediately after the STZ-icv administration, successfully prevented development of the STZ-icv-induced cognitive deficits.	1113	1284
24055495	Beneficial effect of oral galactose was independent of the rat age and of the galactose dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg/kg/day.	1285	1412
24055495	Additionally, oral galactose administration led to the appearance of galactose in the blood.	1413	1505
24055495	The increase of galactose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was several times lower after oral than after parenteral administration of the same galactose dose.	1506	1672
24055495	Oral galactose exposure might have beneficial effects on learning and memory ability and could be worth investigating for improvement of cognitive deficits associated with glucose hypometabolism in AD.	1673	1874
24100257	Takotsubo syndrome (or apical ballooning syndrome) secondary to Zolmitriptan.	0	77
24100257	Takotsubo syndrome (TS), also known as broken heart syndrome, is characterized by left ventricle apical ballooning with elevated cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ie, ST-segment elevation, T wave inversions, and pathologic Q waves).	78	370
24100257	We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and positive troponin I.	371	650
24100257	Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS.	651	822
24100257	Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when she had migraines.	823	947
24100257	But before this event, she was taking zolmitriptan 2-3 times daily for several days because of a persistent migraine headache.	948	1074
24100257	She otherwise reported that she is quite active, rides horses, and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity.	1075	1209
24100257	There was no evidence of any recent stress or status migrainosus.	1210	1275
24100257	Extensive literature search revealed multiple cases of coronary artery vasospasm secondary to zolmitriptan, but none of the cases were associated with TS.	1276	1430
24309294	Cholecystokinin-octapeptide restored morphine-induced hippocampal long-term potentiation impairment in rats.	0	108
24309294	Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8), which is a typical brain-gut peptide, exerts a wide range of biological activities on the central nervous system.	109	259
24309294	We have previously reported that CCK-8 significantly alleviated morphine-induced amnesia and reversed spine density decreases in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in morphine-treated animals.	260	451
24309294	Here, we investigated the effects of CCK-8 on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lateral perforant path (LPP)-granule cell synapse of rat dentate gyrus (DG) in acute saline or morphine-treated rats.	452	651
24309294	Population spikes (PS), which were evoked by stimulation of the LPP, were recorded in the DG region.	652	752
24309294	Acute morphine (30mg/kg, s.c.) treatment significantly attenuated hippocampal LTP and CCK-8 (1ug, i.c.v.) restored the amplitude of PS that was attenuated by morphine injection.	753	930
24309294	Furthermore, microinjection of CCK-8 (0.1 and 1ug, i.c.v.) also significantly augmented hippocampal LTP in saline-treated (1ml/kg, s.c.) rats.	931	1073
24309294	Pre-treatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 (10ug, i.c.v) reversed the effects of CCK-8, but the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718 (10ug, i.c.v) did not.	1074	1240
24309294	The present results demonstrate that CCK-8 attenuates the effect of morphine on hippocampal LTP through CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of CCK-8 on morphine-induced memory impairment.	1241	1444
24442316	Cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis protects liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in acute liver injured mice.	0	109
24442316	Cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis (CMCS) was widely used for a variety of diseases including liver injury, the current study aims to investigate the protective effects of CMCS on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in acute injury liver and related action mechanisms.	110	387
24442316	The mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (D-GalN).	388	488
24442316	39 male BABL/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: normal control, model control, CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment groups.	489	636
24442316	The Serum liver function parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were assayed with the commercial kit.	637	795
24442316	The inflammation and scaffold structure in liver were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and silver staining respectively.	796	918
24442316	The LSECs and sub-endothelial basement membrane were observed with the scanning and transmission electronic microscope.	919	1038
24442316	The protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in liver were analyzed with Western blotting.	1039	1201
24442316	Expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) was investigated with immunofluorescence staining.	1202	1294
24442316	The lipid peroxidation indicators including antisuperoxideanion (ASAFR), hydroxyl free radical (.OH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were determined with kits, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2/9) activities in liver were analyzed with gelatin zymography and in situ fluorescent zymography respectively.	1295	1657
24442316	The model mice had much higher serum levels of ALT and AST than the normal mice.	1658	1738
24442316	Compared to that in the normal control, more severe liver inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis, worse hepatic lipid peroxidation demonstrated by the increased ASAFR, .OH and MDA, but decreased SOD and GST, increased MMP-2/9 activities and VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and vWF expressions, which revealed obvious LSEC injury and scaffold structure broken, were shown in the model control.	1739	2113
24442316	Compared with the model group, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly improved serum ALT/AST, attenuated hepatic inflammation and improved peroxidative injury in liver, decreased MMP-2/9 activities in liver tissue, improved integration of scaffold structure, and decreased protein expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.	2114	2431
24442316	CMCS could protect LSECs from injury and maintain the microvasculature integration in acute injured liver of mice induced by LPS/D-GalN.	2432	2568
24442316	Its action mechanism was associated with the down-regulation of MMP-2/9 activities and inhibition of peroxidation in injured liver.	2569	2700
24477591	The -930A>G polymorphism of the CYBA gene is associated with premature coronary artery disease.	0	95
24477591	A case-control study and gene-risk factors interactions.	96	152
24477591	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD).	153	269
24477591	NADPH oxidases are the main source of ROS in the vasculature.	270	331
24477591	p22phox is a critical component of vascular NADPH oxidases and is encoded by the CYBA (cytochrome b245 alpha) gene.	332	447
24477591	The -930A>G CYBA polymorphism (rs9932581:A>G) modulates the activity of the CYBA promoter, and influences CYBA transcriptional activity.	448	584
24477591	The aim of the present study was to analyze a possible association between the -930A>G polymorphism and CAD and to search for gene-traditional risk factors interactions.	585	754
24477591	480 subjects were studied: 240 patients with premature CAD, 240 age and sex matched blood donors.	755	852
24477591	The -930A>G polymorphism was genotyped using the TaqMan - Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems).	853	966
24477591	The -930G allele carrier state was a risk factor for CAD (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.21-3.44, P=0.007).	967	1061
24477591	A synergistic effect of the -930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI --25) and cigarette smoking was found.	1062	1170
24477591	The estimated CAD risk for BMI --25 and the -930G allele interaction was about 160% greater than that predicted by assuming additivity of the effects, and about 40% greater for interaction of cigarette smoking and the -930G allele.	1171	1402
24477591	Overweight/obesity was a risk factor for CAD only in the -930G allele carriers (P<10(-10)) but not in the AA homozygotes (P=1.00).	1403	1533
24477591	In conclusion the -930A>G CYBA polymorphism is associated with CAD in the Polish population.	1534	1626
24477591	The -930G allele carriers are particularly at risk of consequences of obesity and tobacco smoke exposure.	1627	1732
24587916	Antioxidant effects of bovine lactoferrin on dexamethasone-induced hypertension in rat.	0	87
24587916	Dexamethasone- (Dex-) induced hypertension is associated with enhanced oxidative stress.	88	176
24587916	Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein with antihypertensive properties.	177	259
24587916	In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic administration of LF on oxidative stress and hypertension upon Dex administration.	260	395
24587916	Male Wistar rats were treated by Dex (30  u g/kg/day subcutaneously) or saline for 14 days.	396	487
24587916	Oral bovine LF (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) was given from day 8 to 14 in a reversal study.	488	571
24587916	In a prevention study, rats received 4 days of LF treatment followed by Dex and continued during the test period.	572	685
24587916	Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using tail-cuff method.	686	752
24587916	Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity.	753	815
24587916	Plasma hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value were determined.	816	929
24587916	Dexamethasone significantly increased SBP and plasma H2O2 level and decreased thymus and body weights.	930	1032
24587916	LF lowered (P < 0.01) and dose dependently prevented (P < 0.001) Dex-induced hypertension.	1033	1123
24587916	LF prevented body weight loss and significantly reduced the elevated plasma H2O2 and increased FRAP values.	1124	1231
24587916	Chronic administration of LF strongly reduced the blood pressure and production of ROS and improved antioxidant capacity in Dex-induced hypertension, suggesting the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another mechanism of antihypertensive action of LF.	1232	1490
24588023	The association between tranexamic acid and convulsive seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariate analysis in 11 529 patients.	0	130
24588023	Because of a lack of contemporary data regarding seizures after cardiac surgery, we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11 529 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used from January 2004 to December 2010.	131	378
24588023	A convulsive seizure was defined as a transient episode of disturbed brain function characterised by abnormal involuntary motor movements.	379	517
24588023	Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative seizures.	518	626
24588023	A total of 100 (0.9%) patients developed postoperative convulsive seizures.	627	702
24588023	Generalised and focal seizures were identified in 68 and 32 patients, respectively.	703	786
24588023	The median (IQR [range]) time after surgery when the seizure occurred was 7 (6-12 [1-216]) h and 8 (6-11 [4-18]) h, respectively.	787	916
24588023	Epileptiform findings on electroencephalography were seen in 19 patients.	917	990
24588023	Independent predictors of postoperative seizures included age, female sex, redo cardiac surgery, calcification of ascending aorta, congestive heart failure, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, duration of aortic cross-clamp and tranexamic acid.	991	1236
24588023	When tested in a multivariate regression analysis, tranexamic acid was a strong independent predictor of seizures (OR 14.3, 95% CI 5.5-36.7; p < 0.001).	1237	1389
24588023	Patients with convulsive seizures had 2.5 times higher in-hospital mortality rates and twice the length of hospital stay compared with patients without convulsive seizures.	1390	1562
24588023	Mean (IQR [range]) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 115 (49-228 [32-481]) h in patients with convulsive seizures compared with 26 (22-69 [14-1080]) h in patients without seizures (p < 0.001).	1563	1767
24588023	Convulsive seizures are a serious postoperative complication after cardiac surgery.	1768	1851
24588023	As tranexamic acid is the only modifiable factor, its administration, particularly in doses exceeding 80 mg.kg(-1), should be weighed against the risk of postoperative seizures.	1852	2029
24623966	Endothelial NADPH oxidase 4 mediates vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-induced intravitreal neovascularization in a rat model of retinopathy of prematurity.	0	168
24623966	PURPOSE: NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in angiogenesis.	169	263
24623966	Isoforms of NADPH oxidase NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 are reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (ECs).	264	367
24623966	Of these, NOX1 and NOX2 have been reported to contribute to intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) models.	368	510
24623966	In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the isoform NOX4 in ECs contributed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis and IVNV.	511	667
24623966	METHODS: Isoforms of NADPH oxidase MRNA were measured in several types of cultured vascular ecs: human retinal microvascular ECs (hRMVECs), choroidal ECs (CECs), and human umbilical vascular ECs (HUVECs) using real-time PCR.	668	892
24623966	Newborn rat pups and dams were placed into an OIR model that cycled oxygen concentration between 50% and 10% every 24 h for 14 days, and then were placed in room air (RA) for an additional 4 days (rat OIR model).	893	1105
24623966	NOX4 expression in retinal lysates from the RA-raised pups at postnatal day 0 (P0), P14, and P18 was determined with western blots.	1106	1237
24623966	STAT3 activation was determined as the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 to total STAT3 with western blot analysis of retinal lysates from pups raised in RA or from the rat OIR model at P18.	1238	1424
24623966	Semiquantitative assessment of the density of NOX4 colabeling with lectin-stained retinal ECs was determined by immunolabeling of retinal cryosections from P18 pups in OIR or in RA.	1425	1606
24623966	In hRMVECs transfected with NOX4 siRNA and treated with VEGF or control, 1) ROS generation was measured using the 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester fluorescence assay and 2) phosphorylated VEGF receptor 2 and STAT3, and total VEGFR2 and STAT3 were measured in western blot analyses.	1607	1935
24623966	VEGF-stimulated hRMVEC proliferation was measured following transfection with NOX4 siRNA or STAT3 siRNA, or respective controls.	1936	2064
24623966	RESULTS: NOX4 was the most prevalent isoform of NADPH oxidase in vascular ECs.	2065	2143
24623966	NOX4 expression in retinal lysates was significantly decreased during development in RA.	2144	2232
24623966	Compared to RA, the expression of retinal NOX4 increased at P18.	2233	2297
24623966	At p18 OIR, semiquantitative assessment of the density of lectin and NOX4 colabeling in retinal vascular ECs was greater in retinal cryosections and activated STAT3 was greater in retinal lysates when compared to the RA-raised pups.	2298	2530
24623966	In cultured hRMVECs, knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection inhibited VEGF-induced ROS generation.	2531	2630
24623966	VEGF induced a physical interaction of phosphorylated-VEGFR2 and NOX4.	2631	2701
24623966	Knockdown of NOX4: 1) reduced VEGFR2 activation but did not abolish it and 2) abolished STAT3 activation in response to VEGF.	2702	2827
24623966	Knockdown of either NOX4 or STAT3 inhibited VEGF-induced EC proliferation.	2828	2902
24623966	CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in a model representative of human retinopathy of prematurity, NOX4 was increased at a time point when IVNV developed.	2903	3056
24623966	VEGF-activated NOX4 led to an interaction between VEGF-activated VEGFR2 and NOX4 that mediated EC proliferation via activation of STAT3.	3057	3193
24623966	Altogether, our results suggest that NOX4 may regulate VEGFR2-mediated IVNV through activated STAT3.	3194	3294
24632946	Disruption of the temporally regulated cloaca endodermal b-catenin signaling causes anorectal malformations.	0	108
24632946	The cloaca is temporally formed and eventually divided by the urorectal septum (URS) during urogenital and anorectal organ development.	109	244
24632946	Although congenital malformations, such as anorectal malformations (ARMs), are frequently observed during this process, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear.	245	417
24632946	b-Catenin is a critical component of canonical Wnt signaling and is essential for the regulation of cell differentiation and morphogenesis during embryogenesis.	418	578
24632946	The expression of b-catenin is observed in endodermal epithelia, including URS epithelia.	579	668
24632946	We modulated the b-catenin gene conditionally in endodermal epithelia by utilizing tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver line (Shh(CreERT2)).	669	803
24632946	Both b-catenin loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF) mutants displayed abnormal clefts in the perineal region and hypoplastic elongation of the URS.	804	955
24632946	The mutants also displayed reduced cell proliferation in the URS mesenchyme.	956	1032
24632946	In addition, the b-catenin GOF mutants displayed reduced apoptosis and subsequently increased apoptosis in the URS epithelium.	1033	1159
24632946	This instability possibly resulted in reduced expression levels of differentiation markers, such as keratin 1 and filaggrin, in the perineal epithelia.	1160	1311
24632946	The expression of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) genes, such as Bmp4 and Bmp7, was also ectopically induced in the epithelia of the URS in the b-catenin GOF mutants.	1312	1479
24632946	The expression of the Msx2 gene and phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8, possible readouts of Bmp signaling, was also increased in the mutants.	1480	1612
24632946	Moreover, we introduced an additional mutation for a Bmp receptor gene: BmprIA.	1613	1692
24632946	The Shh(CreERT2/+); b-catenin(flox(ex3)/+); BmprIA(flox/-) mutants displayed partial restoration of URS elongation compared with the b-catenin GOF mutants.	1693	1848
24632946	These results indicate that some ARM phenotypes in the b-catenin GOF mutants were caused by abnormal Bmp signaling.	1849	1964
24632946	The current analysis revealed the close relation of endodermal b-catenin signaling to the ARM phenotypes.	1965	2070
24632946	These results are considered to shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of human ARMs.	2071	2157
24671324	Necrotising fasciitis after bortezomib and dexamethasone-containing regimen in an elderly patient of Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia.	0	132
24671324	Bortezomib and high-dose dexamethasone-containing regimens are considered to be generally tolerable with few severe bacterial infections in patients with B-cell malignancies.	133	307
24671324	However, information is limited concerning the safety of the regimen in elderly patients.	308	397
24671324	We report a case of a 76-year-old man with Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia who suffered necrotising fasciitis without neutropenia after the combination treatment with bortezomib, high-dose dexamethasone and rituximab.	398	614
24671324	Despite immediate intravenous antimicrobial therapy, he succumbed 23 h after the onset.	615	702
24671324	Physicians should recognise the possibility of fatal bacterial infections related to bortezomib plus high-dose dexamethasone in elderly patients, and we believe this case warrants further investigation.	703	905
24709919	Effects of ginsenosides on opioid-induced hyperalgesia in mice.	0	63
24709919	Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is characterized by nociceptive sensitization caused by the cessation of chronic opioid use.	64	190
24709919	OIH can limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics and complicate withdrawal from opioid addiction.	191	291
24709919	In this study, we investigated the effects of Re, Rg1, and Rb1 ginsenosides, the bioactive components of ginseng, on OIH.	292	413
24709919	OIH was achieved in mice after subcutaneous administration of morphine for 7 consecutive days three times per day.	414	528
24709919	During withdrawal (days 8 and 9), these mice were administered Re, Rg1, or Rb1 intragastrically two times per day.	529	643
24709919	On the test day (day 10), mice were subjected to the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid-induced writhing test.	644	764
24709919	Re (300 mg/kg) inhibited OIH in both the thermal sensitivity test and the acetic acid-induced writhing test.	765	873
24709919	However, the Rg1 and Rb1 ginsenosides failed to prevent OIH in either test.	874	949
24709919	Furthermore, Rg1 showed a tendency to aggravate OIH in the acetic acid-induced writhing test.	950	1043
24709919	Our data suggested that the ginsenoside Re, but not Rg1 or Rb1, may contribute toward reversal of OIH.	1044	1146
24742750	Availability of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in assessment of drug potential for QT prolongation.	0	127
24742750	Field potential duration (FPD) in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs), which can express QT interval in an electrocardiogram, is reported to be a useful tool to predict K(+) channel and Ca(2+) channel blocker effects on QT interval.	128	394
24742750	However, there is no report showing that this technique can be used to predict multichannel blocker potential for QT prolongation.	395	525
24742750	The aim of this study is to show that FPD from MEA (Multielectrode array) of hiPS-CMs can detect QT prolongation induced by multichannel blockers.	526	672
24742750	hiPS-CMs were seeded onto MEA and FPD was measured for 2min every 10min for 30min after drug exposure for the vehicle and each drug concentration.	673	819
24742750	IKr and IKs blockers concentration-dependently prolonged corrected FPD (FPDc), whereas Ca(2+) channel blockers concentration-dependently shortened FPDc.	820	972
24742750	Also, the multichannel blockers Amiodarone, Paroxetine, Terfenadine and Citalopram prolonged FPDc in a concentration dependent manner.	973	1107
24742750	Finally, the IKr blockers, Terfenadine and Citalopram, which are reported to cause Torsade de Pointes (TdP) in clinical practice, produced early afterdepolarization (EAD).	1108	1279
24742750	hiPS-CMs using MEA system and FPDc can predict the effects of drug candidates on QT interval.	1280	1373
24742750	This study also shows that this assay can help detect EAD for drugs with TdP potential.	1374	1461
24743235	IL-3 and CSF-1 interact to promote generation of CD11c+ IL-10-producing macrophages.	0	84
24743235	Unraveling the mechanisms of hematopoiesis regulated by multiple cytokines remains a challenge in hematology.	85	194
24743235	IL-3 is an allergic cytokine with the multilineage potential, while CSF-1 is produced in the steady state with restricted lineage coverage.	195	334
24743235	Here, we uncovered an instructive role of CSF-1 in IL-3-mediated hematopoiesis.	335	414
24743235	CSF-1 significantly promoted IL-3-driven CD11c+ cell expansion and dampened basophil and mast cell generation from C57BL/6 bone marrow.	415	550
24743235	Further studies indicated that the CSF-1/CSF-1R axis contributed significantly to IL-3-induced CD11c+ cell generation through enhancing c-Fos-associated monopoiesis.	551	716
24743235	CD11c+ cells induced by IL-3 or IL-3/CSF-1 were competent in cellular maturation and endocytosis.	717	814
24743235	Both IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 cells lacked classical dendritic cell appearance and resembled macrophages in morphology.	815	929
24743235	Both populations produced a high level of IL-10, in addition to IL-1, IL-6 and TNFa, in response to LPS, and were relatively poor T cell stimulators.	930	1079
24743235	Collectively, these findings reveal a role for CSF-1 in mediating the IL-3 hematopoietic pathway through monopoiesis, which regulates expansion of CD11c+ macrophages.	1080	1246
24840785	Aconitine-induced Ca2+ overload causes arrhythmia and triggers apoptosis through p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats.	0	116
24840785	Aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants.	117	223
24840785	Emerging evidence indicates that voltage-dependent Na(+) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine.	224	344
24840785	However, no reports are available on the role of Ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning.	345	424
24840785	In this study, we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo.	425	544
24840785	We found that Ca(2+) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats.	545	698
24840785	To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats.	699	962
24840785	The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose-dependently.	963	1072
24840785	To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay.	1073	1290
24840785	The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time-dependently.	1291	1363
24840785	The expression analysis of Ca(2+) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2+) overload through the expression regulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins.	1364	1531
24840785	The expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression was downregulated.	1532	1712
24840785	Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, especially the P-P38/P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues.	1713	1836
24840785	Hence, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca(2+) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.	1837	2045
24842192	Chronic treatment with metformin suppresses toll-like receptor 4 signaling and attenuates left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction.	0	151
24842192	Acute treatment with metformin has a protective effect in myocardial infarction by suppression of inflammatory responses due to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).	152	330
24842192	In the present study, the effect of chronic pre-treatment with metformin on cardiac dysfunction and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activities following myocardial infarction and their relation with AMPK were assessed.	331	545
24842192	Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (n=6): normal control and groups were injected isoproterenol after chronic pre-treatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100mg/kg of metformin twice daily for 14 days.	546	759
24842192	Isoproterenol (100mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously on the 13th and 14th days to induce acute myocardial infarction.	760	877
24842192	Isoproterenol alone decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility indexed as LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin.	878	1009
24842192	The left ventricular dysfunction was significantly lower in the groups treated with 25 and 50mg/kg of metformin.	1010	1122
24842192	Metfromin markedly lowered isoproterenol-induced elevation in the levels of TLR4 mRNA, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the heart tissues.	1123	1337
24842192	Similar changes were also seen in the serum levels of TNF-a and IL-6.	1338	1407
24842192	However, the lower doses of 25 and 50mg/kg were more effective than 100mg/kg.	1408	1485
24842192	Phosphorylated AMPKa (p-AMPK) in the myocardium was significantly elevated by 25mg/kg of metformin, slightly by 50mg/kg, but not by 100mg/kg.	1486	1627
24842192	Chronic pre-treatment with metformin reduces post-myocardial infarction cardiac dysfunction and suppresses inflammatory responses, possibly through inhibition of TLR4 activities.	1628	1806
24842192	This mechanism can be considered as a target to protect infarcted myocardium.	1807	1884
24911645	Behavioral and neurochemical studies in mice pretreated with garcinielliptone FC in pilocarpine-induced seizures.	0	113
24911645	Garcinielliptone FC (GFC) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species Platonia insignis Mart.	114	218
24911645	It is widely used in folk medicine to treat skin diseases in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat diarrheas and inflammatory diseases.	219	393
24911645	However, there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents.	394	480
24911645	The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid (r-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine, aspartate and glutathione) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures.	481	819
24911645	GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure, at doses 25mg/kg (20.12 + 2.20 min), 50mg/kg (20.95 + 2.21 min) or 75 mg/kg (23.43 + 1.99 min) when compared with seized mice.	820	998
24911645	In addition, GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46.90% when compared with seized mice.	999	1134
24911645	In aspartate, glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5.21%, 13.55% and 21.80%, respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice.	1135	1322
24911645	Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity (63.30%) when compared with seized mice.	1323	1445
24911645	The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals.	1446	1692
24911645	In conclusion, our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus.	1693	1917
24911645	This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent.	1918	2029
24914936	Thyroid hormone receptor a mutation causes a severe and thyroxine-resistant skeletal dysplasia in female mice.	0	110
24914936	A new genetic disorder has been identified that results from mutation of THRA, encoding thyroid hormone receptor a1 (TRa1).	111	234
24914936	Affected children have a high serum T3:T4 ratio and variable degrees of intellectual deficit and constipation but exhibit a consistently severe skeletal dysplasia.	235	398
24914936	In an attempt to improve developmental delay and alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism, patients are receiving varying doses and durations of T4 treatment, but responses have been inconsistent so far.	399	598
24914936	Thra1(PV/+) mice express a similar potent dominant-negative mutant TRa1 to affected individuals, and thus represent an excellent disease model.	599	742
24914936	We hypothesized that Thra1(PV/+) mice could be used to predict the skeletal outcome of human THRA mutations and determine whether prolonged treatment with a supraphysiological dose of T4 ameliorates the skeletal abnormalities.	743	969
24914936	Adult female Thra1(PV/+) mice had short stature, grossly abnormal bone morphology but normal bone strength despite high bone mass.	970	1100
24914936	Although T4 treatment suppressed TSH secretion, it had no effect on skeletal maturation, linear growth, or bone mineralization, thus demonstrating profound tissue resistance to thyroid hormone.	1101	1294
24914936	Despite this, prolonged T4 treatment abnormally increased bone stiffness and strength, suggesting the potential for detrimental consequences in the long term.	1295	1453
24914936	Our studies establish that TRa1 has an essential role in the developing and adult skeleton and predict that patients with different THRA mutations will display variable responses to T4 treatment, which depend on the severity of the causative mutation.	1454	1705
25006961	Absence of PKC-alpha attenuates lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.	0	79
25006961	Lithium, an effective antipsychotic, induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in  40% of patients.	80	182
25006961	The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter (UT-A1) and water channel (AQP2) expression in the inner medulla.	183	395
25006961	Targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as PKC-mediated signaling, may be an effective method of treating lithium-induced polyuria.	396	536
25006961	PKC-alpha null mice (PKCa KO) and strain-matched wild type (WT) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3 or 5 days.	537	655
25006961	WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCa KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration.	656	820
25006961	Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice; however, AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO.	821	976
25006961	Similar results were observed with UT-A1 expression.	977	1029
25006961	Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks.	1030	1081
25006961	Lithium-treated WT mice had 19-fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCa KO animals had a 4-fold increase in output.	1082	1205
25006961	AQP2 and UT-A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium-treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCa KO mice, AQP2 was only reduced by 2-fold and UT-A1 expression was unaffected.	1206	1382
25006961	Urinary sodium, potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium-fed WT but not in lithium-fed PKCa KO mice.	1383	1489
25006961	Our data show that ablation of PKCa preserves AQP2 and UT-A1 protein expression and localization in lithium-induced NDI, and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy.	1490	1695
25054547	Characterization of a novel BCHE "silent" allele: point mutation (p.Val204Asp) causes loss of activity and prolonged apnea with suxamethonium.	0	142
25054547	Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency is characterized by prolonged apnea after the use of muscle relaxants (suxamethonium or mivacurium) in patients who have mutations in the BCHE gene.	143	324
25054547	Here, we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant (c.695T>A, p.Val204Asp).	325	492
25054547	Inhibition studies, kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a "silent" phenotype.	493	666
25054547	Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase with butyrylthiocholine (BTC) and benzoylcholine, and values of dibucaine and fluoride numbers fit with heterozygous atypical silent genotype.	667	862
25054547	Electrophoretic analysis of plasma BChE of the proband and his mother showed that patient has a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and that minor fast-moving BChE components: monomer, dimer, and monomer-albumin conjugate are missing.	863	1107
25054547	Kinetic analysis showed that the p.Val204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr BChE displays a pure Michaelian behavior with BTC as the substrate.	1108	1243
25054547	Both catalytic parameters Km = 265 uM for BTC, two times higher than that of the atypical enzyme, and a low Vmax are consistent with the absence of activity against suxamethonium.	1244	1423
25054547	Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations showed that the overall effect of the mutation p.Val204Asp is disruption of hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441, leading Ser198 and His438 to move away from each other with subsequent disruption of the catalytic triad functionality regardless of the type of substrate.	1424	1734
25054547	MD also showed that the enzyme volume is increased, suggesting a pre-denaturation state.	1735	1823
25054547	This fits with the reduced concentration of p.Ala204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr tetrameric enzyme in the plasma and non-detectable fast moving-bands on electrophoresis gels.	1824	1996
25119790	Curcumin prevents maleate-induced nephrotoxicity: relation to hemodynamic alterations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I.	0	176
25119790	The potential protective effect of the dietary antioxidant curcumin (120 mg/Kg/day for 6 days) against the renal injury induced by maleate was evaluated.	177	330
25119790	Tubular proteinuria and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of maleate (400 mg/kg) in rats.	331	438
25119790	Maleate-induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and N-acetyl b-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), upregulation of kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, decrease in renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h.	439	830
25119790	Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels.	831	949
25119790	Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups.	950	1085
25119790	Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LLC-PK1 cells in culture.	1086	1187
25119790	In addition, maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in ADP-stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using malate/glutamate as substrate.	1188	1359
25119790	The activities of both complex I and aconitase were also diminished.	1360	1428
25119790	All the above-described alterations were prevented by curcumin.	1429	1492
25119790	It is concluded that curcumin is able to attenuate in vivo maleate-induced nephropathy and in vitro cell damage.	1493	1605
25119790	The in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I, and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ROS production.	1606	1853
25218136	Sepsis-induced changes in amino acid transporters and leucine signaling via mTOR in skeletal muscle.	0	100
25218136	The present study tested the hypothesis that sepsis-induced leucine (Leu) resistance in skeletal muscle is associated with a down-regulation of amino acid transporters important in regulating Leu flux or an impairment in the formation of the Leu-sensitive mTOR-Ragulator complex.	101	380
25218136	Sepsis in adult male rats decreased basal protein synthesis in gastrocnemius, associated with a reduction in mTOR activation as indicated by decreased 4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation.	381	564
25218136	The ability of oral Leu to increase protein synthesis and mTOR kinase after 1 h was largely prevented in sepsis.	565	677
25218136	Sepsis increased CAT1, LAT2 and SNAT2 mRNA content two- to fourfold, but only the protein content for CAT1 (20 % decrease) differed significantly.	678	824
25218136	Conversely, sepsis decreased the proton-assisted amino acid transporter (PAT)-2 mRNA by 60 %, but without a coordinate change in PAT2 protein.	825	967
25218136	There was no sepsis or Leu effect on the protein content for RagA-D, LAMTOR-1 and -2, raptor, Rheb or mTOR in muscle.	968	1085
25218136	The binding of mTOR, PRAS40 and RagC to raptor did not differ for control and septic muscle in the basal condition; however, the Leu-induced decrease in PRAS40 raptor and increase in RagC raptor seen in control muscle was absent in sepsis.	1086	1325
25218136	The intracellular Leu concentration was increased in septic muscle, compared to basal control conditions, and oral Leu further increased the intracellular Leu concentration similarly in both control and septic rats.	1326	1541
25218136	Hence, while alterations in select amino acid transporters are not associated with development of sepsis-induced Leu resistance, the Leu-stimulated binding of raptor with RagC and the recruitment of mTOR/raptor to the endosome-lysosomal compartment may partially explain the inability of Leu to fully activate mTOR and muscle protein synthesis.	1542	1886
25277705	Leukemia inhibitory factor protects the lung during respiratory syncytial viral infection.	0	90
25277705	BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects the lung epithelium where it stimulates the production of numerous host cytokines that are associated with disease burden and acute lung injury.	91	289
25277705	Characterizing the host cytokine response to RSV infection, the regulation of host cytokines and the impact of neutralizing an RSV-inducible cytokine during infection were undertaken in this study.	290	487
25277705	METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (Mavs) knockout (KO) mice were infected with RSV and cytokine responses were investigated by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR.	488	801
25277705	Neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals prior to RSV infection.	802	944
25277705	RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines LIF, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-b).	945	1204
25277705	These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during an infection.	1205	1297
25277705	To identify the regulation of RSV inducible cytokines, Mavs and Trif deficient animals were infected with RSV.	1298	1408
25277705	In vivo induction of airway IL-1b, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-g, CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CXCL1, IP-10/CXCL10, IL-22, MIG/CXCL9 and MIF were dependent on Mavs expression in mice.	1409	1587
25277705	Loss of Trif expression in mice altered the RSV induction of IL-1b, IL-5, CXCL12, MIF, LIF, CXCL12 and IFN-g. Silencing of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) expression in A549 cells had a greater impact on RSV-inducible cytokines than melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), and Trif expression.	1588	1953
25277705	To evaluate the role of LIF in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, which enhanced RSV pathology observed with increased airspace protein content, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment.	1954	2226
25277705	CONCLUSIONS: RSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter infection, primarily in a RIG-I dependent manner.	2227	2368
25277705	Expression of LIF protects the lung from lung injury and enhanced pathology during RSV infection.	2369	2466
25550469	The androgen receptor confers protection against diet-induced atherosclerosis, obesity, and dyslipidemia in female mice.	0	120
25550469	Androgens have important cardiometabolic actions in males, but their metabolic role in females is unclear.	121	227
25550469	To determine the physiologic androgen receptor (AR)-dependent actions of androgens on atherogenesis in female mice, we generated female AR-knockout (ARKO) mice on an atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient background.	228	461
25550469	After 8 weeks on a high-fat diet, but not on a normal chow diet, atherosclerosis in aorta was increased in ARKO females (+59% vs. control apoE-deficient mice with intact AR gene).	462	641
25550469	They also displayed increased body weight (+18%), body fat percentage (+62%), and hepatic triglyceride levels, reduced insulin sensitivity, and a marked atherogenic dyslipidemia (serum cholesterol, +52%).	642	846
25550469	Differences in atherosclerosis, body weight, and lipid levels between ARKO and control mice were abolished in mice that were ovariectomized before puberty, consistent with a protective action of ovarian androgens mediated via the AR.	847	1080
25550469	Furthermore, the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone reduced atherosclerosis (-41%; thoracic aorta), subcutaneous fat mass (-44%), and cholesterol levels (-35%) in ovariectomized mice, reduced hepatocyte lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells in vitro, and regulated mRNA expression of hepatic genes pivotal for lipid homeostasis.	1081	1404
25550469	In conclusion, we demonstrate that the AR protects against diet-induced atherosclerosis in female mice and propose that this is mediated by modulation of body composition and lipid metabolism.	1405	1597
25589620	Pharmacogenetic Analysis of INT 0144 Trial: Association of Polymorphisms with Survival and Toxicity in Rectal Cancer Patients Treated with 5-FU and Radiation.	0	158
25589620	PURPOSE: We tested whether 18 polymorphisms in 16 genes (GSTP1, COX2, IL10, EGFR, EGF, FGFR4, CCDN1, VEGFR2, VEGF, CXCR2, IL8, MMP3, ICAM1, ERCC1, RAD51, and XRCC3) would predict disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity in the INT0144 trial, which was designed to investigate different postoperative regimens of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation (CRT) in locally advanced rectal cancers: Arm 1 consisted of bolus 5-FU followed by 5-FU protracted venous infusion (PVI) with radiotherapy; arm 2 was induction and concomitant PVI 5-FU with radiotherapy and arm 3 was induction and concomitant bolus 5-FU with radiotherapy.	159	811
25589620	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA from 746 stage II/III rectal patients enrolled in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S9304 phase III trial was analyzed.	812	958
25589620	Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue.	959	1044
25589620	The polymorphisms were analyzed using direct DNA-sequencing or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).	1045	1186
25589620	RESULTS: GSTP1-Ile105Val (rs1695) was significantly associated with DFS and OS and its effect did not vary by treatment arm.	1187	1311
25589620	The five-year DFS and OS were 53% and 58%, respectively, for G/G, 66% and 72% for G/A, and 57% and 66% for A/A patients.	1312	1432
25589620	In arm 2, IL8-251A/A genotype (rs4073) was associated with a lower risk of toxicities (P = 0.04).	1433	1530
25589620	The VEGFR2 H472Q Q/Q genotype (rs1870377) was associated with a higher risk of grade 3-5 proximal upper gastrointestinal tract (PUGIT) mucositis (P = 0.04) in arm 2.	1531	1696
25589620	However, in arm 1, this genotype was associated with a lower risk of PUGIT mucositis (P = 0.004).	1697	1794
25589620	CONCLUSION: rs1695 may be prognostic in patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant CRT.	1795	1889
25589620	rs4073 and rs1870377 may exhibit different associations with toxicity, according to the 5-FU schedule.	1890	1992
25622904	Inactivation of Sag/Rbx2/Roc2 e3 ubiquitin ligase triggers senescence and inhibits kras-induced immortalization.	0	112
25622904	Our recent study showed that SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates apoptosis and vasculogenesis by promoting degradation of NOXA and NF1, and co-operates with Kras to promote lung tumorigenesis by activating NFkappaB and mTOR pathways via targeted degradation of tumor suppressive substrates including IkappaB, DEPTOR, p21 and p27.	113	445
25622904	Here we investigated the role of Sag/Rbx2 E3 ligase in cellular senescence and immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and report that Sag is required for proper cell proliferation and Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization.	446	680
25622904	Sag inactivation by genetic deletion remarkably suppresses cell proliferation by inducing senescence, which is associated with accumulation of p16, but not p53.	681	841
25622904	Mechanistically, Sag deletion caused accumulation of Jun-B, a substrate of Sag-Fbxw7 E3 ligase and a transcription factor that drives p16 transcription.	842	994
25622904	Importantly, senescence triggered by Sag deletion can be largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, the p16 encoding gene, indicating its causal role.	995	1154
25622904	Furthermore, Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization can also be abrogated by Sag deletion via senescence induction, which is again rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a.	1155	1325
25622904	Finally, we found that Sag deletion inactivates Kras(G12D) activity and block the MAPK signaling pathway, together with accumulated p16, to induce senescence.	1326	1484
25622904	Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a Kras(G12D)-cooperating oncogene required for Kras(G12D)-induced immortalization and transformation, and targeting SAG-SCF E3 ligase may, therefore, have therapeutic value for senescence-based cancer treatment.	1485	1749
25874935	Neuroprotective effect of neuroserpin in oxygen-glucose deprivation- and reoxygenation-treated rat astrocytes in vitro.	0	119
25874935	Neuroserpin (NSP) reportedly exerts neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemic animal models and patients; however, the mechanism of protection is poorly understood.	120	287
25874935	We thus attempted to confirm neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes in the ischemic state and then explored the relative mechanisms.	288	426
25874935	Astrocytes from neonatal rats were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R).	427	542
25874935	To confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP, we measured the cell survival rate, relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release; we also performed morphological methods, namely Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V assay.	543	763
25874935	To explore the potential mechanisms of NSP, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-alpha related to NSP administration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.	764	936
25874935	The proteins related to the NF-kappaB, ERK1/2, and PI3K/Akt pathways were investigated by Western blotting.	937	1044
25874935	To verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the NF-kappaB pathway, a NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060 was employed to observe the effects of NSP-induced neuroprotection.	1045	1244
25874935	We found that NSP significantly increased the cell survival rate and reduced LDH release in OGD/R-treated astrocytes.	1245	1362
25874935	It also reduced NO/TNF-alpha release.	1363	1400
25874935	Western blotting showed that the protein levels of p-IKKBalpha/beta and P65 were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment and such effects were significantly inhibited by NSP administration.	1401	1585
25874935	The NSP-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060, whereas, expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2, and p-AKT were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels were unchanged by NSP administration.	1586	1856
25874935	Our results thus verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP in ischemic astrocytes.	1857	1941
25874935	The potential mechanisms include inhibition of the release of NO/TNF-alpha and repression of the NF-kappaB signaling pathways.	1942	2068
25874935	Our data also indicated that NSP has little influence on the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.	2069	2157
25946186	TIPE2 Inhibits Lung Cancer Growth Attributing to Promotion of Apoptosis by Regulating Some Apoptotic Molecules Expression.	0	122
25946186	Recent studies found that TIPE2 was involved in cancer development.	123	190
25946186	However, little is known about TIPE2 in lung cancer.	191	243
25946186	Our study aims to clarify the role of TIPE2 in lung carcinogenesis.	244	311
25946186	We examined the expression of TIPE2 in lung squamous cancer (LSC), small cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (AdC) tissues and found that TIPE2 expression was lost in small cell lung cancer, compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues.	312	549
25946186	Overexpression of TIPE2 significantly inhibited the growth of lung cancer cell H446 in vitro and even suppressed tumor formation in vivo.	550	687
25946186	Flow cytometry analysis found TIPE2 overexpression promoted apoptosis of H446.	688	766
25946186	In TIPE2 over-expression cells, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax were significantly up-regulated while Bcl-2 was down-regulated.	767	892
25946186	Moreover, coincident results were shown by immunohistochemistry in tumors from nude mice.	893	982
25946186	TIPE2 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, while promoting the phosphorylation of P38, but had no effect on IkBa and ERK pathway.	983	1113
25946186	Taken together, TIPE2 promoted lung cancer cell apoptosis through affecting apoptosis-related molecules caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2 and Bax, possibly via regulating P38 and Akt pathways, indicating that TIPE2 might be a novel marker for lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.	1114	1385
25979836	Gastrointestinal hormones/neurotransmitters and growth factors can activate P21 activated kinase 2 in pancreatic acinar cells by novel mechanisms.	0	146
25979836	P-21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine kinases comprising six isoforms divided in two groups, group-I (PAK1-3)/group-II (PAK4-6) which play important roles in cell cytoskeletal dynamics, survival, secretion and proliferation and are activated by diverse stimuli.	147	421
25979836	However, little is known about PAKs ability to be activated by gastrointestinal (GI) hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors.	422	549
25979836	We used rat pancreatic acini to explore the ability of GI-hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors to activate Group-I-PAKs and the signaling cascades involved.	550	711
25979836	Only PAK2 was present in acini.	712	743
25979836	PAK2 was activated by some pancreatic growth-factors [EGF, PDGF, bFGF], by secretagogues activating phospholipase-C (PLC) [CCK, carbachol, bombesin] and by post-receptor stimulants activating PKC [TPA], but not agents only mobilizing cellular calcium or increasing cyclic AMP.	744	1020
25979836	CCK-activation of PAK2 required both high- and low-affinity-CCK1-receptor-state activation.	1021	1112
25979836	It was partially reduced by PKC- or Src-inhibition, but not with PI3K-inhibitors (wortmannin, LY294002) or thapsigargin.	1113	1233
25979836	IPA-3, which prevents PAK2 binding to small-GTPases partially inhibited PAK2-activation, as well as reduced CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation and amylase release induced by CCK or bombesin.	1234	1419
25979836	This study demonstrates pancreatic acini, possess only one Group-I-PAK, PAK2.	1420	1497
25979836	CCK and other GI-hormones/neurotransmitters/growth-factors activate PAK2 via small GTPases (CDC42/Rac1), PKC and SFK but not cytosolic calcium or PI3K.	1498	1649
25979836	CCK-activation of PAK2 showed several novel features being dependent on both receptor-activation states, having PLC- and PKC-dependent/independent components and small-GTPase-dependent/independent components.	1650	1858
25979836	These results show that PAK2 is important in signaling cascades activated by numerous pancreatic stimuli which mediate their various physiological/pathophysiological responses and thus could be a promising target for the development of therapies in some pancreatic disorders such as pancreatitis.	1859	2155
26102294	Role of stress-activated OCT4A in the cell fate decisions of embryonal carcinoma cells treated with etoposide.	0	110
26102294	Tumor cellular senescence induced by genotoxic treatments has recently been found to be paradoxically linked to the induction of "stemness."	111	251
26102294	This observation is critical as it directly impinges upon the response of tumors to current chemo-radio-therapy treatment regimens.	252	383
26102294	Previously, we showed that following etoposide (ETO) treatment embryonal carcinoma PA-1 cells undergo a p53-dependent upregulation of OCT4A and p21Cip1 (governing self-renewal and regulating cell cycle inhibition and senescence, respectively).	384	627
26102294	Here we report further detail on the relationship between these and other critical cell-fate regulators.	628	732
26102294	PA-1 cells treated with ETO display highly heterogeneous increases in OCT4A and p21Cip1 indicative of dis-adaptation catastrophe.	733	862
26102294	Silencing OCT4A suppresses p21Cip1, changes cell cycle regulation and subsequently suppresses terminal senescence; p21Cip1-silencing did not affect OCT4A expression or cellular phenotype.	863	1050
26102294	SOX2 and NANOG expression did not change following ETO treatment suggesting a dissociation of OCT4A from its pluripotency function.	1051	1182
26102294	Instead, ETO-induced OCT4A was concomitant with activation of AMPK, a key component of metabolic stress and autophagy regulation.	1183	1312
26102294	p16ink4a, the inducer of terminal senescence, underwent autophagic sequestration in the cytoplasm of ETO-treated cells, allowing alternative cell fates.	1313	1465
26102294	Accordingly, failure of autophagy was accompanied by an accumulation of p16ink4a, nuclear disintegration, and loss of cell recovery.	1466	1598
26102294	Together, these findings imply that OCT4A induction following DNA damage in PA-1 cells, performs a cell stress, rather than self-renewal, function by moderating the expression of p21Cip1, which alongside AMPK helps to then regulate autophagy.	1599	1841
26102294	Moreover, this data indicates that exhaustion of autophagy, through persistent DNA damage, is the cause of terminal cellular senescence.	1842	1978
26115410	Mechanisms Underlying Latent Disease Risk Associated with Early-Life Arsenic Exposure: Current Research Trends and Scientific Gaps.	0	131
26115410	BACKGROUND: Millions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in their drinking water.	132	317
26115410	Inorganic As exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood.	318	474
26115410	There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early-life iAs exposure to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to cancer.	475	666
26115410	OBJECTIVES: This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood that is associated with early-life iAs exposure.	667	853
26115410	DISCUSSION: Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression, the development of cancer stem cells, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early-life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects.	854	1107
26115410	CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is mounting that relates early-life iAs exposure and cancer development later in life.	1108	1216
26115410	Future research should include animal studies that address mechanistic hypotheses and studies of human populations that integrate early-life exposure, molecular alterations, and latent disease outcomes.	1217	1419
26270232	Serum levels of chemokines CCL4 and CCL5 in cirrhotic patients indicate the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma.	0	113
26270232	BACKGROUND: Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are diagnosed at an advanced stage.	114	199
26270232	The prognostic value of serum tumour markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is limited.	200	320
26270232	The aim of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum growth factors, apoptotic and inflammatory mediators of cirrhotic patients with and without HCC.	321	483
26270232	METHODS: Serum samples were collected from cirrhotic potential liver transplant patients (LTx) with (n=61) and without HCC (n=78) as well as from healthy controls (HCs; n=39).	484	659
26270232	Serum concentrations of CRP, neopterin and IL-6 as markers of inflammation and thrombopoietin (TPO), GCSF, FGF basic and VEGF, HMGB1, CK-18 (M65) and CK18 fragment (M30) and a panel of proinflammatory chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL5 and IL-8) were measured.	660	927
26270232	Chi square, Fisher exact, Mann-Whitney U-tests, ROC curve analysis and forward stepwise logistic regression analyses were applied.	928	1058
26270232	RESULTS: Patients with HCC had higher serum TPO and chemokines (P   <0.001 for TPO, CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL5) and lower CCL2 (P=0.008) levels than cirrhotic patients without HCC.	1059	1233
26270232	Multivariate forward stepwise regression analysis for significant parameters showed that among the studied parameters CCL4 and CCL5 (P=0.001) are diagnostic markers of HCC.	1234	1406
26270232	Serum levels of TPO and chemokines were lower, whereas M30 was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than in HCs.	1407	1525
26270232	CONCLUSIONS: High serum levels of inflammatory chemokines such as CCL4 and CCL5 in the serum of cirrhotic patients indicate the presence of HCC.	1526	1670
26411452	Putative Prostate Cancer Risk SNP in an Androgen Receptor-Binding Site of the Melanophilin Gene Illustrates Enrichment of Risk SNPs in Androgen Receptor Target Sites.	0	166
26411452	Genome-wide association studies have identified genomic loci, whose single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predispose to prostate cancer (PCa).	167	310
26411452	However, the mechanisms of most of these variants are largely unknown.	311	381
26411452	We integrated chromatin-immunoprecipitation-coupled sequencing and microarray expression profiling in TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement positive DUCaP cells with the GWAS PCa risk SNPs catalog to identify disease susceptibility SNPs localized within functional androgen receptor-binding sites (ARBSs).	382	680
26411452	Among the 48 GWAS index risk SNPs and 3,917 linked SNPs, 80 were found located in ARBSs.	681	769
26411452	Of these, rs11891426:T>G in an intron of the melanophilin gene (MLPH) was within a novel putative auxiliary AR-binding motif, which is enriched in the neighborhood of canonical androgen-responsive elements.	770	976
26411452	T>G exchange attenuated the transcriptional activity of the ARBS in an AR reporter gene assay.	977	1071
26411452	The expression of MLPH in primary prostate tumors was significantly lower in those with the G compared with the T allele and correlated significantly with AR protein.	1072	1238
26411452	Higher melanophilin level in prostate tissue of patients with a favorable PCa risk profile points out a tumor-suppressive effect.	1239	1368
26411452	These results unravel a hidden link between AR and a functional putative PCa risk SNP, whose allele alteration affects androgen regulation of its host gene MLPH.	1369	1530
26449539	The impact of PPARa activation on whole genome gene expression in human precision cut liver slices.	0	99
26449539	BACKGROUND: Studies in mice have shown that PPARa is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in liver and key transcription factor involved in the adaptive response to fasting.	100	279
26449539	However, much less is known about the role of PPARa in human liver.	280	347
26449539	METHODS: Here we set out to study the function of PPARa in human liver via analysis of whole genome gene regulation in human liver slices treated with the PPARa agonist Wy14643.	348	525
26449539	RESULTS: Quantitative PCR indicated that PPARa is well expressed in human liver and human liver slices and that the classical PPARa targets PLIN2, VLDLR, ANGPTL4, CPT1A and PDK4 are robustly induced by PPARa activation.	526	745
26449539	Transcriptomics analysis indicated that 617 genes were upregulated and 665 genes were downregulated by PPARa activation (q value < 0.05).	746	883
26449539	Many genes induced by PPARa activation were involved in lipid metabolism (ACSL5, AGPAT9, FADS1, SLC27A4), xenobiotic metabolism (POR, ABCC2, CYP3A5) or the unfolded protein response, whereas most of the downregulated genes were involved in immune-related pathways.	884	1148
26449539	Among the most highly repressed genes upon PPARa activation were several chemokines (e.g. CXCL9-11, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL6), interferon g-induced genes (e.g. IFITM1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and numerous other immune-related genes (e.g. TLR3, NOS2, and LCN2).	1149	1401
26449539	Comparative analysis of gene regulation by Wy14643 between human liver slices and primary human hepatocytes showed that down-regulation of gene expression by PPARa is much better captured by liver slices as compared to primary hepatocytes.	1402	1641
26449539	In particular, PPARa activation markedly suppressed immunity/inflammation-related genes in human liver slices but not in primary hepatocytes.	1642	1783
26449539	Finally, several putative new target genes of PPARa were identified that were commonly induced by PPARa activation in the two human liver model systems, including TSKU, RHOF, CA12 and VSIG10L.	1784	1976
26449539	CONCLUSION: Our paper demonstrates the suitability and superiority of human liver slices over primary hepatocytes for studying the functional role of PPARa in human liver.	1977	2148
26449539	Our data underscore the major role of PPARa in regulation of hepatic lipid and xenobiotic metabolism in human liver and reveal a marked immuno-suppressive/anti-inflammatory effect of PPARa in human liver slices that may be therapeutically relevant for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.	2149	2435
26615423	Upregulation of centrosomal protein 55 is associated with unfavorable prognosis and tumor invasion in epithelial ovarian carcinoma.	0	131
26615423	Centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55) is a cell cycle regulator implicated in development of certain cancers.	132	234
26615423	However, characteristics of CEP55 expression and its clinical/prognostic significance are unclear in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC).	235	377
26615423	Therefore, we investigated the expression and clinicopathological significance of CEP55 in patients with EOC and its role in regulating invasion and metastasis of ovarian cell lines.	378	560
26615423	CEP55 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).	561	706
26615423	Potential associations of CEP55 expression scores with clinical parameters and patient survival were evaluated.	707	818
26615423	CEP55 function was investigated further using RNA interference, wound healing assay, transwell assay, immunofluorescence analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting.	819	980
26615423	CEP55 was significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines and lesions compared with normal cells and adjacent noncancerous ovarian tissues.	981	1127
26615423	In the 213 EOC samples, CEP55 protein levels were positively correlated with clinical stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), intraperitoneal metastasis (P < 0.001), tumor recurrence (P < 0.001), differentiation grade (P < 0.001), residual tumor size (P < 0.001), ascites see tumor cells (P = 0.020), and serum CA153 level (P < 0.001).	1128	1477
26615423	Moreover, patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed tendencies to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and cytoreductive surgery (P = 0.020).	1478	1640
26615423	By contrast, no significant correlation was detected between the protein levels and patient age, histological type, or serum CA125, CA199, CA724, NSE, CEA, and b-HCG levels.	1641	1814
26615423	Patients with high CEP55 protein expression had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival compared with those with low CEP55 expression.	1815	1960
26615423	Multivariate analysis implicated CEP55 as an independent prognostic indicator for EOC patients.	1961	2056
26615423	Additionally, downregulation of CEP55 in ovarian cancer cells remarkably inhibited cellular motility and invasion.	2057	2171
26615423	Aberrant CEP55 expression may predict unfavorable clinical outcomes in EOC patients and play an important role in regulating invasion in ovarian cancer cells.	2172	2330
26615423	Thus, CEP55 may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for EOC.	2331	2407
26684240	Identification of the BRAF V600E mutation in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.	0	90
26684240	Genomic profiles of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are still insufficiently understood, and the genetic alterations associated with drug responses have not been studied.	91	285
26684240	Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study for pazopanib, and integrated our results with previously published results on pancreas (n = 12) and small intestine NETs (n = 50).	286	560
26684240	The mean numbers of somatic mutations in each case varied widely from 20 to 4682.	561	642
26684240	Among 12 GEP-NETs, eight showed mutations of more than one cancer-related gene, including TP53, CNBD1, RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL.	643	865
26684240	TP53 was recurrently mutated in three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were identified in two cases.	866	972
26684240	Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated a durable response and one small intestinal grade (G) 1 NET patient with BRAF V600E mutation showed progression after pazopanib treatment.	973	1167
26684240	We found BRAF V600E (G1 NET from rectum and two G3 NETs from colon) and BRAF G593S (G2 NET from pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%) in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs from the rectum (n = 26), colon (n = 7), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1) by Sanger sequencing.	1168	1482
26684240	All tumor specimens were obtained before chemotherapy.	1483	1537
26684240	In conclusion, BRAF V600E mutation is likely to result in resistance to pazopanib but may be a potentianally actionable mutation in metastatic GEP-NETs patients.	1538	1699
26847345	Transgelin increases metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells in vivo and alters expression of genes involved in cell motility.	0	134
26847345	BACKGROUND: Transgelin is an actin-binding protein that promotes motility in normal cells.	135	225
26847345	Although the role of transgelin in cancer is controversial, a number of studies have shown that elevated levels correlate with aggressive tumor behavior, advanced stage, and poor prognosis.	226	415
26847345	Here we sought to determine the role of transgelin more directly by determining whether experimental manipulation of transgelin levels in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells led to changes in metastatic potential in vivo. METHODS: Isogenic CRC cell lines that differ in transgelin expression were characterized using in vitro assays of growth and invasiveness and a mouse tail vein assay of experimental metastasis.	416	825
26847345	Downstream effects of transgelin overexpression were investigated by gene expression profiling and quantitative PCR.	826	942
26847345	RESULTS: Stable overexpression of transgelin in RKO cells, which have low endogenous levels, led to increased invasiveness, growth at low density, and growth in soft agar.	943	1114
26847345	Overexpression also led to an increase in the number and size of lung metastases in the mouse tail vein injection model.	1115	1235
26847345	Similarly, attenuation of transgelin expression in HCT116 cells, which have high endogenous levels, decreased metastases in the same model.	1236	1375
26847345	Investigation of mRNA expression patterns showed that transgelin overexpression altered the levels of approximately 250 other transcripts, with over-representation of genes that affect function of actin or other cytoskeletal proteins.	1376	1610
26847345	Changes included increases in HOOK1, SDCCAG8, ENAH/Mena, and TNS1 and decreases in EMB, BCL11B, and PTPRD.	1611	1717
26847345	CONCLUSIONS: Increases or decreases in transgelin levels have reciprocal effects on tumor cell behavior, with higher expression promoting metastasis.	1718	1867
26847345	Chronic overexpression influences steady-state levels of mRNAs for metastasis-related genes.	1868	1960
26900322	CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.	0	74
26900322	PURPOSE: Complement factor I (CFI) plays an important role in complement activation pathways and is known to affect the development of uveitis.	75	218
26900322	The present study was performed to investigate the existence of an association between CFI genetic polymorphisms and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome.	219	372
26900322	METHODS: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with VKH syndrome and 300 healthy controls were recruited for the study.	373	488
26900322	Two milliliters of peripheral blood were collected in a sterile anticoagulative tube.	489	574
26900322	CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY technology.	575	654
26900322	Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using a X(2) test.	655	749
26900322	The analyses were stratified for recurrent status, complicated cataract status, and steroid-sensitive status.	750	859
26900322	RESULTS: No significant association was found between CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms and VKH syndrome.	860	959
26900322	However, patients with recurrent VKH syndrome had lower frequencies of the G allele and GG homozygosity in CFI-rs7356506 when compared to the controls (p=0.016, odds ratio [OR]=0.429, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.212-0.871; p=0.014, OR=0.364, 95% CI=0.158-0.837, respectively).	960	1239
26900322	Furthermore, there were significant decreases in the frequencies of the G allele and GG homozygosity in CFI-rs7356506 in patients with VKH syndrome with complicated cataract compared to the controls (p<0.001, OR=0.357, 95% CI=0.197-0.648; p<0.001, OR=0.273, 95% CI=0.135-0.551, respectively).	1240	1532
26900322	Nevertheless, no significant association with patients with VKH syndrome in steroid-sensitive statuses was detected for CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms.	1533	1681
26900322	CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CFI polymorphisms are not significantly associated with VKH syndrome; nevertheless, we identified a trend for the association of CFI-7356506 with VKH syndrome that depends on the recurrent status and the complicated cataract status but not on the steroid-sensitive status.	1682	1993
26937641	Serum Amyloid A Induces Inflammation, Proliferation and Cell Death in Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells.	0	103
26937641	Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an evolutionary highly conserved acute phase protein that is predominantly secreted by hepatocytes.	104	228
26937641	However, its role in liver injury and fibrogenesis has not been elucidated so far.	229	311
26937641	In this study, we determined the effects of SAA on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main fibrogenic cell type of the liver.	312	437
26937641	Serum amyloid A potently activated IkappaB kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Erk and Akt and enhanced NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase activity in primary human and rat HSCs.	438	615
26937641	Serum amyloid A induced the transcription of MCP-1, RANTES and MMP9 in an NF-kappaB- and JNK-dependent manner.	616	726
26937641	Blockade of NF-kappaB revealed cytotoxic effects of SAA in primary HSCs with signs of apoptosis such as caspase 3 and PARP cleavage and Annexin V staining.	727	882
26937641	Serum amyloid A induced HSC proliferation, which depended on JNK, Erk and Akt activity.	883	970
26937641	In primary hepatocytes, SAA also activated MAP kinases, but did not induce relevant cell death after NF-kappaB inhibition.	971	1093
26937641	In two models of hepatic fibrogenesis, CCl4 treatment and bile duct ligation, hepatic mRNA levels of SAA1 and SAA3 were strongly increased.	1094	1233
26937641	In conclusion, SAA may modulate fibrogenic responses in the liver in a positive and negative fashion by inducing inflammation, proliferation and cell death in HSCs.	1234	1398
26991973	MOL1 is required for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis.	0	56
26991973	Plants maintain pools of pluripotent stem cells which allow them to constantly produce new tissues and organs.	57	167
26991973	Stem cell homeostasis in shoot and root tips depends on negative regulation by ligand-receptor pairs of the CLE peptide and leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) families.	168	352
26991973	However, regulation of the cambium, the stem cell niche required for lateral growth of shoots and roots, is poorly characterized.	353	482
26991973	Here we show that the LRR-RLK MOL1 is necessary for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana.	483	579
26991973	By employing promoter reporter lines, we reveal that MOL1 is active in a domain that is distinct from the domain of the positively acting CLE41/PXY signaling module.	580	745
26991973	In particular, we show that MOL1 acts in an opposing manner to the CLE41/PXY module and that changing the domain or level of MOL1 expression both result in disturbed cambium organization.	746	933
26991973	Underlining discrete roles of MOL1 and PXY, both LRR-RLKs are not able to replace each other when their expression domains are interchanged.	934	1074
26991973	Furthermore, MOL1 but not PXY is able to rescue CLV1 deficiency in the shoot apical meristem.	1075	1168
26991973	By identifying genes mis-expressed in mol1 mutants, we demonstrate that MOL1 represses genes associated with stress-related ethylene and jasmonic acid hormone signaling pathways which have known roles in coordinating lateral growth of the Arabidopsis stem.	1169	1425
26991973	Our findings provide evidence that common regulatory mechanisms in different plant stem cell niches are adapted to specific niche anatomies and emphasize the importance of a complex spatial organization of intercellular signaling cascades for a strictly bidirectional tissue production.	1426	1712
27084744	NOTCH1 and SOX10 are Essential for Proliferation and Radiation Resistance of Cancer Stem-Like Cells in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma.	0	128
27084744	PURPOSE: Although the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has been proposed, lack of assays for their propagation and uncertainty about molecular markers prevented their characterization.	129	351
27084744	Our objective was to isolate CSC from ACC and provide insight into signaling pathways that support their propagation.	352	469
27084744	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To isolate CSC from ACC and characterize them, we used ROCK inhibitor-supplemented cell culture, immunomagnetic cell sorting, andin vitro/in vivoassays for CSC viability and tumorigenicity.	470	680
27084744	RESULTS: We identified in ACC CD133-positive CSC that expressed NOTCH1 and SOX10, formed spheroids, and initiated tumors in nude mice.	681	815
27084744	CD133(+)ACC cells produced activated NOTCH1 (N1ICD) and generated CD133(-)cells that expressed JAG1 as well as neural differentiation factors NR2F1, NR2F2, and p27Kip1.	816	984
27084744	Knockdowns of NOTCH1, SOX10, and their common effector FABP7 had negative effects on each other, inhibited spheroidogenesis, and induced cell death pointing at their essential roles in CSC maintenance.	985	1186
27084744	Downstream effects of FABP7 knockdown included suppression of a broad spectrum of genes involved in proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism.	1187	1338
27084744	Among proliferation-linked NOTCH1/FABP7 targets, we identified SKP2 and its substrate p27Kip1.	1339	1433
27084744	A g-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, selectively depleted CD133(+)cells, suppressed N1ICD and SKP2, induced p27Kip1, inhibited ACC growthin vivo, and sensitized CD133(+)cells to radiation.	1434	1616
27084744	CONCLUSIONS: These results establish in the majority of ACC the presence of a previously uncharacterized population of CD133(+)cells with neural stem properties, which are driven by SOX10, NOTCH1, and FABP7.	1617	1824
27084744	Sensitivity of these cells to Notch inhibition and their dependence on SKP2 offer new opportunities for targeted ACC therapies.	1825	1952
27090298	Circulating Fatty Acid Synthase in pregnant women: Relationship to blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters.	0	126
27090298	The enzyme FASN (fatty acid synthase) is potentially related with hypertension and metabolic dysfunction.	127	232
27090298	FASN is highly expressed in the human placenta.	233	280
27090298	We aimed to investigate the relationship circulating FASN has with blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters in healthy pregnant women.	281	433
27090298	Circulating FASN was assessed in 115 asymptomatic pregnant women in the second trimester of gestation along with C-peptide, fasting glucose and insulin, post-load glucose lipids, HMW-adiponectin and blood pressure (the latter was assessed in each trimester of gestation).	434	705
27090298	At birth, newborns and placentas were weighed.	706	752
27090298	FASN expression was also able to be assessed in 80 placentas.	753	814
27090298	Higher circulating FASN was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), with a more favourable metabolic phenotype (lower fasting glucose and insulin, post load glucose, HbAc1, HOMA-IR and C-peptide), and with lower placental and birth weight (all p < 0.05 to p < 0.001).	815	1095
27090298	Placental FASN expression related positively to circulating FASN (p < 0.005) and negatively to placental weight (p < 0.05).	1096	1219
27090298	Our observations suggest a physiological role of placental FASN in human pregnancy.	1220	1303
27090298	Future studies will clarify whether circulating FASN of placental origin does actually regulate placental and fetal growth, and (thereby) has a favourable influence on the pregnant mother's insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.	1304	1533
27103577	On the pivotal role of PPARa in adaptation of the heart to hypoxia and why fat in the diet increases hypoxic injury.	0	116
27103577	The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa)-mediated metabolic remodeling in cardiac adaptation to hypoxia has yet to be defined.	117	267
27103577	Here, mice were housed in hypoxia for 3 wk before in vivo contractile function was measured using cine MRI.	268	375
27103577	In isolated, perfused hearts, energetics were measured using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation were measured using [(3)H] labeling.	376	558
27103577	Compared with a normoxic, chow-fed control mouse heart, hypoxia decreased PPARa expression, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) levels, while increasing glycolysis, all of which served to maintain normal ATP concentrations ([ATP]) and thereby, ejection fractions.	559	854
27103577	A high-fat diet increased cardiac PPARa expression, fatty acid oxidation, and UCP3 levels with decreased glycolysis.	855	971
27103577	Hypoxia was unable to alter the high PPARa expression or reverse the metabolic changes caused by the high-fat diet, with the result that [ATP] and contractile function decreased significantly.	972	1164
27103577	The adaptive metabolic changes caused by hypoxia in control mouse hearts were found to have occurred already in PPARa-deficient (PPARa(-/-)) mouse hearts and sustained function in hypoxia despite an inability for further metabolic remodeling.	1165	1407
27103577	We conclude that decreased cardiac PPARa expression is essential for adaptive metabolic remodeling in hypoxia, but is prevented by dietary fat.-Cole, M. A., Abd Jamil, A. H., Heather, L. C., Murray, A. J., Sutton, E. R., Slingo, M., Sebag-Montefiore, L., Tan, S. C., Aksentijevic, D., Gildea, O. S., Stuckey, D. J., Yeoh, K. K., Carr, C. A., Evans, R. D., Aasum, E., Schofield, C.

27172902	Cisplatin induces tolerogenic dendritic cells in response to TLR agonists via the abundant production of IL-10, thereby promoting Th2- and Tr1-biased T-cell immunity.	0	166
27172902	Although many advantageous roles of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II), CDDP) have been reported in cancer therapy, the immunomodulatory roles of cisplatin in the phenotypic and functional alterations of dendritic cells (DCs) are poorly understood.	167	425
27172902	Here, we investigated the effect of cisplatin on the functionality of DCs and the changes in signaling pathways activated upon toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation.	426	590
27172902	Cisplatin-treated DCs down-regulated the expression of cell surface molecules (CD80, CD86, MHC class I and II) and up-regulated endocytic capacity in a dose-dependent manner.	591	765
27172902	Upon stimulation with various TLR agonists, cisplatin-treated DCs showed markedly increased IL-10 production through activation of the p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways without altering the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-12p70, indicating the cisplatin-mediated induction of tolerogenic DCs.	766	1061
27172902	This effect was dependent on the production of IL-10 from DCs, as neither DCs isolated from IL-10-/- mice nor IL-10-neutralized DCs generated tolerogenic DCs.	1062	1220
27172902	Interestingly, DCs that were co-treated with cisplatin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibited a decreased immunostimulatory capacity for inducing the proliferation of Th1- and Th17-type T cells; instead, these DCs contributed to Th2-type T cell immunity.	1221	1475
27172902	Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed a unique T cell population, IL-10-producing CD3+CD4+LAG-3+CD49b+CD25-Foxp3- Tr1 cells, that was significantly increased without altering the Foxp3+ regulatory T cell population.	1476	1711
27172902	Taken together, our results suggest that cisplatin induces immune-suppressive tolerogenic DCs in TLR agonist-induced inflammatory conditions via abundant IL-10 production, thereby skewing Th cell differentiation towards Th2 and Tr1 cells.	1712	1950
27172902	This relationship may provide cancer cells with an opportunity to evade the immune system.	1951	2041
27184800	Metallothionein-1 as a biomarker of altered redox metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells exposed to sorafenib.	0	116
27184800	BACKGROUND: Sorafenib, a kinase inhibitor active against various solid tumours, induces oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a new form of oxidative necrosis, in some cancer cells.	117	294
27184800	Clinically-applicable biomarkers that reflect the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells are lacking.	295	417
27184800	METHODS: We used gene expression microarrays, real-time PCR, immunoblot, protein-specific ELISA, and gene reporter constructs encoding the enzyme luciferase to study the response of a panel of cancer cells to sorafenib.	418	637
27184800	Tumour explants prepared from surgical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples and serum samples obtained from HCC patients receiving sorafenib were also used.	638	796
27184800	RESULTS: We observed that genes of the metallothionein-1 (MT1) family are induced in the HCC cell line Huh7 exposed to sorafenib.	797	926
27184800	Sorafenib increased the expression of MT1G mRNA in a panel of human cancer cells, an effect that was not observed with eight other clinically-approved kinase inhibitors.	927	1096
27184800	We identified the minimal region of the MT1G promoter that confers inducibility by sorafenib to a 133 base pair region containing an Anti-oxidant Response Element (ARE) and showed the essential role of the transcription factor NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2).	1097	1375
27184800	We examined the clinical relevance of our findings by analysing the regulation of MT1G in five tumour explants prepared from surgical HCC samples.	1376	1522
27184800	Finally, we showed that the protein levels of MT1 increase in the serum of some HCC patients receiving sorafenib, and found an association with reduced overall survival.	1523	1692
27184800	CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that MT1 constitute a biomarker adapted for exploring the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells.	1693	1847
27292643	Negative Selection and Chromosome Instability Induced by Mad2 Overexpression Delay Breast Cancer but Facilitate Oncogene-Independent Outgrowth.	0	143
27292643	Chromosome instability (CIN) is associated with poor survival and therapeutic outcome in a number of malignancies.	144	258
27292643	Despite this correlation, CIN can also lead to growth disadvantages.	259	327
27292643	Here, we show that simultaneous overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad2 with Kras(G12D) or Her2 in mammary glands of adult mice results in mitotic checkpoint overactivation and a delay in tumor onset.	328	542
27292643	Time-lapse imaging of organotypic cultures and pathologic analysis prior to tumor establishment reveals error-prone mitosis, mitotic arrest, and cell death.	543	699
27292643	Nonetheless, Mad2 expression persists and increases karyotype complexity in Kras tumors.	700	788
27292643	Faced with the selective pressure of oncogene withdrawal, Mad2-positive tumors have a higher frequency of developing persistent subclones that avoid remission and continue to grow.	789	969
27464336	Decreased Whole-Body Fat Mass Produced by Chronic Alcohol Consumption is Associated with Activation of S6K1-Mediated Protein Synthesis and Increased Autophagy in Epididymal White Adipose Tissue.	0	194
27464336	BACKGROUND: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to a loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) but the underlying mechanisms for this lipodystrophy are not fully elucidated.	195	359
27464336	This study tested the hypothesis that the reduction in WAT mass in chronic alcohol-fed mice is associated with a decreased protein synthesis specifically related to impaired function of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).	360	583
27464336	METHODS: Adult male mice were provided an alcohol-containing liquid diet for 24 weeks or an isonitrogenous isocaloric control diet.	584	715
27464336	In vivo protein synthesis was determined at this time and thereafter epididymal WAT (eWAT) was excised for analysis of signal transduction pathways central to controling protein synthesis and degradation.	716	920
27464336	RESULTS: While chronic alcohol feeding decreased whole-body and eWAT mass, this was associated with a discordant increase in protein synthesis in eWAT.	921	1072
27464336	This increase was not associated with a change in mTOR, 4E-BP1, Akt, or PRAS40 phosphorylation.	1073	1168
27464336	Instead, a selective increase in phosphorylation of S6K1 and its downstream substrates, S6 and eIF4B was detected in alcohol-fed mice.	1169	1303
27464336	Alcohol also increased eEF2K phosphorylation and decreased eEF2 phosphorylation consistent with increased translation elongation.	1304	1433
27464336	Alcohol increased Atg12-5, LC3B-I and -II, and ULK1 S555 phosphorylation, suggesting increased autophagy, while markers of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 and -9, and PARP) were unchanged.	1434	1619
27464336	Lipolytic enzymes (ATGL and HSL phosphorylation) were increased and lipogenic regulators (PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha) were decreased in eWAT by alcohol.	1620	1770
27464336	Although alcohol increased TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta mRNA, no change in key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, ACS, and cleaved caspase-1) was detected suggesting alcohol did not increase pyroptosis.	1771	1984
27464336	Plasma insulin did not differ between groups.	1985	2030
27464336	CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the alcohol-induced decrease in whole-body fat mass resulted in part from activation of autophagy in eWAT as protein synthesis was increased and mediated by the specific increase in the activity of S6K1.	2031	2278
27491646	Gartanin induces cell cycle arrest and autophagy and suppresses migration involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signalling pathway in human glioma cells.	0	148
27491646	In central nervous system, glioma is the most common primary brain tumour.	149	223
27491646	The diffuse migration and rapid proliferation are main obstacles for successful treatment.	224	314
27491646	Gartanin, a natural xanthone of mangosteen, suppressed proliferation, migration and colony formation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in T98G glioma cells but not in mouse normal neuronal HT22 cells.	315	527
27491646	Gartanin, at low micromole, led to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase accompanied by inhibited expression level of G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1, while increased expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1.	528	761
27491646	In addition, the secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 (MMP-2/-9) were significantly suppressed in T98G cells treated with gartanin, and it might result from modulating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling pathway in T98G glioma cells.	762	1030
27491646	Moreover, gartanin significantly induced autophagy in T98G cells and increased GFP-LC3 punctate fluorescence accompanied by the increased expression level of Beclin 1 and LC3-II, while suppressed expression level of p62.	1031	1251
27491646	Gartanin treatment resulted in obvious inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, which is important in modulating autophagy.	1252	1382
27491646	Notably, gartanin-mediated anti-viability was significantly abrogated by autophagy inhibitors including 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ).	1383	1531
27491646	These results indicate that anti-proliferation effect of gartanin in T98G cells is most likely via cell cycle arrest modulated by autophagy, which is regulated by PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, while anti-migration effect is most likely via suppression of MMP-2/-9 activity which is involved in MAPK signalling pathway.	1532	1854
27509880	Combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide and 5-fluorouracil upregulates major histocompatibility complex class II and p21 genes and activates caspase-3/7 in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells.	0	211
27509880	Epigenetic anticancer drugs such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been combined with existing anticancer drugs for synergistic or additive effects.	212	372
27509880	In the present study, we found that a very low concentration of depsipeptide, an HDAC inhibitor, potentiated the antitumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a human colon cancer cell model using HCT-116, HT29, and SW48 cells via the inhibition of colony formation ability or cellular viability.	373	670
27509880	Exposure to a combination of 5-FU (1.75 uM) and 1 nM depsipeptide for 24 and 48 h resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in activated caspase-3/7, while 5-FU alone failed to activate caspase-3/7.	671	863
27509880	Microarray and subsequent gene ontology analyses revealed that compared to 5-FU or depsipeptide alone, the combination treatment of 5-FU and depsipeptide upregulated genes related to cell death and the apoptotic process consistent with the inhibition of colony formation and caspase-3/7 activation.	864	1162
27509880	These analyses indicated marked upregulation of antigen processing and presentation of peptide or polysaccharide antigen via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class (GO:0002504) and MHC protein complex (GO:0042611).	1163	1383
27509880	Compared with vehicle controls, the cells treated with the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide showed marked induction (3- to 8.5-fold) of expression of MHC class II genes, but not of MHC class I genes.	1384	1587
27509880	Furthermore, our global analysis of gene expression, which was focused on genes involved in the molecular regulation of MHC class II genes, showed enhancement of pro-apoptotic PCAF and CIITA after the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide.	1588	1826
27509880	These results may indicate a closer relationship between elevation of MHC class II expression and cellular apoptosis induced by the combination of depsipeptide and 5-FU.	1827	1996
27509880	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide induces human colon cancer cell apoptosis in a concerted manner with the induction of MHC class II gene expression.	1997	2222
27630165	Long-Lived CD4+IFN-g+ T Cells rather than Short-Lived CD4+IFN-g+IL-10+ T Cells Initiate Rapid IL-10 Production To Suppress Anamnestic T Cell Responses during Secondary Malaria Infection.	0	186
27630165	CD4(+) T cells that produce IFN-g are the source of host-protective IL-10 during primary infection with a number of different pathogens, including Plasmodium spp.	187	349
27630165	The fate of these CD4(+)IFN-g(+)IL-10(+) T cells following clearance of primary infection and their subsequent influence on the course of repeated infections is, however, presently unknown.	350	539
27630165	In this study, utilizing IFN-g-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and IL-10-GFP dual reporter mice, we show that primary malaria infection-induced CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cells have limited memory potential, do not stably express IL-10, and are disproportionately lost from the Ag-experienced CD4(+) T cell memory population during the maintenance phase postinfection.	540	903
27630165	CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cells generally exhibited a short-lived effector rather than effector memory T cell phenotype postinfection and expressed high levels of PD-1, Lag-3, and TIGIT, indicative of cellular exhaustion.	904	1120
27630165	Consistently, the surviving CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(+) T cell-derived cells were unresponsive and failed to proliferate during the early phase of secondary infection.	1121	1279
27630165	In contrast, CD4(+)YFP(+)GFP(-) T cell-derived cells expanded rapidly and upregulated IL-10 expression during secondary infection.	1280	1410
27630165	Correspondingly, CD4(+) T cells were the major producers within an accelerated and amplified IL-10 response during the early stage of secondary malaria infection.	1411	1573
27630165	Notably, IL-10 exerted quantitatively stronger regulatory effects on innate and CD4(+) T cell responses during primary and secondary infections, respectively.	1574	1732
27630165	The results in this study significantly improve our understanding of the durability of IL-10-producing CD4(+) T cells postinfection and provide information on how IL-10 may contribute to optimized parasite control and prevention of immune-mediated pathology during repeated malaria infections.	1733	2026
27643404	Alcohol consumption and prostate cancer incidence and progression: A Mendelian randomisation study.	0	99
27643404	Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in developed countries, and is a target for risk reduction strategies.	100	219
27643404	The effects of alcohol consumption on prostate cancer incidence and survival remain unclear, potentially due to methodological limitations of observational studies.	220	384
27643404	In this study, we investigated the associations of genetic variants in alcohol-metabolising genes with prostate cancer incidence and survival.	385	527
27643404	We analysed data from 23,868 men with prostate cancer and 23,051 controls from 25 studies within the international PRACTICAL Consortium.	528	664
27643404	Study-specific associations of 68 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 alcohol-metabolising genes (Alcohol Dehydrogenases (ADHs) and Aldehyde Dehydrogenases (ALDHs)) with prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer-specific mortality, by grade, were assessed using logistic and Cox regression models, respectively.	665	988
27643404	The data across the 25 studies were meta-analysed using fixed-effect and random-effects models.	989	1084
27643404	We found little evidence that variants in alcohol metabolising genes were associated with prostate cancer diagnosis.	1085	1201
27643404	Four variants in two genes exceeded the multiple testing threshold for associations with prostate cancer mortality in fixed-effect meta-analyses.	1202	1347
27643404	SNPs within ALDH1A2 associated with prostate cancer mortality were rs1441817 (fixed effects hazard ratio, HRfixed  = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (95%CI):0.66,0.91; p values = 0.002); rs12910509, HRfixed  = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.003); and rs8041922 (HRfixed  = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91; p values = 0.002).	1348	1665
27643404	These SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium with each other.	1666	1724
27643404	In ALDH1B1, rs10973794 (HRfixed  = 1.43; 95%CI:1.14,1.79; p values = 0.002) was associated with prostate cancer mortality in men with low-grade prostate cancer.	1725	1885
27643404	These results suggest that alcohol consumption is unlikely to affect prostate cancer incidence, but it may influence disease progression.	1886	2023
27729412	Reduced adiponectin expression after high-fat diet is associated with selective up-regulation of ALDH1A1 and further retinoic acid receptor signaling in adipose tissue.	0	168
27729412	Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived adipokine with potent antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic activity.	169	289
27729412	Long-term, high-fat diet results in gain of body weight, adiposity, further inflammatory-based cardiovascular diseases, and reduced adiponectin secretion.	290	444
27729412	Vitamin A derivatives/retinoids are involved in several of these processes, which mainly take place in white adipose tissue (WAT).	445	575
27729412	In this study, we examined adiponectin expression as a function of dietary high-fat and high-vitamin A conditions in mice.	576	698
27729412	A decrease of adiponectin expression in addition to an up-regulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 (ALDH1A1), retinoid signaling, and retinoic acid response element signaling was selectively observed in WAT of mice fed a normal-vitamin A, high-fat diet.	699	951
27729412	Reduced adiponectin expression in WAT was also observed in mice fed a high-vitamin A diet.	952	1042
27729412	Adipocyte cell culture revealed that endogenous and synthetic retinoic acid receptor (RAR)a- and RARg-selective agonists, as well as a synthetic retinoid X receptor agonist, efficiently reduced adiponectin expression, whereas ALDH1A1 expression only increased with RAR agonists.	1043	1321
27729412	We conclude that reduced adiponectin expression under high-fat dietary conditions is dependent on 1) increased ALDH1A1 expression in adipocytes, which does not increase all-trans-retinoic acid levels; 2) further RAR ligand-induced, WAT-selective, increased retinoic acid response element-mediated signaling; and 3) RAR ligand-dependent reduction of adiponectin expression.-Landrier, J.-F., Kasiri, E., Karkeni, E., Mihaly, J., Beke, G., Weiss, K., Lucas, R., Aydemir, G., Salles, J., Walrand, S., de Lera, A. R., Ruhl, R.	1322	1843
27729412	Reduced adiponectin expression after high-fat diet is associated with selective up-regulation of ALDH1A1 and further retinoic acid receptor signaling in adipose tissue.	1844	2012
27798239	Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIb negatively regulates invadopodia formation and suppresses an invasive cellular phenotype.	0	123
27798239	The type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KII) enzymes synthesize the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), which has been detected at the Golgi complex and endosomal compartments and recruits clathrin adaptors.	124	350
27798239	Despite common mechanistic similarities between the isoforms, the extent of their redundancy is unclear.	351	455
27798239	We found that depletion of PI4KIIa and PI4KIIb using small interfering RNA led to actin remodeling.	456	555
27798239	Depletion of PI4KIIb also induced the formation of invadopodia containing membrane type I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP).	556	681
27798239	Depletion of PI4KII isoforms also differentially affected trans-Golgi network (TGN) pools of PI(4)P and post-TGN traffic.	682	803
27798239	PI4KIIb depletion caused increased MT1-MMP trafficking to invasive structures at the plasma membrane and was accompanied by reduced colocalization of MT1-MMP with membranes containing the endosomal markers Rab5 and Rab7 but increased localization with the exocytic Rab8.	804	1074
27798239	Depletion of PI4KIIb was sufficient to confer an aggressive invasive phenotype on minimally invasive HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines.	1075	1202
27798239	Mining oncogenomic databases revealed that loss of the PI4K2B allele and underexpression of PI4KIIb mRNA are associated with human cancers.	1203	1342
27798239	This finding supports the cell data and suggests that PI4KIIb may be a clinically significant suppressor of invasion.	1343	1460
27798239	We propose that PI4KIIb synthesizes a pool of PI(4)P that maintains MT1-MMP traffic in the degradative pathway and suppresses the formation of invadopodia.	1461	1616
27840894	Seven novel and six de novo PHEX gene mutations in patients with hypophosphatemic rickets.	0	90
27840894	Inactivating mutations in phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidase on the X chromosome (PHEX) have been identified as a cause of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH; OMIM 307800).	91	291
27840894	In the present study, we enrolled 43 patients from 18 unrelated families clinically diagnosed with hypophosphatemic rickets and 250 healthy controls.	292	441
27840894	For each available individual, all 22 exons with their exon-intron boundaries of the PHEX gene were directly sequenced.	442	561
27840894	The levels of serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) were measured as well.	562	640
27840894	Sequencing analysis detected 17 different PHEX gene mutations, and 7 of these were identified as novel: 3 missense mutations, including c.304G>A (p.Gly102Arg) in exon 3, c.229T>C (p.Cys77Arg) in exon 3 and c.824T>C (p.Leu275Pro) in exon 7; 2 deletion mutations, including c.528delT (p.Glu177LysfsX44) in exon 5 and c.1234delA (p.Ser412ValfsX12) in exon 11; and 2 alternative splicing mutations, including c.436_436+1delAG in intron 4 at splicing donor sites and c.1483-1G>C in intron 13 at splicing acceptor sites.	641	1155
27840894	Moreover, 6 mutations were proven to be de novo in 6 sporadic cases and the probands were all females.	1156	1258
27840894	No mutations were found in the 250 healthy controls.	1259	1311
27840894	The serum levels of FGF23 varied widely among the patients with XLH, and no significant difference was found when compared with those of the healthy controls.	1312	1470
27840894	On the whole, the findings of this study provide new insight into the spectrum of PHEX mutations and provide potential evidence of a critical domain in PHEX protein.	1471	1636
27840894	In addition, the finding of an overlap of the serum FGF23 levels between the patients with XLH and the healthy controls indicates its limited diagnostic value in XLH.	1637	1803
27860244	Role of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in inflammation and migration of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis.	0	131
27860244	To probe the role of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in regulating inflammation, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	132	353
27860244	FLSs were separated from synovial tissues (STs) from patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA).	354	448
27860244	An inhibitor of PRMT5 (EPZ015666) and short interference RNA (siRNA) against PRMT5 were used to inhibit PRMT5 expression.	449	570
27860244	The standard of protein was measured by Western blot or immunofluorescence.	571	646
27860244	The excretion and genetic expression of inflammatory factors were, respectively, estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).	647	829
27860244	Migration and invasion in vitro were detected by Boyden chamber assay.	830	900
27860244	FLSs proliferation was detected by BrdU incorporation.	901	955
27860244	Increased PRMT5 was discovered in STs and FLSs from patients with RA.	956	1025
27860244	In RA FLSs, the level of PRMT5 was up-regulated by stimulation with IL-1b and TNF-a.	1026	1110
27860244	Inhibition of PRMT5 by EPZ015666 and siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced IL-6 and IL-8 production, and proliferation of RA FLSs.	1111	1236
27860244	In addition, inhibition of PRMT5 decreased in vitro migration and invasion of RA FLSs.	1237	1323
27860244	Furthermore, EPZ015666 restrained the phosphorylation of IkB kinaseb and IkBa, as well as nucleus transsituation of p65 as well as AKT in FLSs.	1324	1467
27860244	PRMT5 regulated the production of inflammatory factors, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of RA FLS, which was mediated by the NF-kB and AKT pathways.	1468	1627
27860244	Our data suggested that targeting PRMT5 to prevent synovial inflammation and destruction might be a promising therapy for RA.	1628	1753
27866394	Repeated otilonium bromide administration prevents neurotransmitter changes in colon of rats underwent to wrap restraint stress.	0	128
27866394	Otilonium bromide (OB) is a spasmolytic drug successfully used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).	129	244
27866394	Its efficacy has been attributed to the block of L- and T-type Ca(2+) channels and muscarinic and tachykinin receptors in the smooth muscle.	245	385
27866394	Furthermore, in healthy rats, repeated OB administration modified neurotransmitter expression and function suggesting other mechanisms of action.	386	531
27866394	On this basis, we investigated whether repeated OB treatment prevented the functional and neurochemical changes observed in the colon of rats underwent to wrap restrain stress (WRS) a psychosocial stressor considered suitable to reproduce the main IBS signs and symptoms.	532	803
27866394	In control, WRS and OB/WRS rats functional parameters were measured in vivo and morphological investigations were done ex vivo in the colon.	804	944
27866394	The results showed that OB counteracts most of the neurotransmitters changes caused by WRS.	945	1036
27866394	In particular, the drug prevents the decrease in SP-, NK1r-, nNOS-, VIP-, and S100b-immunoreactivity (IR) and the increase in CGRP-, and CRF1r-IR.	1037	1183
27866394	On the contrary, OB does not affect the increase in CRF2r-IR neurons observed in WRS rats and does not interfere with the mild mucosal inflammation due to WRS.	1184	1343
27866394	Finally, OB per se increases the Mr2 expression in the muscle wall and decreases the number of the myenteric ChAT-IR neurons.	1344	1469
27866394	Functional findings show a significantly reduction in the number of spontaneous abdominal contraction in OB treated rats.	1470	1591
27866394	The ability of OB to block L-type Ca(2+) channels, also expressed by enteric neurons, might represent a possible mechanism through which OB exerts its actions.	1592	1751
27930654	Whole-Organism Developmental Expression Profiling Identifies RAB-28 as a Novel Ciliary GTPase Associated with the BBSome and Intraflagellar Transport.	0	150
27930654	Primary cilia are specialised sensory and developmental signalling devices extending from the surface of most eukaryotic cells.	151	278
27930654	Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs.	279	507
27930654	Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome.	508	774
27930654	To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate.	775	969
27930654	Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161 (FAM161A orthologue), CCDC-104 (CCDC104), and RPI-1 (RP1/RP1L1), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms.	970	1244
27930654	From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components.	1245	1393
27930654	Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains.	1394	1621
27930654	Whereas inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT.	1622	1838
27930654	Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function.	1839	2092
27930654	Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil RAB28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL4/IFT27, as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.	2093	2371
27941998	Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1(VDAC1) Participates the Apoptosis of the Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Desminopathy.	0	117
27941998	Desminopathies caused by the mutation in the gene coding for desmin are genetically protein aggregation myopathies.	118	233
27941998	Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of pathological changes in the desminopathies at the earliest stage.	234	335
27941998	The molecular mechanisms of mitochondria dysfunction in desminopathies remain exclusive.	336	424
27941998	VDAC1 regulates mitochondrial uptake across the outer membrane and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).	425	545
27941998	Relationships between desminopathies and Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) remain unclear.	546	644
27941998	Here we successfully constructed the desminopathy rat model, evaluated with conventional stains, containing hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Gomori Trichrome (MGT), (PAS), red oil (ORO), NADH-TR, SDH staining and immunohistochemistry.	645	874
27941998	Immunofluorescence results showed that VDAC1 was accumulated in the desmin highly stained area of muscle fibers of desminopathy patients or desminopathy rat model compared to the normal ones.	875	1066
27941998	Meanwhile apoptosis related proteins bax and ATF2 were involved in desminopathy patients and desminopathy rat model, but not bcl-2, bcl-xl or HK2.VDAC1 and desmin are closely relevant in the tissue splices of deminopathies patients and rats with desminopathy at protein lever.	1067	1343
27941998	Moreover, apoptotic proteins are also involved in the desminopathies, like bax, ATF2, but not bcl-2, bcl-xl or HK2.	1344	1459
27941998	This pathological analysis presents the correlation between VDAC1 and desmin, and apoptosis related proteins are correlated in the desminopathy.	1460	1604
27941998	Furthermore, we provide a rat model of desminopathy for the investigation of desmin related myopathy.	1605	1706
27959382	Bach1 siRNA attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by modulating oxidative stress in mice.	0	99
27959382	Oxidative stress plays an essential role in inflammation and fibrosis.	100	170
27959382	Bach1 is an important transcriptional repressor that acts by modulating oxidative stress and represents a potential target in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis (PF).	171	338
27959382	In this study, we knocked down Bach1 using adenovirus-mediated small interfering RNA (siRNA) to determine whether the use of Bach1 siRNA is an effective therapeutic strategy in mice with bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF.	339	553
27959382	Mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were incubated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 (5 ng/ml) and subsequently infected with recombined adenovirus-like Bach1 siRNA1 and Bach1 siRNA2, while an empty adenovirus vector was used as the negative control.	554	805
27959382	The selected Bach1 siRNA with higher interference efficiency was used for the animal experiments.	806	903
27959382	A mouse model of BLM-induced PF was established, and Bach1 siRNA (1x109 pfu) was administered to the mice via the tail vein.	904	1028
27959382	The results revealed that the Bach1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly downregulated by Bach1 siRNA.	1029	1137
27959382	Furthermore, the MLFs infected with Bach1 siRNA exhibited increased mRNA and protein expression levels of heme oxygenase-1 and glutathione peroxidase 1, but decreased levels of TGF-b1 and interleukin-6 in the cell supernatants compared with the cells exposed to TGF-b1 alone.	1138	1413
27959382	Bach1 knockdown by siRNA also enhanced the expression of antioxidant factors, but suppressed that of fibrosis-related cytokines in mice compared with the BLM group.	1414	1578
27959382	Finally, the inflammatory infiltration of alveolar and interstitial cells and the destruction of lung structure were significantly attenuated in the mide administered Bach1 siRNA compared with those in the BLM group.	1579	1795
27959382	On the whole, our findings demonstrate that Bach1 siRNA exerts protective effects against BLM-induced PF in mice.	1796	1909
27959382	Our data may provide the basis for the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies for PF.	1910	2009
27959387	Long-term exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to ethanol stimulates oncogenic features.	0	89
27959387	Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer.	90	145
27959387	Little is known regarding the mechanism, although it is assumed that acetaldehyde or estrogen mediated pathways play a role.	146	270
27959387	We previously showed that long-term exposure to 2.5 mM ethanol (blood alcohol ~0.012%) of MCF-12A, a human normal epithelial breast cell line, induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oncogenic transformation.	271	491
27959387	In this study, we investigated in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, whether a similar exposure to ethanol at concentrations ranging up to peak blood levels in heavy drinkers would increase malignant progression.	492	710
27959387	Short-term (1-week) incubation to ethanol at as low as 1-5 mM (corresponding to blood alcohol concentration of ~0.0048-0.024%) upregulated the stem cell related proteins Oct4 and Nanog, but they were reduced after exposure at 25 mM.	711	943
27959387	Long-term (4-week) exposure to 25 mM ethanol upregulated the Oct4 and Nanog proteins, as well as the malignancy marker Ceacam6.	944	1071
27959387	DNA microarray analysis in cells exposed for 1 week showed upregulated expression of metallothionein genes, particularly MT1X.	1072	1198
27959387	Long-term exposure upregulated expression of some malignancy related genes (STEAP4, SERPINA3, SAMD9, GDF15, KRT15, ITGB6, TP63, and PGR, as well as the CEACAM, interferon related, and HLA gene families).	1199	1402
27959387	Some of these findings were validated by RT-PCR.	1403	1451
27959387	A similar treatment also modulated numerous microRNAs (miRs) including one regulator of Oct4 as well as miRs involved in oncogenesis and/or malignancy, with only a few estrogen-induced miRs.	1452	1642
27959387	Long-term 25 mM ethanol also induced a 5.6-fold upregulation of anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of malignant-like features.	1643	1777
27959387	Exposure to acetaldehyde resulted in little or no effect comparable to that of ethanol.	1778	1865
27959387	The previously shown alcohol induction of oncogenic transformation of normal breast cells is now complemented by the current results suggesting alcohol's potential involvement in malignant progression of breast cancer.	1866	2084
27993978	CenpH regulates meiotic G2/M transition by modulating the APC/CCdh1-cyclin B1 pathway in oocytes.	0	97
27993978	Meiotic resumption (G2/M transition) and progression through meiosis I (MI) are two key stages for producing fertilization-competent eggs.	98	236
27993978	Here, we report that CenpH, a component of the kinetochore inner plate, is responsible for G2/M transition in meiotic mouse oocytes.	237	369
27993978	Depletion of CenpH by morpholino injection decreased cyclin B1 levels, resulting in attenuation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation, and severely compromised meiotic resumption.	370	559
27993978	CenpH protects cyclin B1 from destruction by competing with the action of APC/C(Cdh1) Impaired G2/M transition after CenpH depletion could be rescued by expression of exogenous cyclin B1.	560	747
27993978	Unexpectedly, blocking CenpH did not affect spindle organization and meiotic cell cycle progression after germinal vesicle breakdown.	748	881
27993978	Our findings reveal a novel role of CenpH in regulating meiotic G2/M transition by acting via the APC/C(Cdh1)-cyclin B1 pathway.	882	1010
27999109	A Critical Role for the Type I Interferon Receptor in Virus-Induced Autoimmune Diabetes in Rats.	0	96
27999109	The pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes, characterized by immune-mediated damage of insulin-producing b-cells of pancreatic islets, may involve viral infection.	97	259
27999109	Essential components of the innate immune antiviral response, including type I interferon (IFN) and IFN receptor-mediated signaling pathways, are candidates for determining susceptibility to human type 1 diabetes.	260	473
27999109	Numerous aspects of human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis are recapitulated in the LEW.1WR1 rat model.	474	573
27999109	Diabetes can be induced in LEW.1WR1 weanling rats challenged with virus or with the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C).	574	715
27999109	We hypothesized that disrupting the cognate type I IFN receptor (type I IFN a/b receptor [IFNAR]) to interrupt IFN signaling would prevent or delay the development of virus-induced diabetes.	716	906
27999109	We generated IFNAR1 subunit-deficient LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9) genome editing and confirmed functional disruption of the Ifnar1 gene.	907	1128
27999109	IFNAR1 deficiency significantly delayed the onset and frequency of diabetes and greatly reduced the intensity of insulitis after poly I:C treatment.	1129	1277
27999109	The occurrence of Kilham rat virus-induced diabetes was also diminished in IFNAR1-deficient animals.	1278	1378
27999109	These findings firmly establish that alterations in innate immunity influence the course of autoimmune diabetes and support the use of targeted strategies to limit or prevent the development of type 1 diabetes.	1379	1589
28068934	Concordance between PIK3CA mutations in endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	0	130
28068934	BACKGROUND: PIK3CA mutations are expected to be potential therapeutic targets for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).	131	255
28068934	We aimed to clarify the concordance between PIK3CA mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy specimens and corresponding surgically resected specimens.	256	405
28068934	METHODS: We examined five hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene (E542K, E545K, E546K, H1047R, and H1047L) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of paired endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from 181 patients undergoing curative resection for ESCC between 2000 and 2011 using a Luminex technology-based multiplex gene mutation detection kit.	406	779
28068934	RESULTS: Mutation analyses were successfully performed for both endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in all the cases.	780	913
28068934	A PIK3CA mutation was detected in either type of specimen in 13 cases (7.2%, 95% confidence interval: 3.9-12.0).	914	1026
28068934	The overall concordance rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.3% (178/181), 90.9% (10/11), and 98.8% (168/170), respectively.	1027	1185
28068934	Among patients with a PIK3CA mutation detected in both types of specimens, the concordance between PIK3CA mutation genotypes was 100%.	1186	1320
28068934	There were three cases with a discordant mutation status between the types of specimens (PIK3CA mutation in surgically resected specimen and wild-type in biopsy specimen in two cases, and the opposite pattern in one case), suggesting possible intratumoral heterogeneity in the PIK3CA mutation status.	1321	1621
28068934	CONCLUSIONS: The PIK3CA mutation status was highly concordant between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from the same patient, suggesting that endoscopic biopsy specimens can be clinically used to detect PIK3CA mutations in patients with ESCC.	1622	1883
28075473	Spirulina lipopolysaccharides inhibit tumor growth in a Toll-like receptor 4-dependent manner by altering the cytokine milieu from interleukin-17/interleukin-23 to interferon-g. Th17 cells and the cytokine they produce, interleukin (IL)-17, play an important role in tumor progression in humans and in mice.	0	307
28075473	IL-6 and IL-23 are critical cytokines for the differentiation and propagation of Th17 cells, respectively.	308	414
28075473	Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are known to stimulate immune cells to produce such inflammatory cytokines.	415	526
28075473	Contrary to Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS, LPS from Spirulina has low toxicity and barely induces in vivo production of IL-6 and IL-23 in mice.	527	671
28075473	We examined the antitumor effects of Spirulina LPS compared to E. coli LPS in an MH134 hepatoma model.	672	774
28075473	Administration of Spirulina LPS suppressed tumor growth in C3H/HeN mice, but not in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mutant C3H/HeJ mice, by reducing serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23, while increasing interferon (IFN)-g levels.	775	996
28075473	The antitumor activity and IFN-g production were mediated by T cells.	997	1066
28075473	Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that Spirulina LPS impaired the antigen-presenting function that supports the generation of IL-17-producing cells in a toll-like receptor (TLR)4-dependent manner.	1067	1267
28075473	Of note, injection of anti-IL-17 antibody in tumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice in the absence of Spirulina LPS markedly suppressed tumor growth and augmented IFN-g responses.	1268	1435
28075473	Thus, our results support the notion that IFN-g and IL-17/IL-23 mutually regulate Th17 and Th1 responses in tumor-bearing hosts, and Spirulina LPS modulates the balance of the IFN-g-IL-17/IL-23 axis towards IFN-g production, which leads to tumor inhibition.	1436	1693
28075473	Furthermore, Spirulina LPS effectively inhibited the spontaneous development of mammary tumors.	1694	1789
28075473	This study has important implications for the exploitation of TLR-based immunomodulators for cancer immunotherapy.	1790	1904
28101574	NEK2 serves as a prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.	0	67
28101574	Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 (NEK2) is a microtubule-associated protein that regulates spindle assembly in human cells and is overexpressed in various malignancies.	68	251
28101574	However, the role of NEK2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains undetermined.	252	333
28101574	We performed RNA-seq of the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and the normal liver cell line HL-7702 using the Ion Proton System.	334	453
28101574	NEK2 expression was detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in two cell lines and 5 matched HCC and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues.	454	626
28101574	The correlation between survival and NEK2 expression was analyzed in 359 patients with HCC using RNASeqV2 data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/).	627	830
28101574	The expression of NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 63 cases of HCC and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues.	831	982
28101574	Relationships between protein expression and clinicopathological parameters were assessed, and the correlations between NEK2 with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expressions were evaluated.	983	1162
28101574	A total of 610 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were revealed in the transcriptome comparison, 297 of which were upregulated and 313 were downregulated in HCC.	1163	1327
28101574	NEK2, as the most obviously different DEG in cells and tissues from the RNA-seq data, was listed as an HCC candidate biomarker for further verification.	1328	1480
28101574	NEK2 was overexpressed in HCC cells and tissues (P=0.002, P=0.013) and HCC patients with a high expression of NEK2 had a poor prognosis (P=0.0145).	1481	1628
28101574	Clinical analysis indicated that the overexpression of NEK2 in HCC was significantly correlated with diolame complete (P<0.001), tumor nodule number (P=0.012) and recurrence (P=0.004).	1629	1813
28101574	NEK2 expression was positively correlated with the expression of phospho-AKT (r=0.883, P<0.01) and MMP-2 (r=0.781, P<0.01).	1814	1937
28101574	Overexpression of NEK2 was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and poor patient outcomes, suggesting that NEK2 serves as a prognostic biomarker for HCC.	1938	2106
28101574	Alteration of NEK2 protein levels may contribute to invasion and metastasis of HCC, which may occur through activation of AKT signaling and promotion of MMP-2 expression.	2107	2277
28148288	Metalloprotease-disintegrin ADAM12 actively promotes the stem cell-like phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer.	0	111
28148288	BACKGROUND: ADAM12 is upregulated in human breast cancers and is a predictor of chemoresistance in estrogen receptor-negative tumors.	112	245
28148288	ADAM12 is induced during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a feature associated with claudin-low breast tumors, which are enriched in cancer stem cell (CSC) markers.	246	415
28148288	It is currently unknown whether ADAM12 plays an active role in promoting the CSC phenotype in breast cancer cells.	416	530
28148288	METHODS: ADAM12 expression was downregulated in representative claudin-low breast cancer cell lines, SUM159PT and Hs578T, using siRNA transfection or inducible shRNA expression.	531	708
28148288	Cell characteristics commonly associated with the CSC phenotype in vitro (cell migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, mammosphere formation, ALDH activity, and expression of the CD44 and CD24 cell surface markers) and in vivo (tumor formation in mice using limiting dilution transplantation assays) were evaluated.	709	1025
28148288	RNA sequencing was performed to identify global gene expression changes after ADAM12 knockdown.	1026	1121
28148288	RESULTS: We found that sorted SUM159PT cell populations with high ADAM12 levels had elevated expression of CSC markers and an increased ability to form mammospheres.	1122	1287
28148288	ADAM12 knockdown reduced cell migration and invasion, decreased anoikis resistance, and compromised mammosphere formation.	1288	1410
28148288	ADAM12 knockdown also diminished ALDEFLUOR(+) and CD44(hi)/CD24(-/lo) CSC-enriched populations in vitro and reduced tumorigenesis in mice in vivo. RNA sequencing identified a significant overlap between ADAM12- and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-regulated genes.	1411	1682
28148288	Consequently, ADAM12 knockdown lowered the basal activation level of EGFR, and this effect was abolished by batimastat, a metalloproteinase inhibitor.	1683	1833
28148288	Furthermore, incubation of cells with exogenously added EGF prevented the downregulation of CD44(hi)/CD24(-/lo) cell population by ADAM12 knockdown.	1834	1982
28148288	CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ADAM12 actively supports the CSC phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer cells via modulation of the EGFR pathway.	1983	2137
28151486	Star-PAP, a poly(A) polymerase, functions as a tumor suppressor in an orthotopic human breast cancer model.	0	107
28151486	Star-PAP is a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase and required for the expression of a select set of mRNAs.	108	211
28151486	However, the pathological role of Star-PAP in cancer largely remains unknown.	212	289
28151486	In this study, we observed decreased expression of Star-PAP in breast cancer cell lines and tissues.	290	390
28151486	Ectopic Star-PAP expression inhibited proliferation as well as colony-forming ability of breast cancer cells.	391	500
28151486	In breast cancer patients, high levels of Star-PAP correlated with an improved prognosis.	501	590
28151486	Moreover, by regulating the expression of BIK (BCL2-interacting killer), Star-PAP induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway.	591	748
28151486	The growth of breast cancer xenografts in NOD/SCID mice was also inhibited by the doxycycline-induced Star-PAP overexpression.	749	875
28151486	Furthermore, Star-PAP sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs both in vitro and in vivo.	876	977
28151486	In mammary epithelial cells, Star-PAP knockdown partially transformed these cells and induced them to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).	978	1128
28151486	These findings suggested that Star-PAP possesses tumor-suppressing activity and can be a valuable target for developing new cancer therapeutic strategies.	1129	1283
28204828	TIEG1 deficiency confers enhanced myocardial protection in the infarcted heart by mediating the Pten/Akt signalling pathway.	0	124
28204828	The transforming growth factor (TGF)-b-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1) plays a crucial role in modulating cell apoptosis and proliferation in a number of diseases, including pancreatic cancer, leukaemia and osteoporosis.	125	344
28204828	However, the functional role of TIEG1 in the heart has not been fully defined.	345	423
28204828	In this study, we first investigated the role of TIEG1 in ischaemic heart disease.	424	506
28204828	For in vitro experiments, cardiomyocytes were isolated from both TIEG1 knockout (KO) and wile-type (WT) mice, and the apoptotic ratios were evaluated after a 48-h ischaemic insult.	507	687
28204828	A cell proliferation assay was performed after 7 days of incubation under normoxic conditions.	688	782
28204828	In addition, the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells was determined by tube formation assay.	783	880
28204828	For in vivo experiments, a model of myocardial infarction (MI) was established using both TIEG1 KO and WT mice.	881	992
28204828	Echocardiography was performed at 3 and 28 days post-MI, whereas the haemodynamics test was performed 28 days post-MI.	993	1111
28204828	Histological analyses of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis and infarct zone assessments were performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining, BrdU immunostaining, a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)/CD31 immunostaining and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively.	1112	1431
28204828	Changes in the expression of related proteins caused by TIEG1 deficiency were confirmed using both reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis.	1432	1628
28204828	Our results demonstrated that the absence of TIEG1 prevented cardiomyocytes from undergoing apoptosis and promoted higher proliferation; it stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.	1629	1840
28204828	Improved cardiac function and less scar formation were observed in TIEG1 KO mice, and we also observed the altered expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), Akt and Bcl-2/Bax, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).	1841	2081
28204828	On the whole, our findings indicate that the absence of TIEG1 plays a cardioprotective role in ischaemic heart disease by promoting changes in Pten/Akt signalling.	2082	2245
28259923	Pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition via Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway in human colorectal adenocarcinoma.	0	145
28259923	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step in the acquisition of metastatic and invasive power for tumor cells.	146	273
28259923	Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) is a common cancer where metastasis is directly linked to patient survival.	274	381
28259923	Recent studies show that pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 (PLAGL2) could induce tumor EMT and is an independent predictive factor associated with poor prognosis in cancer.	382	552
28259923	In the present study, we confirmed the role of PLAGL2 in the prognosis of CRC patients and provide molecular evidence of PLAGL2 promoted EMT in CRC cell line SW480.	553	717
28259923	We found that PLAGL2 expression was upregulated in the paraffin-embedded CRC tissues compared to borderline or benign tissues.	718	844
28259923	Experimental EMT induced by PLAGL2 plasmid transfection proved PLAGL2 protein overexpression could enhance the cell scratch wound-healing and transwell ability and significantly upregulated mesenchymal marker proteins, N-cadherin and vimentin and concurrently downregulated epithelial marker of E-cadherin.	845	1151
28259923	Subsequently, through western blot assay, we found that PLAGL2 could activate the wnt-signaling component b-catenin in the nuclei.	1152	1282
28259923	More CRC cell metastasis to the lungs was observed when the PLAGL2 overexpressing SW480 cells were injected into the tail vein of rats, compared with the cell control and PLAGL2 silence group.	1283	1475
28259923	Our findings indicated that PLAGL2 might be a very upstream key molecule regulating EMT involved in Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway.	1476	1608
28260056	Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor-mediated cell survival in hypoxia depends on the promotion of autophagy via suppression of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.	0	165
28260056	Hypoxia is widely accepted as a fundamental biological phenomenon, which is strongly associated with tissue damage and cell viability under stress conditions.	166	324
28260056	Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is known to protect tissues from multiple types of damage, and protect cells from apoptosis.	325	454
28260056	Hypoxia is a regulatory factor of the IGF system, however the role of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in hypoxia-induced apoptosis remains unclear.	455	598
28260056	The present study investigated the potential mechanisms associated with IGF-1R-associated apoptosis under hypoxic conditions.	599	724
28260056	Mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibiting disruption or overexpression of IGF-1R (R- cells and R+ cells) were used to examine the level of apoptosis, autophagy, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).	725	931
28260056	The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine was used to assess the effect of autophagy on ROS production and apoptosis under hypoxic conditions.	932	1072
28260056	A potential downstream signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/threonine protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identifiedby western blot analysis.	1073	1270
28260056	The results demonstrated that hypoxia induced apoptosis, increased ROS production, and promoted autophagy in a time-dependent manner relative to that observed under normoxia.	1271	1445
28260056	R+ cells exhibited a lower percentage of apoptotic cells, lower ROS production, and higher levels of autophagy when compared to that of R- cells.	1446	1591
28260056	In addition, inhibition of autophagy led to increased ROS production and a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the two cell types.	1592	1726
28260056	Furthermore, IGF-1R is related with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and enhanced autophagy-associated protein expression, which was verified following treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002.	1727	1921
28260056	These results indicated that IGF-1R may increase cell viability under hypoxic conditions by promoting autophagy and scavenging ROS production, which is closed with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.	1922	2118
28260077	Atorvastatin protects against contrast-induced nephropathy via anti-apoptosis by the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro.	0	128
28260077	Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic acute renal failure occurring following the intravascular injection of iodinated radiographic contrast medium.	129	291
28260077	However, the regulatory mechanisms for CIN remain to be fully elucidated.	292	365
28260077	The present study aimed to investigate whether atorvastatin protects against CIN via anti-apoptotic effects by the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro.	366	524
28260077	To determine whether atorvastatin attenuated CIN, the inflammatory response and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, a rat model of iopamidol-induced CIN was used, and human embryonic proximal tubule (HK2) cell damage was assessed.	525	751
28260077	The rats were assigned into four groups (n=10 per group), as follows: Control rats; rats+atorvastatin; rats + iopamidol; rats+iopamidol+atorvastatin.	752	901
28260077	In vitro, the HK2 cells were treated with iopamidol in the presence or absence of atorvastatin, heat shock protein (Hsp)27 small interfering (si)RNA or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27.	902	1069
28260077	The renal tissues were examined histopathologically and collected for western blot analysis.	1070	1162
28260077	The results showed that atorvastatin ameliorated the apoptosis and deterioration of renal function (P<0.05).	1163	1271
28260077	Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the iopamidol-induced activity of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax)/caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in vivo and in vitro.	1272	1462
28260077	Notably, following treatment with Hsp27 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27, it was found that iopamidol enhanced or weakened the upregulation of Bax/caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 in the HK2 cells, respectively.	1463	1670
28260077	The results of the present study suggested that atorvastatin protected against contrast-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis through the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro.	1671	1851
28260110	Inhibitory effect of emodin on fatty acid synthase, colon cancer proliferation and apoptosis.	0	93
28260110	Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key anabolic enzyme for de novo fatty acid synthesis, which is important in the development of colon carcinoma.	94	237
28260110	The high expression of FASN is considered a promising molecular target for colon cancer therapy.	238	334
28260110	Emodin, a naturally occurring anthraquinone, exhibits an anticancer effect in various types of human cancer, including colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.	335	532
28260110	Cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay.	533	596
28260110	The apoptosis rate of cells was quantified via flow cytometry following Annexin V/propidium iodide staining.	597	705
28260110	FASN activity was measured by monitoring oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate at a wavelength of 340 nm, and intracellular free fatty acid levels were detected using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification kit.	706	929
28260110	Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect target gene and protein expression.	930	1059
28260110	The present study was performed to investigate whether the gene expression of FASN and its enzymatic activity are regulated by emodin in a human colon cancer cell line.	1060	1228
28260110	Emodin markedly inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells and a higher protein level of FASN was expressed, compared with that in SW480, SNU-C2A or SNU-C5 cells.	1229	1392
28260110	Emodin significantly downregulated the protein expression of FASN in HCT116 cells, which was caused by protein degradation due to elevated protein ubiquitination.	1393	1555
28260110	Emodin also inhibited intracellular FASN enzymatic activity and reduced the levels of intracellular free fatty acids.	1556	1673
28260110	Emodin enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner.	1674	1759
28260110	The combined treatment of emodin and cerulenin, a commercial FASN inhibitor, had an additive effect on these activities.	1760	1880
28260110	Palmitate, the final product of the FASN reaction, rescued emodin-induced viability and apoptosis.	1881	1979
28260110	In addition, emodin altered FASN-involved signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2.	1980	2167
28260110	These results suggested that emodin-regulated cell growth and apoptosis were mediated by inhibiting FASN and provide a molecular basis for colon cancer therapy.	2168	2328
28346429	Deletion of endothelial cell-specific liver kinase B1 increases angiogenesis and tumor growth via vascular endothelial growth factor.	0	133
28346429	Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells.	134	236
28346429	It was first identified in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome as a tumor suppressor gene.	237	314
28346429	Whether endothelial LKB1 regulates angiogenesis and tumor growth is unknown.	315	391
28346429	In this study, we generated endothelial cell-specific LKB1-knockout (LKB1(endo-/-)) mice by crossbreeding vascular endothelial-cadherin-Cre mice with LKB1(flox/flox) mice.	392	563
28346429	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was highly co-stained in endothelial cells but not in macrophages in LKB1(endo-/-) mice.	564	700
28346429	Consistently, LKB1(endo-/-) mouse tissues including the lung, skin, kidney and liver showed increased vascular permeability.	701	825
28346429	Tumors implanted in LKB1(endo-/-) mice but not macrophage-specific LKB1-knockout mice grew faster and showed enhanced vascular permeability and increased angiogenesis as compared with those implanted in wild-type mice.	826	1044
28346429	Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibody but not the isotype-matched control antibody decreased endothelial-cell angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo.	1045	1195
28346429	Furthermore, LKB1 deletion enhanced mouse retinal and cell angiogenesis, and knockdown of VEGF by small-interfering RNA decreased endothelial cell proliferation and migration.	1196	1371
28346429	Re-expression of LKB1 or knockdown of VEGF receptor 2 decreased the overproliferation and -migration observed in LKB1(endo-/-) cells.	1372	1505
28346429	Mechanistically, LKB1 could bind to the VEGF transcription factor, specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which then inhibited the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter to reduce VEGF expression.	1506	1689
28346429	Endothelial LKB1 may regulate endothelial angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating Sp1-mediated VEGF expression.	1690	1805
28368423	Myc enhances B-cell receptor signaling in precancerous B cells and confers resistance to Btk inhibition.	0	104
28368423	Dysregulation of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC induces B-cell transformation and is a driver for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).	105	247
28368423	MYC overexpression in B-NHL is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis.	248	341
28368423	Although genomic studies suggest a link between MYC overexpression and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling molecules in B-NHL, signaling pathways essential to Myc-mediated B-cell transformation have not been fully elucidated.	342	563
28368423	We utilized intracellular phospho-flow cytometry to investigate the relationship between Myc and BCR signaling in pre-malignant B cells.	564	700
28368423	Utilizing the Eu-myc mouse model, where Myc is overexpressed specifically in B cells, both basal and stimulated BCR signaling were increased in precancerous B lymphocytes from Eu-myc mice compared with wild-type littermates.	701	925
28368423	B cells overexpressing Myc displayed constitutively higher levels of activated CD79a, Btk, Plcg2 and Erk1/2.	926	1034
28368423	Notably, Myc-overexpressing B cells maintained elevated BCR signaling despite treatment with ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor.	1035	1176
28368423	Furthermore, PI3K/Akt pathway signaling was also increased in Eu-myc B cells, and this increase was partially suppressed with ibrutinib.	1177	1313
28368423	In addition, experiments with Btk-null B cells revealed off-target effects of ibrutinib on BCR signaling.	1314	1419
28368423	Our data show that in pre-malignant B cells, Myc overexpression is sufficient to activate BCR and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and further enhances signaling following BCR ligation.	1420	1600
28368423	Therefore, our results indicate that precancerous B cells have already acquired enhanced survival and growth capabilities before transformation, and that elevated MYC levels confer resistance to pharmacologic inhibitors of BCR signaling, which has significant implications for B-NHL treatment.	1601	1894
28368537	Tissue-Specific Ablation of the LIF Receptor in the Murine Uterine Epithelium Results in Implantation Failure.	0	110
28368537	The cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is essential for rendering the uterus receptive for blastocyst implantation.	111	233
28368537	In mice, LIF receptor expression (LIFR) is largely restricted to the uterine luminal epithelium (LE).	234	335
28368537	LIF, secreted from the endometrial glands (GEs), binds to the LIFR, activating the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) 3 (Jak-Stat3) signaling pathway in the LE.	336	531
28368537	JAK-STAT activation converts the LE to a receptive state so that juxtaposed blastocysts begin to implant.	532	637
28368537	To specifically delete the LIFR in the LE, we derived a line of mice in which Cre recombinase was inserted into the endogenous lactoferrin gene (Ltf-Cre).	638	792
28368537	Lactoferrin expression in the LE is induced by E2, and we demonstrate that Cre recombinase activity is restricted to the LE and GE.	793	924
28368537	To determine the requirement of the LIFR in implantation, we derived an additional mouse line carrying a conditional (floxed) Lifr flx/flx gene.	925	1069
28368537	Crossing Ltf-Cre mice with Lifr flx/flx mice generated Lifr flx/D:Ltf Cre/+ females that were overtly normal but infertile.	1070	1193
28368537	Many of these females, despite repeated matings, did not become pregnant.	1194	1267
28368537	Unimplanted blastocysts were recovered from the Lifr flx/D:Ltf Cre/+ uteri and, when transferred to wild-type recipients, implanted normally, indicating that uterine receptivity rather than the embryo's competency is compromised.	1268	1497
28368537	The loss of Lifr results in both the failure for STAT3 to translocate to the LE nuclei and a reduction in the expression of the LIF regulated gene Msx1 that regulates uterine receptivity.	1498	1685
28368537	These results reveal that uterine expression of the LIFR is essential for embryo implantation and further define the components of the LIF signaling pathway necessary for effective implantation.	1686	1880
28393239	Psoriasin promotes invasion, aggregation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells; association with disease progression.	0	119
28393239	Psoriasin (S100A7) is an 11-kDa small calcium binding protein initially isolated from psoriatic skin lesions.	120	229
28393239	It belongs to the S100 family of proteins which play an important role in a range of cell functions including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.	230	396
28393239	Aberrant Psoriasin expression has been implicated in a range of cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis.	397	513
28393239	This study examined the role of Psoriasin on pancreatic cancer cell functions and the implication in progression of the disease.	514	642
28393239	Expression of Psoriasin was determined in a cohort of pancreatic tissues comprised of 126 pancreatic tumours and 114 adjacent non-tumour pancreatic tissues.	643	799
28393239	Knockdown and overexpression of Psoriasin in pancreatic cancer cells was performed using specifically constructed plasmids, which either had anti-Psoriasin ribozyme transgene or the full length human Psoriasin coding sequence.	800	1026
28393239	Psoriasin knockdown and overexpression was verified using conventional RT-PCR and qPCR.	1027	1114
28393239	The effect of manipulating Psoriasin expression on pancreatic cancer cell functions was assessed using several in vitro cell function assays.	1115	1256
28393239	Local invasive pancreatic cancers extended beyond the pancreas expressed higher levels of Psoriasin transcripts compared with the cancers confined to the pancreas.	1257	1420
28393239	Primary tumours with distant metastases exhibited a reduced expression of Psoriasin.	1421	1505
28393239	Psoriasin overexpression cell lines exhibited significantly increased growth and migration compared to control cells.	1506	1623
28393239	In addition, Psoriasin overexpression resulted in increased pancreatic cancer cell invasion which was associated with upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9.	1624	1803
28393239	Overexpression of Psoriasin also promoted aggregation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells when they lost anchorage.	1804	1923
28393239	Taken together, higher expression of Psoriasin was associated with local invasion in pancreatic cancers.	1924	2028
28393239	Psoriasin expression is associated with pancreatic cancer cell growth, migration, cell-matrix adhesion, and invasion via regulation of MMPs.	2029	2169
28393239	As such, the proposed implications of Psoriasin in invasion, disease progression and as a potential therapeutic target warrant further investigation.	2170	2319
28398555	Biophysical and functional characterization of hippocalcin mutants responsible for human dystonia.	0	98
28398555	Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder that forces the body into twisting, repetitive movements or sometimes painful abnormal postures.	99	240
28398555	With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, the homozygous mutations T71N and A190T in the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) hippocalcin were identified as the genetic cause of primary isolated dystonia (DYT2 dystonia).	241	472
28398555	However, the effect of these mutations on the physiological role of hippocalcin has not yet been elucidated.	473	581
28398555	Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrated that hippocalcin oligomerises in a calcium-dependent manner and binds to voltage-gated calcium channels.	582	738
28398555	Mutations T71N and A190T in hippocalcin did not affect stability, calcium-binding affinity or translocation to cellular membranes (Ca2+/myristoyl switch).	739	893
28398555	We obtained the first crystal structure of hippocalcin and alignment with other NCS proteins showed significant variability in the orientation of the C-terminal part of the molecule, the region expected to be important for target binding.	894	1132
28398555	We demonstrated that the disease-causing mutations did not affect the structure of the protein, however both mutants showed a defect in oligomerisation.	1133	1285
28398555	In addition, we observed an increased calcium influx in KCl-depolarised cells expressing mutated hippocalcin, mostly driven by N-type voltage-gated calcium channels.	1286	1451
28398555	Our data demonstrate that the dystonia-causing mutations strongly affect hippocalcin cellular functions which suggest a central role for perturbed calcium signalling in DYT2 dystonia.	1452	1635
28411266	Genetic Variation at the Sulfonylurea Receptor, Type 2 Diabetes, and Coronary Heart Disease.	0	92
28411266	Despite widespread clinical use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the impact of sulfonylurea therapy on cardiovascular outcomes remains uncertain.	93	242
28411266	Studies of naturally occurring genetic variation can be used to anticipate the expected clinical consequences of a pharmacological therapy.	243	382
28411266	A common missense variant in the gene encoding a component of the sulfonylurea receptor (ABCC8 p.A1369S) promotes closure of the target channel of sulfonylurea therapy and is associated with increased insulin secretion, thus mimicking the effects of sulfonylurea therapy.	383	654
28411266	Using individual-level data from 120,286 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from four large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the impact of this variant on cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease.	655	924
28411266	The p.A1369S variant was associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% CI 0.91, 0.95; P = 1.2 x 10(-11)).	925	1073
28411266	The variant was associated with increased BMI (+0.062 kg/m(2); 95% CI 0.037, 0.086; P = 8.1 x 10(-7)) but lower waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, a marker of abdominal fat distribution.	1074	1262
28411266	Furthermore, p.A1369S was associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 0.99; P = 5.9 x 10(-4)).	1263	1393
28411266	These results suggest that, despite a known association with increased weight, long-term sulfonylurea therapy may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.	1394	1550
28416580	A TSPO ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage.	0	69
28416580	Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease without effective treatment.	70	154
28416580	After ICH, the immediate infiltration of leukocytes and activation of microglia are accompanied by a rapid up-regulation of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO).	155	318
28416580	TSPO ligands have shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in models of CNS injury.	319	416
28416580	In this study, we determined the impact of a TSPO ligand, etifoxine, on brain injury and inflammation in 2 mouse models of ICH.	417	544
28416580	TSPO was up-regulated in Iba1(+) cells from brains of patients with ICH and in CD11b(+)CD45(int) cells from mice subjected to collagenase-induced ICH.	545	695
28416580	Etifoxine significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema after ICH induction by injection of either autologous blood or collagenase.	696	847
28416580	In collagenase-induced ICH mice, the protection of etifoxine was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brain and microglial production of IL-6 and TNF-a.	848	1019
28416580	Etifoxine improved blood-brain barrier integrity and diminished cell death.	1020	1095
28416580	Notably, the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice depleted of microglia by using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor.	1096	1242
28416580	These results indicate that the TSPO ligand etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH.	1243	1348
28416580	TSPO may be a viable therapeutic target that requires further investigations in ICH.-Li, M., Ren, H., Sheth, K. N., Shi, F.-D., Liu, Q.	1349	1484
28416580	A TSPO ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage.	1485	1554
28428256	Regulation of lung endothelial permeability and inflammatory responses by prostaglandin A2: role of EP4 receptor.	0	113
28428256	The role of prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) in modulation of vascular endothelial function is unknown.	114	208
28428256	We investigated effects of PGA2 on pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) permeability and inflammatory activation and identified a receptor mediating these effects.	209	367
28428256	PGA2 enhanced the EC barrier and protected against barrier dysfunction caused by vasoactive peptide thrombin and proinflammatory bacterial wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS).	368	537
28428256	Receptor screening using pharmacological and molecular inhibitory approaches identified EP4 as a novel PGA2 receptor.	538	655
28428256	EP4 mediated barrier-protective effects of PGA2 by activating Rap1/Rac1 GTPase and protein kinase A targets at cell adhesions and cytoskeleton: VE-cadherin, p120-catenin, ZO-1, cortactin, and VASP.	656	853
28428256	PGA2 also suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory signaling by inhibiting the NFkB pathway and expression of EC adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1.	854	997
28428256	These effects were abolished by pharmacological or molecular inhibition of EP4.	998	1077
28428256	In vivo, PGA2 was protective in two distinct models of acute lung injury (ALI): LPS-induced inflammatory injury and two-hit ALI caused by suboptimal mechanical ventilation and injection of thrombin receptor-activating peptide.	1078	1304
28428256	These protective effects were abolished in mice with endothelial-specific EP4 knockout.	1305	1392
28428256	The results suggest a novel role for the PGA2-EP4 axis in vascular EC protection that is critical for improvement of pathological states associated with increased vascular leakage and inflammation.	1393	1590
28468941	Aberrant caveolin-1-mediated Smad signaling and proliferation identified by analysis of adenine 474 deletion mutation (c.474delA) in patient fibroblasts: a new perspective on the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension.	0	215
28468941	A heterozygous caveolin-1 c.474delA mutation has been identified in a family with heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).	216	346
28468941	This frameshift mutation leads to a caveolin-1 protein that contains all known functional domains but has a change in only the final 20 amino acids of the C-terminus.	347	513
28468941	Here we studied how this mutation alters caveolin-1 function, using patient-derived fibroblasts.	514	610
28468941	Transmission electron microscopy showed that fibroblasts carrying the c.474delA mutation form typical caveolae.	611	722
28468941	Expression of mutated caveolin-1 in caveolin-1-null mouse fibroblasts failed to induce formation of caveolae due to retention of the mutated protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.	723	901
28468941	However, coexpression of wild-type caveolin-1 with mutated caveolin-1 restored the ability to form caveolae.	902	1010
28468941	Importantly, fibroblasts carrying the mutation showed twofold increase in proliferation rate associated with hyperphosphorylation of Smad1/5/8.	1011	1154
28468941	This mutation impaired the antiproliferative function of caveolin-1.	1155	1223
28468941	Inhibition of type I TGFb receptors ALK1/2/3/6 responsible for phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 reduced the hyperproliferation seen in c.474delA fibroblasts.	1224	1377
28468941	These results demonstrate the critical role of the final 20 amino acids of caveolin-1 in modulating fibroblast proliferation by dampening Smad signaling and suggest that augmented Smad signaling and fibroblast hyperproliferation are contributing factors in the pathogenesis of PAH in patients with caveolin-1 c.474delA mutation.	1378	1706
28472177	Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1) is associated with stem-like cancer cell functions in pediatric high-grade glioma.	0	130
28472177	Pediatric high-grade gliomas represent 8-12% of all primary tumors of the nervous system in children.	131	232
28472177	Five-year survival for these pediatric aggressive tumors is poor (15-35%) indicating the need to develop better treatments for pediatric high-grade gliomas.	233	389
28472177	In this work we used SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cell lines to study the function of the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1), a deubiquitinase de-regulated in several cancers, in pediatric high-grade gliomas.	390	600
28472177	UCHL1 depletion in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 glioma cells was associated with decreased cell proliferation and invasion, along with a reduced ability to grow in soft agar and to form spheres (i.e. self-renewal measure).	601	812
28472177	A 70% reduction in Wnt signaling was also observed in the SF188 and SJ-GBM2 UCHL1 knockdowns (KDs) using a TCF-dependent TOPflash reporter assay.	813	958
28472177	Transcriptome comparisons of UCHL1 KDs versus vector control identified a list of 306 differentially expressed genes (at least 2-fold change; p    <0.05) which included genes known to be involved in cancer like ACTA2, POSTN, LIF, FBXL7, FBXW11, GDF15, HEY2, but also potential novel genes such us IGLL5, ABCA4, AQP3, AQP4, CALB1, and ALK.	959	1297
28472177	Bioinformatics gene ontology (GO) analysis of these 306 genes revealed significant enrichment in "signal peptides", "extracellular matrix"and "secreted proteins" GO Terms.	1298	1469
28472177	"Angiogenesis and blood vessel development", "neuron differentiation/development", cell adhesion", and "cell migration" also showed significant enrichment in our GO analysis.	1470	1644
28472177	Top canonical pathways identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) included "Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis Signaling" (p = 5.14x10-4), "Virus Entry via Endocytic Pathways" (p = 6.15x 10-4), and "High Mobility Group-Box 1 (HMGB1) Signaling" (p = 6.15x10-4).	1645	1904
28472177	While FGF2, IL1B, TNF and PDGFB were predicted as top upstream regulators (p    < 2x10-16) of the UCHL1 KD-associated transcriptome.	1905	2037
28472177	Aberrant expression of UCHL1 in pediatric high-grade gliomas may promote cell invasion, transformation, and self-renewal properties, at least in part, by modulating Wnt/Beta catenin activity.	2038	2229
28472177	UCHL1 might act as an oncogene in glioma within the gene network that imparts stem-like characteristics to these cancer cells.	2230	2356
28487437	Hypoglycemic Effect of Combined Ghrelin and Glucagon Receptor Blockade.	0	71
28487437	Glucagon receptor (GcgR) blockade has been proposed as an alternative to insulin monotherapy for treating type 1 diabetes since deletion or inhibition of GcgRs corrects hyperglycemia in models of diabetes.	72	277
28487437	The factors regulating glycemia in a setting devoid of insulin and glucagon function remain unclear but may include the hormone ghrelin.	278	414
28487437	Not only is ghrelin release controlled by glucose but also ghrelin has many actions that can raise or reduce falls in blood glucose level.	415	553
28487437	Here, we tested the hypothesis that ghrelin rises to prevent hypoglycemia in the absence of glucagon function.	554	664
28487437	Both GcgR knockout (Gcgr(-/-)) mice and db/db mice that were administered GcgR monoclonal antibody displayed lower blood glucose levels accompanied by elevated plasma ghrelin levels.	665	847
28487437	Although treatment with the pancreatic b-cell toxin streptozotocin induced hyperglycemia and raised plasma ghrelin levels in wild-type mice, hyperglycemia was averted in similarly treated Gcgr(-/-) mice and the plasma ghrelin level was further increased.	848	1102
28487437	Notably, administration of a ghrelin receptor antagonist further reduced blood glucose levels into the markedly hypoglycemic range in overnight-fasted, streptozotocin-treated Gcgr(-/-) mice.	1103	1293
28487437	A lowered blood glucose level also was observed in overnight-fasted, streptozotocin-treated ghrelin receptor-null mice that were administered GcgR monoclonal antibody.	1294	1461
28487437	These data suggest that when glucagon activity is blocked in the setting of type 1 diabetes, the plasma ghrelin level rises, preventing hypoglycemia.	1462	1611
28512644	Analysis of Serum Cytokines and Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms of SOD1, SOD2, and CAT in Erysipelas Patients.	0	110
28512644	Increased free radical production had been documented in group A (beta-hemolytic) streptococcus infection cases.	111	223
28512644	Comparing 71 erysipelas patients to 55 age-matched healthy individuals, we sought for CAT, SOD1, and SOD2 single polymorphism mutation (SNPs) interactions with erysipelas' predisposition and serum cytokine levels in the acute and recovery phases of erysipelas infection.	224	494
28512644	Whereas female patients had a higher predisposition to erysipelas, male patients were prone to having a facial localization of the infection.	495	636
28512644	The presence of SOD1 G7958, SOD2 T2734, and CAT C262 alleles was linked to erysipelas' predisposition.	637	739
28512644	T and C alleles of SOD2 T2734C individually were linked to patients with bullous and erythematous erysipelas, respectively.	740	863
28512644	G and A alleles of SOD1 G7958A individually were associated with lower limbs and higher body part localizations of the infection, respectively.	864	1007
28512644	Serum levels of IL-1beta, CCL11, IL-2Ralpha, CXCL9, TRAIL, PDGF-BB, and CCL4 were associated with symptoms accompanying the infection, while IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, and VEGF were associated with predisposition and recurrence of erysipelas.	1008	1270
28512644	While variations of IL-1beta, IL-7, IL-8, IL-17, CCL5, and HGF were associated with the SOD2 T2734C SNP, variations of PDFG-BB and CCL2 were associated with the CAT C262T SNP.	1271	1446
28518143	Calcium sensing receptor protects high glucose-induced energy metabolism disorder via blocking gp78-ubiquitin proteasome pathway.	0	129
28518143	Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major complication and fatal cause of the patients with diabetes.	130	230
28518143	The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor, which is involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis, regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, and so on.	231	409
28518143	In our previous study, we found that CaSR expression, intracellular calcium levels and cardiac function were all significantly decreased in DCM rats; however, the exact mechanism are not clear yet.	410	607
28518143	The present study revealed the protective role of CaSR in myocardial energy metabolism disorder induced by high glucose (HG) as well as the underlying mechanism.	608	769
28518143	Here, we demonstrated that HG decreased the expression of CaSR, mitochondrial fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2), cell gap junction related proteins (Cx43, beta-catenin, N-cadherin), and intracellular ATP concentration.	770	983
28518143	In contrast, HG increased extracellular ATP concentration, the expression of gp78, mitochondrial fission proteins (Fis1, Drp1), and the ubiquitination levels of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43.	984	1165
28518143	Moreover, CaSR agonist and gp78-siRNA significantly reduced the above changes.	1166	1244
28518143	Taken together, these results suggest that HG induces myocardial energy metabolism disorder via decrease of CaSR expression, and activation of gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system.	1245	1421
28518143	In turn, these effects disrupt the structure and function of the mitochondria and the cell gap junction, result in the reduced ATP synthesis and the increased ATP leakage.	1422	1593
28518143	Stimulation of CaSR significantly attenuates HG-induced abnormal myocardial energy metabolism, suggesting CaSR would be a promising potential therapeutic target for DCM.	1594	1763
28584052	Mutations in N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase in patients with X-linked intellectual disability.	0	106
28584052	N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) regulates protein O-GlcNAcylation, an essential and dynamic post-translational modification.	107	248
28584052	The O-GlcNAc modification is present on numerous nuclear and cytosolic proteins and has been implicated in essential cellular functions such as signaling and gene expression.	249	423
28584052	Accordingly, altered levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation have been associated with developmental defects and neurodegeneration.	424	549
28584052	However, mutations in the OGT gene have not yet been functionally confirmed in humans.	550	636
28584052	Here, we report on two hemizygous mutations in OGT in individuals with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and dysmorphic features: one missense mutation (p.Arg284Pro) and one mutation leading to a splicing defect (c.463-6T>G).	637	868
28584052	Both mutations reside in the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT that are essential for substrate recognition.	869	976
28584052	We observed slightly reduced levels of OGT protein and reduced levels of its opposing enzyme O-GlcNAcase in both patient-derived fibroblasts, but global O-GlcNAc levels appeared to be unaffected.	977	1172
28584052	Our data suggest that mutant cells attempt to maintain global O-GlcNAcylation by down-regulating O-GlcNAcase expression.	1173	1293
28584052	We also found that the c.463-6T>G mutation leads to aberrant mRNA splicing, but no stable truncated protein was detected in the corresponding patient-derived fibroblasts.	1294	1464
28584052	Recombinant OGT bearing the p.Arg284Pro mutation was prone to unfolding and exhibited reduced glycosylation activity against a complex array of glycosylation substrates and proteolytic processing of the transcription factor host cell factor 1, which is also encoded by an XLID-associated gene.	1465	1758
28584052	We conclude that defects in O-GlcNAc homeostasis and host cell factor 1 proteolysis may play roles in mediation of XLID in individuals with OGT mutations.	1759	1913
28604678	Dynamic subunit turnover in ESCRT-III assemblies is regulated by Vps4 to mediate membrane remodelling during cytokinesis.	0	121
28604678	The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III mediates membrane fission in fundamental cellular processes, including cytokinesis.	122	270
28604678	ESCRT-III is thought to form persistent filaments that over time increase their curvature to constrict membranes.	271	384
28604678	Unexpectedly, we found that ESCRT-III at the midbody of human cells rapidly turns over subunits with cytoplasmic pools while gradually forming larger assemblies.	385	546
28604678	ESCRT-III turnover depended on the ATPase VPS4, which accumulated at the midbody simultaneously with ESCRT-III subunits, and was required for assembly of functional ESCRT-III structures.	547	733
28604678	In vitro, the Vps2/Vps24 subunits of ESCRT-III formed side-by-side filaments with Snf7 and inhibited further polymerization, but the growth inhibition was alleviated by the addition of Vps4 and ATP.	734	932
28604678	High-speed atomic force microscopy further revealed highly dynamic arrays of growing and shrinking ESCRT-III spirals in the presence of Vps4.	933	1074
28604678	Continuous ESCRT-III remodelling by subunit turnover might facilitate shape adaptions to variable membrane geometries, with broad implications for diverse cellular processes.	1075	1249
28650467	Genome-wide loss-of-function genetic screening identifies opioid receptor u1 as a key regulator of L-asparaginase resistance in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	0	167
28650467	L-asparaginase is a critical chemotherapeutic agent for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).	168	259
28650467	It hydrolyzes plasma asparagine into aspartate and NH3, causing asparagine deficit and inhibition of protein synthesis and eventually, leukemic cell death.	260	415
28650467	However, patient relapse often occurs due to development of resistance.	416	487
28650467	The molecular mechanism by which ALL cells acquire resistance to L-asparaginase is unknown.	488	579
28650467	Therefore, we sought to identify genes that are involved in L-asparaginase resistance in primary leukemic cells.	580	692
28650467	By unbiased genome-wide RNAi screening, we found that among 10 resistant ALL clones, six hits were for opioid receptor mu 1 (oprm1), two hits were for carbonic anhydrase 1 (ca1) and another two hits were for ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (ube2c).	693	942
28650467	We also found that OPRM1 is expressed in all leukemic cells tested.	943	1010
28650467	Specific knockdown of OPRM1 confers L-asparaginase resistance, validating our genome-wide retroviral shRNA library screening data.	1011	1141
28650467	Methadone, an agonist of OPRM1, enhances the sensitivity of parental leukemic cells, but not OPRM1-depleted cells, to L-asparaginase treatment, indicating that OPRM1 is required for the synergistic action of L-asparaginase and methadone, and that OPRM1 loss promotes leukemic cell survival likely through downregulation of the OPRM1-mediated apoptotic pathway.	1142	1502
28650467	Consistent with this premise, patient leukemic cells with relatively high levels of OPRM1 are more sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment compared to OPRM1-depleted leukemic cells, further indicating that OPRM1 loss has a crucial role in L-asparaginase resistance in leukemic patients.	1503	1787
28650467	Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time, a novel OPRM1-mediated mechanism for L-asparaginase resistance in ALL, and identifies OPRM1 as a functional biomarker for defining high-risk subpopulations and for the detection of evolving resistant clones.	1788	2044
28650467	Oprm1 may also be utilized for effective treatment of L-asparaginase-resistant ALL.Oncogene advance online publication, 26 June 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.211.	2045	2204
28660748	Angiotensin II subtype 1a receptor signaling in resident hepatic macrophages induces liver metastasis formation.	0	112
28660748	Liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) are a clinically significant problem.	113	196
28660748	The renin-angiotensin system is involved in tumor growth and metastases.	197	269
28660748	This study was designed to evaluate the role of angiotensin II subtype receptor 1a (AT1a) in the formation of liver metastasis in CRC.	270	404
28660748	A model of liver metastasis was developed by intrasplenic injection of mouse colon cancer (CMT-93) into AT1a knockout mice (AT1aKO) and wild-type (C57BL/6) mice (WT).	405	571
28660748	Compared with WT mice, the liver weight and liver metastatic rate were significantly lower in AT1aKO.	572	673
28660748	The mRNA levels of CD31, transforming growth factor- b1 (TGF-b1), and F4/80 were suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT.	674	793
28660748	Double immunofluorescence analysis showed that the number of accumulated F4/80(+) cells expressing TGF-b1 in metastatic areas was higher in WT than in AT1aKO.	794	952
28660748	The AT1aKO bone marrow (BM) (AT1aKO-BM)>WT showed suppressed formation of liver metastasis compared with WT-BM>WT.	953	1067
28660748	However, the formation of metastasis was further suppressed in WT-BM>AT1aKO compared with AT1aKO-BM>WT.	1068	1171
28660748	In addition, accumulated F4/80(+) cells in the liver metastasis were not BM-derived F4/80(+) cells, but mainly resident hepatic F4/80(+) cells, and these resident hepatic F4/80(+) cells were positive for TGF-b1.	1172	1383
28660748	Angiotensin II enhanced TGF-b1 expression in Kupffer cells.	1384	1443
28660748	Treatment of WT with clodronate liposomes suppressed liver metastasis by diminishing TGF-b1(+) F4/80(+) cells accumulation.	1444	1567
28660748	The formation of liver metastasis correlated with collagen deposition in the metastatic area, which was dependent on AT1a signaling.	1568	1700
28660748	These results suggested that resident hepatic macrophages induced liver metastasis formation by induction of TGF-b1 through AT1a signaling.	1701	1840
28747658	A single amino acid substitution confers B-cell clonogenic activity to the HIV-1 matrix protein p17.	0	100
28747658	Recent data highlight the presence, in HIV-1-seropositive patients with lymphoma, of p17 variants (vp17s) endowed with B-cell clonogenicity, suggesting a role of vp17s in lymphomagenesis.	101	288
28747658	We investigated the mechanisms responsible for the functional disparity on B cells between a wild-type p17 (refp17) and a vp17 named S75X.	289	427
28747658	Here, we show that a single Arginine (R) to Glycine (G) mutation at position 76 in the refp17 backbone (p17R76G), as in the S75X variant, is per se sufficient to confer a B-cell clonogenic potential to the viral protein and modulate, through activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, different molecules involved in apoptosis inhibition (CASP-9, CASP-7, DFF-45, NPM, YWHAZ, Src, PAX2, MAPK8), cell cycle promotion and cancer progression (CDK1, CDK2, CDK8, CHEK1, CHEK2, GSK-3 beta, NPM, PAK1, PP2C-alpha).	428	942
28747658	Moreover, the only R to G mutation at position 76 was found to strongly impact on protein folding and oligomerization by altering the hydrogen bond network.	943	1099
28747658	This generates a conformational shift in the p17 R76G mutant which enables a functional epitope(s), masked in refp17, to elicit B-cell growth-promoting signals after its interaction with a still unknown receptor(s).	1100	1315
28747658	Our findings offer new opportunities to understand the molecular mechanisms accounting for the B-cell growth-promoting activity of vp17s.	1316	1453
28777492	Gankyrin induces STAT3 activation in tumor microenvironment and sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.	0	113
28777492	Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) develop as a result of chronic liver inflammation.	114	201
28777492	We have shown that the oncoprotein gankyrin is critical for inflammation-induced tumorigenesis in the colon.	202	310
28777492	Although the in vitro function of gankyrin is well known, its role in vivo remains to be elucidated.	311	411
28777492	We investigated the effect of gankyrin in the tumor microenvironment of mice with liver parenchymal cell-specific gankyrin ablation (Alb-Cre;gankyrin(f/f) ) and gankyrin deletion both in liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells (Mx1-Cre;gankyrin(f/f) ).	412	668
28777492	Gankyrin upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in tumor cells.	669	751
28777492	Gankyrin binds to Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), mainly expressed in liver non-parenchymal cells, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).	752	998
28777492	Gankyrin deficiency in non-parenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal cells, reduced STAT3 activity, interleukin (IL)-6 production, and cancer stem cell marker (Bmi1 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]) expression, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential.	999	1267
28777492	Chronic inflammation enhances gankyrin expression in the human liver.	1268	1337
28777492	Gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment is negatively correlated with progression-free survival in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment for HCC.	1338	1495
28777492	Thus, gankyrin appears to play a critical oncogenic function in tumor microenvironment and may be a potential target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against HCC.	1496	1678
28846666	Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Inflammation and Metabolism in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Inner Mongolia.	0	184
28846666	BACKGROUND Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is common all over the world.	185	261
28846666	GDM women are with inflammatory and metabolisms abnormalities.	262	324
28846666	However, few studies have focused on the association of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), inflammatory biomarkers, and metabolic indexes in women with GDM, especially in the Inner Mongolia population.	325	565
28846666	The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T SNPs, and inflammation and metabolic biomarkers in women with GDM pregnancies.	566	739
28846666	MATERIAL AND METHODS Blood samples and placentas from 140 women with GDM and 140 women with healthy pregnancies were collected.	740	867
28846666	Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and MassARRAY-IPLEX were performed to analyze IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T SNPs.	868	1045
28846666	Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to analyze inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines.	1046	1152
28846666	RESULTS Distribution frequency of TNF-alpha -857CT (OR=3.316, 95% CI=1.092-8.304, p=0.025) in women with GDM pregnancies were obviously higher than that in women with healthy pregnancies.	1153	1340
28846666	Women with GDM were of older maternal age, had higher BMI, were more nulliparous, and had T2DM and GDM history, compared to women with healthy pregnancies (p   <0.05).	1341	1508
28846666	Inflammatory biomarkers in serum (hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10 ratio) and placental (NF-kappaB, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10 ratio, IL-1b, TNF-alpha) were significantly different (p   <0.05) between women with GDM and women with healthy pregnancies.	1509	1754
28846666	Differences were found for serum FBG, FINS, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-beta, and placental IRS-1, IRS-2, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, RBP-4, chemerin, nesfatin-1, FATP-4, EL, LPL, FABP-1, FABP-3, FABP-4, and FABP-5.	1755	1963
28846666	CONCLUSIONS TNF-alpha -857C/T SNP, hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-6/IL-10 were associated with GDM in women from Inner Mongolia, as was serious inflammation and disordered lipid and glucose metabolisms.	1964	2162
28851297	An Ag-globin G->A gene polymorphism associated with b(0)39 thalassemia globin gene and high fetal hemoglobin production.	0	120
28851297	BACKGROUND: Increase of the expression of g-globin gene and high production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in b-thalassemia patients is widely accepted as associated with a milder or even asymptomatic disease.	121	325
28851297	The search for HbF-associated polymorphisms (such as the XmnI, BCL11A and MYB polymorphisms) has recently gained great attention, in order to stratify b-thalassemia patients with respect to expectancy of the first transfusion, need for annual intake of blood, response to HbF inducers (the most studied of which is hydroxyurea).	326	654
28851297	METHODS: Ag-globin gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 b-thalassemia patients, including 31 b(0)39/b(0)39, 33 b(0)39/b(+)IVSI-110, 9 b(+)IVSI-110/b(+)IVSI-110, one b(0)IVSI-1/b(+)IVSI-6 and one b(0)39/b(+)IVSI-6.	655	904
28851297	RESULTS: The results show that the rs368698783 polymorphism is present in b-thalassemia patients in the 5'UTR sequence (+25) of the Ag-globin gene, known to affect the LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone) binding site 5'-GGTTAT-3'.	905	1160
28851297	This Ag(+25 G->A) polymorphism is associated with the Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphism and both are linked with the b(0)39-globin gene, but not with the b(+)IVSI-110-globin gene.	1161	1334
28851297	In agreement with the expectation that this mutation alters the LYAR binding activity, we found that the Ag(+25 G->A) and Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphisms are associated with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells isolated from b(0)39/b(0)39 thalassemia patients.	1335	1593
28851297	CONCLUSIONS: As a potential explanation of our findings, we hypothesize that in b-thalassemia the Gg-globin-XmnI/Ag-globin-(G->A) genotype is frequently under genetic linkage with b(0)-thalassemia mutations, but not with the b(+)-thalassemia mutation here studied (i.e. b(+)IVSI-110) and that this genetic combination has been selected within the population of b(0)-thalassemia patients, due to functional association with high HbF.	1594	2026
28851297	Here we describe the characterization of the rs368698783 (+25 G->A) polymorphism of the Ag-globin gene associated in b(0)39 thalassemia patients with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells.	2027	2215
28883039	Disease-associated mutations in human BICD2 hyperactivate motility of dynein-dynactin.	0	86
28883039	Bicaudal D2 (BICD2) joins dynein with dynactin into a ternary complex (termed DDB) capable of processive movement.	87	201
28883039	Point mutations in the BICD2 gene have been identified in patients with a dominant form of spinal muscular atrophy, but how these mutations cause disease is unknown.	202	367
28883039	To investigate this question, we have developed in vitro motility assays with purified DDB and BICD2's membrane vesicle partner, the GTPase Rab6a.	368	514
28883039	Rab6a-GTP, either in solution or bound to artificial liposomes, released BICD2 from an autoinhibited state and promoted robust dynein-dynactin transport.	515	668
28883039	In these assays, BICD2 mutants showed an enhanced ability to form motile DDB complexes.	669	756
28883039	Increased retrograde transport by BICD2 mutants also was observed in cells using an inducible organelle transport assay.	757	877
28883039	When overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons, the hyperactive BICD2 mutants decreased neurite growth.	878	980
28883039	Our results reveal that dominant mutations in BICD2 hyperactivate DDB motility and suggest that an imbalance of minus versus plus end-directed microtubule motility in neurons may underlie spinal muscular atrophy.	981	1193
29049388	An inducible mouse model of podocin-mutation-related nephrotic syndrome.	0	72
29049388	Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, encoding podocin, cause hereditary nephrotic syndrome.	73	156
29049388	The most common podocin mutation, R138Q, is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease.	157	286
29049388	Knock-in mice carrying a R140Q mutation, the mouse analogue of human R138Q, show developmental arrest of podocytes and lethal renal failure at neonatal age.	287	443
29049388	Here we created a conditional podocin knock-in model named NPHS2 R140Q/-, using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase, which permits to study the effects of the mutation in postnatal life.	444	632
29049388	Within the first week of R140Q hemizygosity induction the animals developed proteinuria, which peaked after 4-5 weeks.	633	751
29049388	Subsequently the animals developed progressive renal failure, with a median survival time of 12 (95% CI: 11-13) weeks.	752	870
29049388	Foot process fusion was observed within one week, progressing to severe and global effacement in the course of the disease.	871	994
29049388	The number of podocytes per glomerulus gradually diminished to 18% compared to healthy controls 12-16 weeks after induction.	995	1119
29049388	The fraction of segmentally sclerosed glomeruli was 25%, 85% and 97% at 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively.	1120	1223
29049388	Severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis was present at later disease stage and was correlated quantitatively with the level of proteinuria at early disease stages.	1224	1382
29049388	While R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated, protein abundance was reduced by more than 50% within one week following induction.	1383	1516
29049388	Whereas miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first 4 weeks, miRNA-193a expression peaked 2 weeks after induction.	1517	1646
29049388	In conclusion, the inducible R140Q-podocin mouse model is an auspicious model of the most common genetic cause of human nephrotic syndrome, with a spontaneous disease course strongly reminiscent of the human disorder.	1647	1864
29049388	This model constitutes a valuable tool to test the efficacy of novel pharmacological interventions aimed to improve podocyte function and viability and attenuate proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure.	1865	2089
29183288	Arginase 1 deletion in myeloid cells affects the inflammatory response in allergic asthma, but not lung mechanics, in female mice.	0	130
29183288	BACKGROUND: (Over-)expression of arginase may limit local availability of arginine for nitric oxide synthesis.	131	241
29183288	We investigated the significance of arginase1 (ARG1) for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung inflammation in female mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma.	242	433
29183288	METHODS: Arg1 was ablated in the lung by crossing Arg1 fl/fl and Tie2Cre tg/- mice.	434	517
29183288	OVA sensitization and challenge were conducted, and AHR to methacholine was determined using the Flexivent system.	518	632
29183288	Changes in gene expression, chemokine and cytokine secretion, plasma IgE, and lung histology were quantified using RT-qPCR, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry, respectively.	633	803
29183288	RESULTS: Arg1 ablation had no influence on the development of OVA-induced AHR, but attenuated OVA-induced increases in expression of Arg2 and Nos2, Slc7a1, Slc7a2, and Slc7a7 (arginine transporters), Il4, Il5 and Il13 (TH2-type cytokines), Ccl2 and Ccl11 (chemokines), Ifng (TH1-type cytokine), Clca3 and Muc5ac (goblet cell markers), and OVA-specific IgE.	804	1160
29183288	Pulmonary IL-10 protein content increased, but IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNFalpha and IFNgamma content, and lung histopathology, were not affected.	1161	1301
29183288	Arg1 elimination also decreased number and tightness of correlations between adaptive changes in lung function and inflammatory parameters in OVA/OVA-treated female mice.	1302	1472
29183288	OVA/OVA-treated female mice mounted a higher OVA-IgE response than males, but the correlation between lung function and inflammation was lower.	1473	1616
29183288	Arg1-deficient OVA/OVA-treated females differed from males in a more pronounced decline of arginine-metabolizing and -transporting genes, higher plasma arginine levels, a smaller OVA-specific IgE response, and no improvement of peripheral lung function.	1617	1870
29183288	CONCLUSION: Complete ablation of Arg1 in the lung affects mRNA abundance of arginine-transporting and -metabolizing genes, and pro-inflammatory genes, but not methacholine responsiveness or accumulation of inflammatory cells.	1871	2096
30836660	Salidroside Ameliorates Renal Interstitial Fibrosis by Inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kappaB and MAPK Signaling Pathways.	0	113
30836660	Salidroside (Sal) is an active ingredient that is isolated from Rhodiola rosea, which has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activities and a renal protective effect.	114	285
30836660	However, the role of Sal on renal fibrosis has not yet been elucidated.	286	357
30836660	Here, the purpose of the current study is to test the protective effects of Sal against renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF), and to explore the underlying mechanisms using both in vivo and in vitro models.	358	561
30836660	In this study, we establish the unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) or folic acid (FA)-induced mice renal interstitial fibrosis in vivo and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-stimulated human proximal tubular epithelial cell (HK-2) model in vitro.	562	819
30836660	The levels of kidney functional parameters and inflammatory cytokines in serum are examined.	820	912
30836660	The degree of renal damage and fibrosis is determined by histological assessment.	913	994
30836660	Immunohistochemistry and western blotting are used to determine the mechanisms of Sal against RIF.	995	1093
30836660	Our results show that treatment with Sal can ameliorate tubular injury and deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components (including collagen SH and collagen I).	1094	1264
30836660	Furthermore, Sal administration significantly suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by a decreased expression of alpha-SMA, vimentin, TGF-beta1, snail, slug, and a largely restored expression of E-cadherin.	1265	1498
30836660	Additionally, Sal also reduces the levels of serum biochemical markers (serum creatinine, Scr; blood urea nitrogen, BUN; and uric acid, UA) and decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha).	1499	1719
30836660	Further study revealed that the effect of Sal on renal interstitial fibrosis is associated with the lower expression of TLR4, p-IkappaBalpha, p-NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), both in vivo and in vitro.	1720	1946
30836660	In conclusion, Sal treatment improves kidney function, ameliorates the deposition of the ECM components and relieves the protein levels of EMT markers in mouse kidneys and HK-2 cells.	1947	2130
30836660	Furthermore, Sal treatment significantly decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines and inhibits the TLR4/NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.	2131	2280
30836660	Collectively, these results suggest that the administration of Sal could be a novel therapeutic strategy in treating renal fibrosis.	2281	2413
