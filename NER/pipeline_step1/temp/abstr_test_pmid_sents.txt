1711760	Delayed institution of hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia: effect on brain edema.	0	90
1711760	The effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2-h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studied.	91	267
1711760	Under isoflurane anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded.	268	356
1711760	In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated.	357	440
1711760	In the hypertensive group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO.	441	537
1711760	Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested.	538	607
1711760	The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO.	608	710
1711760	Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the ischemic territory).	711	843
1711760	The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining.	844	928
1711760	In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups.	929	1027
1711760	In the periphery of the ischemic territory, SG in the cortex was greater (less edema accumulation) in the hypertensive group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, P less than 0.05).	1028	1208
1711760	The area of histochemical injury (as a percent of the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the hypertensive group (33 +/- 3% vs 21 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05).	1209	1381
1711760	The data indicate that phenylephrine-induced hypertension instituted 2 h after MCAO does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core, that it improves edema in the periphery of the ischemic territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction.	1382	1647
6086495	Localisation of the Becker muscular dystrophy gene on the short arm of the X chromosome by linkage to cloned DNA sequences.	0	123
6086495	A linkage study in 30 Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) kindreds using three cloned DNA sequences from the X chromosome which demonstrate restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), suggests that the BMD gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome, in the p21 region.	124	405
6086495	The genes for Becker and Duchenne dystrophies must therefore be closely linked, if not allelic, and any future DNA probes found to be of practical use in one disorder should be equally applicable to the other.	406	615
6086495	The linkage analysis also provides data on the frequency of recombination along the short arm of the X chromosome, and across the centromeric region..	616	766
7018927	Pituitary response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone during haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia.	0	106
7018927	The effects of a 6-hour infusion with haloperidol on serum prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels was studied in a group of male subjects.	107	252
7018927	Five hours after starting the infusions, a study of the pituitary responses to LH-releasing hormone (LH-RH) was carried out.	253	377
7018927	Control patients received infusions of 0.9% NaCl solution.	378	436
7018927	During the course of haloperidol infusions, significant hyperprolactinemia was found, together with an abolished pituitary response to LH-RH, as compared with responses of control subjects.	437	626
7811247	X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD): a novel mutation of the ALD gene in 6 members of a family presenting with 5 different phenotypes.	0	134
7811247	Fragments of the adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) cDNA from a patient with adolescent ALD were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned.	135	277
7811247	Bidirectional sequencing of the entire coding ALD gene disclosed a cytosine to guanine transversion at nucleotide 1451 in exon five, resulting in substitution of proline 484 by arginine.	278	464
7811247	Five of nine siblings of the patient, comprising two cerebral ALD, one adrenomyeloneuropathy, one Addison only as well as the symptomatic mother (all accumulating very long chain fatty acids) carried this mutation, which was not found in the unaffected persons, in five unrelated ALD patients, and in twenty controls.	465	782
7811247	We propose that this missense mutation generated the disease per se as well as the metabolic defect; the different phenotypes, however, must have originated by means of additional pathogenetic factors..	783	985
8944024	Detection of heterozygous mutations in BRCA1 using high density oligonucleotide arrays and two-colour fluorescence analysis.	0	124
8944024	The ability to scan a large gene rapidly and accurately for all possible heterozygous mutations in large numbers of patient samples will be critical for the future of medicine.	125	301
8944024	We have designed high-density arrays consisting of over 96, 600 oligonucleotides 20-nucleotides (nt) in length to screen for a wide range of heterozygous mutations in the 3.	302	475
8944024	45-kilobases (kb) exon 11 of the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene BRCA1.	476	557
8944024	Reference and test samples were co-hybridized to these arrays and differences in hybridization patterns quantitated by two-colour analysis.	558	697
8944024	Fourteen of fifteen patient samples with known mutations were accurately diagnosed, and no false positive mutations were identified in 20 control samples.	698	852
8944024	Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms were also readily detected.	853	918
8944024	DNA chip-based assays may provide a valuable new technology for high-throughput cost-efficient detection of genetic alterations.	919	1047
14510914	Congenital hypothyroidism due to a new deletion in the sodium/iodide symporter protein.	0	87
14510914	OBJECTIVE: Iodide transport defect (ITD) is a rare disorder characterised by an inability of the thyroid to maintain an iodide gradient across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells, that often results in congenital hypothyroidism.	88	333
14510914	When present the defect is also found in the salivary glands and gastric mucosa and it has been shown to arise from abnormalities of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS).	334	501
14510914	PATIENT: We describe a woman with hypothyroidism identified at the 3rd month of life.	502	587
14510914	The diagnosis of ITD was suspected because of nodular goitre, and little if any iodide uptake by the thyroid and salivary glands.	588	717
14510914	Treatment with iodide partially corrected the hypothyroidism; however, long-term substitution therapy with L-thyroxine was started.	718	849
14510914	MEASUREMENTS: Thyroid radioiodide uptake was only 1.4% and 0.3% at 1 and 24 h after the administration of recombinant human TSH.	850	978
14510914	The saliva to plasma I- ratio was 1.1 indicating that the inability of the thyroid gland to concentrate I- was also present in the salivary glands.	979	1126
14510914	RESULTS: Analysis of the patient's NIS gene revealed a 15 nucleotide (nt) deletion of the coding sequence (nt 1314 through nt 1328) and the insertion of 15 nt duplicating the first 15 nt of the adjacent intron.	1127	1337
14510914	The patient was homozygous for this insertion/deletion, while both consanguineous parents were heterozygous.	1338	1446
14510914	This deletion predicts the production of a protein lacking the five terminal amino acids of exon XI (439-443) which are located in the 6th intracellular loop.	1447	1605
14510914	COS-7 cells transfected with a vector expressing the mutant del-(439-443) NIS failed to concentrate iodide, suggesting that the mutation was the direct cause of the ITD in this patient.	1606	1791
14510914	CONCLUSION: In conclusion we describe the first Italian case of congenital hypothyroidism due to a new deletion in the NIS gene.	1792	1920
15041272	A first Taiwanese Chinese family of type 2B von Willebrand disease with R1306W mutation.	0	88
15041272	Clinical, laboratory and genetic defect of a Taiwanese family with type 2B von Willebrand disease (VWD) were studied.	89	206
15041272	The proband was a 55-year-old woman who gave birth to two daughters and one son aged 30, 29 and 27, respectively.	207	320
15041272	All had abnormal mucocutaneous bleedings since their childhood.	321	384
15041272	In proband, PT, PTT and platelet count were normal; template bleeding time was 14 min; VIII:C was 51%, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), 42% and von Willerand factor ristocetin-cofactor (VWF:RCo, 15%); ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) at 0.3 and 0.6 mg/ml of ristocetin was 16% and 68%, respectively.	385	705
15041272	The enhanced response to ristocetin was identified to be in plasma, not in platelet itself, by mixing studies.	706	816
15041272	Analysis of von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer of plasma but not of platelets showed absence of high-molecular weight (HMW) multimer.	817	952
15041272	All three children had similar laboratory findings.	953	1004
15041272	Exon 28 of VWF gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced.	1005	1091
15041272	The proband and three children were all found to be heterozygous for C to T transition at nucleotide 3916 resulting in Arg 1306 Trp (R1306W) substitution.	1092	1246
15041272	This mutation in the glycoprotein Ib (GPIb)-binding site has been found to increase the affinity of plasma VWF for platelets, and thus cause loss of HMW multimers and often thrombocytopenia.	1247	1437
15041272	In conclusion, a first report of type 2B VWD in a Taiwanese Chinese family who show R1306W mutation in VWF gene was described.	1438	1564
15096016	Pallidal stimulation: an alternative to pallidotomy?	0	52
15096016	A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985.	53	208
15096016	Laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant PD, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community.	209	337
15096016	Another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long-term success rates and low morbidity rates.	338	539
15096016	Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success.	540	595
15096016	According to the literature pallidotomy improves the "on" symptoms of PD, such as dyskinesias, as well as the "off" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on-off fluctuations.	596	778
15096016	Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving levodopa-induced dyskinesias.	779	930
15096016	Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper- or dyskinetic upper limbs, but increases the "freezing" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time.	931	1090
15096016	Considering the small increase in the patient's independence, the high costs of bilateral implants, and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices, the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy.	1091	1362
15099351	Mutations in the PCSK9 gene in Norwegian subjects with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia.	0	95
15099351	Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is at a locus for autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, and recent data indicate that the PCSK9 gene is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis.	96	294
15099351	Mutations within this gene have previously been found to segregate with hypercholesterolemia.	295	388
15099351	In this study, DNA sequencing of the 12 exons of the PCSK9 gene has been performed in 51 Norwegian subjects with a clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia where mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and mutation R3500Q in the apolipoprotein B-100 gene had been excluded.	389	688
15099351	Two novel missense mutations were detected in the catalytic subdomain of the PCSK9 gene.	689	777
15099351	Two patients were heterozygotes for D374Y, and one patient was a double heterozygote for D374Y and N157K.	778	883
15099351	D374Y segregated with hypercholesterolemia in the two former families where family members were available for study.	884	1000
15099351	Our findings support the notion that mutations in the PCSK9 gene cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia.	1001	1112
15122708	Desmin-related myopathy with Mallory body-like inclusions is caused by mutations of the selenoprotein N gene.	0	109
15122708	Desmin-related myopathies (DRMs) are a heterogeneous group of muscle disorders, morphologically defined by intrasarcoplasmic aggregates of desmin.	110	256
15122708	Mutations in the desmin and the alpha-B crystallin genes account for approximately one third of the DRM cases.	257	367
15122708	The genetic basis of the other forms remain unknown, including the early-onset, recessive form with Mallory body-like inclusions (MB-DRMs), first described in five related German patients.	368	556
15122708	Recently, we identified the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1) as responsible for SEPN-related myopathy (SEPN-RM), a unique early-onset myopathy formerly divided in two different nosological categories: rigid spine muscular dystrophy and the severe form of classical multiminicore disease.	557	840
15122708	The finding of Mallory body-like inclusions in two cases of genetically documented SEPN-RM led us to suspect a relationship between MB-DRM and SEPN1.	841	990
15122708	In the original MB-DRM German family, we demonstrated a linkage of the disease to the SEPN1 locus (1p36), and subsequently a homozygous SEPN1 deletion (del 92 nucleotide -19/+73) in the affected patients.	991	1195
15122708	A comparative reevaluation showed that MB-DRM and SEPN-RM share identical clinical features.	1196	1288
15122708	Therefore, we propose that MB-DRM should be categorized as SEPN-RM.	1289	1356
15122708	These findings substantiate the molecular heterogeneity of DRM, expand the morphological spectrum of SEPN-RM, and implicate a necessary reassessment of the nosological boundaries in early-onset myopathies.	1357	1562
15188772	Severe reversible left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to accidental iatrogenic epinephrine overdose.	0	120
15188772	Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy due to chronic excess of endogenous catecholamines has been recognized for decades as a clinical phenomenon.	121	266
15188772	In contrast, reports of myocardial dysfunction due to acute iatrogenic overdose are rare.	267	356
15188772	A 35-year-old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of epinephrine developed myocardial stunning that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise, profound, albeit transient, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis.	357	686
15188772	Our case illustrates the serious consequences of medical errors that can be avoided through improved medication labeling and staff supervision.	687	830
15614572	Effects of the antidepressant trazodone, a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonist, on dopamine-dependent behaviors in rats.	0	115
15614572	RATIONALE: 5-Hydroxytryptamine, via stimulation of 5-HT 2C receptors, exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas activation of 5-HT 2A receptors enhances stimulated DAergic neurotransmission.	116	343
15614572	The antidepressant trazodone is a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonist.	344	409
15614572	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of trazodone treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal DAergic system.	410	552
15614572	METHODS: The effect of pretreatment with trazodone on dexamphetamine- and apomorphine-induced oral stereotypies, on catalepsy induced by haloperidol and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), on ergometrine-induced wet dog shake (WDS) behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections was studied in rats.	553	850
15614572	We also investigated whether trazodone induces catalepsy in rats.	851	916
15614572	RESULTS: Trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg i.p. did not induce catalepsy, and did not antagonize apomorphine (1.5 and 3 mg/kg) stereotypy and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy.	917	1094
15614572	However, pretreatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p. trazodone enhanced dexamphetamine stereotypy, and antagonized haloperidol catalepsy, ergometrine-induced WDS behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections.	1095	1304
15614572	Trazodone at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg i.p. induced catalepsy and antagonized apomorphine and dexamphetamine stereotypies.	1305	1421
15614572	CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg does not block pre- and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors, while at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors.	1422	1627
15614572	Furthermore, at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, trazodone blocks 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors.	1628	1711
15614572	We suggest that trazodone (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), by blocking the 5-HT 2C receptors, releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5-HT, and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy.	1712	1964
15623763	TGFBI gene mutations causing lattice and granular corneal dystrophies in Indian patients.	0	89
15623763	PURPOSE: To identify mutations in the TGFBI gene in Indian patients with lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD) or granular corneal dystrophy (GCD) and to look for genotype-phenotype correlations.	90	279
15623763	METHODS: Thirty-seven unrelated patients were studied, 18 with LCD and 19 with GCD.	280	363
15623763	The diagnosis of LCD or GCD was made on the basis of clinical and/or histopathological evaluation.	364	462
15623763	Exons and flanking intron sequences of the TGFBI gene were amplified by PCR with specific primers.	463	561
15623763	PCR products were screened by the method of single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by sequencing.	562	669
15623763	Mutations were confirmed by screening at least 100 unrelated normal control subjects.	670	755
15623763	RESULTS: Mutations were identified in 14 of 18 patients with LCD and in all 19 patients with GCD.	756	853
15623763	In LCD, three novel heterozygous mutations found were glycine-594-valine (Gly594Val) in 2 of 18 patients, valine-539-aspartic acid (Val539Asp) in 1 patient, and deletion of valine 624, valine 625 (Val624-Val625del) in 1 patient.	854	1082
15623763	In addition, mutation of arginine 124-to-cysteine (Arg124Cys) was found in 8 of 18 patients and histidine 626-to-arginine (His626Arg) in 2 of 18 patients.	1083	1237
15623763	Atypical clinical features for LCD were noted in patients with the Gly594Val and Val624-Val625del mutations.	1238	1346
15623763	In GCD, 18 patients with GCD type I had a mutation of arginine 555-to-tryptophan (Arg555Trp) and 1 patient with GCD type III (Reis-Bucklers dystrophy), had the Arg124Leu mutation.	1347	1526
15623763	Seven novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also found, of which a change of leucine 269 to phenylalanine (Leu269Phe) was found in 12 of 18 patients with the Arg555Trp mutation.	1527	1716
15623763	CONCLUSIONS: Arg124Cys and Arg555Trp appear to be the predominant mutations causing LCD and GCD, respectively, in the population studied.	1717	1854
15623763	The novel mutations identified in this study are associated with distinct phenotypes.	1855	1940
15818664	Association of sporadic chondrocalcinosis with a -4-basepair G-to-A transition in the 5'-untranslated region of ANKH that promotes enhanced expression of ANKH protein and excess generation of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate.	0	230
15818664	OBJECTIVE: Certain mutations in ANKH, which encodes a multiple-pass transmembrane protein that regulates inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) transport, are linked to autosomal-dominant familial chondrocalcinosis.	231	437
15818664	This study investigated the potential for ANKH sequence variants to promote sporadic chondrocalcinosis.	438	541
15818664	METHODS: ANKH variants identified by genomic sequencing were screened for association with chondrocalcinosis in 128 patients with severe sporadic chondrocalcinosis or pseudogout and in ethnically matched healthy controls.	542	763
15818664	The effects of specific variants on expression of common markers were evaluated by in vitro transcription/translation.	764	882
15818664	The function of these variants was studied in transfected human immortalized CH-8 articular chondrocytes.	883	988
15818664	RESULTS: Sporadic chondrocalcinosis was associated with a G-to-A transition in the ANKH 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) at 4 bp upstream of the start codon (in homozygotes of the minor allele, genotype relative risk 6.0, P = 0.0006; overall genotype association P = 0.02).	989	1261
15818664	This -4-bp transition, as well as 2 mutations previously linked with familial and sporadic chondrocalcinosis (+14 bp C-to-T and C-terminal GAG deletion, respectively), but not the French familial chondrocalcinosis kindred 143-bp T-to-C mutation, increased reticulocyte ANKH transcription/ANKH translation in vitro.	1262	1576
15818664	Transfection of complementary DNA for both the wild-type ANKH and the -4-bp ANKH protein variant promoted increased extracellular PPi in CH-8 cells, but unexpectedly, these ANKH mutants had divergent effects on the expression of extracellular PPi and the chondrocyte hypertrophy marker, type X collagen.	1577	1880
15818664	CONCLUSION: A subset of sporadic chondrocalcinosis appears to be heritable via a -4-bp G-to-A ANKH 5'-UTR transition that up-regulates expression of ANKH and extracellular PPi in chondrocyte cells.	1881	2078
15818664	Distinct ANKH mutations associated with heritable chondrocalcinosis may promote disease by divergent effects on extracellular PPi and chondrocyte hypertrophy, which is likely to mediate differences in the clinical phenotypes and severity of the disease.	2079	2332
15824163	No Evidence for BRAF as a melanoma/nevus susceptibility gene.	0	61
15824163	Somatic mutations of BRAF have been identified in both melanoma tumors and benign nevi.	62	149
15824163	Germ line mutations in BRAF have not been identified as causal in families predisposed to melanoma.	150	249
15824163	However, a recent study suggested that a BRAF haplotype was associated with risk of sporadic melanoma in men.	250	359
15824163	Polymorphisms or other variants in the BRAF gene may therefore act as candidate low-penetrance genes for nevus/melanoma susceptibility.	360	495
15824163	We hypothesized that promoter variants would be the most likely candidates for determinants of risk.	496	596
15824163	Using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened peripheral blood DNA from 184 familial melanoma cases for BRAF promoter variants.	597	759
15824163	We identified a promoter insertion/deletion in linkage disequilibrium with the previously described BRAF polymorphism in intron 11 (rs1639679) reported to be associated with melanoma susceptibility in males.	760	967
15824163	We therefore investigated the contribution of this BRAF polymorphism to melanoma susceptibility in 581 consecutively recruited incident cases, 258 incident cases in a study of late relapse, 673 female general practitioner controls, and the 184 familial cases.	968	1227
15824163	We found no statistically significant difference in either genotype or allele frequencies between cases and controls overall or between male and female cases for the BRAF polymorphism in the two incident case series.	1228	1444
15824163	Our results therefore suggest that the BRAF polymorphism is not significantly associated with melanoma and the promoter insertion/deletion linked with the polymorphism is not a causal variant.	1445	1637
15824163	In addition, we found that there was no association between the BRAF genotype and mean total number of banal or atypical nevi in either the cases or controls.	1638	1796

15970799	OBJECTIVES: SLCO1B1*5 and SLCO1B1*15 have been reported to reduce the clearance of pravastatin in healthy volunteers.	167	284
15970799	However, there remains controversy in the effects of SLCO1B1*5 on the activity of OATP1B1 in vitro.	285	384
15970799	In addition, the effect of SLCO1B1*15 on the function of OATP1B1 has not been studied using cDNA-expression systems.	385	501
15970799	Object of the present study was to study the influence of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, a novel haplotype found in a patient with pravastatin-induced myopathy, on the functional properties of OATP1B1 by transient expression systems of HEK293 and HeLa cells using endogenous conjugates and statins as substrates.	502	814
15970799	METHODS: Transporting assays for endogenous substrates were performed using tritium labeled estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide and estrone-3-sulfate.	815	960
15970799	Quantitation of pravastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin and simvastatin were carried out using HPLC tandem mass spectrometry.	961	1086
15970799	RESULTS: The transporting activities of cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G decreased significantly but those of SLCO1B1*1b, *1a+C1007G and *1b+C1007G were not altered for all of the substrates tested except for simvastatin.	1087	1322
15970799	Kinetic analysis of pravastatin and atorvastatin showed that Km values were not altered but Vmax values decreased significantly in cells expressing SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G.	1323	1501
15970799	Immunocytochemical study showed that SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G proteins are localized not only at the plasma membrane but also in the intracellular space.	1502	1660
15970799	CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 521T>C, existing commonly in SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G, is the key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that determines the functional properties of SLCO1B1*5, *15 and *15+C1007G allelic proteins and that decreased activities of these variant proteins are mainly caused by a sorting error produced by this SNP.	1661	2016
16001362	An autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia linked to chromosome 16q22.1 is associated with a single-nucleotide substitution in the 5' untranslated region of the gene encoding a protein with spectrin repeat and Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange-factor domains.	0	254
16001362	Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) is a group of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders.	255	355
16001362	By positional cloning, we have identified the gene strongly associated with a form of degenerative ataxia (chromosome 16q22.1-linked ADCA) that clinically shows progressive pure cerebellar ataxia.	356	552
16001362	Detailed examination by use of audiogram suggested that sensorineural hearing impairment may be associated with ataxia in our families.	553	688
16001362	After restricting the candidate region in chromosome 16q22.1 by haplotype analysis, we found that all patients from 52 unrelated Japanese families harbor a heterozygous C-->T single-nucleotide substitution, 16 nt upstream of the putative translation initiation site of the gene for a hypothetical protein DKFZP434I216, which we have called "puratrophin-1" (Purkinje cell atrophy associated protein-1).	689	1090
16001362	The full-length puratrophin-1 mRNA had an open reading frame of 3,576 nt, predicted to contain important domains, including the spectrin repeat and the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho GTPases, followed by the Dbl-homologous domain, which indicates the role of puratrophin-1 in intracellular signaling and actin dynamics at the Golgi apparatus.	1091	1451
16001362	Puratrophin-1--normally expressed in a wide range of cells, including epithelial hair cells in the cochlea--was aggregated in Purkinje cells of the chromosome 16q22.1-linked ADCA brains.	1452	1638
16001362	Consistent with the protein prediction data of puratrophin-1, the Golgi-apparatus membrane protein and spectrin also formed aggregates in Purkinje cells.	1639	1792
16001362	The present study highlights the importance of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) in identification of genes of human disease, suggests that a single-nucleotide substitution in the 5' UTR could be associated with protein aggregation, and indicates that the GEF protein is associated with cerebellar degeneration in humans.	1793	2113
16321363	Congenital disorder of glycosylation Ic due to a de novo deletion and an hALG-6 mutation.	0	89
16321363	We describe a new cause of congenital disorder of glycosylation-Ic (CDG-Ic) in a young girl with a rather mild CDG phenotype.	90	215
16321363	Her cells accumulated lipid-linked oligosaccharides lacking three glucose residues, and sequencing of the ALG6 gene showed what initially appeared to be a homozygous novel point mutation (338G>A).	216	412
16321363	However, haplotype analysis showed that the patient does not carry any paternal DNA markers extending 33kb in the telomeric direction from the ALG6 region, and microsatellite analysis extended the abnormal region to at least 2.5Mb.	413	644
16321363	We used high-resolution karyotyping to confirm a deletion (10-12Mb) [del(1)(p31.2p32.3)] and found no structural abnormalities in the father, suggesting a de novo event.	645	814
16321363	Our findings extend the causes of CDG to larger DNA deletions and identify the first Japanese CDG-Ic mutation.	815	925
16330669	Array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis reveals recurrent chromosomal alterations and prognostic parameters in primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma.	0	166
16330669	PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical relevance of genomic aberrations in primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma (PCLBCL).	167	286
16330669	PATIENTS AND METHODS: Skin biopsy samples of 31 patients with a PCLBCL classified as either primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL; n = 19) or PCLBCL, leg type (n = 12), according to the WHO-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification, were investigated using array-based comparative genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and examination of promoter hypermethylation.	287	731
16330669	RESULTS: The most recurrent alterations in PCFCL were high-level DNA amplifications at 2p16.1 (63%) and deletion of chromosome 14q32.33 (68%).	732	874
16330669	FISH analysis confirmed c-REL amplification in patients with gains at 2p16.1.	875	952
16330669	In PCLBCL, leg type, most prominent aberrations were a high-level DNA amplification of 18q21.31-q21.33 (67%), including the BCL-2 and MALT1 genes as confirmed by FISH, and deletions of a small region within 9p21.3 containing the CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and NSG-x genes.	953	1214
16330669	Homozygous deletion of 9p21.3 was detected in five of 12 patients with PCLBCL, leg type, but in zero of 19 patients with PCFCL.	1215	1342
16330669	Complete methylation of the promoter region of the CDKN2A gene was demonstrated in one PCLBCL, leg type, patient with hemizygous deletion, in one patient without deletion, but in zero of 19 patients with PCFCL.	1343	1553
16330669	Seven of seven PCLBCL, leg type, patients with deletion of 9p21.3 and/or complete methylation of CDKN2A died as a result of their lymphoma.	1554	1693
16330669	CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate prominent differences in chromosomal alterations between PCFCL and PCLBCL, leg type, that support their classification as separate entities within the WHO-EORTC scheme.	1694	1898
16330669	Inactivation of CDKN2A by either deletion or methylation of its promoter could be an important prognostic parameter for the group of PCLBCL, leg type.	1899	2049
16419642	A novel missense mutation, F826Y, in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene in Japanese hypertensives: its implications for clinical phenotypes.	0	141
16419642	A gain-of-function mutation resulting in the S810L amino acid substitution in the hormone-binding domain of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR, locus symbol NR3C2) is responsible for early-onset hypertension that is exacerbated in pregnancy.	142	383
16419642	The objective of this study was to test whether other types of missense mutations in the hormone-binding domain could be implicated in hypertension in Japanese.	384	544
16419642	Here, we screened 942 Japanese patients with hypertension for the S810L mutation in exon 6 in the MR. We did not identify the S810L mutation in our hypertensive population, indicating that S810L does not play a major role in the etiology of essential hypertension in Japanese.	545	821
16419642	However, we identified a novel missense mutation, F826Y, in three patients in a heterozygous state, in addition to four single nucleotide polymorphisms, including one synonymous mutation (L809L).	822	1017
16419642	The F826Y mutation is present in the MR hormone-binding domain and might affect the ligand affinity.	1018	1118
16419642	The F826Y mutation was also identified in 13 individuals (5 hypertensives and 8 normotensives) in a Japanese general population (n=3,655).	1119	1257
16419642	The allele frequency was 0.00178.	1258	1291
16419642	The frequencies of the F826Y mutation in the hypertensive population (3/942) and in the hypertensive group (5/ 1,480) and the normotensive group (8/2,175) in the general population were not significantly different, suggesting that this mutation does not greatly affect hypertension.	1292	1574
16419642	Although it is unclear at present whether or not the F826Y mutation makes a substantial contribution to the mineralocorticoid receptor activity, this missense mutation may contribute, to some extent, to clinical phenotypes through its effects on MR.	1575	1824
16629641	Definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis C virus.	0	80
16629641	Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease.	81	209
16629641	The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.	210	318
16629641	Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic anemia.	319	492
16629641	Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders.	493	715
16629641	In general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life.	716	856
16629641	Although ribavirin-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates.	857	1021
16629641	Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages.	1022	1145
16629641	Viramidine, a liver-targeting prodrug of ribavirin, has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C.	1146	1347
16731636	Enhanced isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen.	0	101
16731636	We have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate.	102	268
16731636	In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso).	269	426
16731636	Transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen (TGR) were used.	427	490
16731636	In isolated hearts, Iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular (LV) pressure and maximal contraction (+dP/dt(max)) in the TGR than in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.	491	676
16731636	LV hypertrophy induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats (in g LV wt/100 g body wt, 0.28 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.004, respectively).	677	841
16731636	The greater LV hypertrophy in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta-AR and upregulation of LV beta-AR kinase-1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats.	842	1026
16731636	The decrease in the heart rate (HR) induced by the beta-AR antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats (-9.9 +/- 1.7% vs. -18.1 +/- 1.5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on HR was similar in both strains.	1027	1313
16731636	These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta-AR agonist-induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.	1314	1510
16737910	Identification of the nuclear localization motif in the ETV6 (TEL) protein.	0	75
16737910	ETV6, or Translocation-Ets-Leukemia (TEL), is an ETS family transcriptional repressor that is essential for establishing hematopoiesis in neonatal bone marrow, and is frequently a target of chromosomal translocations in human cancer.	76	309
16737910	ETV6 is predominantly a nuclear phosphoprotein that represses transcription by binding directly to the promoters of target genes.	310	439
16737910	The nuclear localization mechanism of ETV6, however, is not well understood.	440	516
16737910	In this report, we provide evidence that a nuclear localization signal (NLS) exists in the C-terminal region of ETV6.	517	634
16737910	ETV6 proteins with mutations outside of amino acids 332-452 localize to the nucleus, whereas proteins with mutations within amino acids 332-452 remain in the cytoplasm.	635	803
16737910	Furthermore, when a fragment of ETV6 comprised of amino acids 332-452 was fused to cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase protein, the fusion protein was able to enter the nucleus.	804	976
16737910	These results strongly indicate that residues 332-452 mediate nuclear localization of ETV6.	977	1068
16755009	Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of cognitive dysfunctions.	0	104
16755009	The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice.	105	282
16755009	The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds (DCE) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice.	283	464
16755009	Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory.	465	581
16755009	Diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models.	582	679
16755009	DCE (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice.	680	778
16755009	The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze.	779	931
16755009	Similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice.	932	1047
16755009	Furthermore, DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.).	1048	1156
16755009	Daucus carota extract (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice.	1157	1310
16755009	The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice.	1311	1446
16755009	There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of DCE.	1447	1592
16755009	Therefore, DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.	1593	1833
16822828	Genotyping of five chinese patients with 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency diagnosed through high-performance liquid chromatography serum adrenal profile: identification of two novel CYP17 mutations.	0	196
16822828	CONTEXT: 17alpha-Hydroxylase deficiency is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by CYP17 gene mutations.	197	317
16822828	OBJECTIVE: Five Chinese patients with 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency were genotyped.	318	402
16822828	PATIENTS: The five patients derived from four families living in Shandong Province, China.	403	493
16822828	The diagnosis of 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency was initially established through HPLC serum adrenal profiles in Qilu Hospital, China, from 1983-1993.	494	644
16822828	RESULTS: Three CYP17 gene mutations were identified from these patients.	645	717
16822828	Among them, V311fs and Y329fs are two novel frame-shifting mutations.	718	787
16822828	V311fs is an 8-bp nucleotide (TTAAATGG) deletion in exon 5.	788	847
16822828	Y329fs is a deletion-insertion combined mutation (TAC-->AA) at codon 329 in exon 6.	848	931
16822828	Two homozygotes for Y329fs and one compound heterozygote for Y329fs and V311fs were identified from three different families.	932	1057
16822828	Two homozygous sisters for the D487_S488_F489 deletion were identified.	1058	1129
16822828	CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the diagnostic value of the HPLC serum adrenal profile for 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency.	1130	1254
16822828	The D487_S488_F489 deletion had been identified in two previously genotyped Chinese families.	1255	1348
16822828	In our present study, a third Chinese family with this mutation was identified, suggesting that this mutation is a prevalent CYP17 mutation in the Chinese population.	1349	1515
16822828	The identification of Y329fs mutation in addition to three previously identified mutations at codon 329 suggests that codon 329 is an unstable point of the CYP17 gene.	1516	1683
16822828	The mutations identified from our five patients appear to be random, but the recurrence of the Y329fs mutation may be attributed to a founder effect.	1684	1833
16822828	Our studies suggest that 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency may not be rare in the Chinese population.	1834	1932
16904497	Cauda equina syndrome after epidural steroid injection: a case report.	0	70
16904497	OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral radiculopathy are physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, oral medications, and spinal manipulative therapy.	71	243
16904497	Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia.	244	312
16904497	The following case is a report of cauda equina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine.	313	440
16904497	CLINICAL FEATURES: A 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection.	441	558
16904497	INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: An 18-gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L4-5 level.	559	675
16904497	Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging.	676	771
16904497	After verifying the epidural space, bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injected.	772	862
16904497	After the injection, there was a reduction in radicular symptoms.	863	928
16904497	Three hours later, she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity weakness.	929	1013
16904497	The neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg.	1014	1121
16904497	There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test.	1122	1178
16904497	Deep-tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg.	1179	1243
16904497	She was unable to urinate.	1244	1270
16904497	The patient's symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours.	1271	1336
16904497	She had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling Foley catheter.	1337	1418
16904497	All of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours.	1419	1486
16904497	CONCLUSION: Complications associated with epidural steroid injections are rare.	1487	1566
16904497	Clinical examination and continued vigilance for neurologic deterioration after epidural steroid injections is important.	1567	1688
16970763	Mutations in the NDP gene: contribution to Norrie disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity.	0	127
16970763	BACKGROUND: To examine the contribution of mutations within the Norrie disease (NDP) gene to the clinically similar retinal diseases Norrie disease, X-linked familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), Coat's disease and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).	128	383
16970763	METHODS: A dataset comprising 13 Norrie-FEVR, one Coat's disease, 31 ROP patients and 90 ex-premature babies of <32 weeks' gestation underwent an ophthalmologic examination and were screened for mutations within the NDP gene by direct DNA sequencing, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or gel electrophoresis.	384	708
16970763	Controls were only screened using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis.	709	817
16970763	Confirmation of mutations identified was obtained by DNA sequencing.	818	886
16970763	RESULTS: Evidence for two novel mutations in the NDP gene was presented: Leu103Val in one FEVR patient and His43Arg in monozygotic twin Norrie disease patients.	887	1047
16970763	Furthermore, a previously described 14-bp deletion located in the 5' unstranslated region of the NDP gene was detected in three cases of regressed ROP.	1048	1199
16970763	A second heterozygotic 14-bp deletion was detected in an unaffected ex-premature girl.	1200	1286
16970763	Only two of the 13 Norrie-FEVR index cases had the full features of Norrie disease with deafness and mental retardation.	1287	1407
16970763	CONCLUSION: Two novel mutations within the coding region of the NDP gene were found, one associated with a severe disease phenotypes of Norrie disease and the other with FEVR.	1408	1583
16970763	A deletion within the non-coding region was associated with only mild-regressed ROP, despite the presence of low birthweight, prematurity and exposure to oxygen.	1584	1745
16970763	In full-term children with retinal detachment only 15% appear to have the full features of Norrie disease and this is important for counselling parents on the possible long-term outcome.	1746	1932
17000021	No independent role of the -1123 G>C and+2740 A>G variants in the association of PTPN22 with type 1 diabetes and juvenile idiopathic arthritis in two Caucasian populations.	0	172
17000021	INTRODUCTION: The PTPN22 is a negative regulator of the T cell response.	173	245
17000021	Its +1858C>T (R620W) polymorphism has been shown to associate with a risk for multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).	246	426
17000021	The minor (susceptibility) allele is absent in Asian populations, but a recent study suggested an independent involvement of another polymorphism located within the promoter -1123 nucleotides relative to the translational start site.	427	660
17000021	AIMS: We aimed to analyse the association of three PTPN22 polymorphisms in two distinct Caucasian populations, the Czechs (with T1D and with JIA) and Azeri (with T1D).	661	828
17000021	METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at positions -1123 (rs2488457), +1858 (rs2476601, the R620W substitution), and +2740 (rs1217412) were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 372 subjects with childhood-onset T1D, 130 subjects with JIA, and 400 control subjects of Czech origin, and in 160 subjects with T1D and 271 healthy controls of Azeri origin.	829	1189
17000021	RESULTS: In the Czechs, all three SNPs were in a tight linkage disequlibrium, while in the Azeri, the linkage disequlibrium was limited to between the promoter and 3'-UTR polymorphism, D'(-1123, +2740)=0.99, r(2)=0.72.	1190	1408
17000021	Haplotype reconstruction via the expectation-maximization algorithm showed in both populations that only the haplotype containing the minor (W) allele at codon 620 was associated with T1D (OR=2.26, 95% CI 1.68-3.02 in Czechs, OR=14.8, 95% CI 2.0-651 in Azeri) or JIA (OR=2.43, 95% CI 1.66-3.56 in Czechs).	1409	1714
17000021	The haplotypes having the wild-type (R) allele at codon 620 and minor alleles at -1123 and/or +2740 were neutral as to the risk of autoimmune conditions in both populations.	1715	1888
17000021	CONCLUSIONS: In two different Caucasian populations, the Czechs and the Azeri, no independent contribution can be detected either of the -1123 promoter SNP or the +2740 3'-UTR SNP, and only the minor allele at PTPN22 codon 620 contributes to the risk of autoimmunity.	1889	2156

17033974	Retinal signal transmission depends on the activity of high voltage-gated l-type calcium channels in photoreceptor ribbon synapses.	102	233
17033974	We recently identified a truncating frameshift mutation in the Cacna2d4 gene in a spontaneous mouse mutant with profound loss of retinal signaling and an abnormal morphology of ribbon synapses in rods and cones.	234	445
17033974	The Cacna2d4 gene encodes an l-type calcium-channel auxiliary subunit of the alpha (2) delta type.	446	544
17033974	Mutations in its human orthologue, CACNA2D4, were not yet known to be associated with a disease.	545	641
17033974	We performed mutation analyses of 34 patients who received an initial diagnosis of night blindness, and, in two affected siblings, we detected a homozygous nucleotide substitution (c.2406C-->A) in CACNA2D4.	642	848
17033974	The mutation introduces a premature stop codon that truncates one-third of the corresponding open reading frame.	849	961
17033974	Both patients share symptoms of slowly progressing cone dystrophy.	962	1028
17033974	These findings represent the first report of a mutation in the human CACNA2D4 gene and define a novel gene defect that causes autosomal recessive cone dystrophy.	1029	1190
17273972	Human TBX1 missense mutations cause gain of function resulting in the same phenotype as 22q11.2 deletions.	0	106
17273972	Deletion 22q11.2 syndrome is the most frequent known microdeletion syndrome and is associated with a highly variable phenotype, including DiGeorge and Shprintzen (velocardiofacial) syndromes.	107	298
17273972	Although haploinsufficiency of the T-box transcription factor gene TBX1 is thought to cause the phenotype, to date, only four different point mutations in TBX1 have been reported in association with six of the major features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.	299	553
17273972	Although, for the two truncating mutations, loss of function was previously shown, the pathomechanism of the missense mutations remains unknown.	554	698
17273972	We report a novel heterozygous missense mutation, H194Q, in a familial case of Shprintzen syndrome and show that this and the two previously reported missense mutations result in gain of function, possibly through stabilization of the protein dimer DNA complex.	699	960
17273972	We therefore conclude that TBX1 gain-of-function mutations can result in the same phenotypic spectrum as haploinsufficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations or deletions.	961	1135
17286451	Retinoblastoma in India : microsatellite analysis and its application in genetic counseling.	0	92
17286451	OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted with two objectives.	93	150
17286451	The first was to estimate the frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the RB1 gene as a mechanism in disease causation in tumors of patients from India.	151	308
17286451	The second objective was to employ RB1 molecular deletion and microsatellite-based linkage analysis as laboratory tools, while counseling families with a history of retinoblastoma (RB).	309	494
17286451	METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and tumors of 54 RB patients and their relatives.	495	593
17286451	Eight fluorescent microsatellite markers, both intragenic and flanking the RB1 gene, were used.	594	689
17286451	After PCR amplification, samples were run on an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer for LOH, deletion detection, and haplotype generation.	690	823
17286451	RESULTS: LOH was found in conjunction with tumor formation in 72.9% of RB patients (39/54 patients; p=0.001; 95% CI 0.6028, 0.8417); however, we could not associate various other clinical parameters of RB patients with the presence or absence of RB1 LOH.	824	1078
17286451	Seven germline deletions (13% of RB patients) were identified, and the maternal allele was more frequently lost (p=0.01).	1079	1200
17286451	A disease co-segregating haplotype was detected in two hereditary autosomal dominant cases.	1201	1292
17286451	CONCLUSION: LOH of the RB1 gene could play an important role in tumor formation.	1293	1373
17286451	Large deletions involving RB1 were observed, and a disease co-segregating haplotype was used for indirect genetic testing.	1374	1496
17286451	This is the first report from India where molecular testing has been applied for RB families in conjunction with genetic counseling.	1497	1629
17286451	In tertiary ophthalmic practice in India, there is an emerging trend towards the application of genetical knowledge in clinical practice.	1630	1767
17318851	Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) contribute to human tooth agenesis.	0	121
17318851	Phenotypic characteristics expressed in syndromes give clues to the factors involved in the cause of isolated forms of the same defects.	122	258
17318851	We investigated two genes responsible for craniofacial syndromes, FGFR1 and IRF6, in a collection of families with isolated tooth agenesis.	259	398
17318851	Cheek swab samples were obtained for DNA analysis from 116 case/parent trios.	399	476
17318851	Probands had at least one developmentally missing tooth, excluding third molars.	477	557
17318851	In addition, we studied 89 cases and 50 controls from Ohio to replicate any positive findings.	558	652
17318851	Genotyping was performed by kinetic polymerase chain-reaction or TaqMan assays.	653	732
17318851	Linkage disequilibrium analysis and transmission distortion of the marker alleles were performed.	733	830
17318851	The same variants in the IRF6 gene that are associated with isolated orofacial clefts are also associated with human tooth agenesis (rs861019, P = 0.058; rs17015215-V274I, P = 0.0006; rs7802, P = 0.004).	831	1034
17318851	Mutations in IRF6 cause Van der Woude and popliteal pterygium syndromes.	1035	1107
17318851	The craniofacial phenotypic characteristics of these syndromes include oral clefts and preferential tooth agenesis of incisors and premolars, besides pits on the lower lips.	1108	1281
17318851	Also it appears that preferential premolar agenesis is associated with FGFR1 (P = 0.014) and IRF6 (P = 0.002) markers.	1282	1400
17318851	There were statistically significant data suggesting that IRF6 interacts not only with MSX1 (P = 0.001), but also with TGFA (P = 0.03).	1401	1536
17327131	Molecular analysis of the CYP2F1 gene: identification of a frequent non-functional allelic variant.	0	99
17327131	The CYP2F1 is a human cytochrome P450 that is selectively expressed in lung tissue and involved in the metabolism of various pneumotoxicants with potential carcinogenic effects.	100	277
17327131	In the present study, we report the first systematic investigation of the genetic polymorphism of this enzyme.	278	388
17327131	We analyzed the nucleotidic sequence of the CYP2F1 gene in DNA samples from 90 French Caucasians consisting in 44 patients with lung cancer and 46 control individuals, using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of PCR products (PCR-SSCP).	389	639
17327131	We identified 24 novel mutations distributed in the promoter region of the gene, as well as in the coding regions and their flanking intronic sequences.	640	792
17327131	In addition to the wild-type CYP2F1*1 allele, seven allelic variant, CYP2F1*2A, *2B, *3, *4, *5A, *5B and *6, were characterized.	793	922
17327131	The most frequent allelic variant, CYP2F1*2A (25.6%), harbors a combination of 9 mutations, including 2 missense mutations (Asp218Asn and Gln266His) and a 1-bp insertion (c.14_15insC) that creates a premature stop codon in exon 2, probably leading to the synthesis of a severely truncated protein with no catalytic activity.	923	1247
17327131	The identification of around 7% of homozygotes for the frameshift mutation in our Caucasian population suggests the existence of an interindividual variation of the CYP2F1 activity and, consequently, the possibility of interindividual differences in the toxic response to some pneumotoxicants and in the susceptibility to certain chemically induced diseases.	1248	1606
17327131	However, our preliminary results did not show any evidence that the CYP2F1 genetic polymorphism has implications in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.	1607	1755
17384765	Succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead-exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure.	0	167
17384765	BACKGROUND: There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels.	168	296
17384765	However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure.	297	517
17384765	OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning.	518	733
17384765	RESULTS: Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb-exposed children.	734	917
17384765	Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit.	918	1149
17384765	In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen.	1150	1361
17384765	CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure.	1362	1519
17384765	These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children.	1520	1665
17384765	However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals.	1666	1828
17391797	The phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene V175M single nucleotide polymorphism confers the susceptibility to NASH in Japanese population.	0	149
17391797	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The genetic predisposition on the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been poorly understood.	150	279
17391797	A functional polymorphism Val175Met was reported in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine.	280	465
17391797	The aim of this study was to investigate whether the carriers of Val175Met variant impaired in PEMT activity are more susceptible to NASH.	466	604
17391797	METHODS: Blood samples of 107 patients with biopsy-proven NASH and of 150 healthy volunteers were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism.	605	796
17391797	RESULTS: Val175Met variant allele of the PEMT gene was significantly more frequent in NASH patients than in healthy volunteers (p<0.001), and carriers of Val175Met variant were significantly more frequent in NASH patients than in healthy volunteers (p<0.01).	797	1055
17391797	Among NASH patients, body mass index was significantly lower (p<0.05), and non-obese patients were significantly more frequent (p<0.001) in carriers of Val175Met variant than in homozygotes of wild type PEMT.	1056	1264
17391797	CONCLUSIONS: Val175Met variant of PEMT could be a candidate molecule that determines the susceptibility to NASH, because it is more frequently observed in NASH patients and non-obese persons with Val175Met variant of PEMT are facilitated to develop NASH.	1265	1519
17495183	Tenomodulin is associated with obesity and diabetes risk: the Finnish diabetes prevention study.	0	96
17495183	We recently showed that long-term weight reduction changes the gene expression profile of adipose tissue in overweight individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).	97	266
17495183	One of the responding genes was X-chromosomal tenomodulin (TNMD), a putative angiogenesis inhibitor.	267	367
17495183	Our aim was to study the associations of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes with adiposity, glucose metabolism, and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).	368	541
17495183	Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms from two different haploblocks were genotyped from 507 participants of the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS).	542	695
17495183	Sex-specific genotype effects were observed.	696	740
17495183	Three markers of haploblock 1 were associated with features of adiposity in women (rs5966709, rs4828037) and men (rs11798018).	741	867
17495183	Markers rs2073163 and rs1155794 from haploblock 2 were associated with 2-hour plasma glucose levels in men during the 3-year follow-up.	868	1003
17495183	The same two markers together with rs2073162 associated with the conversion of IGT to T2D in men.	1004	1101
17495183	The risk of developing T2D was approximately 2-fold in individuals with genotypes associated with higher 2-hour plasma glucose levels; the hazard ratios were 2.192 (p = 0.025) for rs2073162-A, 2.191 (p = 0.027) for rs2073163-C, and 1.998 (p = 0.054) for rs1155974-T.	1102	1368
17495183	These results suggest that TNMD polymorphisms are associated with adiposity and also with glucose metabolism and conversion from IGT to T2D in men.	1369	1516
17572393	Neuroprotective effects of melatonin upon the offspring cerebellar cortex in the rat model of BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia.	0	126
17572393	Cortical dysplasia is a malformation characterized by defects in proliferation, migration and maturation.	127	232
17572393	This study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum induced by maternal exposure to carmustine-[1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoure] (BCNU) and to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin upon cerebellar BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia, using histological and biochemical analyses.	233	549
17572393	Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: intact-control, saline-control, melatonin-treated, BCNU-exposed and BCNU-exposed plus melatonin.	550	697
17572393	Rats were exposed to BCNU on embryonic day 15 and melatonin was given until delivery.	698	783
17572393	Immuno/histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum, and levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were determined.	784	947
17572393	Histopathologically, typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups, but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in BCNU-exposed cortical dysplasia group.	948	1155
17572393	There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in BCNU-exposed group, but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed, indicating a delayed maturation, and melatonin significantly reversed these changes.	1156	1489
17572393	Malondialdehyde level in BCNU-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups.	1490	1745
17572393	These data suggest that exposure of animals to BCNU during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and melatonin protects the cerebellum against the effects of BCNU.	1746	1933
17935240	Somatic and gonadal mosaicism in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.	0	63
17935240	The g.ORF15 + 652-653delAG mutation in the RPGR gene is the most frequent mutation in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP).	64	187
17935240	The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of mosaicism in an XLRP family.	188	282
17935240	Eight subjects in the RP family were recruited.	283	330
17935240	Blood samples were collected for DNA extraction.	331	379
17935240	Haplotype analysis and mutational screening on the RPGR gene were performed.	380	456
17935240	Additionally, samples of hair follicles and buccal cells from the mother of the proband were acquired for DNA extraction and molecular analysis.	457	601
17935240	Phenotype was characterized with routine ophthalmic examination, Goldmann perimetry, electroretinography, and color fundus photography.	602	737
17935240	A g.ORF15 + 652-653delAG mutation was identified in second- and third-generation patients/carriers.	738	837
17935240	A first-generation female, who was considered to be an obligate carrier, demonstrated a normal phenotype as well as a normal genotype in lymphocytic DNA, indicating the gonadal mosaicism; however, a heterozygous AG-deletion at nucleotide 652 and 653 was identified in the genomic DNA of hair follicles, hair shaft, and buccal cells, indicating that the mutation is somatic.	838	1211
17935240	In conclusion, we reported on a family in which an asymptomatic woman with somatic-gonadal mosaicism for a RPGR gene mutation transmitted the mutation to an asymptomatic daughter and to a son with XLRP.	1212	1414
17935240	Gonadal mosaicism may be responsible for a proportion of multiplex or simplex RP families, in which more than 50% of all cases of RP are found.	1415	1558

17962394	Skewed X inactivation in an X linked nystagmus family resulted from a novel, p.R229G, missense mutation in the FRMD7 gene.	0	122
17962394	AIMS: This study aimed to identify the underlying genetic defect of a large Turkish X linked nystagmus (NYS) family.	123	239
17962394	METHODS: Both Xp11 and Xq26 loci were tested by linkage analysis.	240	305
17962394	The 12 exons and intron-exon junctions of the FRMD7 gene were screened by direct sequencing.	306	398
17962394	X chromosome inactivation analysis was performed by enzymatic predigestion of DNA with a methylation-sensitive enzyme, followed by PCR of the polymorphic CAG repeat of the androgen receptor gene.	399	594
17962394	RESULTS: The family contained 162 individuals, among whom 28 had NYS.	595	664
17962394	Linkage analysis confirmed the Xq26 locus.	665	707
17962394	A novel missense c.686C>G mutation, which causes the substitution of a conserved arginine at amino acid position 229 by glycine (p.R229G) in exon 8 of the FRMD7 gene, was observed.	708	888
17962394	This change was not documented in 120 control individuals.	889	947
17962394	The clinical findings in a female who was homozygous for the mutation were not different from those of affected heterozygous females.	948	1081
17962394	Skewed X inactivation was remarkable in the affected females of the family.	1082	1157
17962394	CONCLUSIONS: A novel p.R229G mutation in the FRMD7 gene causes the NYS phenotype, and skewed X inactivation influences the manifestation of the disease in X linked NYS females.	1158	1334
18235024	Cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response is strictly associated with mutations in KCNV2.	0	92
18235024	PURPOSE: Cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response (CDSRR) is a retinal disorder characterized by reduced visual acuity, color vision defects, and specific alterations of ERG responses that feature elevated scotopic b-wave amplitudes at high luminance intensities.	93	360
18235024	Mutations in PDE6H and in KCNV2 have been described in CDSRR.	361	422
18235024	A combined clinical and genetic study was conducted in a cohort of patients with CDSRR, to substantiate these prior RESULTS: Seventeen patients from 13 families underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination including color vision testing, Goldmann visual fields, fundus photography, Ganzfeld and multifocal ERGs, and optical coherence tomography.	423	767
18235024	The coding sequences and flanking intron/UTR sequences of PDE6C and KCNV2 were screened for mutations by means of DHPLC and direct DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA.	768	943
18235024	results.	944	952
18235024	Whereas no mutations were detected in the PDE6H gene, mutations in KCNV2 were identified in all patients, in either the homozygous or compound heterozygous state.	953	1115
18235024	Ten of the 11 identified mutations were novel, including three missense and six truncating mutations and one gross deletion.	1116	1240
18235024	The mutations concordantly segregate in all available families according a recessive mode of inheritance.	1241	1346
18235024	The CDSRR phenotype was associated with reduced visual acuity of variable degree and color vision defects.	1347	1453
18235024	Macular defects ranging from mild pigmentary changes to distinct foveal atrophy were present in nine patients.	1454	1564
18235024	Progression of the disease was observed in only three of seven patients with follow-up data.	1565	1657
18235024	CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype of cone dystrophy with supernormal rod response is tightly linked with mutations in KCNV2.	1658	1775
18408250	A single nucleotide polymorphism in the IRF5 promoter region is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in the Japanese population.	0	146
18408250	OBJECTIVES: Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a member of the IRF family of transcription factors, which regulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines.	147	312
18408250	Polymorphisms in the IRF5 gene have been associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythaematosus (SLE) in Caucasian and Asian populations, but their involvement in other autoimmune diseases is still uncertain.	313	530
18408250	Here, we assessed the genetic role of IRF5 in susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Japanese subjects.	531	642
18408250	METHODS: We selected 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a CGGGG insertion-deletion polymorphism in the IRF5 gene.	643	767
18408250	We performed 2 sets of case-control comparisons using Japanese subjects (first set: 830 patients with RA and 658 controls; second set: 1112 patients with RA and 940 controls), and then performed a stratified analysis using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) status.	768	1053
18408250	We genotyped the SNPs using TaqMan assays.	1054	1096
18408250	RESULTS: A significant association of the rs729302 A allele with RA susceptibility was found in both sets (odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.35, p<0.001 in the combined analysis).	1097	1281
18408250	When the patients were stratified by the SE, the rs729302 A allele was found to confer increased risk to RA in patients that were SE negative (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92, p = 0.001) as compared with patients carrying the SE (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.33, p = 0.24).	1282	1549
18408250	In both sets, no genotyped polymorphisms were significantly associated with RA susceptibility, but rs729302 was significantly associated.	1550	1687
18408250	CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the promoter polymorphism of IRF5 is a genetic factor conferring predisposition to RA, and that it contributes considerably to disease pathogenesis in patients that were SE negative.	1688	1912
18487244	Depletion of mitochondrial DNA in fibroblast cultures from patients with POLG1 mutations is a consequence of catalytic mutations.	0	129
18487244	We investigated clinical and cellular phenotypes of 24 children with mutations in the catalytic (alpha) subunit of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gamma polymerase (POLG1).	130	300
18487244	Twenty-one had Alpers syndrome, the commonest severe POLG1 autosomal recessive phenotype, comprising hepatoencephalopathy and often mtDNA depletion.	301	449
18487244	The cellular mtDNA content reflected the genotype more closely than did clinical features.	450	540
18487244	Patients with tissue depletion of mtDNA all had at least one allele with either a missense mutation in a catalytic domain or a nonsense mutation.	541	686
18487244	Four out of 12 patients exhibited a progressive, mosaic pattern of mtDNA depletion in cultured fibroblasts.	687	794
18487244	All these patients had mutations in a catalytic domain in both POLG1 alleles, in either the polymerase or exonuclease domain or both.	795	928
18487244	The tissue mtDNA content of patients who had two linker mutations was normal, and their phenotypes the mildest.	929	1040
18487244	Epilepsy and/or movement disorder were major features in all 21.	1041	1105
18487244	Previous studies have implicated replication stalling as a mechanism for mtDNA depletion.	1106	1195
18487244	The mosaic cellular depletion that we have demonstrated in cell cultures may be a manifestation of severe replication stalling.	1196	1323
18487244	One patient with a severe cellular and clinical phenotype was a compound heterozygote with POLG1 mutations in the polymerase and exonuclease domain intrans.	1324	1480
18487244	This suggests that POLG1 requires both polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease activity in the same molecule.	1481	1583
18487244	This is consistent with current functional models for eukaryotic DNA polymerases, which alternate between polymerizing and editing modes, as determined by competition between these two active sites for the 3' end of the DNA.	1584	1808
18631865	mToR inhibitors-induced proteinuria: mechanisms, significance, and management.	0	78
18631865	Massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of rapamycin (mToR) inhibitors, especially sirolimus, in renal transplant recipients with chronic allograft nephropathy.	79	316
18631865	Because proteinuria is a major predictive factor of poor transplantation outcome, many studies focused on this adverse event during the past years.	317	464
18631865	Whether proteinuria was due to sirolimus or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range proteinuria has been observed during sirolimus therapy in islet transplantation and in patients who received sirolimus de novo.	465	727
18631865	Podocyte injury and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have been related to mToR inhibition in some patients, but the pathways underlying these lesions remain hypothetic.	728	898
18631865	We discuss herein the possible mechanisms and the significance of mToR blockade-induced proteinuria.	899	999
18768591	Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 in doxorubicin-induced nephrotic syndrome.	0	87
18768591	Doxorubicin-induced nephropathy leads to epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)-dependent volume retention and renal fibrosis.	88	208
18768591	The aldosterone-sensitive serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and salt excess.	209	414
18768591	The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome.	415	540
18768591	To this end, doxorubicin (15 mug/g body wt) was injected intravenously into gene-targeted mice lacking SGK1 (sgk1(-/-)) and their wild-type littermates (sgk1(+/+)).	541	705
18768591	Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria (>100 mg protein/mg crea) in 15/44 of sgk1(+/+) and 15/44 of sgk1(-/-) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites, lipidemia, and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes.	706	934
18768591	Plasma aldosterone levels increased in nephrotic mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1(+/+) mice.	935	1079
18768591	Urinary sodium excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1(+/+) mice (15 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) than in sgk1(-/-) mice (35 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) and was associated with a significantly higher body weight gain in sgk1(+/+) compared with sgk1(-/-) mice (+6.6 +/- 0.7 vs. +4.1 +/- 0.8 g).	1080	1370
18768591	During the course of nephrotic syndrome, serum urea concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk1(-/-) mice than in sgk1(+/+) mice leading to uremia and a reduced median survival in sgk1(-/-) mice (29 vs. 40 days in sgk1(+/+) mice).	1371	1611
18768591	In conclusion, gene-targeted mice lacking SGK1 showed blunted volume retention, yet were not protected against renal fibrosis during experimental nephrotic syndrome.	1612	1777
18991055	Association between polymorphisms in SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, FTO, WFS1, CDKAL1, KCNQ1 and type 2 diabetes in the Korean population.	0	141
18991055	According to recent genome-wide association studies, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).	142	313
18991055	The aim of the present study was to investigate the association among the polymorphisms of SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, FTO, WFS1, CDKAL1 and KCNQ1 and the risk of T2DM in the Korean population.	314	513
18991055	This study was based on a multicenter case-control study, including 908 patients with T2DM and 502 non-diabetic controls.	514	635
18991055	We genotyped rs13266634, rs1111875, rs10811661, rs4402960, rs8050136, rs734312, rs7754840 and rs2237892 and measured the body weight, body mass index and fasting plasma glucose in all patients and controls.	636	842
18991055	The strongest association was found in a variant of CDKAL1 [rs7754840, odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.50-2.10, p = 5.0 x 10(-11)].	843	977
18991055	The G allele of rs1111875 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.18-1.72, p = 1.8 x 10(-4)) in HHEX), the T allele of rs10811661 (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.23-1.75, p = 2.1 x 10(-5)) in CDKN2A/B) and the C allele of rs2237892 (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.10-1.56, p = 0.003) in KCNQ1 showed significant associations with T2DM.	978	1278
18991055	Rs13266634 (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.00-1.42, p = 0.045) in SLC30A8 showed a nominal association with the risk of T2DM, whereas SNPs in IGF2BP2, FTO and WFS1 were not associated.	1279	1454
18991055	In conclusion, we have shown that SNPs in HHEX, CDKN2A/B, CDKAL1, KCNQ1 and SLC30A8 confer a risk of T2DM in the Korean population.	1455	1586
19058010	Effect of green tea and vitamin E combination in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats.	0	101
19058010	The present study was aimed to investigate the combined effects of green tea and vitamin E on heart weight, body weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, endogenous antioxidants and membrane bound ATPases in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction in rats.	102	377
19058010	Adult male albino rats, treated with ISO (200 mg/kg, s.c.) for 2 days at an interval of 24 h caused a significant (P<0.05) elevation of heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation and Ca+2 ATPase level whereas there was a significant (P<0.05) decrease in body weight, endogenous antioxidants, Na+/ K+ ATPase and Mg+2 ATPase levels.	378	720
19058010	Administration of green tea (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and vitamin E (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) together for 30 consecutive days and challenged with ISO on the day 29th and 30th, showed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, Ca+2 ATPase and a significant increase in the body weight, endogenous antioxidants, Na+/K+ ATPase and Mg+2 ATPase when compared with ISO treated group and green tea or vitamin E alone treated groups.	721	1187
19058010	These findings indicate the synergistic protective effect of green tea and vitamin E during ISO induced myocardial infarction in rats.	1188	1322
19218574	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85alpha regulatory subunit gene Met326Ile polymorphism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.	0	126
19218574	BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance is a core feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).	127	212
19218574	Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is an important enzyme in the early insulin signaling cascade and plays a key role in insulin-mediated glucose transport.	213	369
19218574	In its regulatory subunit, p85alpha, there is a common amino acid substitution (the Met326Ile polymorphism), and this amino acid may be crucial for the function of the p85alpha regulatory subunit and PI3-kinase.	370	581
19218574	METHODS: Analysis of the Met326Ile polymorphism was carried out on DNA samples from 256 PCOS patients and 283 controls.	582	701
19218574	Clinical and biochemical profiles of participants were also compared.	702	771
19218574	RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the Met326Ile polymorphism in the PCOS group was not different from that of the controls (Met326Met/Met326Ile/Ile326Ile rates were 73.4%/23.4%/3.2% and 70.3%/26.1%/3.6% for the PCOS and control groups, respectively, P = 0.72).	772	1036
19218574	The PCOS group was divided into two subgroups according to the presence of the variant 326Ile allele.	1037	1138
19218574	Compared with those carrying at least one variant 326Ile allele, carriers with the Met326Met genotype had higher serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) {1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.3] ng/ml in those with the Met326Met genotype versus 0.8 (95% CI 0.7-1.0) ng/ml in those with Ile326Ile and Met326Ile genotypes, P = 0.0073} and free testosterone levels [1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.4) pg/ml for Met326Met genotype versus 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.3) pg/ml for Ile326Ile and Met326Ile genotypes, P = 0.038].	1139	1636
19218574	CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the PI3-kinase gene Met326Ile polymorphism may not be a major determinant for the development of PCOS, but it may modulate the concentrations of serum 17-OHP or free testosterone in PCOS patients.	1637	1871
19353688	Pure monosomy and pure trisomy of 13q21.2-31.1 consequent to a familial insertional translocation: exclusion of PCDH9 as the responsible gene for autosomal dominant auditory neuropathy (AUNA1).	0	193
19353688	Insertional translocations (IT) are rare structural rearrangements.	194	261
19353688	Offspring of IT balanced carriers are at high risk to have either pure partial trisomy or monosomy for the inserted segment as manifested by "pure" phenotypes.	262	421
19353688	We describe an IT between chromosomes 3 and 13 segregating in a three-generation pedigree.	422	512
19353688	Short tandem repeat (STR) segregation analysis and array-comparative genomic hybridization were used to define the IT as a 25.1 Mb segment spanning 13q21.2-q31.1.	513	675
19353688	The phenotype of pure monosomy included deafness, duodenal stenosis, developmental and growth delay, vertebral anomalies, and facial dysmorphisms; the trisomy was manifested by only minor dysmorphisms.	676	877
19353688	As the AUNA1 deafness locus on 13q14-21 overlaps the IT in the PCDH9 (protocadherin-9) gene region, PCDH9 was investigated as a candidate gene for deafness in both families.	878	1051
19353688	Genotyping of STRs and single nucleotide polymorphisms defined the AUNA1 breakpoint as 35 kb 5' to PCDH9, with a 2.4 Mb area of overlap with the IT.	1052	1200
19353688	DNA sequencing of coding regions in the AUNA1 family and in the retained homologue chromosome in the monosomic patient revealed no mutations.	1201	1342
19353688	We conclude that AUNA1 deafness does not share a common etiology with deafness associated with monosomy 13q21.2-q31.3; deafness may result from monosomy of PCHD9 or another gene in the IT, as has been demonstrated in contiguous gene deletion syndromes.	1343	1595
19353688	Precise characterization of the breakpoints of the translocated region is useful to identify which genes may be contributing to the phenotype, either through haploinsufficiency or extra dosage effects, in order to define genotype-phenotype correlations.	1596	1849
19521089	Serotonin transporter gene polymorphic element 5-HTTLPR increases the risk of sporadic Parkinson's disease in Italy.	0	116
19521089	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder causing muscular rigidity, resting tremor and bradykinesia.	117	233
19521089	We conducted an association study assessing how PD risk in Italy was influenced by the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) polymorphic region 5-HTTLPR, consisting of an insertion/deletion (long allele-L/short allele-S) of 43 bp in the SLC6A4 promoter region.	234	492
19521089	The SLC6A4 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism rs25531(A-->G) was evaluated too.	493	577
19521089	We collected 837 independent subjects (393 PD, 444 controls).	578	639
19521089	An association between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and risk of PD (S/S genotype OR [95% CI]: 1.7[1.2-2.5], p = 0.002) was found.	640	766
19521089	The rs25531 and the haplotype 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 did not associate with risk of PD.	767	848
19521089	Our data indicate that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphic element within the SLC6A4 promoter may govern the genetic risk of PD in Italians.	849	978
19592582	Matriptase-2 mutations in iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia patients provide new insights into protease activation mechanisms.	0	131
19592582	Mutations leading to abrogation of matriptase-2 proteolytic activity in humans are associated with an iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) due to elevated hepcidin levels.	132	313
19592582	Here we describe two novel heterozygous mutations within the matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6) gene of monozygotic twin girls exhibiting an IRIDA phenotype.	314	459
19592582	The first is the frameshift mutation (P686fs) caused by the insertion of the four nucleotides CCCC in exon 16 (2172_2173insCCCC) that is predicted to terminate translation before the catalytic serine.	460	660
19592582	The second mutation is the di-nucleotide substitution c.467C>A and c.468C>T in exon 3 that causes the missense mutation A118D in the SEA domain of the extracellular stem region of matriptase-2.	661	854
19592582	Functional analysis of both variant matriptase-2 proteases has revealed that they lead to ineffective suppression of hepcidin transcription.	855	995
19592582	We also demonstrate that the A118D SEA domain mutation causes an intra-molecular structural imbalance that impairs matriptase-2 activation.	996	1135
19592582	Collectively, these results extend the pattern of TMPRSS6 mutations associated with IRIDA and functionally demonstrate that mutations affecting protease regions other than the catalytic domain may have a profound impact in the regulatory role of matriptase-2 during iron deficiency.	1136	1418
19642243	Acute renal failure in patients with AIDS on tenofovir while receiving prolonged vancomycin course for osteomyelitis.	0	117
19642243	Renal failure developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in 2 patients who were receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of an antiretroviral regimen.	118	289
19642243	Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule.	290	435
19642243	Vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic agent.	436	538
19642243	Clinicians should be aware that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure during prolonged administration of vancomycin.	539	663
19696792	Single nucleotide polymorphism in ABCG2 is associated with irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression.	0	102
19696792	Irinotecan is an anti-neoplastic agent that is widely used for treating colorectal and lung cancers, but often causes toxicities such as severe myelosuppression and diarrhea.	103	277
19696792	In this study, we performed a two-stage case-control association study for irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression (grades 3 and 4).	278	413
19696792	In the first stage, 23 patients who developed severe myelosuppression and 58 patients who did not develop any toxicity were examined for 170 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes involved in the metabolism and transport of irinotecan.	414	661
19696792	A total of five SNPs were identified to show the possible association with severe myelosuppression (P(Fisher)<0.01) and were further examined in 7 cases and 20 controls in the second stage of the study.	662	864
19696792	An intronic SNP, rs2622604, in ABCG2 showed P(Fisher)=0.0419 in the second stage and indicated a significant association with severe myelosuppression in the combined study (P(Fisher)=0.000237; P(Corrected)=0.036).	865	1078
19696792	Although only limited subjects were investigated, our results suggested that a genetic polymorphism in ABCG2 might alter the transport activity for the drug and elevate the systemic circulation level of irinotecan, leading to severe myelosuppression.	1079	1329
19728177	Prolonged hypothermia as a bridge to recovery for cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension associated with fulminant hepatic failure.	0	137
19728177	BACKGROUND: To review evidence-based treatment options in patients with cerebral edema complicating fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) and discuss the potential applications of hypothermia.	138	324
19728177	METHOD: Case-based observations from a medical intensive care unit (MICU) in a tertiary care facility in a 27-year-old female with FHF from acetaminophen and resultant cerebral edema.	325	508
19728177	RESULTS: Our patient was admitted to the MICU after being found unresponsive with presumed toxicity from acetaminophen which was ingested over a 2-day period.	509	667
19728177	The patient had depressed of mental status lasting at least 24 h prior to admission.	668	752
19728177	Initial evaluation confirmed FHF from acetaminophen and cerebral edema.	753	824
19728177	The patient was treated with hyperosmolar therapy, hyperventilation, sedation, and chemical paralysis.	825	927
19728177	Her intracranial pressure remained elevated despite maximal medical therapy.	928	1004
19728177	We then initiated therapeutic hypothermia which was continued for 5 days.	1005	1078
19728177	At re-warming, patient had resolution of her cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension.	1079	1169
19728177	At discharge, she had complete recovery of neurological and hepatic functions.	1170	1248
19728177	CONCLUSION: In patients with FHF and cerebral edema from acetaminophen overdose, prolonged therapeutic hypothermia could potentially be used as a life saving therapy and a bridge to hepatic and neurological recovery.	1249	1465
19728177	A clinical trial of hypothermia in patients with this condition is warranted.	1466	1543
19811499	Independent and cooperative roles of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor-kappaB, and bone morphogenetic protein-2 in regulation of metastasis and osteomimicry of prostate cancer cells and differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.	0	265
19811499	The molecular mechanisms involved in prostate cancer (PC) metastasis and bone remodeling are poorly understood.	266	377
19811499	We recently reported that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) mediates transcriptional regulation and activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 signaling by nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in bone metastatic prostate cancer cells.	378	630
19811499	In the present study, we demonstrate that NF-kappaB, whether activated by recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or by ectopic expression of the p65 subunit, is involved in extracellular matrix adhesion and invasion of osteotropic PC-3 and C4-2B, but not LNCaP, cells.	631	912
19811499	The enhanced metastatic potential was associated with transcriptional upregulation of osteopontin, osteocalcin, and collagen IA1 in osteotropic PC cells, suggesting their role in osteomimicry of PC cells.	913	1117
19811499	Unlike BMP-4, BMP-2 protein enhanced the invasive properties of C4-2B cells, but not in LNCaP cells.	1118	1218
19811499	Also, this effect was nullified by Noggin.	1219	1261
19811499	In addition, BMP-2 mediates TNF-alpha-induced invasion of C4-2B cells in a NF-kappaB-dependent fashion.	1262	1365
19811499	TNF-alpha or conditioned media (CM) of TNF-alpha-stimulated C4-2B cells upregulated BMP-2 and BMP-dependent Smad transcripts and inhibited receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand transcripts in RAW 264.7 preosteoclast cells, respectively, implying that this factor may contribute to suppression of osteoclastogenesis via direct and paracrine mechanisms.	1366	1718
19811499	In contrast, CM of TNF-alpha-stimulate or BMP2-stimulated C4-2B cells induced in vitro mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells in a BMP-2-dependent and NF-kappaB-dependent manner, respectively.	1719	1916
19811499	Taken together, the results suggest that mutual interactions between these factors may be pivotal not only in enhancing the osteomimicry and metastatic potential of PC cells, but also in bone remodeling and in shifting the balance from osteoclastogenesis towards osteoblastogenesis.	1917	2199
19918264	FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism and prostate cancer risk in Scottish men.	0	70
19918264	Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), a member of the fibroblast growth receptor family, was recently reported to be more abundantly expressed in malignant than benign prostate cells.	71	261
19918264	A single nucleotide polymorphism at position 388 of the FGFR4 amino-acid sequence results in the substitution of glycine (Gly) with arginine (Arg) and higher frequency of the ArgArg genotype was previously found in prostate cancer patients.	262	502
19918264	DNA was extracted from the blood drawn from 399 prostate cancer patients, 150 BPH patients and 294 healthy community controls.	503	629
19918264	Polymerase chain reaction was carried out and single nucleotide polymorphisms of FGFR4 were identified by restriction enzyme digestion.	630	765
19918264	No overall association is detectable between the Arg allele and increased prostate cancer risk.	766	861
19918264	Subgroup analysis shows a higher incidence of the heterozygous ArgGly genotype in cancer cases than in the combined group of BPH and controls (P<0.05); this difference is statistically significant between cancer and BPH patients but not between cancer cases and community controls.	862	1143
19918264	The single nucleotide polymorphism Gly(388)Arg in FGFR4 is not associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in Scottish men.	1144	1273
19918264	This observation is in contrast with results from two previous studies conducted in the USA and Japan.	1274	1376
19923525	Nimodipine prevents memory impairment caused by nitroglycerin-induced hypotension in adult mice.	0	96
19923525	BACKGROUND: Hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction.	97	234
19923525	We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine (NIMO) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory.	235	396
19923525	METHODS: The passive avoidance (PA) paradigm was used to assess memory retention.	397	478
19923525	For PA training, latencies (seconds) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered.	479	630
19923525	Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial.	631	686
19923525	Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) NTG immediately after learning, 3) NTG 3 h after learning, 4) NTG and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone.	687	896
19923525	The extent of hypotension and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals.	897	1044
19923525	RESULTS: All groups exhibited similar training latencies (17.0 +/- 4.6 s).	1045	1119
19923525	Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, NTG + NIMO, or delayed NTG (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively).	1120	1352
19923525	A Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups (H = 15.34; P < 0.001).	1353	1484
19923525	In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of NTG (n = 3) and NTG + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively.	1485	1776
19923525	Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with NIMO alone decreased from 88.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg to 80.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg.	1777	1894
19923525	The intergroup difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).	1895	1962
19923525	PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the NTG group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the NTG + NIMO groups, respectively.	1963	2149
19923525	There were no significant differences among groups.	2150	2201
19923525	CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of NTG immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect.	2202	2415
19923525	NIMO attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by NTG but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension.	2416	2556
19923525	The observed effect of NIMO may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension, because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups.	2557	2745
20105280	Activated Ras alters lens and corneal development through induction of distinct downstream targets.	0	99
20105280	BACKGROUND: Mammalian Ras genes regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation and are frequently mutated in human cancers.	100	256
20105280	Tumor development in response to Ras activation varies between different tissues and the molecular basis for these variations are poorly understood.	257	405
20105280	The murine lens and cornea have a common embryonic origin and arise from adjacent regions of the surface ectoderm.	406	520
20105280	Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway induces the corneal epithelial cells to proliferate and the lens epithelial cells to exit the cell cycle.	521	693
20105280	The molecular mechanisms that regulate the differential responses of these two related tissues have not been defined.	694	811
20105280	We have generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active version of human H-Ras in their lenses and corneas.	812	934
20105280	RESULTS: Ras transgenic lenses and corneal epithelial cells showed increased proliferation with concomitant increases in cyclin D1 and D2 expression.	935	1084
20105280	This initial increase in proliferation is sustained in the cornea but not in the lens epithelial cells.	1085	1188
20105280	Coincidentally, cdk inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 were upregulated in the Ras transgenic lenses but not in the corneas.	1189	1309
20105280	Phospho-Erk1 and Erk2 levels were elevated in the lens but not in the cornea and Spry 1 and Spry 2, negative regulators of Ras-Raf-Erk signaling, were upregulated more in the corneal than in the lens epithelial cells.	1310	1527
20105280	Both lens and corneal differentiation programs were sensitive to Ras activation.	1528	1608
20105280	Ras transgenic embryos showed a distinctive alteration in the architecture of the lens pit.	1609	1700
20105280	Ras activation, though sufficient for upregulation of Prox1, a transcription factor critical for cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation, is not sufficient for induction of terminal fiber differentiation.	1701	1921
20105280	Expression of Keratin 12, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, was reduced in the Ras transgenic corneas.	1922	2038
20105280	CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that Ras activation a) induces distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea resulting in distinct cellular responses and b) is sufficient for initiation but not completion of lens fiber differentiation.	2039	2304
20195852	Risk of nephropathy after consumption of nonionic contrast media by children undergoing cardiac angiography: a prospective study.	0	129
20195852	Despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures, the studies in pediatrics are limited, with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography.	130	429
20195852	This prospective study determined the incidence of CIN for two nonionic contrast media (CM), iopromide and iohexol, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of CM and the presence of cyanosis.	430	701
20195852	The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide (group A, n = 40) or iohexol (group B, n = 40).	702	818
20195852	Serum sodium (Na), potassium (K), and creatinine (Cr) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values, then measured again at 12-, 24-, and 48-h intervals after CM use.	819	996
20195852	Urine samples for Na and Cr also were checked at the same intervals.	997	1065
20195852	Risk of renal failure, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage renal damage (RIFLE criteria) were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population.	1066	1274
20195852	Accordingly, among the 15 CIN patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had renal injury.	1275	1470
20195852	Whereas 33.3% of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014).	1471	1743
20195852	Among the 15 patients with CIN, 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243).	1744	1916
20195852	Although clinically silent, CIN is not rare in pediatrics.	1917	1975
20195852	The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although CIN usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.	1976	2203
20520283	Efficacy and safety of asenapine in a placebo- and haloperidol-controlled trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.	0	133
20520283	Asenapine is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of schizophrenia or of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features.	134	340
20520283	In a double-blind 6-week trial, 458 patients with acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to fixed-dose treatment with asenapine at 5 mg twice daily (BID), asenapine at 10 mg BID, placebo, or haloperidol at 4 mg BID (to verify assay sensitivity).	341	590
20520283	With last observations carried forward (LOCF), mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score reductions from baseline to endpoint were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 mg BID (-16.2) and haloperidol (-15.4) than placebo (-10.7; both P < 0.05); using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), changes at day 42 were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID (-21.3 and -19.4, respectively) and haloperidol (-20.0) than placebo (-14.6; all P < 0.05).	591	1070
20520283	On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale, all treatments were superior to placebo with LOCF and MMRM; asenapine at 5 mg BID was superior to placebo on the negative subscale with MMRM and on the general psychopathology subscale with LOCF and MMRM.	1071	1338
20520283	Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% and 52%, 57%, and 41% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively.	1339	1499
20520283	Extrapyramidal symptoms reported as AEs occurred in 15% and 18%, 34%, and 10% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively.	1500	1661
20520283	Across all groups, no more than 5% of patients had clinically significant weight change.	1662	1750
20520283	Post hoc analyses indicated that efficacy was similar with asenapine and haloperidol; greater contrasts were seen in AEs, especially extrapyramidal symptoms.	1751	1908
20528871	Salvage therapy with nelarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide in relapsed/refractory paediatric T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphoma.	0	143
20528871	A combination of 5 d of nelarabine (AraG) with 5 d of etoposide (VP) and cyclophosphamide (CPM) and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was used as salvage therapy in seven children with refractory or relapsed T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma.	144	385
20528871	The most common side effects attributable to the AraG included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor neuropathy and musculoskeletal pain.	386	517
20528871	Haematological toxicity was greater for the combination than AraG alone, although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies.	518	692
20528871	All patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of AraG/VP/CPM.	693	839
20528871	Our experience supports the safety of giving AraG as salvage therapy in synchrony with etoposide and cyclophosphamide, although neurological toxicity must be closely monitored.	840	1016
20648600	High frequency of lamivudine resistance mutations in Brazilian patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B.	0	109
20648600	This study analyzed the genotype distribution and frequency of lamivudine (LAM) and tenofovir (TDF) resistance mutations in a group of patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV).	110	303
20648600	A cross-sectional study of 847 patients with HIV was conducted.	304	367
20648600	Patients provided blood samples for HBsAg detection.	368	420
20648600	The load of HBV was determined using an "in-house" real-time polymerase chain reaction.	421	508
20648600	HBV genotypes/subgenotypes, antiviral resistance, basal core promoter (BCP), and precore mutations were detected by DNA sequencing.	509	640
20648600	Twenty-eight patients with co-infection were identified.	641	697
20648600	The distribution of HBV genotypes among these patients was A (n = 9; 50%), D (n = 4; 22.2%), G (n = 3; 16.7%), and F (n = 2; 11.1%).	698	830
20648600	Eighteen patients were treated with LAM and six patients were treated with LAM plus TDF.	831	919
20648600	The length of exposure to LAM and TDF varied from 4 to 216 months.	920	986
20648600	LAM resistance substitutions (rtL180M + rtM204V) were detected in 10 (50%) of the 20 patients with viremia.	987	1094
20648600	This pattern and an accompanying rtV173L mutation was found in four patients.	1095	1172
20648600	Three patients with the triple polymerase substitution pattern (rtV173L + rtL180M + rtM204V) had associated changes in the envelope gene (sE164D + sI195M).	1173	1328
20648600	Mutations in the BCP region (A1762T, G1764A) and in the precore region (G1896A, G1899A) were also found.	1329	1433
20648600	No putative TDF resistance substitution was detected.	1434	1487
20648600	The data suggest that prolonged LAM use is associated with the emergence of particular changes in the HBV genome, including substitutions that may elicit a vaccine escape phenotype.	1488	1669
20648600	No putative TDF resistance change was detected after prolonged use of TDF.	1670	1744
20683499	Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L., crocin on streptozocin-induced model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease in male rats.	0	135
20683499	BACKGROUND: The involvement of water-soluble carotenoids, crocins, as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L. extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed.	136	317
20683499	In the present study, the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer's disease induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (STZ) in male rats was investigated.	318	484
20683499	METHODS: Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, STZ; 5 and 6, STZ + crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups.	485	662
20683499	In Alzheimer's disease groups, rats were injected with STZ-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar STZ-icv application was repeated.	663	822
20683499	In STZ + crocin animal groups, crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks.	823	958
20683499	Prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days.	959	1026
20683499	However, the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm, and for spatial cognition evaluation, Y-maze task was used.	1027	1178
20683499	RESULTS: It was found out that crocin (30 mg/kg)-treated STZ-injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y-maze than vehicle-treated STZ-injected rats.	1179	1348
20683499	In addition, crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ-injected group in passive avoidance test.	1349	1509
20683499	CONCLUSION: Therefore, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of crocin (30 mg/kg) in antagonizing the cognitive deficits caused by STZ-icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.	1510	1756
20806042	A novel mutation in GJA8 causing congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome in a Chinese pedigree.	0	96
20806042	PURPOSE: To identify the underlying genetic defect in a four-generation family of Chinese origin with autosomal dominant congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC).	97	266
20806042	METHODS: All individuals in the study underwent a full clinical examination and the details of history were collected .	267	386
20806042	Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and the exons of all candidate genes were sequenced.	387	539
20806042	RESULTS: Direct sequencing of the encoding regions of the candidate genes revealed a heterozygous mutation c.592C-->T in exon 2 of the gap junction protein, alpha 8 (GJA8) gene.	540	717
20806042	This mutation was responsible for the familial disorder through the substitution of a highly conserved arginine to tryptophan at codon 198 (p.R198W).	718	867
20806042	This change co-segregated with all affected members of the family, but was not detected either in the non-carrier relatives or in the 100 normal controls.	868	1022
20806042	CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first to relate p.R198W mutation in GJA8 with CCMC.	1023	1106
20806042	The result expands the mutation spectrum of GJA8 in associated with congenital cataract and microcornea, and implies that this gene has direct involvement with the development of the lens as well as the other anterior segment of the eye.	1107	1344
21496008	Screening and cell-based assessment of mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene.	0	95
21496008	ARX mutations cause a diverse spectrum of human disorders, ranging from severe brain and genital malformations to non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID).	96	253
21496008	ARX is a transcription factor with multiple domains that include four polyalanine (pA) tracts, the first two of which are frequently expanded by mutations.	254	409
21496008	We progressively screened DNA samples from 613 individuals with ID initially for the most frequent ARX mutations (c.304ins(GCG)(7)'expansion' of pA1 and c.429_452dup 'dup24bp' of pA2).	410	594
21496008	Five hundred samples without pA1 or pA2 mutations had the entire ARX ORF screened by single stranded polymorphism conformation (SSCP) and/or denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography (dHPLC) analysis.	595	800
21496008	Overall, eight families with six mutations in ARX were identified (1.31%): five duplication mutations in pA2 (0.82%) with three new clinical reports of families with the dup24bp and two duplications larger than the dup24bp mutation discovered (dup27bp, dup33bp); and three point mutations (0.6%), including one novel mutation in the homeodomain (c.1074G>T).	801	1158
21496008	Four ultraconserved regions distal to ARX (uc466-469) were also screened in a subset of 94 patients, with three unique nucleotide changes identified in two (uc466, uc467).	1159	1330
21496008	The subcellular localization of full length ARX proteins was assessed for 11 variants.	1331	1417
21496008	Protein mislocalization increased as a function of pA2 tract length and phenotypic severity, as has been previously suggested for pA1.	1418	1552
21496008	Similarly, protein mislocalization of the homeodomain mutations also correlated with clinical severity, suggesting an emerging genotype vs cellular phenotype correlation.	1553	1723
21699520	PTCH1 gene mutations in exon 17 and loss of heterozygosity on D9S180 microsatellite in sporadic and inherited human basal cell carcinomas.	0	138
21699520	BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most frequent human cancer that results from malignant transformation of basal cells in the epidermis.	139	290
21699520	Gorlin syndrome is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disease that predisposes with multiple BCCs and other birth defects.	291	414
21699520	Both sporadic and inherited BCCs are associated with mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTCH1, but there is still uncertainty on the role of its homolog PTCH2.	415	578
21699520	OBJECTIVES: To search for mutations and genomic instability in sporadic and inherited BCCs.	579	670
21699520	METHODS: DNA obtained from leukocytes and tumor cells was amplified by polymerase chain reaction regarding five exons of PTCH1 and PTCH2 and neighboring microsatellites.	671	840
21699520	Exons were sequenced and compared with the GenBank database.	841	901
21699520	RESULTS: Only D9S180, of six microsatellites, showed loss of heterozygosity in three BCCs (two sporadic and one inherited).	902	1025
21699520	One sporadic BCC presented the mutation g.2885G>C in exon 17 of PTCH1, which predicts the substitution p.R962T in an external domain of the protein.	1026	1174
21699520	In addition, the leukocytes and tumor cells of one patient with Gorlin syndrome showed the mutation g.2839T>G in the same exon and gene, which predicts a p.E947stop and truncated protein.	1175	1362
21699520	All control and tumor samples presented IVS9 + 217T in intron 9 of PTCH1.	1363	1436
21699520	CONCLUSION: Mutations found in the PTCH1 gene and neighboring repetitive sequences may have contributed to the development of the studied BCCs.	1437	1580
21799811	Strong association of 677 C>T substitution in the MTHFR gene with male infertility--a study on an indian population and a meta-analysis.	0	136
21799811	BACKGROUND: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme of folate and methionine metabolism, making it crucial for DNA synthesis and methylation.	137	305
21799811	The objective of this study was to analyze MTHFR gene 677C>T polymorphism in infertile male individuals from North India, followed by a meta-analysis on our data and published studies.	306	490
21799811	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We undertook genotyping on a total of 837 individuals including well characterized infertile (N=522) and confirmed fertile (N=315) individuals.	491	666
21799811	The SNP was typed by direct DNA sequencing.	667	710
21799811	Chi square test was done for statistical analysis.	711	761
21799811	Published studies were searched using appropriate keywords.	762	821
21799811	Source of data collection for meta-analysis included 'Pubmed', 'Ovid' and 'Google Scholar'.	822	913
21799811	Those studies analyzing 677C>T polymorphism in male infertility and presenting all relevant data were included in meta-analysis.	914	1042
21799811	The genotype data for infertile subjects and fertile controls was extracted from each study.	1043	1135
21799811	Chi square test was done to obtain odds ratio (OR) and p-value.	1136	1199
21799811	Meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (Version 2).	1200	1283
21799811	The frequency of mutant (T) allele (p=0.0025) and genotypes (CT+TT) (p=0.0187) was significantly higher in infertile individuals in comparison to fertile controls in our case-control study.	1284	1473
21799811	The overall summary estimate (OR) for allele and genotype meta-analysis were 1.304 (p=0.000), 1.310 (p=0.000), respectively, establishing significant association of 677C>T polymorphism with male infertility.	1474	1681
21799811	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 677C>T substitution associated strongly with male infertility in Indian population.	1682	1791
21799811	Allele and genotype meta-analysis also supported its strong correlation with male infertility, thus establishing it as a risk factor.	1792	1925
21810259	HIV-1 Tat activates indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in murine organotypic hippocampal slice cultures in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent manner.	0	156
21810259	BACKGROUND: We have established that activation of the tryptophan degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) mediates the switch from cytokine-induced sickness behavior to depressive-like behavior.	157	362
21810259	Because human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein causes depressive-like behavior in mice, we investigated its ability to activate IDO in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) derived from neonatal C57BL/6 mice.	363	597
21810259	METHODS: Depressive-like behavior in C57BL/6J mice was assessed by the forced swim test.	598	686
21810259	Expression of cytokines and IDO mRNA in OHSCs was measured by real-time RT-PCR and cytokine protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).	687	847
21810259	p38 MAPK phosphorylation was analyzed by western blot.	848	902
21810259	RESULTS: Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of Tat (40 ng) induced depressive-like behavior in the absence of sickness.	903	1035
21810259	Addition of Tat (40 ng/slice) to the medium of OHSCs induced IDO steady-state mRNA that peaked at 6 h. This effect was potentiated by pretreatment with IFNg.	1036	1193
21810259	Tat also induced the synthesis and release of TNFa and IL-6 protein in the supernatant of the slices and increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the serotonin transporter (SERT).	1194	1414
21810259	Tat had no effect on endogenous synthesis of IFNg.	1415	1465
21810259	To explore the mechanisms of Tat-induced IDO expression, slices were pretreated with the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB 202190 for 30 min before Tat treatment.	1466	1651
21810259	SB 202190 significantly decreased IDO expression induced by Tat, and this effect was accompanied by a reduction of Tat-induced expression of TNFa, IL-6, iNOS and SERT.	1652	1819
21810259	CONCLUSION: These data establish that Tat induces IDO expression via an IFNg-independent mechanism that depends upon activation of p38 MAPK.	1820	1960
21810259	Targeting IDO itself or the p38 MAPK signaling pathway could provide a novel therapy for comorbid depressive disorders in HIV-1-infected patients.	1961	2107
21911891	Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 serum levels and 4G/5G gene polymorphism in morbidly obese Hispanic patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.	0	155
21911891	BACKGROUND: The plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) has been implicated in the regulation of fibrinolysis and extracellular matrix components.	156	309
21911891	The single base pair guanine insertion/deletion polymorphism (4G/5G) within the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene influences PAI-1 synthesis and may modulate hepatic fibrogenesis.	310	489
21911891	AIM: To evaluate the influence of PAI-1 serum levels and 4G/5G polymorphism on the risk of liver fibrosis associated to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in morbidly obese patients.	490	679
21911891	MATERIAL AND METHODS: Case-control study of 50 obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery and 71 non-obese subjects matched by age and sex.	680	820
21911891	Anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed, including PAI-1 serum levels.	821	910
21911891	Genomic DNA was obtained to assess the presence of 4G/5G polymorphism.	911	981
21911891	RESULTS: BMI, insulinemia, triglycerides, HOMA-IR, hypertension and diabetes were significantly higher in obese patients compared to control subjects.	982	1132
21911891	PAI-1 serum levels observed in obese patients were significantly lower (10.63 4.82) compared to controls (14.26 11.4; p < 0.05).	1133	1261
21911891	No differences were observed in the PAI-1 4G/5G promoter genotypes frequencies (p = 0.12).	1262	1352
21911891	No differences were observed in PAI-1 plasma levels among obese patients with liver fibrosis (10.64 4.35) compared to patients without liver fibrosis (10.61 5.2; p = 0.985).	1353	1526
21911891	PAI-1 4G/5G promoter genotypes frequencies were similar in patients with or without liver fibrosis associated to NASH (p = 0.6).	1527	1655
21911891	CONCLUSIONS: Morbidly obese patients had significantly lower PAI-1 serum levels with similar PAI-1 4G/5G genotypes frequencies compared to non-obese subjects.	1656	1814
21911891	The frequency of 4G/5G genotypes in Chilean Hispanic healthy subjects was similar to that described in other populations.	1815	1936
21911891	No association was found between PAI-1 serum levels or 4G/5G genotype with liver fibrosis in obese patients.	1937	2045

22048266	Trisomy of the 21{st} chromosome leads to an over dosage of several regulatory genes in Down syndrome (DS).	94	201
22048266	Though allelic and genotypic combinations formed between genes are interesting, till date, this particular area has never been explored in DS.	202	344
22048266	In the present investigation four SNPs in two transcription factors, Single minded 2 (SIM2) and V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog2 (ETS2), located in the 21{st} chromosome were genotyped to understand their role in DS.	345	579
22048266	Genomic DNA of eastern Indian probands with DS (N=132), their parents (N=209) and ethnically matched controls (N=149) was subjected to PCR-based analyses of functionally important SNPs followed by statistical analyses.	580	798
22048266	ETS2 rs461155 showed high heterozygosity in DS.	799	846
22048266	Significantly lower frequency of SIM2 C-G haplotype (rs2073601-rs2073416) was noticed in individuals with DS (P value =0.01669) and their fathers (P value=0.01185).	847	1011
22048266	Significantly lower frequency of the A-C-C-G with higher frequency of A-C-A-G haplotypes was also noticed in subjects with DS (P value =0.02089 and 0.00588 respectively).	1012	1182
22048266	Data obtained indicate that the rs2073601 'A' allele, responsible for nonsynonymous substitution of leucine to methionine, may have some role in DS in this population.	1183	1350
22180037	Genetic polymorphism of the glutathione-S-transferase P1 gene (GSTP1) and susceptibility to prostate cancer in the Kashmiri population.	0	135
22180037	Glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is a critical enzyme of the phase II detoxification pathway.	136	233
22180037	One of the common functional polymorphisms of GSTP1 is A > G at nucleotide 313, which results in an amino acid substitution (Ile105Val) at the substrate binding site of GSTP1 and reduces catalytic activity of GSTP1.	234	449
22180037	To investigate the GSTP1 Ile105Val genotype frequency in prostate cancer cases in the Kashmiri population, we designed a case-control study, in which 50 prostate cancer cases and 45 benign prostate hyperplasia cases were studied for GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism, compared to 80 controls taken from the general population, employing the PCR-RFLP technique.	450	805
22180037	We found the frequency of the three different genotypes of GSTP1 Ile105Val in our ethnic Kashmir population, i.e., Ile/Ile, Ile/Val and Val/Val, to be 52.4, 33.3 and 14.3% among prostate cancer cases, 48.5, 37.5 and 14% among benign prostate hyperplasia cases and 73.8, 21.3 and 5% in the control population, respectively.	806	1128
22180037	There was a significant association between the GSTP1 Ile/Val genotype and the advanced age group among the cases.	1129	1243
22180037	We conclude that GSTP1 Ile/Val polymorphism is involved in the risk of prostate cancer development in our population.	1244	1361
22369755	Reciprocal effects of NNK and SLURP-1 on oncogene expression in target epithelial cells.	0	88
22369755	AIMS: To elucidate how the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed on bronchial and oral epithelial cells targeted by the tobacco nitrosamine (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK) facilitate carcinogenic transformation.	89	329
22369755	MAIN METHODS: Since NNK-dependent transformation can be abolished by the nicotinergic secreted mammalian Ly-6/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1 (SLURP-1), we compared effects of NNK and recombinant (r)SLURP-1 on the expression of genes related to tumorigenesis in human immortalized bronchial and oral epithelial cell lines BEP2D and Het-1A, respectively.	330	710
22369755	KEY FINDINGS: NNK stimulated expression of oncogenic genes, including MYB and PIK3CA in BEP2D, ETS1, NRAS and SRC in Het-1A, and AKT1, KIT and RB1 in both cell types, which could be abolished in the presence of rSLURP-1.	711	931
22369755	Other cancer-related genes whose upregulation by NNK was abolishable by rSLURP-1 were the growth factors EGF in BEP2D cells and HGF in Het-1A cells, and the transcription factors CDKN2A and STAT3 (Het-1A only).	932	1142
22369755	NNK also upregulated the anti-apoptotic BCL2 (Het-1A) and downregulated the pro-apoptotic TNF (Het-1A), BAX and CASP8 (BEP2D), all of which could be abolished, in part, by rSLURP-1.	1143	1324
22369755	NNK decreased expression of the CTNNB1 gene encoding the intercellular adhesion molecule beta-catenin (BEP2D), as well as tumor suppressors CDKN3 and FOXD3 in BEP2D cells and SERPINB5 in Het-1A cells.	1325	1525
22369755	These pro-oncogenic effects of NNK were abolished by rSLURP-1 that also upregulated RUNX3.	1526	1616
22369755	SIGNIFICANCE: The obtained results identified target genes for both NNK and SLURP-1 and shed light on the molecular mechanism of their reciprocal effects on tumorigenic transformation of bronchial and oral epithelial cells.	1617	1840
22729903	Contribution of STAT4 gene single-nucleotide polymorphism to systemic lupus erythematosus in the Polish population.	0	115
22729903	The STAT4 has been found to be a susceptible gene in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in various populations.	116	246
22729903	There are evident population differences in the context of clinical manifestations of SLE, therefore we investigated the prevalence of the STAT4 G > C (rs7582694) polymorphism in patients with SLE (n = 253) and controls (n = 521) in a sample of the Polish population.	247	514
22729903	We found that patients with the STAT4 C/G and CC genotypes exhibited a 1.583-fold increased risk of SLE incidence (95 % CI = 1.168-2.145, p = 0.003), with OR for the C/C versus C/G and G/G genotypes was 1.967 (95 % CI = 1.152-3.358, p = 0.0119).	515	760
22729903	The OR for the STAT4 C allele frequency showed a 1.539-fold increased risk of SLE (95 % CI = 1.209-1.959, p = 0.0004).	761	879
22729903	We also observed an increased frequency of STAT4 C/C and C/G genotypes in SLE patients with renal symptoms OR = 2.259 (1.365-3.738, p = 0.0014), (p (corr) = 0.0238) and in SLE patients with neurologic manifestations OR = 2.867 (1.467-5.604, p = 0.0016), (p (corr) = 0.0272).	880	1154
22729903	Moreover, we found a contribution of STAT4 C/C and C/G genotypes to the presence of the anti-snRNP Ab OR = 3.237 (1.667-6.288, p = 0.0003), (p (corr) = 0.0051) and the presence of the anti-Scl-70 Ab OR = 2.665 (1.380-5.147, p = 0.0028), (p (corr) = 0.0476).	1155	1412
22729903	Our studies confirmed an association of the STAT4 C (rs7582694) variant with the development of SLE and occurrence of some clinical manifestations of the disease.	1413	1575
23872883	Biochemical effects of Solidago virgaurea extract on experimental cardiotoxicity.	0	81
23872883	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major health problem of advanced as well as developing countries of the world.	82	199
23872883	The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of the Solidago virgaurea extract on isoproterenol-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.	200	352
23872883	The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total cholesterol, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (P < 0.05).	353	917
23872883	Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations.	918	1077
23872883	Captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study.	1078	1251
23872883	The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol-treated rats.	1252	1437
23872883	The study emphasizes the beneficial action of S. virgaurea extract as a cardioprotective agent.	1438	1533
24114426	Depression, impulsiveness, sleep, and memory in past and present polydrug users of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy).	0	133
24114426	RATIONALE: Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse.	134	237
24114426	Unfortunately, the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent.	238	348
24114426	OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT-related behaviors; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years, and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances.	349	627
24114426	METHODS: A sample of 997 participants (52 % male) was recruited to four control groups (non-drug (ND), alcohol/nicotine (AN), cannabis/alcohol/nicotine (CAN), non-ecstasy polydrug (PD)), and two ecstasy polydrug groups (present (MDMA) and past users (EX-MDMA).	628	888
24114426	Participants completed a drug history questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised which, in total, provided 13 psychometric measures.	889	1115
24114426	RESULTS: While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non-drug controls, the MDMA and EX-MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures.	1116	1336
24114426	Strikingly, despite prolonged abstinence (mean, 4.98; range, 4-9 years), past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery.	1337	1458
24114426	Compared with present ecstasy users, the past users showed no change for ten measures, increased impairment for two measures, and improvement on just one measure.	1459	1621
24114426	CONCLUSIONS: Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression, impulsiveness, and sleep disturbance, the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern.	1622	1846
24126708	Association of common genetic variants of HOMER1 gene with levodopa adverse effects in Parkinson's disease patients.	0	116
24126708	Levodopa is the most effective symptomatic therapy for Parkinson's disease, but its chronic use could lead to chronic adverse outcomes, such as motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and visual hallucinations.	117	318
24126708	HOMER1 is a protein with pivotal function in glutamate transmission, which has been related to the pathogenesis of these complications.	319	454
24126708	This study investigates whether polymorphisms in the HOMER1 gene promoter region are associated with the occurrence of the chronic complications of levodopa therapy.	455	620
24126708	A total of 205 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were investigated.	621	699
24126708	Patients were genotyped for rs4704559, rs10942891 and rs4704560 by allelic discrimination with Taqman assays.	700	809
24126708	The rs4704559 G allele was associated with a lower prevalence of dyskinesia (prevalence ratio (PR)=0.615, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.426-0.887, P=0.009) and visual hallucinations (PR=0.515, 95% CI 0.295-0.899, P=0.020).	810	1033
24126708	Our data suggest that HOMER1 rs4704559 G allele has a protective role for the development of levodopa adverse effects.	1034	1152
24132704	Crocin improves lipid dysregulation in subacute diazinon exposure through ERK1/2 pathway in rat liver.	0	102
24132704	INTRODUCTION: Diazinon Yis one of the most broadly used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture.	103	204
24132704	It has been shown that exposure to diazinon may interfere with lipid metabolism.	205	285
24132704	Moreover, the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established.	286	352
24132704	Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) expression.	353	503
24132704	The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism, ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute diazinon.	504	663
24132704	Furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on diazinon induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied.	664	772
24132704	METHODS: 24 Rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks; Corn oil (control), diazinon (15mg/kg per day, orally) and crocin (12.5 and 25mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally) in combination with diazinon (15 mg/kg).	773	1016
24132704	The levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL in blood of rats were analyzed.	1017	1096
24132704	Moreover mRNA levels of LDLr and ERK1/2 as well as protein levels of total and activated forms of ERK1/2 in rat liver were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis.	1097	1312
24132704	RESULTS: Our data showed that subacute exposure to diazinon significantly increased concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL.	1313	1449
24132704	Moreover diazinon decreased ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation and LDLr transcript.	1450	1529
24132704	Crocin reduced inhibition of ERK activation and diazinon-induced hyperlipemia and increased levels of LDLr transcript.	1530	1648
24132704	CONCLUSIONS: Crocin may be considered as a novel protective agent in diazinon-induced hyperlipemia through modulating of ERK pathway and increase of LDLr expression.	1649	1814
24535067	Prevention of etomidate-induced myoclonus: which is superior: Fentanyl, midazolam, or a combination?	0	100
24535067	A Retrospective comparative study.	101	135
24535067	BACKGROUND: In this retrospective comparative study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of fentanyl, midazolam, and a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to prevent etomidate-induced myoclonus.	136	334
24535067	MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed based on anesthesia records.	335	410
24535067	Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate, the patients were separated into 4 groups: no pretreatment (Group NP), fentanyl 1 ug.kg-1 (Group F), midazolam 0.03 mg.kg-1 (Group M), and midazolam 0.015 mg.kg-1 + fentanyl 0.5 ug.kg-1 (Group FM).	411	702
24535067	Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected: 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs, anesthesia is induced with 0.3 mg.kg-1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20-30 seconds.	703	939
24535067	Myoclonic movements are evaluated, which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection.	940	1084
24535067	The severity of pain due to etomidate injection, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and adverse effects were also evaluated.	1085	1210
24535067	RESULTS: Study results showed that myoclonus incidence was 85%, 40%, 70%, and 25% in Group NP, Group F, Group M, and Group FM, respectively, and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM.	1211	1405
24535067	CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pretreatment with fentanyl or combination of fentanyl and midazolam was effective in preventing etomidate-induced myoclonus.	1406	1560
24739405	Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone in amphetamine-induced schizophrenia models in mice.	0	86
24739405	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on animal models of schizophrenia.	87	188
24739405	METHODS: Seventy Swiss albino female mice (25-35 g) were divided into 4 groups: amphetamine-free (control), amphetamine, 50, and 100 mg/kg DHEA.	189	333
24739405	The DHEA was administered intraperitoneally (ip) for 5 days.	334	394
24739405	Amphetamine (3 mg/kg ip) induced hyper locomotion, apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously [sc]) induced climbing, and haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg sc) induced catalepsy tests were used as animal models of schizophrenia.	395	607
24739405	The study was conducted at the Animal Experiment Laboratories, Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey between March and May 2012.	608	792
24739405	Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis test for hyper locomotion, and one-way ANOVA for climbing and catalepsy tests.	793	929
24739405	RESULTS: In the amphetamine-induced locomotion test, there were significant increases in all movements compared with the amphetamine-free group.	930	1074
24739405	Both DHEA 50 mg/kg (p<0.05), and 100 mg/kg (p<0.01) significantly decreased all movements compared with the amphetamine-induced locomotion group.	1075	1220
24739405	There was a significant difference between groups in the haloperidol-induced catalepsy test (p<0.05).	1221	1322
24739405	There was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the apomorphine-induced climbing test (p>0.05).	1323	1456
24739405	CONCLUSION: We observed that DHEA reduced locomotor activity and increased catalepsy at both doses, while it had no effect on climbing behavior.	1457	1601
24739405	We suggest that DHEA displays typical neuroleptic-like effects, and may be used in the treatment of schizophrenia.	1602	1716
24768818	Structural mechanisms determining inhibition of the collagen receptor DDR1 by selective and multi-targeted type II kinase inhibitors.	0	133
24768818	The discoidin domain receptors (DDRs), DDR1 and DDR2, form a unique subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by the binding of triple-helical collagen.	134	302
24768818	Excessive signaling by DDR1 and DDR2 has been linked to the progression of various human diseases, including fibrosis, atherosclerosis and cancer.	303	449
24768818	We report the inhibition of these unusual receptor tyrosine kinases by the multi-targeted cancer drugs imatinib and ponatinib, as well as the selective type II inhibitor DDR1-IN-1.	450	630
24768818	Ponatinib is identified as the more potent molecule, which inhibits DDR1 and DDR2 with an IC50 of 9nM.	631	733
24768818	Co-crystal structures of human DDR1 reveal a DFG-out conformation (DFG, Asp-Phe-Gly) of the kinase domain that is stabilized by an unusual salt bridge between the activation loop and aD helix.	734	926
24768818	Differences to Abelson kinase (ABL) are observed in the DDR1 P-loop, where a b-hairpin replaces the cage-like structure of ABL.	927	1054
24768818	P-loop residues in DDR1 that confer drug resistance in ABL are therefore accommodated outside the ATP pocket.	1055	1164
24768818	Whereas imatinib and ponatinib bind potently to both the DDR and ABL kinases, the hydrophobic interactions of the ABL P-loop appear poorly satisfied by DDR1-IN-1 suggesting a structural basis for its DDR1 selectivity.	1165	1382
24768818	Such inhibitors may have applications in clinical indications of DDR1 and DDR2 overexpression or mutation, including lung cancer.	1383	1512
24853300	Crucial role of calbindin-D28k in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease mouse model.	0	86
24853300	Calbindin-D28k (CB), one of the major calcium-binding and buffering proteins, has a critical role in preventing a neuronal death as well as maintaining calcium homeostasis.	87	259
24853300	Although marked reductions of CB expression have been observed in the brains of mice and humans with Alzheimer disease (AD), it is unknown whether these changes contribute to AD-related dysfunction.	260	458
24853300	To determine the pathogenic importance of CB depletions in AD models, we crossed 5 familial AD mutations (5XFAD; Tg) mice with CB knock-out (CBKO) mice and generated a novel line CBKO.5XFAD (CBKOTg) mice.	459	663
24853300	We first identified the change of signaling pathways and differentially expressed proteins globally by removing CB in Tg mice using mass spectrometry and antibody microarray.	664	838
24853300	Immunohistochemistry showed that CBKOTg mice had significant neuronal loss in the subiculum area without changing the magnitude (number) of amyloid b-peptide (Ab) plaques deposition and elicited significant apoptotic features and mitochondrial dysfunction compared with Tg mice.	839	1117
24853300	Moreover, CBKOTg mice reduced levels of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 and cAMP response element-binding protein at Ser-133 and synaptic molecules such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDA receptor 1), NMDA receptor 2A, PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the subiculum compared with Tg mice.	1118	1467
24853300	Importantly, this is the first experimental evidence that removal of CB from amyloid precursor protein/presenilin transgenic mice aggravates AD pathogenesis, suggesting that CB has a critical role in AD pathogenesis.	1468	1684
25080425	Regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and apoptotic pathways by betaine attenuates isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial injury in rats.	0	164
25080425	The present study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of betaine on acute myocardial ischemia induced experimentally in rats focusing on regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and apoptotic pathways as the potential mechanism underlying the drug effect.	165	473
25080425	Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with betaine (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) orally for 40 days.	474	570
25080425	Acute myocardial ischemic injury was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg), for two consecutive days.	571	704
25080425	Serum cardiac marker enzyme, histopathological variables and expression of protein levels were analyzed.	705	809
25080425	Oral administration of betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly reduced the level of cardiac marker enzyme in the serum and prevented left ventricular remodeling.	810	973
25080425	Western blot analysis showed that isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was maintained or further enhanced by betaine treatment in myocardium.	974	1125
25080425	Furthermore, betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) treatment increased the ventricular expression of Bcl-2 and reduced the level of Bax, therefore causing a significant increase in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax.	1126	1320
25080425	The protective role of betaine on myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination.	1321	1428
25080425	In summary, our results showed that betaine pretreatment attenuated isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia via the regulation of STAT3 and apoptotic pathways.	1429	1596
25305591	VPAC2 (vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor type 2) receptor deficient mice develop exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with increased Th1/Th17 and reduced Th2/Treg responses.	0	195
25305591	Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are two structurally-related neuropeptides with widespread expression in the central and peripheral nervous systems.	196	410
25305591	Although these peptides have been repeatedly shown to exert potent anti-inflammatory actions when administered in animal models of inflammatory disease, mice deficient in VIP and PACAP were recently shown to exhibit different phenotypes (ameliorated and exacerbated, respectively) in response to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).	411	755
25305591	Therefore, elucidating what are the specific immunoregulatory roles played by each of their receptor subtypes (VPAC1, VPAC2, and PAC1) is critical.	756	903
25305591	In this study, we found that mice with a genetic deletion of VIPR2, encoding the VPAC2 receptor, exhibited exacerbated (MOG35-55)-induced EAE compared to wild type mice, characterized by enhanced clinical and histopathological features, increased proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IFN-gamma (Th1), and IL-17 (Th17)) and reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGFbeta, and IL-4 (Th2)) in the CNS and lymph nodes.	904	1330
25305591	Moreover, the abundance and proliferative index of lymph node, thymus and CNS CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs were strikingly reduced in VPAC2-deficient mice with EAE.	1331	1494
25305591	Finally, the in vitro suppressive activity of lymph node and splenic Tregs from VPAC2-deficient mice was impaired.	1495	1609
25305591	Overall, our results demonstrate critical protective roles for PACAP and the VPAC2 receptor against autoimmunity, promoting the expansion and maintenance of the Treg pool.	1610	1781
25983002	Inhibition of LDHA suppresses tumor progression in prostate cancer.	0	67
25983002	A key hallmark of cancer cells is their altered metabolism, known as Warburg effect.	68	152
25983002	Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) executes the final step of aerobic glycolysis and has been reported to be involved in the tumor progression.	153	292
25983002	However, the function of LDHA in prostate cancer has not been studied.	293	363
25983002	In current study, we observed overexpression of LDHA in the clinical prostate cancer samples compared with benign prostate hyperplasia tissues as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and real-time qPCR.	364	566
25983002	Attenuated expression of LDHA by siRNA or inhibition of LDHA activities by FX11 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis of PC-3 and DU145 cells.	567	750
25983002	Mechanistically, decreased Warburg effect as demonstrated by reduced glucose consumption and lactate secretion and reduced expression of MMP-9, PLAU, and cathepsin B were found after LDHA knockdown or FX11 treatment in PC-3 and DU145 cells.	751	991
25983002	Taken together, our study revealed the oncogenic role of LDHA in prostate cancer and suggested that LDHA might be a potential therapeutic target.	992	1137
25986755	Low functional programming of renal AT2R mediates the developmental origin of glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring induced by prenatal caffeine exposure.	0	154
25986755	UNASSIGNED: Our previous study has indicated that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) could induce intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) of offspring.	155	303
25986755	Recent research suggested that IUGR is a risk factor for glomerulosclerosis.	304	380
25986755	However, whether PCE could induce glomerulosclerosis and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown.	381	479
25986755	This study aimed to demonstrate the induction to glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring by PCE and its intrauterine programming mechanisms.	480	618
25986755	A rat model of IUGR was established by PCE, male fetuses and adult offspring at the age of postnatal week 24 were euthanized.	619	744
25986755	The results revealed that the adult offspring kidneys in the PCE group exhibited glomerulosclerosis as well as interstitial fibrosis, accompanied by elevated levels of serum creatinine and urine protein.	745	948
25986755	Renal angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by PCE, whereas the renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a (AT1aR)/AT2R expression ratio was increased.	949	1142
25986755	The fetal kidneys in the PCE group displayed an enlarged Bowman's space and a shrunken glomerular tuft, accompanied by a reduced cortex width and an increase in the nephrogenic zone/cortical zone ratio.	1143	1345
25986755	Observation by electronic microscope revealed structural damage of podocytes; the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes, nephrin and podocin, was also detected by q-PCR.	1346	1527
25986755	Moreover, AT2R gene and protein expressions in fetal kidneys were inhibited by PCE, associated with the repression of the gene expression of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)/tyrosine kinase receptor (c-Ret) signaling pathway.	1528	1771
25986755	These results demonstrated that PCE could induce dysplasia of fetal kidneys as well as glomerulosclerosis of adult offspring, and the low functional programming of renal AT2R might mediate the developmental origin of adult glomerulosclerosis.	1772	2014
26027517	The autotaxin-LPA2 GPCR axis is modulated by gamma-irradiation and facilitates DNA damage repair.	0	97
26027517	In this study we characterized the effects of radiation injury on the expression and function of the autotaxin (ATX)-LPA2 GPCR axis.	98	230
26027517	In IEC-6 crypt cells and jejunum enteroids quantitative RT-PCR showed a time- and dose-dependent upregulation of lpa2 in response to gamma-irradiation that was abolished by mutation of the NF-kappaB site in the lpa2 promoter or by inhibition of ATM/ATR kinases with CGK-733, suggesting that lpa2 is a DNA damage response gene upregulated by ATM via NF-kappaB.	231	590
26027517	The resolution kinetics of the DNA damage marker gamma-H2AX in LPA-treated IEC-6 cells exposed to gamma-irradiation was accelerated compared to vehicle, whereas pharmacological inhibition of LPA2 delayed the resolution of gamma-H2AX.	591	824
26027517	In LPA2-reconstituted MEF cells lacking LPA1    '3 the levels of gamma-H2AX decreased rapidly, whereas in Vector MEF were high and remained sustained.	825	975
26027517	Inhibition of ERK1    '2 or PI3K/AKT signaling axis by pertussis toxin or the C311A/C314A/L351A mutation in the C-terminus of LPA2 abrogated the effect of LPA on DNA repair.	976	1149
26027517	LPA2 transcripts in Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) enriched for bone marrow stem cells were 27- and 5-fold higher than in common myeloid or lymphoid progenitors, respectively.	1150	1317
26027517	Furthermore, after irradiation higher residual gamma-H2AX levels were detected in the bone marrow or jejunum of irradiated LPA2-KO mice compared to WT mice.	1318	1474
26027517	We found that gamma-irradiation increases plasma ATX activity and LPA level that is in part due to the previously established radiation-induced upregulation of TNFalpha.	1475	1644
26027517	These findings identify ATX and LPA2 as radiation-regulated genes that appear to play a physiological role in DNA repair.	1645	1766
26110643	Protein-Trap Insertional Mutagenesis Uncovers New Genes Involved in Zebrafish Skin Development, Including a Neuregulin 2a-Based ErbB Signaling Pathway Required during Median Fin Fold Morphogenesis.	0	197
26110643	Skin disorders are widespread, but available treatments are limited.	198	266
26110643	A more comprehensive understanding of skin development mechanisms will drive identification of new treatment targets and modalities.	267	399
26110643	Here we report the Zebrafish Integument Project (ZIP), an expression-driven platform for identifying new skin genes and phenotypes in the vertebrate model Danio rerio (zebrafish).	400	579
26110643	In vivo selection for skin-specific expression of gene-break transposon (GBT) mutant lines identified eleven new, revertible GBT alleles of genes involved in skin development.	580	755
26110643	Eight genes--fras1, grip1, hmcn1, msxc, col4a4, ahnak, capn12, and nrg2a--had been described in an integumentary context to varying degrees, while arhgef25b, fkbp10b, and megf6a emerged as novel skin genes.	756	962
26110643	Embryos homozygous for a GBT insertion within neuregulin 2a (nrg2a) revealed a novel requirement for a Neuregulin 2a (Nrg2a)-ErbB2/3-AKT signaling pathway governing the apicobasal organization of a subset of epidermal cells during median fin fold (MFF) morphogenesis.	963	1230
26110643	In nrg2a mutant larvae, the basal keratinocytes within the apical MFF, known as ridge cells, displayed reduced pAKT levels as well as reduced apical domains and exaggerated basolateral domains.	1231	1424
26110643	Those defects compromised proper ridge cell elongation into a flattened epithelial morphology, resulting in thickened MFF edges.	1425	1553
26110643	Pharmacological inhibition verified that Nrg2a signals through the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase network.	1554	1659
26110643	Moreover, knockdown of the epithelial polarity regulator and tumor suppressor lgl2 ameliorated the nrg2a mutant phenotype.	1660	1782
26110643	Identifying Lgl2 as an antagonist of Nrg2a-ErbB signaling revealed a significantly earlier role for Lgl2 during epidermal morphogenesis than has been described to date.	1783	1951
26110643	Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that successive, coordinated ridge cell shape changes drive apical MFF development, making MFF ridge cells a valuable model for investigating how the coordinated regulation of cell polarity and cell shape changes serves as a crucial mechanism of epithelial morphogenesis.	1952	2262
26516699	Changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression during pancreatic cancer development and progression in a genetically engineered KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre mouse (KC) model.	0	155
26516699	Differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been demonstrated in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PC).	156	277
26516699	Due to the lack of tissue samples from early-stages of PC, the stage-specific alteration of miRNAs during PC initiation and progression is largely unknown.	278	433
26516699	In this study, we investigated the global miRNA expression profile and their processing machinery during PC progression using the KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC) mouse model.	434	599
26516699	At 25 weeks, the miRNA microarray analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-150, miR-494, miR-138, miR-148a, miR-216a, and miR-217 and upregulation of miR-146b, miR-205, miR-31, miR-192, and miR-21 in KC mice compared to controls.	600	840
26516699	Further, expression of miRNA biosynthetic machinery including Dicer, Exportin-5, TRKRA, and TARBP2 were downregulated, while DGCR8 and Ago2 were upregulated in KC mice.	841	1009
26516699	In addition, from 10 to 50 weeks of age, stage-specific expression profiling of miRNA in KC mice revealed downregulation of miR-216, miR-217, miR-100, miR-345, miR-141, miR-483-3p, miR-26b, miR-150, miR-195, Let-7b and Let-96 and upregulation of miR-21, miR-205, miR-146b, miR-34c, miR-1273, miR-223 and miR-195 compared to control mice.	1010	1347
26516699	Interestingly, the differential expression of miRNA in mice also corroborated with the miRNA expression in human PC cell lines and tissue samples; ectopic expression of Let-7b in CD18/HPAF and Capan1 cells resulted in the downregulation of KRAS and MSST1 expression.	1348	1614
26516699	Overall, the present study aids an understanding of miRNA expression patterns during PC pathogenesis and helps to facilitate the identification of promising and novel early diagnostic/prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.	1615	1842
26731607	DNA-damage response gene GADD45A induces differentiation in hematopoietic stem cells without inhibiting cell cycle or survival.	0	127
26731607	Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain blood cell production life-long by their unique abilities of self-renewal and differentiation into all blood cell lineages.	128	292
26731607	Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45 alpha (GADD45A) is induced by genotoxic stress in HSCs.	293	390
26731607	GADD45A has been implicated in cell cycle control, cell death and senescence, as well as in DNA-damage repair.	391	501
26731607	In general, GADD45A provides cellular stability by either arresting the cell cycle progression until DNA damage is repaired or, in cases of fatal damage, by inducing apoptosis.	502	678
26731607	However, the function of GADD45A in hematopoiesis remains controversial.	679	751
26731607	We revealed the changes in murine HSC fate control orchestrated by the expression of GADD45A at single cell resolution.	752	871
26731607	In contrast to other cellular systems, GADD45A expression did not cause a cell cycle arrest or an alteration in the decision between cell survival and apoptosis in HSCs.	872	1041
26731607	Strikingly, GADD45A strongly induced and accelerated the differentiation program in HSCs.	1042	1131
26731607	Continuous tracking of individual HSCs and their progeny via time-lapse microscopy elucidated that once GADD45A was expressed, HSCs differentiate into committed progenitors within 29 hours.	1132	1321
26731607	GADD45A-expressing HSCs failed to long-term reconstitute the blood of recipients by inducing multilineage differentiation in vivo.	1322	1452
26731607	Importantly, g-irradiation of HSCs induced their differentiation by upregulating endogenous GADD45A.	1453	1553
26731607	The differentiation induction by GADD45A was transmitted by activating p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and allowed the generation of megakaryocytic-erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid lineages.	1554	1766
26731607	These data indicate that genotoxic stress-induced GADD45A expression in HSCs prevents their fatal transformation by directing them into differentiation and thereby clearing them from the system.	1767	1961
27134166	Metabolic Symbiosis Enables Adaptive Resistance to Anti-angiogenic Therapy that Is Dependent on mTOR Signaling.	0	111
27134166	Therapeutic targeting of tumor angiogenesis with VEGF inhibitors results in demonstrable, but transitory efficacy in certain human tumors and mouse models of cancer, limited by unconventional forms of adaptive/evasive resistance.	112	341
27134166	In one such mouse model, potent angiogenesis inhibitors elicit compartmental reorganization of cancer cells around remaining blood vessels.	342	481
27134166	The glucose and lactate transporters GLUT1 and MCT4 are induced in distal hypoxic cells in a HIF1a-dependent fashion, indicative of glycolysis.	482	625
27134166	Tumor cells proximal to blood vessels instead express the lactate transporter MCT1, and p-S6, the latter reflecting mTOR signaling.	626	757
27134166	Normoxic cancer cells import and metabolize lactate, resulting in upregulation of mTOR signaling via glutamine metabolism enhanced by lactate catabolism.	758	911
27134166	Thus, metabolic symbiosis is established in the face of angiogenesis inhibition, whereby hypoxic cancer cells import glucose and export lactate, while normoxic cells import and catabolize lactate.	912	1108
27134166	mTOR signaling inhibition disrupts this metabolic symbiosis, associated with upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT2.	1109	1232
27248656	Hsp90beta is involved in the development of high salt-diet-induced nephropathy via interaction with various signalling proteins.	0	128
27248656	A high-salt diet often leads to a local intrarenal increase in renal hypoxia and oxidative stress, which are responsible for an excess production of pathogenic substances.	129	300
27248656	Here, Wistar Kyoto/spontaneous hypertensive (WKY/SHR) rats fed a high-salt diet developed severe proteinuria, resulting from pronounced renal inflammation, fibrosis and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis.	301	504
27248656	All these were mainly non-pressure-related effects.	505	556
27248656	Hsp90beta, TGF-beta, HIF-1alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MCP-1 were shown to be highly expressed in response to salt loading.	557	678
27248656	Next, we found that Hsp90beta might play the key role in non-pressure-related effects of salt loading through a series of cellular signalling events, including the NF-kappaB, p38 activation and Bcl-2 inactivation.	679	892
27248656	Hsp90beta was previously proven to regulate the upstream mediators in multiple cellular signalling cascades through stabilizing and maintaining their activities.	893	1054
27248656	In our study, 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) or Hsp90beta knockdown dramatically alleviated the high-salt-diet-induced proteinuria and renal damage without altering blood pressure significantly, when it reversed activations of NF-kappaB, mTOR and p38 signalling cascades.	1055	1357
27248656	Meanwhile, Co-IP results demonstrated that Hsp90beta could interact with and stabilize TAK1, AMPKalpha, IKKalpha/beta, HIF-1alpha and Raptor, whereas Hsp90beta inhibition disrupted this process.	1358	1552
27248656	In addition, Hsp90beta inhibition-mediated renal improvements also accompanied the reduction of renal oxidative stress.	1553	1672
27248656	In conclusion, salt loading indeed exhibited non-pressure-related impacts on proteinuria and renal dysfunction in WKY/SHR rats.	1673	1800
27248656	Hsp90beta inhibition caused the destabilization of upstream mediators in various pathogenic signalling events, thereby effectively ameliorating this nephropathy owing to renal hypoxia and oxidative stress.	1801	2006
27384305	Male 11b-HSD1 Knockout Mice Fed Trans-Fats and Fructose Are Not Protected From Metabolic Syndrome or Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.	0	134
27384305	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) defines a spectrum of conditions from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis and is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome.	135	355
27384305	Glucocorticoids can promote steatosis by stimulating lipolysis within adipose tissue, free fatty acid delivery to liver and hepatic de novo lipogenesis.	356	508
27384305	Glucocorticoids can be reactivated in liver through 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1) enzyme activity.	509	628
27384305	Inhibition of 11b-HSD1 has been suggested as a potential treatment for NAFLD.	629	706
27384305	To test this, male mice with global (11b-HSD1 knockout [KO]) and liver-specific (LKO) 11b-HSD1 loss of function were fed the American Lifestyle Induced Obesity Syndrome (ALIOS) diet, known to recapitulate the spectrum of NAFLD, and metabolic and liver phenotypes assessed.	707	979
27384305	Body weight, muscle and adipose tissue masses, and parameters of glucose homeostasis showed that 11b-HSD1KO and LKO mice were not protected from systemic metabolic disease.	980	1152
27384305	Evaluation of hepatic histology, triglyceride content, and blinded NAFLD activity score assessment indicated that levels of steatosis were similar between 11b-HSD1KO, LKO, and control mice.	1153	1342
27384305	Unexpectedly, histological analysis revealed significantly increased levels of immune foci present in livers of 11b-HSD1KO but not LKO or control mice, suggestive of a transition to NASH.	1343	1530
27384305	This was endorsed by elevated hepatic expression of key immune cell and inflammatory markers.	1531	1624
27384305	These data indicate that 11b-HSD1-deficient mice are not protected from metabolic disease or hepatosteatosis in the face of a NAFLD-inducing diet.	1625	1771
27384305	However, global deficiency of 11b-HSD1 did increase markers of hepatic inflammation and suggests a critical role for 11b-HSD1 in restraining the transition to NASH.	1772	1936
27640183	Erythropoietin does not activate erythropoietin receptor signaling or lipolytic pathways in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue in vivo. BACKGROUND: Erythropoietin (Epo) exerts direct effects on white adipose tissue (WAT) in mice in addition to its erythropoietic effects, and in humans Epo increases resting energy expenditure and affect serum lipid levels, but direct effects of Epo in human WAT have not been documented.	0	427
27640183	We therefore investigated the effects of acute and prolonged Epo exposure on human WAT in vivo.	428	523
27640183	METHOD: Data were obtained from two clinical trials: 1) acute Epo exposure (rHuEpo, 400 IU/kg) followed by WAT biopsies after 1 h and 2) 10 weeks treatment with the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) Darbepoietin-alpha.	524	747
27640183	Biopsies were analyzed by PCR for Epo receptor (Epo-R) mRNA.	748	808
27640183	A new and highly specific antibody (A82, Amgen) was used to evaluate the presence of Epo-R by western blot analysis in addition to Epo-R signaling proteins (Akt, STAT5, p70s6k, LYN, and p38MAPK), activation of lipolytic pathways (ATGL, HSL, CGI-58, G0S2, Perilipin, Cidea, Cidec, AMPK, and ACC), and mitochondrial biogenesis (VDAC, HSP90, PDH, and SDHA).	809	1163
27640183	RESULTS: No evidence of in vivo activation of the Epo-R in WAT could be documented despite detectable levels of Epo-R mRNA.	1164	1287
27640183	CONCLUSION: Thus, in contradiction to animal studies, Epo treatment within a physiological relevant range in humans does not exert direct effects in a subcutaneous WAT.	1288	1456
27825100	High glucose repatterns human podocyte energy metabolism during differentiation and diabetic nephropathy.	0	105
27825100	Podocytes play a key role in diabetic nephropathy pathogenesis, but alteration of their metabolism remains unknown in human kidney.	106	237
27825100	By using a conditionally differentiating human podocyte cell line, we addressed the functional and molecular changes in podocyte energetics during in vitro development or under high glucose conditions.	238	439
27825100	In 5 mM glucose medium, we observed a stepwise activation of oxidative metabolism during cell differentiation that was characterized by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g coactivator 1a (PGC-1a)-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, with concomitant reduction of the glycolytic enzyme content.	440	769
27825100	Conversely, when podocytes were cultured in high glucose (20 mM), stepwise oxidative phosphorylation biogenesis was aborted, and a glycolytic switch occurred, with consecutive lactic acidosis.	770	962
27825100	Expression of the master regulators of oxidative metabolism transcription factor A mitochondrial, PGC-1a, AMPK, and serine-threonine liver kinase B1 was altered by high glucose, as well as their downstream signaling networks.	963	1188
27825100	Focused transcriptomics revealed that myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) and myogenic factor 5 (MYF5) expression was inhibited by high glucose levels, and endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNA-mediated combined inhibition of those transcription factors phenocopied the glycolytic shift that was observed in high glucose conditions.	1189	1539
27825100	Accordingly, a reduced expression of MEF2C, MYF5, and PGC-1a was found in kidney tissue sections that were obtained from patients with diabetic nephropathy.	1540	1696
27825100	These findings obtained in human samples demonstrate that MEF2C-MYF5-dependent bioenergetic dedifferentiation occurs in podocytes that are confronted with a high-glucose milieu.-Imasawa, T., Obre, E., Bellance, N., Lavie, J., Imasawa, T., Rigothier, C., Delmas, Y., Combe, C., Lacombe, D., Benard, G., Claverol, S., Bonneu, M., Rossignol, R. High glucose repatterns human podocyte energy metabolism during differentiation and diabetic nephropathy.	1697	2144
28098423	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction through activating Akt signalling in rats.	0	127
28098423	The clinical application of doxorubicin (Dox) is limited by its adverse effect of cardiotoxicity.	128	225
28098423	Previous studies have suggested the cardioprotective effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).	226	330
28098423	We hypothesize that BDNF could protect against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.	331	405
28098423	Sprague Dawley rats were injected with Dox (2.5 mg/kg, 3 times/week, i.p.), in the presence or absence of recombinant BDNF (0.4 ug/kg, i.v.) for 2 weeks.	406	559
28098423	H9c2 cells were treated with Dox (1 uM) and/or BDNF (400 ng/ml) for 24 hrs.	560	635
28098423	Functional roles of BDNF against Dox-induced cardiac injury were examined both in vivo and in vitro.	636	736
28098423	Protein level of BDNF was reduced in Dox-treated rat ventricles, whereas BDNF and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) were markedly up-regulated after BDNF administration.	737	921
28098423	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor significantly inhibited Dox-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction in rats.	922	1066
28098423	Meanwhile, BDNF increased cell viability, inhibited apoptosis and DNA damage of Dox-treated H9c2 cells.	1067	1170
28098423	Investigations of the underlying mechanisms revealed that BDNF activated Akt and preserved phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin and Bad without affecting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular regulated protein kinase pathways.	1171	1426
28098423	Furthermore, the beneficial effect of BDNF was abolished by BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc or Akt inhibitor.	1427	1527
28098423	In conclusion, our findings reveal a potent protective role of BDNF against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity by activating Akt signalling, which may facilitate the safe use of Dox in cancer treatment.	1528	1722
28279980	GLUT4 Is Not Necessary for Overload-Induced Glucose Uptake or Hypertrophic Growth in Mouse Skeletal Muscle.	0	107
28279980	GLUT4 is necessary for acute insulin- and contraction-induced skeletal muscle glucose uptake, but its role in chronic muscle loading (overload)-induced glucose uptake is unknown.	108	286
28279980	Our goal was to determine whether GLUT4 is required for overload-induced glucose uptake.	287	375
28279980	Overload was induced in mouse plantaris muscle by unilateral synergist ablation.	376	456
28279980	After 5 days, muscle weights and ex vivo [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake were assessed.	457	544
28279980	Overload-induced muscle glucose uptake and hypertrophic growth were not impaired in muscle-specific GLUT4 knockout mice, demonstrating that GLUT4 is not necessary for these processes.	545	728
28279980	To assess which transporters mediate overload-induced glucose uptake, chemical inhibitors were used.	729	829
28279980	The facilitative GLUT inhibitor cytochalasin B, but not the sodium-dependent glucose cotransport inhibitor phloridzin, prevented overload-induced uptake demonstrating that GLUTs mediate this effect.	830	1028
28279980	To assess which GLUT, hexose competition experiments were performed.	1029	1097
28279980	Overload-induced [(3)H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was not inhibited by d-fructose, demonstrating that the fructose-transporting GLUT2, GLUT5, GLUT8, and GLUT12 do not mediate this effect.	1098	1284
28279980	To assess additional GLUTs, immunoblots were performed.	1285	1340
28279980	Overload increased GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and GLUT10 protein levels twofold to fivefold.	1341	1427
28279980	Collectively, these results demonstrate that GLUT4 is not necessary for overload-induced muscle glucose uptake or hypertrophic growth and suggest that GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and/or GLUT10 mediate overload-induced glucose uptake.	1428	1654
28348168	FGFR2 is required for airway basal cell self-renewal and terminal differentiation.	0	82
28348168	Airway stem cells slowly self-renew and produce differentiated progeny to maintain homeostasis throughout the lifespan of an individual.	83	219
28348168	Mutations in the molecular regulators of these processes may drive cancer or degenerative disease, but are also potential therapeutic targets.	220	362
28348168	Conditionally deleting one copy of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) in adult mouse airway basal cells results in self-renewal and differentiation phenotypes.	363	510
28348168	We show that FGFR2 signalling correlates with maintenance of expression of a key transcription factor for basal cell self-renewal and differentiation: SOX2.	511	667
28348168	This heterozygous phenotype illustrates that subtle changes in receptor tyrosine kinase signalling can have significant effects, perhaps providing an explanation for the numerous changes seen in cancer.	668	870

28481876	Miniature chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins play critical roles in DNA replication licensing, initiation and elongation.	90	214
28481876	MCM8, one of the MCM proteins playing a critical role in DNA repairing and recombination, was found to have overexpression and increased DNA copy number in a variety of human malignancies.	215	403
28481876	The gain of MCM8 is associated with aggressive clinical features of several human cancers.	404	494
28481876	Increased expression of MCM8 in prostate cancer is associated with cancer recurrence.	495	580
28481876	Forced expression of MCM8 in RWPE1 cells, the immortalized but non-transformed prostate epithelial cell line, exhibited fast cell growth and transformation, while knock down of MCM8 in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells induced cell growth arrest, and decreased tumour volumes and mortality of severe combined immunodeficiency mice xenografted with PC3 and DU145 cells.	581	942
28481876	MCM8 bound cyclin D1 and activated Rb protein phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 in vitro and in vivo.	943	1055
28481876	The cyclin D1/MCM8 interaction is required for Rb phosphorylation and S-phase entry in cancer cells.	1056	1156
28481876	As a result, our study showed that copy number increase and overexpression of MCM8 may play critical roles in human cancer development.	1157	1292
28687665	Mutation of the a-tubulin Tuba1a leads to straighter microtubules and perturbs neuronal migration.	0	98
28687665	Brain development involves extensive migration of neurons.	99	157
28687665	Microtubules (MTs) are key cellular effectors of neuronal displacement that are assembled from a/b-tubulin heterodimers.	158	278
28687665	Mutation of the a-tubulin isotype TUBA1A is associated with cortical malformations in humans.	279	372
28687665	In this study, we provide detailed in vivo and in vitro analyses of Tuba1a mutants.	373	456
28687665	In mice carrying a Tuba1a missense mutation (S140G), neurons accumulate, and glial cells are dispersed along the rostral migratory stream in postnatal and adult brains.	457	625
28687665	Live imaging of Tuba1a-mutant neurons revealed slowed migration and increased neuronal branching, which correlated with directionality alterations and perturbed nucleus-centrosome (N-C) coupling.	626	821
28687665	Tuba1a mutation led to increased straightness of newly polymerized MTs, and structural modeling data suggest a conformational change in the a/b-tubulin heterodimer.	822	986
28687665	We show that Tuba8, another a-tubulin isotype previously associated with cortical malformations, has altered function compared with Tuba1a.	987	1126
28687665	Our work shows that Tuba1a plays an essential, noncompensated role in neuronal saltatory migration in vivo and highlights the importance of MT flexibility in N-C coupling and neuronal-branching regulation during neuronal migration.	1127	1358
29045486	Thiamine deficiency activates hypoxia inducible factor-1a to facilitate pro-apoptotic responses in mouse primary astrocytes.	0	124
29045486	Thiamine is an essential enzyme cofactor required for proper metabolic function and maintenance of metabolism and energy production in the brain.	125	270
29045486	In developed countries, thiamine deficiency (TD) is most often manifested following chronic alcohol consumption leading to impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation and excitotoxicity.	271	477
29045486	These biochemical lesions result in apoptotic cell death in both neurons and astrocytes.	478	566
29045486	Comparable histological injuries in patients with hypoxia/ischemia and TD have been described in the thalamus and mammillary bodies, suggesting a congruency between the cellular responses to these stresses.	567	773
29045486	Consistent with hypoxia/ischemia, TD stabilizes and activates Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1a (HIF-1a) under physiological oxygen levels.	774	907
29045486	However, the role of TD-induced HIF-1a in neurological injury is currently unknown.	908	991
29045486	Using Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, we have demonstrated that TD induces HIF-1a expression and activity in primary mouse astrocytes.	992	1128
29045486	We observed a time-dependent increase in mRNA and protein expression of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory HIF-1a target genes MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa during TD.	1129	1296
29045486	We also observed apoptotic cell death in TD as demonstrated by PI/Annexin V staining, TUNEL assay, and Cell Death ELISA.	1297	1417
29045486	Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1a activity using YC1 and thiamine repletion both reduced expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1a target genes and apoptotic cell death in TD.	1418	1589
29045486	These results demonstrate that induction of HIF-1a mediated transcriptional up-regulation of pro-apoptotic/inflammatory signaling contributes to astrocyte cell death during thiamine deficiency.	1590	1783
30442153	Ca2+-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress correlation with astrogliosis involves upregulation of KCa3.1 and inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling.	0	143
30442153	BACKGROUND: The intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 was recently shown to control the phenotype switch of reactive astrogliosis (RA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).	144	327
30442153	METHODS: KCa3.1 channels expression and cell localization in the brains of AD patients and APP/PS1 mice model were measured by immunoblotting and immunostaining.	328	489
30442153	APP/PS1 mice and KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice were subjected to Morris water maze test to evaluate the spatial memory deficits.	490	611
30442153	Glia activation and neuron loss was measured by immunostaining.	612	675
30442153	Fluo-4AM was used to measure cytosolic Ca2+ level in beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced reactive astrocytes in vitro.	676	787
30442153	RESULTS: KCa3.1 expression was markedly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in both Abeta-stimulated primary astrocytes and brain lysates of AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mice.	788	1011
30442153	The KCa3.1 channel was shown to regulate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through an interaction with the Ca2+ channel Orai1 in primary astrocytes.	1012	1159
30442153	Gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 protected against SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and ER stress via the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in astrocytes.	1160	1334
30442153	Importantly, gene deletion or blockade of KCa3.1 restored AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling both in vivo and in vitro.	1335	1465
30442153	Consistent with these in vitro data, expression levels of the ER stress markers 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, as well as that of the RA marker glial fibrillary acidic protein were increased in APP/PS1 AD mouse model.	1466	1740
30442153	Elimination of KCa3.1 in KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice corrected these abnormal responses.	1741	1824
30442153	Moreover, glial activation and neuroinflammation were attenuated in the hippocampi of KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice, as compared with APP/PS1 mice.	1825	1965
30442153	In addition, memory deficits and neuronal loss in APP/PS1 mice were reversed in KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice.	1966	2069
30442153	CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that KCa3.1 is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in astrocytes and attenuation of the UPR and ER stress, thus contributing to memory deficits and neuronal loss.	2070	2287
