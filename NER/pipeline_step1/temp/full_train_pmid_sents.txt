18507837	Excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with 36,939 new cases diagnosed in 2004.	0	127
18507837	The prognosis of breast cancer is generally good, with an overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 80% in England and Wales.	128	257
18507837	Clinical stage at diagnosis, including tumour size, lymph node status, and presence of metastases, along with tumour biological factors such as histological grade and type are the most important determinants of prognosis.	258	479
18507837	Cyclins and their regulators, which are involved in cell cycle control, are important as potential oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes in breast cancer.	480	633
18507837	The cell cycle consists of a series of well-controlled events that drive DNA replication and cell division.	634	741
18507837	These events are divided into specific phases: preparation for DNA synthesis (G1), DNA synthesis (S), a gap phase (G2), and mitosis (M).	742	878
18507837	Transition between these phases requires tight control; the G1/S phase transition, in particular, includes many cell cycle events that are altered in breast cancer.	879	1043
18507837	Somatic alterations in these genes have been shown to correlate with breast cancer prognosis and survival, but few studies have examined the effects of inherited genetic variation in cell cycle genes.	1044	1244
18507837	The a870g polymorphism of the CCND1 gene (rs603965) has been shown to be associated with breast cancer survival in a large Chinese population-based study and in a small population of patients with metastatic breast cancer.	1245	1467
18507837	The V109G polymorphism of the p27 gene CDKN1B (rs2066827), examined by polymerase chain reaction analysis of tumour specimens, was associated with shortened disease-free survival in a subset of patients with infiltrating metastasis-free breast cancer.	1468	1719
18507837	These previous studies, however, were only of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the genes involved in the G1 phase of cell cycle control have not been systematically evaluated.	1720	1915
18507837	The purpose of this study was to assess whether common germline genetic variation in these genes is associated with breast cancer survival by using a comprehensive SNP tagging approach to efficiently capture the common variation.	1916	2145
18507837	Thirteen genes involved in the G1 phase of the cell cycle have been investigated in this study, including those that encode for the cyclin family that regulate cyclin-dependent kinases (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, and CCNE1); cyclin-dependent kinases, which are necessary for the G1/S transition (CDK2 [p33], CDK4, and CDK6); and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN1A [p21, Cip1], CDKN1B [p27, Kip1], CDKN2A [p16], CDKN2B [p15], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]).	2146	2605
18507837	Cases were selected from the Studies of Epidemiology and Risk factors in Cancer Heredity (SEARCH) breast cancer study, an ongoing population study of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the region of England included in the Eastern Cancer Registration and Information Centre (ECRIC) (formerly the East Anglian Cancer Registry).	2606	2935
18507837	Eligible participants include women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer who were either under 70 years of age since the beginning of the study on 1 July 1996 (incident cases) or age 55 or younger since 1 January 1991 and who were alive at the start of the study (prevalent cases).	2936	3218
18507837	Due to boundary changes, some prevalent cases diagnosed before 1995 were identified by the North Thames Cancer Registry.	3219	3339
18507837	Of those eligible, 67% returned a comprehensive epidemiological questionnaire and 64% returned a blood sample for genotyping.	3340	3465
18507837	All participants in the study provided informed consent, and the study was approved by the Eastern Multicentre Research Ethics Committee.	3466	3603
18507837	DNA is available from 4,470 cases for genotyping; 27% of these participants are prevalent cases.	3604	3700
18507837	The samples have been split into two sets in order to save DNA and reduce genotyping costs.	3701	3792
18507837	Cases with high genomic yield were randomly selected from the first 3,500 recruited to comprise set 1 (n = 2,270), with set 2 comprising the remainder of these plus the next 970 incident cases recruited (n = 2,200).	3793	4008
18507837	DNA yield was not associated with genotype for those cases included in set 1 or set 2.	4009	4095
18507837	SNPs showing a positive association with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer (P trend < 0.05) were genotyped in set 2.	4096	4222
18507837	Data from both sets were then combined (n = 4,470) to jointly analyze the SNPs with positive associations.	4223	4329
18507837	This joint analysis approach results in increased power to detect genetic association despite more stringent significance levels with Bonferroni correction.	4330	4486
18507837	As the prevalent cases were the first recruited, the proportion of prevalent cases was somewhat higher in set 1 than set 2 (33% versus 20%).	4487	4627
18507837	In total, 1,370 prevalent cases were included in both sets; median time from diagnosis to blood draw was 3.4 years (range: 0.8 to 9.34 years).	4628	4770
18507837	Median age at diagnosis was similar in the two sets (50 and 53 years old, respectively).	4771	4859
18507837	Median time from diagnosis to blood draw was slightly longer for set 2 (18 months) than for set 1 (9 months), but the number of deaths in each set was similar (359 in set 1 and 278 in set 2).	4860	5051
18507837	There was no significant difference in the morphology, histopathological grade, or TNM (tumour, node, metastasis) stage of the cases by set or by prevalent/incident status.	5052	5224
18507837	The ECRIC and the North Thames Cancer Registry have active follow-up at years 3 and 5 after diagnosis and then at 5-year intervals.	5225	5356
18507837	Follow-up information and all-cause mortality are obtained by searching hospital information systems for recent visits.	5357	5476
18507837	If a patient has not had a recent visit, the patient's general practitioner is contacted to obtain the vital status.	5477	5593
18507837	Death certificate flagging through the Office of National Statistics also provides the registries with notification of deaths.	5594	5720
18507837	The lag times with this process are a few weeks for cancer deaths and 2 months to a year for non-cancer deaths.	5721	5832
18507837	Cause-specific mortality was obtained from part I of the death certificate.	5833	5908
18507837	Thirteen genes involved in the G1 phase of cell cycle regulation were selected as candidate genes for breast cancer survival.	5909	6034
18507837	A comprehensive SNP tagging approach was used in which tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) were chosen to capture all known common genetic variation in each gene with an estimated correlation coefficient (r2) of greater than 0.8.	6035	6251
18507837	In some cases, SNPs that were poorly correlated with other single SNPs could be efficiently tagged with a haplotype defined by multiple SNPs.	6252	6393
18507837	Correlation between these SNPs and the haplotype of tagSNPs (r2s) was aimed to be greater than 0.8.	6394	6493
18507837	TagSNPs were identified with the program Tagger.	6494	6542
18507837	Data from the International HapMap Project and resequencing data from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Environmental Genome Project were used to select tagSNPs.	6543	6734
18507837	In total, 85 tagSNPs were chosen.	6735	6768
18507837	Genotyping was carried out using the TaqMan® platform (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	6769	6911
18507837	Primers and FAM- and VIC-labeled probes were supplied directly by Applied Biosystems as Assays-by-Design™.	6912	7018
18507837	All assays were carried out in 384-well plates.	7019	7066
18507837	Each plate included negative controls (with no DNA) and positive controls duplicated on a separate quality control plate.	7067	7188
18507837	Plates were read on the ABI Prism 7900 using Sequence Detection Software (Applied Biosystems).	7189	7283
18507837	Failed genotypes were not repeated.	7284	7319
18507837	Assays in which the genotypes of duplicate samples did not show greater than 95% concordance were discarded and replaced with alternative assays with the same tagging properties.	7320	7498
18507837	Call rates for each assay were over 95%.	7499	7539
18507837	Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of each tagSNP on survival.	7540	7629
18507837	The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated by visual inspection of log-log plots as well as tested analytically using Schoenfeld residuals.	7630	7776
18507837	TagSNPs significantly associated with survival were re-evaluated in a model adjusted for known breast cancer prognostic factors, which included age at diagnosis (<40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, or >60 years), clinical stage (TNM stage 1, 2, 3, or 4), histopathological grade (well differentiated, moderately differentiated, or poorly differentiated), estrogen receptor (ER) status, and treatment.	7777	8166
18507837	Time at risk began on the date of blood sample receipt and ended on the date of death from any cause or, if death did not occur, on 30 November 2006.	8167	8316
18507837	This allows for the difference in ascertainment of incident and prevalent cases and provides an unbiased estimate of the relative hazard provided that the proportional hazards assumption is correct.	8317	8515
18507837	Follow-up was censored at 10 years after diagnosis as follow-up became less reliable for each individual after 10 years.	8516	8636
18507837	A hazard ratio (HR) was estimated for heterozygous and rare homozygous genotypes relative to the common genotype.	8637	8750
18507837	Primary tests used were a likelihood ratio test (2 degrees of freedom) for heterogeneity of risk among the three genotypes (common homozygote, heterozygote, and rare homozygote) and a trend test (1 degree of freedom) based on the number of rare alleles carried.	8751	9012
18507837	All analyses were performed with Intercooled Stata, version 8.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).	9013	9118
18507837	The characteristics of the SEARCH breast cancer study participants for whom genotyping and vital status data were available are described in Table 1.	9119	9268
18507837	More than 99% of the cases were Caucasian.	9269	9311
18507837	There were 3,263 (73%) cases enrolled as incident cases and 1,207 (27%) as prevalent cases.	9312	9403
18507837	No significant difference in survival hazard was found between the two groups (P = 0.19).	9404	9493
18507837	During the 25,049 person-years at risk, there were 637 deaths before 10 years of follow-up.	9494	9585
18507837	Five hundred forty-two of these deaths were coded as breast cancer-specific.	9586	9662
18507837	The results of the univariate Cox regression analyses for single marker tagSNPs are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and for multimarker tagSNPs in Supplementary Table 2 (Additional File 1).	9663	9851
18507837	None of the tagSNPs in CCND1, CCND2, CCNE1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK1A, CDKN1B, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, or CDKN2D were significantly associated with all-cause survival.	9852	10011
18507837	The trend tests for CCND3 rs2479717, CCND3 rs9529, and CDK6 rs2079147 were significant at the 0.05 level (P = 0.001, 0.006, and 0.02, respectively).	10012	10160
18507837	CCND3 rs2479717 and CCND3 rs9529 are highly correlated with each other (r2 = 0.92).	10161	10244
18507837	In a forced Cox regression model including both CCND3 rs2479717 and CCND3 rs9529, only CCND3 rs2479717 remained significant (P = 0.029).	10245	10381
18507837	Therefore, only CCND3 rs2479717 and CDK6 rs2079147 were genotyped in the second set.	10382	10466
18507837	CCND3 rs2479717 remained significant in the joint analysis (HR per rare allele carried = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001) (Figure 1).	10467	10629
18507837	Data on tumour grade, TNM stage, and age at diagnosis were available for 80%, 97%, and 100% of the cases, respectively.	10630	10749
18507837	Only stage and grade remained significantly associated with survival in the multivariate model.	10750	10845
18507837	Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and adjuvant hormone therapy treatment data were available for 4,303 (96.3%) cases.	10846	10957
18507837	Of these, 1,412 (32.8%) underwent chemotherapy, 3,006 (69.9%) were treated with adjuvant hormone therapy, and 3,099 (72.0%) received radiotherapy.	10958	11104
18507837	Surgical treatment information was available for 4,194 (93.8%) cases; of these, 3,840 (91.6%) underwent surgery.	11105	11217
18507837	The risk associated with CCND3 rs2479717 was not significantly attenuated after adjusting for tumour stage, grade, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, adjuvant hormone therapy, and surgery (HR per rare allele carried = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.41; P = 0.003).	11218	11468
18507837	We repeated the analysis in those recruited within 3 years of diagnosis (3,558 individuals), and there were no differences in the results for both the univariate analysis (HR per rare allele carried = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.46; P = 0.0002) and the multivariate model (HR per rare allele carried = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.42; P = 0.004).	11469	11806
18507837	ER status was available for 2,624 (58.7%) cases.	11807	11855
18507837	Of these, 1,975 (75.3%) individuals had an ER-positive tumour.	11856	11918
18507837	No differences across stage, grade, or ER status are noted across the rs2479717 genotype (Table 2).	11919	12018
18507837	If ER status is added to the multivariate model, the power of the model is somewhat decreased due to a reduction in sample size, resulting in a slight attenuation of the HR and loss of significance for CCND3 rs2479717 (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.35; P = 0.19).	12019	12281
18507837	The HR for CCND3 rs2479717 was almost the same for those individuals with an ER-positive tumour (HR per rare allele carried = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.41) and those with an ER-negative tumour (HR per rare allele carried = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.43); the test for interaction was not significant (P = 0.97).	12282	12588
18507837	Results were consistent for breast cancer-specific mortality (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 found in Additional File 2).	12589	12708
18507837	Only CCND3 rs2479717 remained significant in the joint analysis (HR per rare allele carried = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.44; P = 0.0004).	12709	12843
18507837	This HR was not attenuated by stage, grade, and treatment (HR per rare allele carried = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.40; P = 0.01).	12844	12970
18507837	CCND3 rs2479717 is an a > t intronic alteration approximately 50 bases downstream from exon 3.	12971	13065
18507837	It lies in a large linkage disequilibrium (LD) block on chromosome 6, which contains seven genes: CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC (Figure 2).	13066	13224
18507837	To further evaluate the effect of these genes on breast cancer survival, microarray gene expression data for seven breast cancer cohorts were taken from existing literature and public databases (Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress).	13225	13462
18507837	The publicly available data comprise raw expression data that have been 'normalized'.	13463	13548
18507837	This usually involves background correction, quantile normalization, and log transformation.	13549	13641
18507837	The retrieved datasets were further normalized, if necessary, by transforming them onto a common log2 scale and shifting the median of each array to zero.	13642	13796
18507837	Study characteristics are included in Table 3.	13797	13843
18507837	In total, the studies included tumour samples from 1,241 individuals.	13844	13913
18507837	All of the studies contained clinical outcomes; five of the studies had information on all-cause mortality, and two of the studies had disease recurrence as an outcome.	13914	14082
18507837	Most of the studies had a mix of untreated and treated individuals, with treatment including both chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy.	14083	14218
18507837	Median age at diagnosis ranged from less than 53 years to 65 years.	14219	14286
18507837	The majority of tumours were ER-positive and medium grade (Supplementary Table 5 found in Additional File 3).	14287	14396
18507837	Combined, the datasets provided 9,048 years at risk (median of 7.4 years at risk) and a total of 384 events.	14397	14505
18507837	To test whether a gene's expression is associated with clinical outcome, we used Cox proportional hazards regression models.	14506	14630
18507837	In this context, the HR refers to the proportional increase in hazard risk per unit increase on a log2 scale of expression level of the transcript.	14631	14778
18507837	To attempt to control for study heterogeneity, expression data for each gene were analyzed two ways: a Cox survival model stratified by study (fixed effects) and a random-effects meta-analysis.	14779	14972
18507837	Elevated expression levels of the BYSL transcript were significantly associated with breast cancer survival in a random-effects model (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.10 to 3.08; P = 0.02) (Figure 3a), but the association did not reach significance in a fixed-effects model (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.38; P = 0.08).	14973	15280
18507837	Elevated expression levels of the C6orf49 transcript were significantly associated with breast cancer survival in a fixed-effects model (HR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.16; P = 0.002) and in a random-effects model (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.11 to 3.05; P = 0.02) (Figure 3b).	15281	15548
18507837	Expression levels of CCND3, TRFP, USP49, FRS3, or PGC transcripts were not significantly associated with breast cancer survival (Supplementary Table 6 found in Additional File 3).	15549	15728
18507837	We have evaluated the association of 85 tagSNPs in 13 cell cycle control genes with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer.	15729	15857
18507837	Previous work has shown that expression of these genes is associated with breast cancer prognosis; however, to our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess germline variation in genes involved in controlling the cell cycle and breast cancer survival.	15858	16127
18507837	This study used a two-stage design, with an initial set of 85 tagSNPs genotyped in 2,270 individuals.	16128	16229
18507837	The top two SNPs, with a P value of less than 0.05, were genotyped in the second set of patients (n = 2,200).	16230	16339
18507837	Because a combined analysis with adjustment for multiple testing has been shown to increase power over a replication study, a joint analysis of both sets of data was performed.	16340	16516
18507837	One SNP, CCND3 rs2479717, showed a significant association with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer (unadjusted P value = 0.0001).	16517	16655
18507837	This finding remains significant after a conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (P value = 0.0085), and the HR is not significantly attenuated after adjusting for stage, grade, and treatment.	16656	16864
18507837	There was no evidence of association with survival for polymorphisms in CCND1, CCND2, CCNE1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, and CDKN2D.	16865	17027
18507837	These findings were based on the analysis of all-cause mortality.	17028	17093
18507837	This may result in a reduction of statistical power as some deaths will be unrelated to breast cancer.	17094	17196
18507837	Breast cancer-specific mortality was available from death certificates, and the results were consistent for the breast cancer-specific analysis, with an identical HR for CCND3 rs2479717.	17197	17383
18507837	It is worth noting that cause of death as coded on a death certificate is also prone to misclassification and subsequent loss of statistical power.	17384	17531
18507837	Our analyses incorporated prevalent cases.	17532	17574
18507837	It may be thought that inclusion of prevalent cases may result in a bias of the HR.	17575	17658
18507837	However, provided that the Cox proportional hazards assumption holds true, the HR estimate is unbiased.	17659	17762
18507837	For example, there is no significant difference between the HRs for CCND3 rs2479717, TNM stage, or histopathological grade when comparing subjects recruited within 6 months of diagnosis with those recruited more than 6 months after diagnosis (P = 0.69, 0.90, and 0.42, respectively).	17763	18046
18507837	Furthermore, our repeated analyses, including only those individuals recruited within 3 years of their diagnosis, were identical to our full analysis.	18047	18197
18507837	CCND3 encodes for cyclin D3, a protein involved in the regulation of the G1/S phase transition.	18198	18293
18507837	The SNP associated with survival, CCND3 rs2479717, is in an intron and unlikely to have a functional effect.	18294	18402
18507837	However, a functional effect would not be expected as it was chosen as a tagSNP, not as a functional SNP.	18403	18508
18507837	Furthermore, a functional variant tagged by this SNP may not even alter the function of CCND3; the SNP lies in a large LD block with several genes that are reasonable candidates for breast cancer survival.	18509	18714
18507837	PGC encodes for pepsinogen C, a proteolytic enzyme involved in digestion, which is expressed in breast tumours.	18715	18826
18507837	Higher pepsinogen C expression is associated with well-differentiated and moderately differentiated breast tumours and has been associated with longer overall survival in these patients.	18827	19013
18507837	BYSL encodes for bystin, a crucial component protein of an adhesion molecule complex that is important for the attachment of the embryo to the uterus.	19014	19164
18507837	This protein is present in human prostatic carcinoma cells in areas of perineural invasion in an increasing gradient, suggesting a role in perineural adhesion.	19165	19324
18507837	C6orf49 encodes for overexpressed breast tumour protein, a member of the LIM domain (cysteine-rich double zinc fingers) protein family that is overexpressed in tumours and has a possible role in cancer differentiation.	19325	19543
18507837	FRS3 encodes for fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 3, a negative regulator in epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways.	19544	19700
18507837	USP49 encodes for ubiquitin-specific protease 49, which is involved in the modification of cellular proteins.	19701	19810
18507837	Ubiquitin-specific protease 49 is expressed in samples derived from tumour biopsies.	19811	19895
18507837	TRFP encodes for TATA-binding protein-related protein, which is associated with an RNA polymerase II-SRB complex; this complex may regulate class II genes.	19896	20051
18507837	To further evaluate this LD block, we examined breast tumour expression of these seven genes using expression microarray data from seven published datasets.	20052	20208
18507837	Significant associations between increased tumour expression levels of BYSL and C6orf49 transcripts and breast cancer survival emerged.	20209	20344
18507837	Differences between the microarray datasets, varying outcome information, and incomplete control of confounding by prognostic factors may limit interpretation of these findings; however, we attempted to control for patient and tumour heterogeneity between these studies by performing two analyses: a random-effects and a fixed-effects meta-analysis.	20345	20694
18507837	Although the results for BYSL are unclear, both analyses showed consistent associations of elevated tumour expression of the C6orf49 transcript with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer.	20695	20888
18507837	Our study has found evidence that tagSNP CCND3 rs2479717, which is found in a genomic region that includes CCND3 and six other genes, is associated with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer.	20889	21086
18507837	Although our study began as an evaluation of cell cycle control genes, our significant finding may actually relate to a gene in LD with CCND3 rs2479717 that is not related to cell cycle control.	21087	21281
18507837	This is supported by our findings that elevated tumour expression of the C6orf49 transcript, one of the genes in LD with rs2479717, is associated with breast cancer survival.	21282	21456
18507837	If our findings can be confirmed in other studies, further evaluation of this locus to identify the causal variant would be warranted.	21457	21591
16277682	Paget's disease of bone (PDB; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) entry no.	0	82
16277682	602080) is a metabolic bone disease characterized by accelerated bone resorption followed by the deposition of dense, chaotic bone matrix, affecting up to 3% of individuals of Caucasian ancestry above the age of 55 years.	83	304
16277682	Although PDB is genetically heterogeneous, in some familial cases of late onset PDB an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has been reported.	305	452
16277682	Mutations of the p62/sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) gene account for most of the sporadic and familial forms of PDB, and exons 7 and 8, encoding the ubiquitin-binding-associated domain (UBA), host a clustered mutational area.	453	675
16277682	p62 acts as a scaffold protein in signalling pathways downstream of the interleukin-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and nerve growth factor receptors.	676	828
16277682	In a recent paper we described an M404V mutation in the UBA of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in an Italian population of patients affected by PDB.	829	965
16277682	This mutation has also been confirmed in other ethnic groups.	966	1027
16277682	For the Italian patient carrying this A→G transition at exon 8, collection of the family history demonstrated a clear inheritance for PDB.	1028	1166
16277682	DNA analysis for the p62/SQSTM1 gene mutation was performed in all affected familial members and in several unaffected subjects, to evaluate the segregation of the M404V mutation with the PDB phenotype and to detect potentially asymptomatic gene carriers.	1167	1422
16277682	Through this analysis we identified both a familial form of PDB, in which the M404V mutation segregates with a polyostotic phenotype of the disorder, and several asymptomatic gene carriers.	1423	1612
16277682	The Local Ethical Committee of the University of Florence approved this study.	1613	1691
16277682	The PDB female proband (III-1) was clinically evaluated and genetically characterized as a carrier of a novel M404V mutation at exon 8 of the p62/SQSTM1 gene (Fig.	1692	1855
16277682	1).	1856	1859
16277682	Through the family history a familial form of PDB (F01 pedigree, Fig.	1860	1929
16277682	1) was ascertained.	1930	1949
16277682	The four-generation family, originating from central Italy, consists of 37 living subjects (22 females and 15 males; age range 33 to 92 years) and 18 deceased individuals (11 males and 7 females; Fig.	1950	2150
16277682	1).	1856	1859
16277682	Members from generations I to III were farmers born and still living in a rural environment, whereas fourth-generation individuals, although born in the same environment as previous generations, moved to urban life after adolescence.	2155	2388
16277682	Relevant clinical information on affected and gene-carrier members of the F01 pedigree was collected; they are summarized in Table 1.	2389	2522
16277682	All available family members were asked to undergo DNA mutational analysis and biochemical assessment after administration of an informed consent form.	2523	2674
16277682	No information was available on the first (I) generation (subjects I-1, I-1.0 and I-2; Fig.	2675	2766
16277682	1).	1856	1859
16277682	In the second (II) generation (Fig.	2771	2806
16277682	1) blood samples for genomic DNA evaluation were obtained from the only living subject (patient II-6), a 92-year-old male, suffering from a benign hyperplasia of the prostate (Table 1).	2807	2992
16277682	Male subject II-3, the father of a III-6 affected individual (Fig.	2993	3059
16277682	1), was referred to as a carrier of multiple bone deformities and pain by living members of the family, strongly suggesting the presence of PDB disease in this individual.	3060	3231
16277682	Figure 2a contributes to sustaining this hypothesis.	3232	3284
16277682	The proband III-1, in whom the M404V mutation was first detected, belongs to the third (III) generation (Fig.	3285	3394
16277682	1).	1856	1859
16277682	Patient III-6 died because of an osteogenic sarcoma within or in a Pagetic bone.	3399	3479
16277682	This patient was diagnosed as being affected by PDB at the age of 62 years because of the presence of bone pain, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and X-rays indicating typical PDB.	3480	3677
16277682	Bone scintigraphy showed signs of disease in the right pelvis, the right proximal femur and left ribs IV and VIII.	3678	3792
16277682	Three years after the diagnosis of PDB, bone pain in the right pelvis increased markedly and a bone biopsy showed the presence of an osteogenic sarcoma on the Pagetic bone already metastasized to the lungs.	3793	3999
16277682	The patient died at 65 years of age after surgical and chemotherapeutic interventions, some years before DNA analysis was performed on the F01 pedigree.	4000	4152
16277682	The ages of members from the fourth (IV) generation (IV-1, IV-2, IV-3, IV-5, IV-6, IV-13, IV-14, IV-15 and IV-16) ranged from 41 to 53 years.	4153	4294
16277682	Neither clinical nor biochemical abnormalities suggestive of PDB are currently evident in this younger group (Fig.	4295	4409
16277682	1, Table 1).	4410	4422
16277682	Evaluation of AP, measured by an autoanalyzer, has been performed also in all the individuals undergoing mutational analysis.	4423	4548
16277682	The upper limit of the reference range is 120 units/l.	4549	4603
16277682	After administration of an informed consent form, peripheral blood was obtained from 22 subjects: 4 PDB patients (III-1, III-3, III-12 and III-13) and 18 clinically unaffected members (II-6, III-7, III-8, III-9, III-10, III-14, III-18, III-19, III-20, IV-1, IV-2, IV-3, IV-5, IV-6, IV-13, IV-14, IV-15 and IV-16) (Fig.	4604	4922
16277682	1, Table 1).	4410	4422
16277682	Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes with the use of a microvolume extraction method, QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.	4936	5147
16277682	Exon 8 of the p62/SQSTM1 gene was amplified by PCR (I-Cycler; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy) using a couple of primers located in the flanking intron: 5'-CAGTGTGGCCTGTGAGGAC-3'/5'-CAGTGAGCCTTGGGTCTCG-3'.	5148	5356
16277682	For each patient we used 0.1 μg of DNA, in a final buffer volume of 50 μl (67 mM Tris-HCl, 16.6 mM (NH4)SO4, 0.01% Tween 20, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM deoxyribonucleotides, each primer at 0.2 μM and 1 unit of Polytaq (Polymed, Florence, Italy)).	5357	5597
16277682	Thirty PCR cycles were performed at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min, after a first denaturing cycle at 94°C for 3 min.	5598	5732
16277682	A final extension cycle of 5 min was performed at 72°C.	5733	5788
16277682	PCR products were tested by 2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose-gel electrophoresis, purified with a High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and finally sequenced with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).	5789	6076
16277682	The sequencing reaction consisted of 25 repeated cycles of denaturation for 10 s at 96°C, annealing for 5 s at 55°C and extension for 2 min at 60°C.	6077	6225
16277682	The sequencing products were purified with a DyeEx 2.0 Spin Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) to remove the excess dye terminator.	6226	6357
16277682	A 5 μl sample of each purified sequence was then resuspended in 15 μl of formamide and denatured for 2 min at 95°C.	6358	6473
16277682	Analysis of the forward and reverse sequences was performed on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).	6474	6615
16277682	Suspicion or diagnosis of PDB was based on description by relatives, evidence of bone deformities and pain strongly suggestive of PDB (II-3 (Fig.	6616	6761
16277682	2a), II-8 and II-10) and, when possible, direct evidence of elevated total AP, X-ray scanning and bone scintigraphy (III-1, III-3 (Fig.	6762	6897
16277682	2b), III-6, III-12 and III-13; Fig.	6898	6933
16277682	1, Table 1).	4410	4422
16277682	After careful reconstitution of their clinical history, 12 subjects (6 males and 6 females), of which 11 were living, were reported to be the following: clinically ascertained as PDB patients (III-1, III-3 (Fig.	6947	7158
16277682	2b), III-6, III-12 and III-13) with increased circulating levels of AP (more than 120 units/l); presumably affected by PDB (II-3 (Fig.	7159	7293
16277682	2a), II-8 and II-10); and potentially mutant (II-1, II-2, II-7 and III-5; Table 1).	7294	7377
16277682	In accordance with previously described criteria, all affected members, clinically ascertained (III-1, III-3 (Fig.	7378	7492
16277682	2b), III-6, III-12 and III-13), exhibited polyostotic localization of PDB (III-1, III-3, III-6 and III-13), except patient III-12 (Table 1).	7493	7633
16277682	In the last of these the monostotic left femur involvement was diagnosed only through standard X-ray examination, so the possibility of underestimation of skeletal involvement cannot be excluded (Table 1).	7634	7839
16277682	Over all, considering only the clinically ascertained affected subjects (III-1, III-3, III-6, III-12 and III-13), the number of bones involved in this family is 3.8 ± 2.31 (mean ± SD).	7840	8024
16277682	Three subjects in the family (II-3 (Fig.	8025	8065
16277682	2a), II-8 and II-10) were presumably affected by PDB on the basis of the history related by other members of the family and of the fact that progeny of II-3 and II-8 carried the M404V mutation.	8066	8259
16277682	In these three cases the description of bone deformities was suggestive of multiple bone localization.	8260	8362
16277682	Until now none of the unaffected members has exhibited AP levels outside the normal range (that is, more than 120 units/l).	8363	8486
16277682	All the available ascertained affected PDB individuals from the third generation (III-1, III-3, III-12 and III-13) exhibited the M404V mutation of the p62/SQSTM1 gene (Table 1), confirming the pathogenetic nature of this p62/SQSTM1 gene mutation and suggesting segregation of the mutation with the polyostotic phenotype in this family.	8487	8822
16277682	Although patient III-6 died as a result of an osteogenic sarcoma on a Pagetic bone several years before the genetic evaluation of F01 pedigree, he probably had the M404V mutation.	8823	9002
16277682	Through mutational analysis the pedigree was carefully reconstructed, and this allowed us to propose that patients II-1, II-2, II-3, II-7, II-8 and III-5 were also carriers of the M404V mutation.	9003	9198
16277682	In fact, their PDB-affected children (III-1, III-3, III-6, III-12 and III-13) exhibited the mutation (Table 1).	9199	9310
16277682	Of the unaffected subjects, II-6, III-7, III-8, III-9, III-10, III-14, III-18, III-19, III-20, IV-2, IV-3, IV-5 and IV-6 (age range from 35 to 92 years) were not carrying the M404V p62/SQSTM1 gene mutation, whereas subjects IV-1, IV-13, IV-14, IV-15 and IV-16 (age range from 41 to 53 years) were carrying the mutation (Table 1).	9311	9640
16277682	AP levels were still in the normal range (less than 120 units/l) in these gene carriers (Table 1).	9641	9739
16277682	Several lines of evidence support the role of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in the pathogenesis of PDB, even though the molecular mechanisms that underlie its functional activities are not fully understood.	9740	9936
16277682	Similarly, little information has been collected about either the potential genotype–phenotype correlation between gene mutations and clinical manifestations of PDB or the role of genetic testing in asymptomatic carriers within affected families.	9937	10183
16277682	The findings described in this paper are of interest with regard to both issues.	10184	10264
16277682	The p62/SQSTM1 protein binds non-covalently to ubiquitin, co-localizing with ubiquitinated inclusions in several human diseases characterized by altered protein aggregation.	10265	10438
16277682	Moreover, the protein mediates several cellular functions including NFκB-dependent signalling and transcriptional activity, which are important for the recruitment and activation of osteoclastic cells.	10439	10640
16277682	The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the p62-UBA domain has recently been determined, but its functional significance in the p62 protein is still unknown.	10641	10802
16277682	The study by Ciani and colleagues showed that the M404V mutation is able to modify the secondary structure of the domain and affects its ability to bind to Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains in vitro.	10803	11003
16277682	Together with other p62/SQSTM1 gene mutations at the UBA domain, Cavey and colleagues showed that M404V is able to cause the loss of monoubiquitin binding and impair in vitro Lys48-linked polyubiquitin binding, although these effects were reported only when the binding experiments were performed at the physiological temperature of 37°C.	11004	11342
16277682	These findings suggest that PDB-related SQSTM1 mutations may confer a higher susceptibility to development of the disease by impairing the binding of the p62 protein to a ubiquitinated target.	11343	11535
16277682	However, other molecular mechanisms, involving a key ubiquitinated substrate, could be invoked in the attempt to explain the acquisition of the PDB phenotype in individuals with mutations of the p62/SQSTM1 gene.	11536	11747
16277682	A structural analysis demonstrated in 4 of 70 PDB relatives with British ancestry that an M404V mutation involves residues on the hydrophobic surface patch implicated in ubiquitin binding.	11748	11936
16277682	Consequently, an M404V mutation affects the ability of a mutant UBA domain to bind polyubiquitin chains.	11937	12041
16277682	Using this structural information Hocking and colleagues reported that patients with truncating mutations of the p62/SQSTM1 gene exhibited a trend for more extensive PDB than those with mis-sense mutations such as M404V.	12042	12262
16277682	They concluded that there is no correlation between the ubiquitin-binding properties of different mutant UBA domains and disease occurrence or extension of the same.	12263	12428
16277682	These findings therefore do not provide a speculative hypothesis for an explanation of the observed genotype–phenotype correlation in the Italian family with PDB described in this paper.	12429	12615
16277682	The heterozygous segregation of M404V mutation with the PDB phenotype in the F01 pedigree supports the pathogenetic role via a dominant-negative action.	12616	12768
16277682	Moreover, the evidence of a genotype–phenotype correlation in this family can also include epigenetic mechanisms that, through a common genetic background, can contribute, along with the M404V mutation, to the expression of a polyostotic PDB phenotype in the affected members.	12769	13045
16277682	Interestingly, the commonly shared rural environment of all the members from generations I to III and, for a shorter period, generation IV of this family, together with the presence of past measles infection in all individuals analysed, could suggest a role for environmental factors in determining the polyostotic expression of the disease in M404V mutant subjects.	13046	13412
16277682	Clinical follow-up of asymptomatic carriers from generation IV might confirm or negate this observation.	13413	13517
16277682	Studies on the penetrance of PDB have been performed by several authors, the PDB shows an incomplete clinical expression, meaning that some SQSTM1 gene carriers from affected families do not show clinical evidence of the disease.	13518	13747
16277682	Moreover, some PDB-affected individuals, from affected families with a known SQSTM1 gene mutation, do not exhibit the mutation.	13748	13875
16277682	Conversely, individuals older than 55 years of age with a known SQSTM1 mutation from relatives affected with PDB, did not develop PDB.	13876	14010
16277682	A potential explanation for these findings is the existence of genetic heterogeneity, with possible modifier loci capable of controlling the clinical expression of PDB.	14011	14179
16277682	For individuals younger than 55 years of age with a known SQSTM1 mutation, originating from relatives affected with PDB, who had not yet developed PDB, the time needed for phenotypic expression of the disease could represent a limiting factor.	14180	14423
16277682	In general, a lack of expression of the disease in recognized SQSTM1 gene carriers could be explained by a reduced exposure to environmental factors such as paramixovirus infections and/or by the progressive abandonment of the rural environment.	14424	14669
16277682	An important application of genetic analyses in families is the precocious identification of asymptomatic gene carriers.	14670	14790
16277682	In this relative the p62/SQSTM1 disease-associated mutation was also present in individuals younger than 50 years of age.	14791	14912
16277682	So far the asymptomatic gene carriers have not exhibited any abnormality in the circulating levels of AP and have not shown any clinical signs suggestive of PDB.	14913	15074
16277682	Although bone scanning is commonly recommended in patients with PDB older than 40 years of age, because of the ethical considerations observed in our country, bone scan tests cannot be performed unless AP levels are raised and consequently PDB bone localization cannot be excluded at this stage in asymptomatic mutant carriers.	15075	15402
16277682	However, considering that a positive individual older than 40 years of age has an up to 80% likelihood of developing the disease by 70 years of age, the extremely high penetrance of PDB in this family clearly indicates the need for an accurate vertical follow-up of the six asymptomatic mutant carriers.	15403	15706
16277682	This will allow us to confirm the suggested genotype–phenotype correlation in the currently asymptomatic carriers as well, and to assess the role of mutational analysis of the p62/SQSTM1 gene for early detection of the individuals at risk for developing PDB.	15707	15965
16277682	At present, a positive test for the mutation of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in a patient with PDB does not have any impact on treatment.	15966	16094
16277682	Finally, one of the affected subjects (III-6) in this family developed an osteosarcoma that caused her death.	16095	16204
16277682	Pagetoid osteosarcoma is a complication of PDB and is most often observed in severe, long-standing PDB.	16205	16308
16277682	Two previous reports described a direct lineage in which Pagetoid osteosarcoma developed in affected family members.	16309	16425
16277682	Although specific genetic mechanisms remain to be elucidated, some authors reported loss of heterozygosity for loci at chromosome 18q21-22 in Pagetoid osteosarcomas as well as in sporadic osteosarcomas.	16426	16628
16277682	The deleted region was shown to harbour the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK, TNFRSF11A) gene identified in a family affected by familial expansile osteolysis (OMIM entry no.	16629	16816
16277682	174810), a Paget-like syndrome.	16817	16848
16277682	Although the RANK gene has not been found to be mutated in PDB-affected individuals, a positive association between a polymorphic variant of this gene and PDB has been reported.	16849	17026
16277682	NFκB is also the potential molecular target of the mechanism underlying the altered osteoclastogenesis seen in PDB patients carrying mutated sequences in the UBA domain of the p62/SQSTM1 gene.	17027	17219
16277682	Inactivation of the p62/SQSTM1 gene could activate the RANK–NFκB signalling, as seen in the familial expansile osteolysis syndrome, with impairment of TNF-α-induced programmed cell death.	17220	17407
16277682	Such machinery is also crucial for immunity, lymphocyte development, tumorigenesis and cancer chemoresistance; NFκB functions are recognized as relevant to tumour promotion.	17408	17581
16277682	Even though the presence of the M404V mutation could not be assessed in patient III-6, these hypotheses strongly support the need for further investigation into the possible role of the p62 protein in the occurrence of osteosarcoma, both in PDB-affected patients and in individuals without PDB.	17582	17876
16277682	This paper describes a genotype–phenotype correlation in PDB cases with a mis-sense mutation in the p62/SQSTM1 gene.	17877	17993
16277682	These results should be confirmed in other PDB patients of Italian and other ancestries.	17994	18082
16277682	Moreover, the value of a pre-symptomatic gene test in PDB requires a vertical evaluation in well-characterized relatives, opening new possibilities for the practical application of genetic diagnosis in PDB family members and also in the general population.	18083	18339
16277682	Finally, the knowledge of the function of p62/SQSTM1 gene mutations should enable us to uncover the pathogenesis of PDB and osteogenic osteosarcoma.	18340	18488
15461822	The increased prevalence of disease caused by the mosquito-borne dengue (DEN) viruses (four serotypes; DEN-1 – DEN-4) has intensified the effort to generate a vaccine that would both confer protection and be economically feasible for use in countries with limited resources for healthcare.	0	289
15461822	Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock (DHF/DSS) are a severe disease burden for tropical and semitropical countries inhabited by more than 2.5 billion people.	290	462
15461822	Risk factors for the more severe disease, DHF/DSS, include the strain of virus, age and genetic background of the host, and secondary infection by a DEN serotype different from that which caused the primary infection.	463	680
15461822	Increased risk associated with secondary infection by a different DEN serotype is believed to be caused both by increased virus replication resulting from antibody-dependent enhancement and by augmented immune activation induced by the secondary infection.	681	937
15461822	Typically, regions with DHF/DSS have all four DEN serotypes circulating simultaneously, and an effective DEN vaccine must contain a tetravalent formulation that confers protection against each of the four DEN serotypes.	938	1157
15461822	Immunity to the DEN viruses is primarily mediated by neutralizing antibodies directed against the envelope (E) glycoprotein, and most vaccine strategies aim to induce antibody against this major protective antigen.	1158	1372
15461822	Live attenuated tetravalent vaccines appear to be the best vaccine candidates since they are economical to manufacture and they induce long-term immunity with the live attenuated yellow fever virus vaccine serving as a successful model flavivirus vaccine.	1373	1628
15461822	Several strategies to produce live attenuated tetravalent vaccines are being pursued including attenuation of viruses by conventional passage in tissue culture or introduction of defined attenuating mutations into recombinant DEN viruses.	1629	1867
15461822	In addition, chimeric dengue viruses are being evaluated that contain the E protein of a DEN virus on a background of either an attenuated DEN virus from a different serotype or a more distantly related, but attenuated, flavivirus.	1868	2099
15461822	We have previously described attenuated and immunogenic monovalent vaccine candidates for DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4 that were generated by two distinct recombinant methodologies.	2100	2283
15461822	Using the first methodology, nucleotides 10478–10507 were deleted from the 3' UTR (Δ30) of a wild type cDNA clone for DEN-4 to generate a vaccine candidate, rDEN4Δ30, which is safe, attenuated, and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys and humans.	2284	2523
15461822	Incorporation of the Δ30 mutation into an infectious cDNA clone of DEN-1 wild type virus at a site homologous to that in DEN-4 attenuated DEN-1 for rhesus monkeys and is currently being evaluated in humans.	2524	2730
15461822	The Δ30 mutation did not confer attenuation upon DEN-3 for reasons that have not been defined.	2731	2825
15461822	Thus, this approach has yielded live attenuated virus vaccine candidates for both DEN-1 and DEN-4.	2826	2924
15461822	Using a second methodology, antigenic chimeric viruses have been generated by replacing the membrane protein (M) and E structural genes of rDEN4Δ30 with those from DEN-2 or DEN-3.	2925	3104
15461822	These antigenic chimeric viruses were attenuated and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys and represent vaccine candidates for DEN-2 and DEN-3.	3105	3241
15461822	We have also described a set of point mutations that can attenuate wild type rDEN-4 for SCID mice transplanted with human liver cells (SCID-HuH-7) or for rhesus monkeys.	3242	3411
15461822	Such mutations identified in rDEN-4 could be introduced into conserved sites of cDNA clones for other DEN serotypes to fine-tune the level of attenuation of vaccine candidates.	3412	3588
15461822	We have found it prudent to pursue several strategies to develop a live attenuated virus vaccine for each dengue serotype recognizing that it has been a challenge to achieve a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity.	3589	3825
15461822	Thus, in addition to the antigenic chimeric DEN-2 vaccine candidate described above, a second approach was pursued in the present study that involved the construction of an infectious cDNA clone of a wild type DEN-2 virus isolated in Tonga, and the generation of DEN-2 vaccine candidates by the sequential introduction of defined attenuating mutations into the recombinant version of the DEN-2 Tonga/74 wild type virus.	3826	4245
15461822	The rDEN2Δ30 vaccine candidate was evaluated for replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice, mosquitoes, and rhesus monkeys.	4246	4358
15461822	In addition, an attenuating point mutation, previously described in DEN-4, was introduced into the rDEN2Δ30 virus, and this rDEN2Δ30 derivative was characterized in SCID-HuH-7 mice.	4359	4540
15461822	Vero cells (African green monkey kidney) were propagated in OptiPro SFM (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen).	4541	4692
15461822	HuH-7 cells (human hepatoma) were maintained in D-MEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM L-glutamine and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen).	4693	4869
15461822	C6/36 cells (Aedes albopictus mosquito cells) were maintained at 32°C in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) containing Earle's salts and 25 mM HEPES buffer (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen).	4870	5134
15461822	A dengue virus type 2 isolate, Tonga/74, was provided by Dr. Duane Gubler (CDC, Fort Collins, CO).	5135	5233
15461822	The virus was isolated during a 1974 dengue outbreak in the South Pacific island of Tonga.	5234	5324
15461822	The virus was isolated by inoculation of patient sera into Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and subsequent passage in C6/36 cells before determination of genomic sequence.	5325	5492
15461822	Viral RNA was isolated from DEN-2 Tonga/74 wild type virus using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).	5493	5611
15461822	Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamer primers and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen).	5612	5751
15461822	Overlapping PCR fragments of approximately 2000 base pairs were generated using DEN-2 specific primers and Advantage cDNA polymerase (ClonTech, Palo Alto, CA).	5752	5911
15461822	Both strands of the resulting PCR fragments were sequenced directly on a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using DEN-2 specific primers in BigDye terminator cycle sequencing reactions (Applied Biosystems) and the results were assembled into a consensus sequence.	5912	6200
15461822	To determine the nucleotide sequence of the genomic 5' and 3' regions, the 5' cap nucleoside of the viral genome was removed with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI), followed by circularization of the genome using RNA ligase (Epicentre Technologies).	6201	6483
15461822	An RT-PCR fragment spanning the ligation junction was generated and sequenced using DEN-2 primers.	6484	6582
15461822	For the DEN-2 Tonga/74 consensus sequence, GenBank accession number AY744147 was assigned.	6583	6673
15461822	cDNA fragments of DEN-2 Tonga/74 were generated by reverse-transcription of the genome as indicated in Figure 1.	6674	6786
15461822	Each fragment was subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced to verify that it matched the consensus sequence as determined for the virus.	6787	6928
15461822	This yielded seven cloned cDNA fragments spanning the genome.	6929	6990
15461822	Cloned fragments were modified as follows: Fragment X, representing the 5' end of the genome was abutted to the SP6 promoter; Fragment L was modified to contain a SpeI restriction site at genomic nucleotide 2353; Fragment R was modified to contain a SpeI restriction site also at genomic nucleotide 2353, and, to stabilize the eventual full-length clone, two additional mutations at nucleotides 2362 – 2364 and 2397 were created to ensure that translation stop codons were present in all reading frames other than that used to synthesize the virus polyprotein; Fragment A was modified at nucleotide 3582 to ablate a naturally occurring SpeI restriction site and at nucleotide 4497 to ablate a naturally occurring KpnI restriction site; Fragment C was modified at nucleotide 9374 to ablate a naturally occurring KpnI restriction site; and Fragment Y, representing the 3' end of the genome was abutted to a KpnI restriction site.	6991	7918
15461822	All mutations introduced into the cloned cDNA fragments were translationally-silent, thereby preserving the wild-type polyprotein sequence.	7919	8058
15461822	Each fragment was added incrementally between the AscI and KpnI restriction sites of DEN-4 cDNA clone p4 (GenBank accession number: AY648301) to generate a full-length DEN-2 cDNA clone (p2) with the same vector background successfully used to generate rDEN-4 and rDEN4Δ30 virus.	8059	8337
15461822	cDNA clone p2 was sequenced to confirm that the virus genome region matched the DEN-2 Tonga/74 consensus amino acid and nucleotide sequence, with the exception of the translationally-silent modifications noted above.	8338	8554
15461822	The Δ30 mutation which removes nucleotides 10541–10570 was introduced into Fragment Y to generate Fragment YΔ30.	8555	8667
15461822	To create p2Δ30, the Fragment Y region of p2 was replaced with Fragment YΔ30 (Figure 1).	8668	8756
15461822	The genomic region of each full-length cDNA was sequenced as described above and GenBank accessions were assigned as follows (cDNA clone: accession numbers): p2: AY744148, p2Δ30: AY744149.	8757	8945
15461822	Using site-directed mutagenesis, an attenuating amino acid change characterized in the NS3 gene of DEN-4 (nt 4995–7; a.a. 158, Ser→Leu) was introduced into the p2Δ30 cDNA clone.	8946	9123
15461822	A mutagenic oligonucleotide was designed to change DEN-2 NS3 amino acid 158 from Ser (AGT) to Leu (CTA) and used to construct the cDNA clone, p2Δ30-4995 (accession number: AY744150), which was sequenced for confirmation of nucleotide changes.	9124	9366
15461822	cDNA clones were linearized with Acc65I (isoschizomer of KpnI which cleaves leaving only a single 3' nucleotide) and were transcribed in vitro using the AmpliCap SP6 Message Maker kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI).	9367	9589
15461822	Purified transcripts were then transfected into Vero or C6/36 cells.	9590	9658
15461822	Viruses recovered in C6/36 cells were passaged 3 times in Vero cells, and all viruses were biologically cloned by terminal dilution in Vero cells.	9659	9805
15461822	The genomes of recombinant viruses used to infect rhesus monkeys were completely sequenced as described above to identify adventitious mutations that had accumulated during transfection and biological cloning.	9806	10015
15461822	Four to six week-old SCID mice (Tac:Icr:Ha(ICR)-Prkdcscid) (Taconic, Germantown, NY) were injected intraperitoneally with 107 HuH-7 cells suspended in 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline.	10016	10200
15461822	Tumors were detected in the peritoneum, and mice were infected by direct inoculation of the tumor with 104 PFU of virus in 0.05 ml Opti-MEM (Invitrogen).	10201	10354
15461822	On day 7 post-infection, serum was obtained from cardiac blood and stored at -70°C.	10355	10438
15461822	Virus titer in serum samples was determined by plaque assay in Vero cells.	10439	10513
15461822	The DEN-2 viruses were evaluated in rhesus macaques using established methods.	10514	10592
15461822	DEN virus sero-negative monkeys were injected subcutaneously with 105 PFU virus diluted in L-15 medium (Invitrogen) or with a mock inoculum.	10593	10733
15461822	Serum was collected on days 0–6, 8, 10, 12 and 28 after inoculation and stored at -70°C.	10734	10822
15461822	Virus titer was determined for each serum sample by plaque assay in Vero cells and serum neutralizing antibody titer was determined for serum from days 0 and 28 by plaque reduction neutralization test.	10823	11024
15461822	On day 28, monkeys were challenged with 105 PFU of DEN-2 Tonga/74, and serum was collected on days 29–34, 36, and 56.	11025	11142
15461822	Virus titer was determined for serum from days 28–34 and 36 and serum neutralizing antibody titer was determined for serum from day 56.	11143	11278
15461822	Replication in Aedes aegypti and Toxorynchites amboinensis mosquitoes was evaluated as previously described.	11279	11387
15461822	Briefly, A. aegypti were fed blood meals containing serial 10-fold dilutions of virus.	11388	11474
15461822	After 21 days, viral antigen was detected in head and midgut preparations by immunoflourescence assay using DEN-2-specific hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid and fluorescein isothyocyanate conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and the mosquito infectious dose-50% (MID50) was determined.	11475	11777
15461822	T. amboinensis were inoculated intrathoracically with a 0.2 ul dose containing serial ten-fold dilutions of virus and incubated for 14 days.	11778	11918
15461822	Head preparations were made and antigen visualized as described above.	11919	11989
15461822	A full-length cDNA clone, p2, was constructed that matched the genomic consensus sequence of the American genotype DEN-2 isolate, Tonga/74, with the exception of translationally-silent modifications made to facilitate cloning (Figure 1).	11990	12227
15461822	The previously described Δ30 deletion mutation was incorporated into the p2 cDNA clone to form p2Δ30.	12228	12329
15461822	The rDEN-2 virus was recovered in C6/36 and Vero cells, but the presence of the Δ30 mutation limited recovery to only C6/36 cells.	12330	12460
15461822	After passage in Vero cells, adaptation mutations were identified by sequence analysis as had been described for other DEN viruses.	12461	12592
15461822	Both rDEN-2 and rDEN2Δ30 viruses accumulated a single nucleotide change in NS4B at nt 7169 encoding a Val→Ala change at amino acid position 115 as has been observed for rDEN-3 (Table 1).	12593	12779
15461822	The same nucleotide change was previously reported to occur at the homologous site following passage of DEN-4 in Vero cells resulting in a Leu→Ser change (Table 1).	12780	12944
15461822	Inclusion of the 7169 mutation into the p2Δ30 cDNA permitted recovery in both C6/36 and Vero cells (data not shown).	12945	13061
15461822	The rDEN2Δ30 virus reached a virus titer of 6.6 log10PFU/ml in Vero cells.	13062	13136
15461822	As an initial evaluation of replication of the DEN-2 Tonga/74 virus and the rDEN-2 viruses, replication in SCID mice transplanted with HuH-7 human hepatoma cells (SCID-HuH-7 mice) was tested.	13137	13328
15461822	Wild-type viruses from each DEN serotype have been shown to replicate to approximately 6.0 log10PFU/ml serum in SCID-HuH-7 mice, and an att phenotype in SCID-HuH-7 mice has been shown to be a predictor of reduced replication in rhesus monkeys.	13329	13572
15461822	The parent DEN-2 Tonga/74 virus replicated efficiently in SCID-HuH-7 mice and reached a mean titer in serum of 5.9 log10PFU/ml (Table 2) similar to that previously observed with the DEN-2 New Guinea C (NGC) prototype strain.	13573	13797
15461822	The rDEN-2 virus replicated to the same level as the wild-type isolate, while rDEN2Δ30 was 10-fold restricted in replication.	13798	13923
15461822	This reduction was statistically significant (Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test; P < 0.05), and was similar to that observed for the well-characterized rDEN4Δ30 virus.	13924	14084
15461822	The DEN-2 viruses were evaluated for infectivity of Aedes aegypti fed on an infectious bloodmeal (oral infectivity only) and for Toxorynchites amboinensis inoculated intrathoracically (Table 3).	14085	14279
15461822	At the doses tested neither DEN-2, rDEN-2, or rDEN2Δ30 were detected in the midgut or head of A. aegypti mosquitoes which had fed on an infectious bloodmeal 21 days earlier.	14280	14453
15461822	The inability to infect the midgut led to a lack of infection in the head tissue.	14454	14535
15461822	This indicates that the DEN-2 Tonga/74 viruses are poorly infectious for A. aegypti mosquitoes by oral infectivity, as has been demonstrated for multiple DEN-2 viruses of the American genotype.	14536	14729
15461822	In contrast the DEN-2 NGC prototype strain, an Asian genotype member, was highly infectious in A. aegypti mosquitoes when tested previously but it was not included here as a concurrent control.	14730	14923
15461822	The defect in rDEN-2 infectivity for A. aegypti was further investigated by directly inoculating the same virus stocks intrathoracically into T. amboinensis and measuring the ability of the viruses to infect the head tissues.	14924	15149
15461822	Both rDEN-2 and rDEN2Δ30 were highly infectious by intrathoracic inoculation (Table 3).	15150	15237
15461822	The Δ30 mutation did not alter the infectivity of rDEN-2 following intrathoracic inoculation, a property also previously observed for DEN-1, -3 and -4.	15238	15389
15461822	These results indicate that the lack of infectivity for A. aegypti was likely caused by the inability of the DEN-2 Tonga/74 viruses to establish a midgut infection and that the viruses retained the ability to infect head tissues.	15390	15619
15461822	The replication (viremia), immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the DEN-2 viruses in monkeys were studied.	15620	15732
15461822	Monkeys inoculated with the DEN-2 Tonga/74 wild-type isolate were viremic for an average of 4.5 days with a mean peak titer of 2.1 log10PFU/ml (Table 4).	15733	15886
15461822	Inoculation with rDEN-2 resulted in detectable viremia for 4.0 days with a mean peak titer of 1.9 log10PFU/ml.	15887	15997
15461822	While the levels of rDEN2Δ30 replication (2.8 days viremia; mean peak titer of 1.7 log10PFU/ml) were lower than DEN-2 and rDEN-2, the differences were not as dramatic as had been observed for rDEN1Δ30 and rDEN4Δ30 when compared to their parent viruses.	15998	16250
15461822	The level of neutralizing antibodies induced by the rDEN2Δ30 virus was also less than that induced by the wild-type DEN-2 viruses, a finding consistent with the decreased replication exhibited by this vaccine candidate.	16251	16470
15461822	Therefore, by three quantitative measures, duration and peak titer of viremia and the level of neutralizing antibodies induced, rDEN2Δ30 appeared to be attenuated when compared to DEN-2 Tonga/74.	16471	16666
15461822	When vaccinated monkeys were challenged with DEN-2 Tonga/74, all monkeys were protected, as indicated by the lack of viremia (Table 4).	16667	16802
15461822	Based on the limited attenuation conferred upon rDEN-2 by the Δ30 mutation in rhesus monkeys, we sought to construct a further attenuated derivative of rDEN2Δ30.	16803	16964
15461822	To further attenuate rDEN2Δ30, an att mutation that has been characterized in another DEN serotype was imported into a homologous region in DEN-2.	16965	17111
15461822	One such mutation, the 4995 mutation in DEN-4 NS3 at amino acid 158 (Ser→Leu), was previously incorporated into the DEN-4 vaccine candidate, rDEN4Δ30, and found to further attenuate the virus for SCID-HuH-7 mice and rhesus monkeys.	17112	17343
15461822	Site directed mutagenesis was used to introduce a Ser→Leu mutation at amino acid 158 of NS3 in rDEN2Δ30-7169, and the rDEN2Δ30-4995 virus was recovered in C6/36 cells and propagated in Vero cells reaching a virus titer of 6.2 log10PFU/ml (Table 1).	17344	17592
15461822	Importantly, the resulting Leu codon would require two nucleotide changes to revert to one of the six odons encoding a Ser residue.	17593	17724
15461822	Replication in the SCID-HuH-7 mouse model was used as an initial assessment of the rDEN2Δ30-4995 virus phenotype.	17725	17838
15461822	Table 5 includes results from three separate experiments (including those from Table 1) and confirms the approximate 10-fold reduction in replication conferred by the Δ30 mutation upon rDEN-2 replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice.	17839	18062
15461822	The rDEN2Δ30-4995 virus had a mean peak virus titer of 4.6 log10PFU/ml which was only a modest reduction from that of rDEN2Δ30, 5.2 log10PFU/ml.	18063	18207
15461822	However, comparison of a large number of samples indicated that the reduction in virus titer conferred by the NS3 4995 mutation upon rDEN2Δ30 was statistically significant (rDEN2Δ30-4995 versus rDEN2Δ30; Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test; P < 0.05).	18208	18450
15461822	The virus titer of rDEN2Δ30-4995 virus in SCID-HuH-7 mice was over 60-fold reduced from that of the rDEN-2 parent virus.	18451	18571
15461822	Development of a live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine has been complicated by two major factors.	18572	18674
15461822	First, monovalent vaccine candidates that exhibit a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity have been difficult to identify.	18675	18819
15461822	Second, satisfactorily attenuated tetravalent vaccine formulations that induce a broad neutralizing antibody response against each of the four DEN serotypes have been difficult to develop.	18820	19008
15461822	For these reasons, we have sought to develop multiple vaccine candidates for each DEN serotype to increase the likelihood that a vaccine with a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity will be identified.	19009	19232
15461822	To produce a live-attenuated DEN-2 vaccine candidate, we previously generated an antigenic chimeric virus, rDEN2/4Δ30, expressing the M and E structural genes of the DEN-2 NGC strain on the attenuated rDEN4Δ30 background.	19233	19454
15461822	The vaccine candidates described in the present study, rDEN2Δ30 and rDEN2Δ30-4995, could serve as alternates to this antigenic chimeric virus if evaluation of the rDEN2/4Δ30 virus in humans, either as a monovalent vaccine or as a component of a tetravalent vaccine, indicates that it lacks a balance between attenuation and immunogenicity.	19455	19794
15461822	It was hoped that each of the four components of a tetravalent vaccine, consisting of DEN-1, -2, -3, and -4 wild type viruses, each with the common 30 nucleotide deletion mutation in the 3' UTR, would exhibit a similar level of attenuation in animal models.	19795	20052
15461822	Unfortunately, the level of attenuation conferred by the Δ30 mutation upon each of the four serotypes has proven to be variable.	20053	20181
15461822	In rhesus monkeys, the rDEN2Δ30 virus appears to have an intermediate attenuation phenotype in between that of the attenuated rDEN1Δ30 and rDEN4Δ30 and the non-attenuated rDEN3Δ30.	20182	20362
15461822	Although rDEN2Δ30 was slightly attenuated compared to its DEN-2 parent virus in rhesus monkeys, the reduction in replication was less than that of rDEN1Δ30 and rDEN4Δ30.	20363	20532
15461822	While the latter two viruses had detectable viremia in only 50% of monkeys, a mean number of viremic days of less than one day, and a mean peak viremia of less than 1.0 log10PFU/ml, the rDEN2Δ30 virus infected 100% of the rhesus monkeys and reached a peak virus titer of 1.7 log10PFU/ml.	20533	20820
15461822	However, the 10-fold reduction of replication of rDEN4Δ30 and rDEN2Δ30 in SCID-HuH-7 mice, compared to that of their respective wild type parents, was similar.	20821	20980
15461822	To date, rDEN4Δ30 is the only Δ30 vaccine candidate that has been tested in humans, and it was found to be both safe and immunogenic.	20981	21114
15461822	If the level of attenuation in SCID-HuH-7 mice serves as a better guide to attenuation in humans, rDEN2Δ30 might be satisfactorily attenuated in humans since its level of attenuation for SCID-HuH-7 mice and that of the rDEN4Δ30 vaccine candidate are comparable.	21115	21376
15461822	To construct a further attenuated derivative of rDEN2Δ30, the 4995 mutation present in the NS3 gene of DEN-4 at amino acid 158 (Ser→Leu) was introduced into the homologous region of the NS3 protein of rDEN2Δ30.	21377	21587
15461822	Although the 4995 mutation results in a single amino acid change and thus may be susceptible to reversion, the mutant leucine codon selected for insertion into rDEN2Δ30-4995 would require two nucleotide changes to revert to a serine codon.	21588	21827
15461822	Introduction of the 4995 mutation into rDEN4Δ30 resulted in a 100-fold greater reduction of replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice.	21828	21951
15461822	In rDEN2Δ30, its introduction resulted in nearly a 10-fold reduction in virus titer, a smaller but still statistically significant reduction.	21952	22093
15461822	These results provide a second example of the difficulty in predicting the precise level of attenuation following import of an attenuating mutation into a different DEN serotype.	22094	22272
15461822	Nevertheless, the rDEN2Δ30-4995 vaccine candidate is more attenuated than its rDEN2Δ30 parent and warrants evaluation in rhesus monkeys and humans.	22273	22420
15461822	Epidemiologic and molecular pathogenesis studies of DEN-2 strains support the concept that the DEN-2 Tonga/74 virus, from which the vaccine candidates were derived, may naturally have a lower level of virulence than other DEN-2 viruses.	22421	22657
15461822	If the DEN-2 Tonga/74 parent virus is naturally attenuated to some degree, only a small incremental increase in attenuation might be required to satisfactorily attenuate it for humans.	22658	22842
15461822	Gubler et al. investigated the 1974 outbreak of DEN-2 infection in the Pacific island of Tonga.	22843	22938
15461822	In comparison to a subsequent DEN-1 outbreak, the 1974 DEN-2 outbreak was distinguished by mild disease with few hemorrhagic sequelae, low viremia, and an overall slow spread of virus infection.	22939	23133
15461822	The weak DEN-2 outbreak was proposed to be a result of the circulation of a strain with an inherently low level of virulence.	23134	23259
15461822	Since the Tonga/74 outbreak, additional evidence has emerged that supports the suggestion that there are at least two circulating lineages of DEN-2 viruses that differ in virulence.	23260	23441
15461822	The DEN-2 Tonga/74 virus is a member of the DEN-2 American genotype, which as a group appear to possess lower virulence than that of the Asian genotype of DEN-2 viruses.	23442	23611
15461822	Despite the presence of the American DEN-2 genotype viruses and limited co-circulation of DEN-1 and DEN-3 viruses in the Americas in the 1960s and 1970s, the first major epidemic of DHF/DSS in the Americas occurred only after the introduction of a DEN-2 Asian genotype virus in 1981.	23612	23895
15461822	It was thought that genetic differences might have contributed to this difference in virulence and evidence to this effect has been forthcoming.	23896	24040
15461822	Rico-Hesse and colleagues have defined genetic elements within the genome of DEN-2 American genotype viruses which distinguish them from members of the Asian genotype.	24041	24208
15461822	In addition, using chimeric rDEN-2 American/Asian viruses, introduction of three genetic elements (a point mutation in the E gene, the 5' UTR, and the 3' UTR) of the American genotype was found to confer reduced virus replication in dendritic cells and monocytes upon an Asian genotype rDEN-2.	24209	24502
15461822	The Tonga/74 virus shares each of these three attenuating genetic determinants specific to the American genotype, which provides a possible explanation for its lower virulence in humans.	24503	24689
15461822	The rDEN2Δ30 vaccine candidate, whose parent is the DEN-2 Tonga/74 American genotype virus, thus contains naturally occurring and experimentally introduced attenuating mutations.	24690	24868
15461822	Thus, the small incremental increase in attenuation provided by the Δ30, with or without the 4995 mutation, might prove to satisfactorily attenuate the DEN-2 Tonga/74 for humans.	24869	25047
15461822	The American genotype DEN-2 viruses exhibit decreased infectivity for Aedes mosquitoes in comparison to Asian DEN-2 viruses.	25048	25172
15461822	Consistent with these observations, the wild type New Guinea C Asian DEN2 virus was highly infectious for Aedes mosquitoes in our laboratory whereas the Tonga/74 American genotype virus was poorly infectious by the oral route (present study).	25173	25415
15461822	In fact, the increased prevalence of DEN-2 viruses of the Asian genotype in the Americas has been suggested to be a result of their enhanced transmission.	25416	25570
15461822	However, the active circulation of American genotype viruses over many decades indicates that mosquito transmission does occur and large epidemics have been associated with viruses of this genotype.	25571	25769
15461822	At the doses tested, neither the DEN-2 Tonga/74 isolate nor the recombinant viruses were found to infect the midgut or head of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes fed an infectious blood meal.	25770	25951
15461822	Since rDEN-2 and rDEN2Δ30 viruses were infectious by intrathoracic inoculation of Toxorynchites mosquitoes, the lack of infectivity for A. aegypti was likely caused solely by the inability of the DEN-2 Tonga/74 viruses to establish a midgut infection.	25952	26203
15461822	Decreased infectivity for Aedes mosquitoes could serve to help limit transmission of the vaccine virus.	26204	26307
15461822	The live-attenuated DEN-2 virus candidates described here, rDEN2Δ30 and rDEN2Δ30-4995, have several properties desired in a live attenuated virus vaccine for humans.	26308	26473
15461822	First, both viruses reached a titer over 6.0 log10PFU/ml in Vero cells that would permit economical manufacture.	26474	26586
15461822	Second, the viruses are derived from the DEN-2 Tonga/74 strain, a member of the American genotype, which has been associated with decreased virulence.	26587	26737
15461822	Third, rDEN2Δ30 was attenuated for replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice and slightly attenuated for rhesus monkeys while inducing a protective neutralizing antibody response.	26738	26906
15461822	Fourth, rDEN2Δ30-4995 was more attenuated in SCID-HuH-7 mice than rDEN2Δ30.	26907	26982
15461822	Fifth, the DEN-2 Tonga/74 strain, like other members of the American genotype, is poorly infectious for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which would help to limit uncontrolled transmission of the vaccine virus.	26983	27185
16412238	Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), a genetically heterogeneous condition with at least three subtypes, is considered to be a monogenic model of the common "metabolic syndrome".	0	194
16412238	FPLD subtype 2 (FPLD2, MIM 151660) results from mutations in nuclear lamin A/C encoded by LMNA (MIM 151330), and FPLD subtype 3 (FPLD3, MIM 604367) results from mutations in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ encoded by PPARG (MIM 601487).	195	444
16412238	The FPLD phenotype is characterized by redistribution of fat stores – lipoatrophy of extremities and gluteal region often with lipohypertrophy involving the face and in central/visceral adipose stores – together with clinical metabolic disturbances such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes.	445	744
16412238	Careful phenotypic – or "phenomic" – analysis suggested that fat redistribution is more extreme in FPLD2 compared to FPLD3, but that metabolic disturbances are greater in FPLD3 compared to FPLD2.	745	940
16412238	Thus, fat loss is probably a key mechanism that contributes to the development of metabolic complications in both FPLD subtypes, but the more severe clinical features in FPLD3 suggest that PPARG mutations may have additional direct effects.	941	1181
16412238	Indeed, an independent direct effect of the dominant negative human PPARG P467L mutation – induction of hypertension – was recently demonstrated in an animal model.	1182	1346
16412238	Certain PPARG missense mutations in FPLD3 – such as V290M and P467L – appear to act through a dominant negative mechanism, in which the mutant allele product is expressed and then interferes with the function of the product of the wild-type allele, resulting in markedly depressed net receptor activity.	1347	1650
16412238	In contrast, the heterozygous PPARG missense mutation F388L in FPLD3 does not act through a dominant negative mechanism; it appears simply to have diminished transactivation capacity, with no obvious effect on the wild-type allele product, resulting in effective "haploinsufficiency" from depressed but not absent receptor activity.	1651	1983
16412238	Furthermore, the recently described heterozygous PPARG -14A>G promoter variant in FPLD3 is associated with no coding sequence change, and only a simple reduction in promoter activity, again suggesting that haploinsufficiency but not complete deficiency of PPAR-γ activity as the basis of disease among affected heterozygotes.	1984	2309
16412238	We now present a Canadian FPLD3 family with a novel PPARG nonsense mutation whose disease mechanism appears to be haploinsufficiency rather than dominant negative.	2310	2473
16412238	The study received approval from the University of Western Ontario Ethics Review Panel (protocol 07920E) and all subjects gave informed consent to participate.	2474	2633
16412238	DNA sequencing initially showed no mutation in LMNA.	2634	2686
16412238	We amplified and sequenced the 6 exons of PPARG plus >100 nucleotides at each intron-exon boundary, and ~700 bp of the promoter.	2687	2815
16412238	Rapid, allele-specific genotyping methods were then developed for each mutation.	2816	2896
16412238	For the Y355X mutation genotype, we amplified the 603 bp fragment containing exon 5 using primers 5' TTC ACT GTG AGT TAG AAA TC and 3' CAA TGC AGA CTA ACA CTA AGG.	2897	3060
16412238	This was followed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose, gel purification and ddNTP extension (SnaPShot, PE Applied Biosystems, Mississauga, ON) with primer 5' AAG AGC CTG CGA AAG CCT TT, and analysis on a Prism 377 DNA Sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Mississauga, ON).	3061	3327
16412238	Genomic DNA from 260 healthy Caucasian subjects was studied, permitting 95% power to exclude a mutation frequency ≥1% in the healthy population (two-tailed alpha<0.05).	3328	3496
16412238	A cDNA encoding full-length human PPARγ1 was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).	3497	3633
16412238	The Y355X mutation was introduced into this clone using the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by changing the tyrosine codon (TAC) to a stop codon TAG.	3634	3807
16412238	Both the wild-type (WT) and mutant clones were fully sequenced.	3808	3871
16412238	Initial experiments demonstrated that transfection of the Y355X PPARγ clone resulted in the production of a small amount of full-length PPARγ protein, presumably generated by inefficient translation termination at the 355X stop codon.	3872	4106
16412238	To eliminate this contaminating wild-type PPARγ, which would compromise interpretation of results, a second construct was generated in which all of the PPARγ sequences down-stream of the 355X codon were deleted from the plasmid.	4107	4335
16412238	All of the transcription assays were carried out with this construct.	4336	4405
16412238	For transcription assays, NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in 96-well plates (5.5 × 103 cells/well) in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum.	4406	4540
16412238	Cells were transfected with the either WT or Y355X mutant PPARγ expression plasmid, 1 ng of a β-galactosidase control plasmid and 35 ng of the PPAR-dependent luciferase reporter pFATP-Luc (three copies of the mouse FATP gene PPRE inserted upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter).	4541	4831
16412238	Cells were transfected for 4 h with Lipofectamine-plus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then treated with DMSO or the indicated amount of rosiglitazone for 16 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured in cell extracts using the Dual-light assay system (ABI, Foster City, CA) and a 96-well luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany).	4832	5194
16412238	Transfections were performed in triplicate.	5195	5238
16412238	To examine protein expression of PPARγ, a FLAG epitope tag was added to the N-termini of WT and Y355X cDNAs and both were transferred into the eukaryotic expression vector pTRE-shuttle2 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA).	5239	5466
16412238	NIH3T3 cells (1.0 × 106 cells/well of a 6-well plate) were transfected with the indicated amounts of PPARγ expression plasmid, and 1 ng of a cyan fluorescent protein-expressing plasmid pECFP-N1 as a control.	5467	5674
16412238	After 20 h, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in a buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 30 mM NaF and 1 mM Na3VO4.	5675	5870
16412238	Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis.	5871	6007
16412238	Western blots were performed by using monoclonal anti-FLAG-M2-peroxidase (HRP) conjugated antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).	6008	6130
16412238	Subject II-5 (Figure 1).	6131	6155
16412238	A 45 year-old woman was referred for severe hypertriglyceridemia with relapsing pancreatitis.	6156	6249
16412238	She had noted muscular legs and lower arms beginning in adolescence.	6250	6318
16412238	Menarche was at age 12 and periods were regular.	6319	6367
16412238	Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia were diagnosed during her third pregnancy at age 33.	6368	6470
16412238	Diabetes was treated with oral agents alone until age 40 when insulin was added.	6471	6551
16412238	Control of both glycemia and hypertriglyceridemia has been difficult, with triglycerides >100 mmol/L at times and recurrent eruptive xanthomata and pancreatitis.	6552	6713
16412238	A five-month trial of pioglitazone 15 mg daily resulted in a decrease in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from 12.1 to 7.6%, and in triglycerides from 66.4 to 7.3 mmol/L, but this was later discontinued due to fluid retention.	6714	6936
16412238	She had no history of hypertension.	6937	6972
16412238	Physical examination revealed normal blood pressure, BMI 30 kg/m2, waist circumference 90 cm, and small eruptive xanthomata over her elbows.	6973	7113
16412238	Subcutaneous fat was markedly diminished in her arms below the distal humerus and in her buttocks, thighs, and calves, with prominent arm and leg musculature.	7114	7272
16412238	Facial, neck, suprascapular and abdominal fat distribution was normal.	7273	7343
16412238	She had no buffalo hump, acanthosis nigricans or phlebectasia.	7344	7406
16412238	Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged fatty liver and enlarged spleen.	7407	7479
16412238	Dual X-ray absorptiometry scan revealed total body fat of 19.9% (within the normal female range), but with decreased fat on the limbs, particularly the legs at 14%.	7480	7644
16412238	Figure 2 shows a computed tomographic scan of the legs of the proband and a normal subject; the proband had a relative paucity of fat.	7645	7779
16412238	Measurements in fasting plasma included: glucose 14.4 mmol/L; HbA1c 10.1% (normal 4.3–6.1%); insulin 26.3 mU/L (normal 5.0–20.0); C-peptide 3.69 nmol/L (normal 0.30–1.32).	7780	7951
16412238	Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides were 14.7 and 49.6 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were not determined.	7952	8137
16412238	Serum alanine transaminase was 21 U/L (normal <50 U/L).	8138	8193
16412238	APOE genotype was normal (E3/E3).	8194	8227
16412238	Lipoprotein lipase activity was slightly depressed at 79 nmol/min/ml (normal >90 nmol/min/ml).	8228	8322
16412238	Triglycerides varied between 9.1 and 59.4 mmol/L despite treatment with fenofibrate 200 mg and salmon oil 6 g daily.	8323	8439
16412238	Plasma glucose remained high despite taking >2 U/kg insulin daily and metformin 500 mg TID.	8440	8531
16412238	A five-day trial of octreotide 100 μg TID to ameliorate abdominal pain reduced plasma C-peptide levels to <1 nmol/L and insulin to the normal range, but did not reduce fasting or postprandial glucose levels and produced abdominal bloating.	8532	8771
16412238	Genomic DNA sequence analysis of the LIPE gene encoding lipoprotein lipase showed no mutations.	8772	8867
16412238	Subject III-3 (Figure 1).	8868	8893
16412238	The 12 year-old daughter of subject II-5 was assessed for combined hyperlipidemia.	8894	8976
16412238	She was born at 33 weeks' gestation, during a pregnancy that had been complicated by pre-eclampsia, diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia.	8977	9111
16412238	At age 3 months, she was diagnosed with a patent ductus arteriosus with pulmonary branch stenosis and incomplete right bundle branch block.	9112	9251
16412238	She had poor growth and difficulty feeding as an infant.	9252	9308
16412238	She was first noted to have elevated triglycerides and cholesterol at age 5 that were treated only with dietary advice.	9309	9428
16412238	She required several corrective surgeries for strabismus, the most recent at age 12.	9429	9513
16412238	There was no history of pancreatitis or eruptive xanthomata.	9514	9574
16412238	Height and weight at age 12 1/2 years were 153 cm (25–50th percentile for age and sex) and 45.4 kg (50th percentile for age and sex), respectively.	9575	9722
16412238	She had a broad forehead with deep-set eyes, triangular facies and a narrow pointed chin.	9723	9812
16412238	Examination of the chest, heart, and musculoskeletal systems was unremarkable, and there was no acanthosis nigricans or phlebectasia.	9813	9946
16412238	She had a normal distribution of subcutaneous fat, with no loss of fat over the arms, buttocks, or legs, and no increase in face, neck, suprascapular or abdominal fat.	9947	10114
16412238	Measurements in fasting plasma revealed: glucose 5.0 mmol/L; insulin 18.2 mU/L (normal 5.0–20 mU/L); C-peptide 1.64 nmol/L (normal 0.30–1.32 nmol/L); total cholesterol 5.26 mmol/L (normal 3.2–4.4 mmol/L for age), triglycerides 1.79 mmol/L (normal 0.4–1.3 mmol/L); HDL cholesterol 0.92 mmol/L (normal 1.0–1.8 mmol/L); and LDL cholesterol 3.52 (normal 1.6–2.8 mmol/L).	10115	10481
16412238	Subjects II-5 and III-3 were each found to be heterozygous for a nonsense mutation (single nucleotide base change), that predicted a premature termination signal rather than the wild-type (WT) tyrosine at codon 355 (Figure 3).	10482	10708
16412238	This mutation was absent from 5 non-FPLD3 first-degree relatives of subject II-5 (namely subjects I-2, II-2, II-4, III-1 and III-2).	10709	10841
16412238	The mutation was absent from the genomes of 260 healthy control subjects.	10842	10915
16412238	To establish experimental conditions that generated equal amounts of the Y355X mutation, epitope-tagged versions of the WT and mutant PPARγ clones were transfected into NIH3T3 cells.	10916	11098
16412238	Western analysis of extracts from these cells demonstrated that much less Y355X mutant protein was produced from the same amount of transfected DNA suggesting that the mutant receptor was significantly less stable than the wild-type receptor (Figure 4A).	11099	11353
16412238	Approximately 15 times more Y355X than wild-type DNA was needed to generate equal amounts of the two PPARγ proteins.	11354	11470
16412238	Using these conditions, the transcriptional activity of the Y355X PPARγ mutant was assessed by transient transfection of (non-epitope tagged) PPARγ expressing plasmids into NIH3T3 cells and measuring luciferase activity from a PPAR responsive reporter.	11471	11723
16412238	Under these conditions the Y355X mutation did not display any transcriptional activity at any dose of the ligand rosiglitazone (Figure 4B).	11724	11863
16412238	To determine if the Y355X receptor had dominant-negative activity against WT PPARγ, a mixing experiment was performed in which WT and mutant receptors were co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells.	11864	12053
16412238	In the absence of ligand, the transcriptional activity of the combination of 1 ng of WT and 15 ng of Y355X DNA (equal protein amounts) was similar to 1 ng of WT receptor alone (Figure 5A).	12054	12242
16412238	Likewise, in the presence of a saturating amount of ligand, the presence of an equal amount of Y355X protein did not reduce the activity of co-transfected WT PPARγ.	12243	12407
16412238	These results indicate that the Y355X mutation does not have dominant-negative activity against the WT receptor.	12408	12520
16412238	This was confirmed by further mixing experiments in which an increasing amount of mutant or WT receptor was mixed with a fixed amount of WT PPARγ (Figure 5B).	12521	12679
16412238	While increasing the amount of the wild-type receptor caused a dose dependent increase in transcriptional activity (Figure 5B, open bars), the addition of increasing amounts of Y355X PPARγ to a fixed amount of wild-type receptor had no significant effect on transcription (Figure 5B, filled bars).	12680	12977
16412238	For comparison, the same experiment was conducted with a PPARγ mutation (V290M) that has been previously shown to have dominant-negative activity.	12978	13124
16412238	Increasing amounts of V290M PPARγ caused a dose-dependent decrease in wild-type PPARγ transcriptional activity in this assay (Figure 5B, grey bars).	13125	13273
16412238	Thus, PPARγ receptors bearing the Y355X mutation do not possess any dominant-negative activity against the wild-type PPARγ receptor The principal novel findings of this study are: 1) identification of a novel human PPARG nonsense mutation, namely Y355X; 2) demonstration that heterozygosity for Y355X is associated with partial lipodystrophy and metabolic disturbances consistent with the FPLD3 phenotype; and 3) evidence that the mechanism underlying the disease association in affected heterozygotes is haploinsufficiency rather than dominant negative interference of the function of the normal allele product.	13274	13886
16412238	The Y355X mutation caused the complete inactivation of PPARγ transcriptional activity and reduced the stability of the PPARγ protein.	13887	14020
16412238	The Y355X nonsense mutation almost certainly creates haploinsufficiency – a quantitative deficiency – for PPARγ in affected FPLD3 subjects.	14021	14160
16412238	PPARG Y355X (present in two FPLD3 subjects) encodes a protein that is truncated by ~30% and shows no transcriptional activity.	14161	14287
16412238	Furthermore, the Y355X mutant receptor clearly does not display dominant-negative activity against WT receptor in transfection assays.	14288	14422
16412238	The likelihood that this lack of dominant-negative activity reflects the in vivo situation is supported by the observation that the adult proband with Y355X had a beneficial response to an average pharmacological dose of the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone.	14423	14679
16412238	Given the specificity of this ligand for PPARγ, this observation suggests that there is no interference of the normal allele product.	14680	14813
16412238	The in vitro results also indicate that the Y355X mutation significantly reduces the stability of the receptor, making it likely that cells with one wild-type and one Y355X allele (as occurs in these patients), would contain significantly less mutant receptor compared to the wild-type protein.	14814	15108
16412238	Together, these findings strongly suggest that the PPARG Y355X mutation acts via a haploinsufficiency mechanism.	15109	15221
16412238	The findings extend the range of heterozygous PPARG mutations seen in FPLD3.	15222	15298
16412238	Currently, most heterozygous PPARG mutations (3/6 total heterozygous mutations, namely -14A>G, F388L and Y355X) from most affected subjects (8/12 total FPLD3 subjects), act via a haploinsufficiency mechanism.	15299	15507
16412238	The PPARG -14A>G mutation within the promoter of the γ4 isoform (present in two FPLD3 subjects) was associated with quantitative loss of expression of the allele product, with no qualitative abnormalities of the encoded protein.	15508	15736
16412238	PPARG F388L (present in four FPLD3 subjects), a transactivation-deficient missense mutation, was expressed at normal levels and had no in vitro dominant negative interference with the function of the normal allele.	15737	15951
16412238	The combined LOD score for the linkage of these four heterozygous PPARG haploinsufficiency mutations with the FPLD3 phenotype in the three kindreds is 3.0 (maximum at 0% recombination), providing additional human genetic evidence for causation.	15952	16196
16412238	Only two heterozygous germline PPARG mutations in FPLD3, namely P467L (present in two FPLD3 subjects) and V290M (present in one FPLD3 subject), were shown by convincing in vitro studies to act through a dominant negative mechanism.	16197	16428
16412238	The PPARG R425C mutation (present only in one FPLD3 subject) has not yet been functionally assessed in vitro.	16429	16538
16412238	Another nonsense mutation in PPARG, namely A553ΔAAATfs185, did not show dominant negative interference of the WT allele, and carriers of this mutation did not have FPLD3, but simple insulin resistance, which required double heterozygosity with a truncation mutation in PPP1R3A for clinical expression.	16539	16840
16412238	Yet another PPARG missense mutation, R115Q, was found in obese subjects without FPLD3; it had defective phosphorylation of serine at position 114 and an apparent gain of function resulting in accelerated differentiation of pre-adipocytes.	16841	17079
16412238	The PPARG mutations in subjects without FPLD3 indicate the complexity of the relationship between mutations in this gene and clinical phenotypes, such as phenotype differences related to differences in functional impact, and the requirement for interactions with other genes before a phenotype is expressed.	17080	17387
16412238	The presence of a metabolic phenotype without loss of subcutaneous fat in the pre-pubescent carrier of Y355X suggests either some variation in penetrance of PPARG mutations, or some influence of other genes activated in puberty that may affect the expression of the Y355X mutation.	17388	17669
16412238	How might a quantitative relative loss-of-function mutation in one PPARG allele contribute to adipose repartitioning and insulin resistance in FPLD3?	17670	17819
16412238	Quantitative increases in activity as induced by pharmacological PPAR agonism can enhance insulin sensitivity and anabolically influence adipose tissue.	17820	17972
16412238	But heterozygous PPARγ-deficient mice in which one allele has been deleted seem to be less insulin resistant than their WT littermates.	17973	18108
16412238	This suggests that an additional mechanism or stress may be required to produce insulin resistance in human homologues of these animals.	18109	18245
16412238	A simple quantitative genetic deficiency of PPARγ might compromise the ability of heterozygotes to express sufficient PPARγ, perhaps creating a bottleneck at key stages of adipose differentiation during development and adolescence.	18246	18477
16412238	In contrast to other direct effects of PPARG mutations on other pathways and targets, a simple reduction in functional activity resulting from the -14A>G, F388L and Y355X mutations may be sufficient to produce a clinical phenotype.	18478	18709
16412238	Interestingly, both subjects ascertained here were females.	18710	18769
16412238	Observations from the small numbers of PPARγ-deficient individuals indicate that females may be more severely affected than males.	18770	18900
16412238	Similar, between-sex differences in phenotype severity were noted in FPLD2 due to mutant LMNA.	18901	18995
16412238	But the anecdotal nature of the between-sex differences in phenotypic severity in PPARγ-deficiency and in partial lipodystrophy precludes speculation regarding potential mechanisms.	18996	19177
16412238	Ascertainment of additional subjects and families and specific physiological studies are required.	19178	19276
16412238	In summary, we have found a rare nonsense mutation causing reduced expression of PPARγ in a proband with FPLD3.	19277	19388
16412238	The findings in this Canadian kindred extend the range of PPARG mutations in FPLD3 and especially those that likely operate through a haploinsufficiency mechanism.	19389	19552
18385794	Anophthalmia (an absence of eye structures) and/or microphthalmia (an abnormally small eye) are rare disorders with a prevalence of 0.2–0.4 per 10,000 births in developed countries.	0	181
18385794	One or both eyes are affected in isolation or as part of other birth defects.	182	259
18385794	The disease exhibits diverse patterns of genetic inheritance, and the severity is variable due to the genetic heterogeneity of the ocular malformation.	260	411
18385794	Mutations in several human genes are associated with anophthalmia and microphthalmia.	412	497
18385794	Among them, mutations in SOX2 appear to account for most cases.	498	561
18385794	SOX2, which is located at chromosome 3q26.3-q27, encodes 317 amino acids that belong to the high-mobility-group (HMG) DNA-binding protein family.	562	707
18385794	Expressed in embryonic stem cells and a wide variety of tissues during early development, SOX2 plays an important role in cell differentiation and early organogenesis.	708	875
18385794	In ocular tissues, the inhibition of SOX2 expression in the developing Xenopus retina has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and allows cells to develop into non-neuronal cell types.	876	1063
18385794	Working in concert with PAX6, SOX2 regulates downstream target genes such as the crystalline genes to guide early lens development.	1064	1195
18385794	Mutations in SOX2 account for approximately 10% of anophthalmia and microphthalmia cases.	1196	1285
18385794	Previously reported cases of anophthalmia and microphthalmia were associated with SOX2 whole-gene deletions or coding sequence mutations.	1286	1423
18385794	In this study, a cohort of 34 anophthalmia/microphthalmia patients was screened for mutations in SOX2.	1424	1526
18385794	Two novel heterozygous mutations and two sequence variants (one novel, one known SNP) were identified in 6 (two siblings) out of 34 patients.	1527	1668
18385794	This confirms the importance of SOX2 mutation screening in patients with anophthalmia/microphthalmia.	1669	1770
18385794	In screening unaffected family members, we also found an individual with a pathogenic allele suggesting the novel finding that autosomal dominant SOX2 mutations can be non-penetrant.	1771	1953
18385794	As part of our large scale screening campaign, mutation analysis of CHX10 was also performed.	1954	2047
18385794	The homeodomain protein CHX10 has been shown to be essential for ocular development, and autosomal recessive mutations of the gene have been implicated in microphthalmia in both humans and mice.	2048	2242
18385794	Screening of the same cohort of anophthalmia/microphthalmia patients identified two synonymous sequence variants in exon 3 and one non-synonymous sequence variant in exon 5.	2243	2416
18385794	This non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in normal controls.	2417	2486
18385794	We did not find sequence variants in other exons of CHX10, suggesting that CHX10 mutations are less frequent in patients with anophthalmia.	2487	2626
18385794	To identify existing and potentially novel mutations of SOX2 and CHX10 in a cohort of anophthalmia and microphthalmia patients, we undertook a candidate gene screening approach.	2627	2804
18385794	We screened 34 affected individuals (two sets of siblings), five unaffected family members, and 80 healthy controls.	2805	2921
18385794	Patient demographics are summarized in Appendix 1.	2922	2972
18385794	The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subject Research at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and at the Albert Einstein Medical Center.	2973	3142
18385794	The study also conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.	3143	3213
18385794	Informed consent was obtained from all subjects whose blood and DNA samples were used in the analysis.	3214	3316
18385794	Peripheral blood samples (10–20 ml) were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted using the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN).	3317	3470
18385794	Conformation-sensitive-gel-electrophoresis (CSGE) was used for initial SOX2 and CHX10 gene screenings.	3471	3573
18385794	Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on genomic DNA of affected patients, unaffected relatives, and healthy controls to amplify SOX2 and CHX10 exonic sequences (primer sets are available upon request).	3574	3793
18385794	An additional 120 base pairs of intronic sequences at both the 5′-end and 3′-end were also included.	3794	3894
18385794	PCR amplification was performed in a reaction volume of 25 μl containing 50 ng of genomic DNA, 200 μM dNTP, 0.4 μM of each primer pair, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1X PCR buffer, 1X Q-solution, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).	3895	4131
18385794	A single annealing temperature of 55 °C was used for all primers.	4132	4197
18385794	PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel for detection of heteroduplexes and homoduplexes.	4198	4322
18385794	Patient samples containing heteroduplexes were selected for sequence analysis.	4323	4401
18385794	Base pair changes in SOX2 and CHX10 were confirmed by sequencing bidirectionally in patient samples.	4402	4502
18385794	Of the 34 patients (32 independent probands) analyzed, three (two siblings) showed novel mutations in coding sequence and three had two sequence variants in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of SOX2 (Figure 1 and Table 1).	4503	4724
18385794	Mutation, c.310 G>T (p. Glu104X), found in one patient, was in the region encoding the HMG DNA-binding domain and resulted in a change from glutamic acid to a stop codon.	4725	4895
18385794	The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p. Pro184ArgfsX19) in the region encoding the activation domain, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the coding sequence.	4896	5133
18385794	In addition, a novel nucleotide substitution, c.*557G>A, was identified in the 3′-untranslated region in one patient, and a known single nucleotide polymorphism (c. *469 C>A, SNP rs11915160) was also detected in 2 out of 34 patients (Appendix 1).	5134	5380
18385794	Patient 40A is an eight-year-old child with bilateral anophthalmia.	5381	5448
18385794	Clinical features included dilated ventricles with ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement for hydrocephalus, microcephaly, atrophic optic nerves, chiasm, posterior corpus callosum and splenium, and abnormal electroencephalograms with no overt seizures.	5449	5700
18385794	The patient has short stature and delayed motor and mental development.	5701	5772
18385794	He has an unusual ataxic gait but is independently mobile with a walker.	5773	5845
18385794	He has begun to speak in three to four word sentences.	5846	5900
18385794	The amplified genomic fragments from the patient (40A) showed faster and slower migrating products comparing to that of the wild type observed in samples from the parents (40B and 40C) and normal controls (C1 and C2) with CSGE (Figure 2A).	5901	6140
18385794	The heteroduplexes suggest a mutation in the fragment.	6141	6195
18385794	The genomic DNA from this patient was sequenced bidirectionally.	6196	6260
18385794	Two alleles were identified (Figure 2B), one with a wild type allele and one with a nucleotide substitution at c.310 G>T of the coding sequence, resulting in a nonsense amino acid change (p. Glu104X).	6261	6461
18385794	The predicted shorter peptide is truncated at the end of the HMG domain, which results in the deletion of the entire COOH-terminal activation domain (Figure 2C).	6462	6623
18385794	The mutation, located in the HMG domain, is not directly involved in DNA binding based on NMR-spectroscopy structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).	6624	6774
18385794	Both parents were homozygous for the wild type allele.	6775	6829
18385794	Patient 54A is a nine-year-old child with right anophthalmia and left microphthalmia.	6830	6915
18385794	Her clinical features included a right middle fossa arachnoid cyst and partial absence of the posterior aspect of the corpus callosum including the splenium.	6916	7073
18385794	She had mild hydrocephalus and partial complex seizures.	7074	7130
18385794	Other abnormalities were growth and thyroid hormone deficiency, developmental delays, and a wide-based ataxic gait.	7131	7246
18385794	She also presented with facial asymmetry with a beaked nose, small widely-spaced teeth, and diastasis recti.	7247	7355
18385794	The parents were unaffected.	7356	7384
18385794	CSGE analysis showed three slower migrating product bands in addition to the wild type, indicative of heterozygosity (Figure 3A).	7385	7514
18385794	The affected sibling of the proband (54H), who was diagnosed with bilateral anophthalmia by ultrasound in utero, had two slower migrating bands and the wild type product.	7515	7685
18385794	An amniocentesis was performed, and a chromosome study was that of a normal female with a 46XX karyotype.	7686	7791
18385794	Her birthweight of 8 lbs 15 ounces and length of 52 cm are appropriate for a term infant.	7792	7881
18385794	Her newborn hearing screening test was normal.	7882	7928
18385794	An orbital ultrasound shortly after birth revealed the absence of globe structures bilaterally.	7929	8024
18385794	A head MRI at age of four months showed partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and hypoplasia of the orbits.	8025	8134
18385794	Minimal ocular tissue was noted in the orbit with visualization of the extraocular muscles and lacrimal glands.	8135	8246
18385794	The optic nerves were not visualized.	8247	8284
18385794	The maxillae were hypoplastic.	8285	8315
18385794	At approximately nine months, she began treatment with thyroid supplementation for hypothyroidism.	8316	8414
18385794	She is of a low growth percentile with normal growth hormone levels.	8415	8483
18385794	She had urticaria pigmentosa at 14 months of age.	8484	8533
18385794	At the age of 16 months, she sat without support, rolled, and babbled with consonants and vowels.	8534	8631
18385794	She finger feeds and has no feeding difficulties.	8632	8681
18385794	Her development is delayed but is more advanced than that of her sister, the proband, at the equivalent age.	8682	8790
18385794	The mother has normal vision and an unremarkable ophthalmologic examination.	8791	8867
18385794	She has normal motor abilities and intellect.	8868	8913
18385794	A head MRI scan of the mother was unremarkable.	8914	8961
18385794	Sequence analysis detected two alleles in the proband, the affected sibling, and the clinically normal mother (54B).	8962	9078
18385794	One allele was the wild type sequence and the other was a c.549delC (p.Pro184ArgfsX19) in the coding sequence (Figure 3B).	9079	9201
18385794	The deletion changes the reading frame and results in a premature stop codon 19 amino acids downstream of the deletion site.	9202	9326
18385794	The mutation is predicted to delete part of the COOH-terminal activation domain and to produce a truncated peptide (Figure 3C).	9327	9454
18385794	The father (54C) of the proband was homozygous for the wild type allele.	9455	9527
18385794	Patient 49A is a 17-year-old female with bilateral anophthalmia.	9528	9592
18385794	Her clinical features include a ventricular-septal defect, which resolved without surgical intervention, and fusion of two primary teeth of the left lower jaw.	9593	9752
18385794	She is developmentally normal and is currently applying to four-year colleges.	9753	9831
18385794	The parents were unaffected.	7356	7384
18385794	A heterozygous sequence variant was identified in this individual in the 3′-UTR by CSGE (Figure 4A).	9861	9961
18385794	Sequence analysis detected two alleles, one with a wild type sequence and one with a nucleotide substitution, c.*557G>A (Figure 4B).	9962	10094
18385794	The sequence alteration does not predictably change the SOX2 protein and is not a previously described SNP (dbSNP Build 128).	10095	10220
18385794	A review of transcription factor databases did not uncover known regulatory elements associated with the nucleotide substitution.	10221	10350
18385794	DNA was unavailable from additional unaffected family members of the proband.	10351	10428
18385794	To determine that the above sequence alterations detected in anophthalmia and microphthalmia patients were not single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 80 healthy control individuals were examined by direct sequencing analysis.	10429	10655
18385794	None of the above sequence alterations were found in the normal control subjects.	10656	10737
18385794	During this screening, we also detected SNP c.*469 C>A in 2 out of 34 patients.	10738	10817
18385794	The SNP is a known variant and located at 3′ UTR (SNP rs11915160).	10818	10884
18385794	To evaluate sequence variations in CHX10, the same cohort of patients were screened by CSGE and direct sequencing.	10885	10999
18385794	The majority of sequence variations were detected in exon 3 (Table 2), and the mutations were all synonymous, c.471 C>T (p.Ser157Ser, rs35435463) and c.579 G>A (p. Gln193Gln, novel SNP).	11000	11186
18385794	Another sequence variation was found in exon 5, c.871 G>A (p. Asp291Asn, novel SNP), in one affected individual resulting in a non-synonymous polymorphism.	11187	11342
18385794	Using healthy controls, the same sequence variant was found, suggesting non-causality.	11343	11429
18385794	The present study identified two novel mutations and two sequence variants (one novel, one known SNP) in SOX2 in 6 (two siblings) out of 34 anophthalmia/microphthalmia/ coloboma patients.	11430	11617
18385794	The frequency of mutations in SOX2 in anophthalmia and microphthalmia patients is estimated at 10% for this study, which is consistent with previous reports.	11618	11775
18385794	A mutational analysis of CHX10 of the same cohort of anophthalmia/microphthalmia patients identified two synonymous sequence variants in exon 3 and one non-synonymous sequence variant in exon 5.	11776	11970
18385794	The non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in normal controls, suggesting it is not causative.	11971	12071
18385794	Further sequence analysis of other genes associated with anophthalmia and microphthalmia such as PAX6, BCOR, OTX2, SIX6, and CHD7 is ongoing in this study cohort to determine mutation associations.	12072	12269
18385794	Two mutations, a nonsense mutation and a frameshift mutation, were located in the coding region of SOX2, and both resulted in truncation of the SOX2 protein.	12270	12427
18385794	The shortened protein product may result in loss of function.	12428	12489
18385794	In animal studies, homozygous mice for SOX2 null allele are embryonic lethal and heterozygous mice with one null allele are normal compared to that of the wild type.	12490	12655
18385794	Further reduction of the level of SOX2 expression by deleting a neural cell-specific enhancer on a heterozygous background resulted in reduced viability and neurodegeneration.	12656	12831
18385794	These observations suggest that the abnormal phenotype may become apparent when SOX2 expression falls below a certain threshold, or loss of function in one allele reduces SOX2 expression below that level.	12832	13036
18385794	One of the mutations detected in this study was at the 3′ UTR.	13037	13099
18385794	Although the relationship between the mutation at the 3′-UTR and anophthalmia/ microphthalmia is indeterminate, one possibility is that the nucleotide substitution at c.*557G>A affects SOX2 expression.	13100	13301
18385794	This is supported by the observation that the 3′UTR of SOX2 contains regulatory elements that enhance its transcriptional activity in embryonic stem cells.	13302	13457
18385794	Of interest is the transmission of a SOX2 mutation from an unaffected mother to her two daughters in the example of sibling patients 54A and 54H.	13458	13603
18385794	Gonosomal mosaicism, evidenced by the presence of a mutation in buccal cells but not in white cell-derived DNA, has been reported for SOX2 in an unaffected parent.	13604	13767
18385794	We were able to identify this mutation in genomic DNA derived from white blood cells in the unaffected mother.	13768	13878
18385794	This suggests that this mother may not be mosaic in this circumstance.	13879	13949
18385794	We propose that the anophthalmia phenotype appears to be non-penetrant.	13950	14021
18385794	Non-penetrant mutations have been reported previously in sonic hedgehog (SHH) and in fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR).	14022	14150
18385794	This example underscores the importance of testing seemingly unaffected parents once a mutation is discovered in their offspring regardless of their phenotype and points out that some individuals with a SOX2 mutation may be non-penetrant.	14151	14389
18385794	Our patients with coding region mutations had SOX2 phenotypes consistent with previous studies.	14390	14485
18385794	All patients with mutations had bilateral anophthalmia and unilateral severe microphthalmia (40A, 49A, 54H) with the exception of patient 54A who had unilateral anophthalmia instead of bilateral anophthalmia.	14486	14694
18385794	This suggests that SOX2 mutations cause a more severe disruption of normal eye development and that microphthalmia/anophthalmia are of a spectrum of the same disease.	14695	14861
18385794	The patients with coding sequence mutations (40A, 54A, and 54H) had significant brain abnormalities.	14862	14962
18385794	Patient 40A showed dilated ventricles and microcephaly.	14963	15018
18385794	Patient 54A was diagnosed with a right middle fossa arachnoid cyst and partial absence of posterior aspect of corpus callosum including the splenium.	15019	15168
18385794	Patient 54H, the sibling of patient 54A, had partial agenesis of the corpus callosum.	15169	15254
18385794	Brain structure changes are also consistent with other studies and are supported by murine models of SOX2 deficiency with neurodegeneration and impaired brain neurogenesis.	15255	15427
18385794	Hormonal deficiencies and growth retardation are also important phenotypic associations with SOX2 coding sequence changes (patients 40A, 54A, and 54H).	15428	15579
18385794	Ragge et al. have reported a case of anophthalmia/microphthalmia caused by a frameshift mutation in SOX2 (case 9, c.628delA, p.Met210fs211X).	15580	15721
18385794	The genetic location of that mutation is similar to the proband 54A and her sibling 54H (c.549delC, p.Pro184ArgfsX19) in this study.	15722	15854
18385794	The neurological phenotypes in this study, including brain malformations and seizure activity, were also present in their case.	15855	15982
18385794	Patient 49A with a 3′-UTR mutation had a cardiac ventricular-septal defect with dental anomalies.	15983	16080
18385794	Different forms of craniofacial and dental defects were also noted in some patients with coding region mutations of SOX2 gene.	16081	16207
18385794	Patient 54A (Appendix 1) had facial asymmetry and small, widely spaced teeth.	16208	16285
18385794	One of the patients (case #1) reported by Ragge et al. also showed craniofacial dysmorphisms and widely spaced teeth.	16286	16403
18385794	The SOX2 UTR mutations appear to be associated with severe eye development but are perhaps less likely to manifest with neurological manifestations.	16404	16552
18385794	In conclusion, this study confirms that heterozygous loss of function mutations in SOX2 cause anophthalmia and microphthalmia and represent approximately 10% of patients ascertained for anophthalmia and microphthalmia but may also be non-penetrant.	16553	16801
18385794	Mutations in CHX10 are less frequently found.	16802	16847
18385794	Genetic screening of other candidate genes and the identification of genetic factors influencing SOX2 expression may help to determine the susceptibility of various disease alleles in the occurrence of this severe form of eye malformation and also help to identify factors that may influence SOX2 expression.	16848	17156
18385794	Further characterization of genetic interactions among causative genes may also help to further our understanding of the formation of the eye.	17157	17299
18310445	The gonadotrophins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), are produced by the gonadotroph cells of the anterior pituitary and play important roles in reproductive function.	0	199
18310445	Tight control over the production of these hormones is crucial, particularly in females, to coordinate follicle selection and terminal follicular growth as well as the timing and number of ovulations.	200	400
18310445	Synthesis and release of LH and FSH are regulated by hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and gonadal steroids.	401	527
18310445	Despite these common regulators, divergences in the circulating patterns of LH and FSH are often encountered, suggesting that these regulators act differentially on the production of LH and FSH and/or that other factors are specifically involved in the control of FSH synthesis.	528	806
18310445	While the pulsatile pattern of GnRH release is essential for the activation and secretion of both gonadotrophins, changes in pulse frequency observed during the oestrous cycle differentially affect the LH and FSH production.	807	1031
18310445	High frequencies of GnRH pulses are associated with greater LH secretion whereas lower frequencies favour FSH secretion.	1032	1152
18310445	In addition, the FSH secretion is controlled, independently of LH, by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) superfamily members such as activins and inhibins.	1153	1309
18310445	Activin, a dimer of two highly related β-subunits (βA and/or βB), stimulates FSHβ gene expression and FSH release, whereas inhibin, a heterodimer composed of one α-subunit and one β-subunit (βA or βB), decreases FSH synthesis and release.	1310	1548
18310445	Activin is secreted by the gonads and within the pituitary, where it acts as an autocrine and/or paracrine regulator of FSH synthesis.	1549	1683
18310445	Recently, other members of the TGFβ superfamily, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), were shown to modulate preferentially FSH secretion.	1684	1825
18310445	In ovine pituitary cells, BMP-4 (50 ng/ml) and BMP-6 (100 ng/ml) inhibited FSHβ mRNA expression and FSH release.	1826	1938
18310445	By contrast, in the murine LβT2 gonadotroph cell line and rat pituitary cells, BMP-6 and BMP-7, at higher concentrations (1 μg/ml), BMP-2 and BMP-15 (100 ng/ml) were able to stimulate basal FSH secretion and FSHβ promoter activity.	1939	2170
18310445	This difference of BMP effect between the mouse and the sheep could reflect a dissimilar pattern of BMP receptors on gonadotroph cells driving different signalling pathways.	2171	2344
18310445	Alternatively, different BMPs could differentially affect FSH synthesis.	2345	2417
18310445	The TGFβ superfamily members act through two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II.	2418	2526
18310445	Activin signals through activin receptor types IIA (ActRIIA) or IIB (ActRIIB) and activin receptor type IB (ActRIB, also known as activin receptor-like kinase 4 or ALK-4).	2527	2698
18310445	Specific BMP signalling requires BMP receptor type II (BMPRII) and BMP receptor types IA (BMPRIA or ALK-3) or IB (BMPRIB or ALK-6).	2699	2830
18310445	The ligand-type II receptor complex induces phosphorylation and activation of type I receptors that in turn trans-phosphorylate receptor-activated Smad proteins within the cytoplasm.	2831	3013
18310445	These then interact with common Smad4, and the resulting complex translocates to the nucleus to affect gene transcription.	3014	3136
18310445	Activin leads to the specific activation of Smads 2 and 3, whereas BMPs activate Smads 1, 5 and 8.	3137	3235
18310445	The combinations of activin and BMP ligands and receptors are not unique.	3236	3309
18310445	For example, ActRIIA and ActRIIB can bind to BMP-6, whereas BMPRII binds specifically to BMP ligands.	3310	3411
18310445	Regarding type I receptors, ActRIA (also known as ALK-2) has been identified as a type-I receptor for BMPs.	3412	3519
18310445	To further explore BMP action at the gonadotroph cell level, we have examined the effects of BMP-4 on mouse LβT2 cell LH and FSH β-subunit mRNA levels and gonadotrophin release.	3520	3697
18310445	Considering that activin and GnRH are important modulators of FSH synthesis, it is of interest to determine if BMP-4 interacts with these two factors and to explore the signalling pathways through which BMP-4 exerts its effect.	3698	3925
18310445	Mouse LβT2 cells (provided by Dr P Mellon, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA) were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% foetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) on flasks coated with Matrigel (1:29; BD Biosciences Clontech, Cowley, Oxford, UK).	3926	4222
18310445	For experimental purposes LβT2 cells were set up as described previously at a density of 2·75×106/well.	4223	4326
18310445	After overnight incubation, cells were treated with 0 or 50 ng/ml recombinant human activin A (R&D Systems, Abingdon, Oxon, UK) ±a daily 1-h pulse of 10 nM GnRH (Bachem, St Helens, Merseyside, UK), in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml recombinant human BMP-4 (R&D Systems) for 3 days.	4327	4613
18310445	Media were collected daily for measurement of secreted FSH and LH by RIA.	4614	4687
18310445	On day 4, total RNA was extracted from cells for the measurement of FSHβ, LHβ, GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) and follistatin mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR.	4688	4841
18310445	In addition, on day 4, after a final pulse of GnRH, protein extracts were prepared for western blot analysis.	4842	4951
18310445	RIAs for mouse FSH and LH were performed as previously described, using reagents supplied by Dr A Parlow (NHPP, Harbor-UCLA, Torrance, CA, USA).	4952	5096
18310445	The minimum detectable concentrations were 1 ng/ml and 200 pg/ml for FSH and LH respectively.	5097	5190
18310445	The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <10% for both assays.	5191	5270
18310445	The expression of BMP receptor mRNA in LβT2 cells was assessed by RT-PCR, using adult mouse pituitary as a positive control.	5271	5395
18310445	Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent (Sigma–Aldrich Ltd).	5396	5458
18310445	Aliquots were treated with DNase I using DNA-free (Ambion (Europe) Ltd, Huntingdon, Cambs, UK) and reverse transcribed, using random hexamers, with Taqman Reverse Transcription reagents (PE Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) according to manufacturers protocol.	5459	5723
18310445	PCR was performed for 35 cycles using ThermoStart Taq DNA polymerase (Abgene, Epsom, Surrey, UK).	5724	5821
18310445	Primer sequences were as follows: BMPRIA: fwd: CCTGTTGTTATAGGTCCGTT; rev: TCTCCTACTGGAATAAATGC; BMPRIB: fwd: AGATTGGAAAAGGCCGCTATG; rev: GATGTCAACCTCATTTGTGTC; BMPRII: fwd: GAGGACTGGCTTATCTTCAC; rev: AGCTCCTTCTAGCACTTCTG.	5822	6043
18310445	Predicted product sizes were 194, 473 and 245 bp respectively.	6044	6106
18310445	LβT2 cells, cultured on Labtek II chamber slides (Fisher Scientific UK, Manchester, UK) were washed with PBS, fixed in Bouin's solution for 5 min, washed and then permeabilized using 10% normal goat serum, 1% BSA in PBS (blocking solution) containing 0·2% Igepal CA-630 for 20 min at room temperature.	6107	6408
18310445	After washing, cells were blocked for 1 h, then incubated at 4 °C overnight with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against BMPRIA, BMPRIB or BMPRII, diluted at 1:50.	6409	6578
18310445	Antibodies were kindly donated by Dr C-H Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden).	6579	6683
18310445	Negative controls were performed with 1:100 goat serum in place of the primary antibody.	6684	6772
18310445	Slides were washed and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) diluted 1:200.	6773	6921
18310445	After washing, the slides were mounted using Permafluor fluorescent mounting medium (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and examined using a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, UK).	6922	7139
18310445	Levels of mRNA for FSHβ, LHβ, GnRH-R and follistatin were measured using Taqman RT-PCR.	7140	7227
18310445	Primer and probe sequences were designed using Primer Express software and synthesized by PE Biosystems or by Biosource Europe SA (Nivelles, Belgium).	7228	7378
18310445	FSHβ, LHβ and GnRH-R primer/probe sequences have been previously reported.	7379	7453
18310445	The sequences for follistatin were as follows: fwd: GGGCTGGATGGGAAAACCTA; rev: CGGCTGCTCTTTGCATCTG; probe (FAM labelled): CGCAACGAATGTGCACTCCTCAAGG.	7454	7602
18310445	Ribosomal 18S primers and probe were from a Taqman Ribosomal RNA Control Reagents kit (VIC labelled probe).	7603	7710
18310445	RNA was prepared, DNase I-treated and reverse transcribed as described above.	7711	7788
18310445	RNA was added to RT reactions at 10 ng/μl.	7789	7831
18310445	A PCR mix was prepared, consisting of Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (1×), gene specific forward and reverse primers (300 nM each) and probe (200 nM), and ribosomal 18S forward and reverse primers (50 nM each) and probe (200 nM).	7832	8062
18310445	This was aliquoted into tubes, then cDNA was added at 1 μl/25 μl reaction mix.	8063	8141
18310445	Aliquots (25 μl) were transferred to wells in a 96-well PCR plate, with each sample run in duplicate.	8142	8243
18310445	Plates were sealed with optical adhesive covers and the PCRs run on ABI Prism 7900HT PCR machine using standard conditions.	8244	8367
18310445	Controls included cDNA prepared with omission of reverse transcriptase.	8368	8439
18310445	Prior to analysis, a validation assay was performed to demonstrate that amplification of target genes and the reference (18S) were approximately equal.	8440	8591
18310445	Quantification of specific mRNA levels was performed by the ΔΔCt method (Bulletin no.2; PE Biosystems).	8592	8695
18310445	Standard PCRs using each set of primers were run on an agarose gel to confirm amplification of a single product of the correct size.	8696	8828
18310445	Unless otherwise stated all reagents, equipment and software were from PE Biosystems.	8829	8914
18310445	To investigate activation of Smads, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), LβT2 cells were treated as described above except that on day 4, a final pulse of GnRH was given (duration of 1 h for Smad study and 10 or 20 min for ERK1/2, p38 and CREB studies).	8915	9198
18310445	The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7·4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0·5% Igepal CA-630, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor cocktail.	9199	9476
18310445	The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd).	9477	9578
18310445	After 5 min at 95 °C in reducing buffer, proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA).	9579	9747
18310445	For Smad and ERK analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline, 0·1% Tween (TBST) containing 5% fat-free dry milk and then incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C.	9748	9958
18310445	The P-Smad1/5 rabbit monoclonal, P-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) and were all used at 1:1000 dilution.	9959	10132
18310445	The Smad1/5 and Smad2/3 polyclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY, USA) and were used at 1:500 and 1:1000 dilutions respectively.	10133	10291
18310445	The P-Smad2/3 antibody was provided by Dr C-H Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) and used at 1:2000 dilutions.	10292	10430
18310445	After washing in TBST, the membranes were incubated with Amersham ECL peroxidase-labelled anti-rabbit antibody (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK) for 1 h at room temperature.	10431	10621
18310445	Immunoreactive proteins were detected using Amersham ECL Plus western blotting detection reagents and exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (both from GE Healthcare UK Ltd).	10622	10783
18310445	For quantification, the membranes were scanned on a Typhoon 9400 variable-mode imager (GE Healthcare UK Ltd).	10784	10893
18310445	In each case, the membrane was probed first with the antibody against the phosphorylated protein, then stripped using buffer containing 2% SDS, 62·5 mM Tris (pH 6·8), 0·1 M 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 75 °C.	10894	11105
18310445	After washing, immunodetection was repeated using antibody against the total protein.	11106	11191
18310445	For P-p38 and P-CREB analysis, membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (Licor Biosciences UK Ltd, Cambridge, UK) and primary antibodies were diluted in Odyssey buffer diluted 1:1 with PBS, 0·1% Tween 20 (PBST).	11192	11412
18310445	The primary antibody against the phosphorylated protein was combined with a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin to act as loading control for quantitation.	11413	11558
18310445	The P-p38 and P-CREB antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:1000 dilutions and α-tubulin monoclonal (Sigma) was used at 1:3000 dilutions.	11559	11711
18310445	After washing in PBST the membranes were incubated with a mixture of goat anti-rabbit IR Dye 680 and goat anti-mouse IR Dye 800CW for 1 h at room temperature.	11712	11870
18310445	Immunoreactive proteins were detected and quantified using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor Biosciences UK Ltd).	11871	11992
18310445	Results are reported as mean±s.e.m.	11993	12028
18310445	from one representative experiment.	12029	12064
18310445	Experiments were carried out at least three times.	12065	12115
18310445	Analyses of interactions between BMP-4 and other treatment groups were carried out using two-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni method.	12116	12245
18310445	Comparisons between treatments on FSH, LH concentrations, FSHβ and LHβ mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein intensities were analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test.	12246	12444
18310445	The value of P<0·05 was considered significant.	12445	12492
18310445	The statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).	12493	12607
18310445	Qualitative RT-PCR analysis of total RNA prepared from mouse LβT2 gonadotroph cells and adult mouse pituitary was carried out using primers specific for BMPRIA (ALK-3), BMPRIB (ALK-6) and BMPRII.	12608	12803
18310445	As shown in Fig.	12804	12820
18310445	1A, products of the expected size were observed for all three receptor types in both LβT2 cells and adult mouse pituitary.	12821	12943
18310445	In negative controls, performed by omitting reverse transcriptase enzyme in RT reactions, no PCR products were detected (not shown).	12944	13076
18310445	Particularly in LβT2 cells, the levels of BMPRIB mRNA appeared to be lower than the other two receptor types.	13077	13186
18310445	Immunostaining using specific antibodies confirmed the presence of expressed protein for all three BMP receptor types in LβT2 cells when compared with a negative control (Fig.	13187	13362
18310445	1B).	13363	13367
18310445	To determine whether BMP-4 was capable of modifying gonadotrophin production and secretion in LβT2 gonadotrophs, cells given activin ±a daily 1 h pulse of GnRH for three days were also treated with BMP-4.	13368	13572
18310445	Secretion profiles for FSH and LH, representing the total protein secreted during day 3 GnRH treatment and the subsequent overnight incubation, and the corresponding day 4 β-subunit mRNA levels are shown in Fig.	13573	13784
18310445	2.	13785	13787
18310445	As expected, FSH secretion increased (P<0·001) in response to activin and this effect was increased synergistically (P<0·001) in the presence of GnRH, although GnRH alone had no effect (Fig.	13788	13978
18310445	2A).	13979	13983
18310445	While BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSH secretion, it increased the release of FSH in response to activin and activin+GnRH (P<0·01 and P<0·001 respectively).	13984	14140
18310445	Similarly, the FSHβ mRNA expression was up-regulated by activin (P<0·05) and this effect was also increased synergistically by GnRH (P<0·001; Fig.	14141	14287
18310445	2B).	14288	14292
18310445	BMP-4 alone, or in combination with activin or GnRH, had no effect on FSHβ mRNA, but it further increased activin+GnRH-stimulated mRNA levels (P<0·01).	14293	14444
18310445	LH release from LβT2 cells was stimulated by GnRH (P<0.	14445	14500
18310445	001) and these levels almost doubled when GnRH was combined with activin (P<0·001, Fig.	14501	14588
18310445	2C).	14589	14593
18310445	BMP-4 alone or in combination with activin and/or GnRH did not affect LH release.	14594	14675
18310445	By contrast, while LHβ mRNA expression also increased in response to GnRH and activin+GnRH (P<0·001), these levels were reduced (P<0·05) by BMP-4 (Fig.	14676	14827
18310445	2D).	14828	14832
18310445	To investigate the possible underlying mechanisms for the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotrophin production and release in LβT2 gonadotrophs, GnRH-R and follistatin mRNA levels on day 4 from cells treated as described were measured.	14833	15060
18310445	As shown in Fig.	12804	12820
18310445	3A, activin and GnRH alone produced small increases in GnRH-R mRNA levels, but combined activin+GnRH was required to achieve a significant (P<0·001) effect.	15078	15234
18310445	BMP-4 reduced GnRH-R mRNA expression in both the GnRH- and activin+GnRH-treated cells (P<0·01 and P<0·001 respectively).	15235	15355
18310445	Follistatin mRNA levels, on the other hand, increased in response to activin and activin+GnRH (P<0·01 and P<0·001 respectively, Fig.	15356	15488
18310445	3B).	15489	15493
18310445	BMP-4 treatment significantly reduced the activin-stimulated increase in follistatin mRNA (P<0·05), but had no effect on the increase observed in response to activin+GnRH.	15494	15665
18310445	To determine whether or not the BMP and activin signalling pathways could interact at the Smad activation level, LβT2 cells cultured in the presence or absence of activin ±a daily 1 h pulse of GnRH for 3 days were also exposed to BMP-4.	15666	15902
18310445	On day 4, a final 1-h pulse of GnRH was given and proteins extracted for western blot analysis, using antibodies specific for P-Smad1/5 and P-Smad2/3, to look at the BMP and activin signalling pathways respectively.	15903	16118
18310445	As shown in Fig.	12804	12820
18310445	4A, BMP-4, but not activin, induced the appearance of a band at ∼60 kDa, corresponding to the phosphorylated form of Smad1/5.	16136	16261
18310445	The presence of activin and/or GnRH with BMP-4 did not affect the intensity of this band when compared with BMP-4 treatment alone.	16262	16392
18310445	By contrast, activin (± GnRH) induced activation of Smad2/3 as indicated by increased intensity of band(s) at ∼55–58 kDa corresponding to phosphorylated Smad2/3 (Fig.	16393	16559
18310445	4B).	16560	16564
18310445	When cells were treated with both BMP-4 and activin±GnRH, band intensity did not change compared with activin±GnRH alone.	16565	16686
18310445	It should be noted that the results shown here were obtained using an antibody against P-Smad2/3 and that two bands were observed.	16687	16817
18310445	However, it appeared that the upper band (P-Smad2) was mainly responsible for the increased signal in response to activin±GnRH and indeed, identical results were obtained using an antibody specific for P-Smad2 (data not shown).	16818	17045
18310445	As there is evidence that, as well as signalling through the Smad pathways, TGFβ family members may also utilize other downstream signalling pathways, we examined whether or not BMP-4 activated or influenced the activation of other pathways known to be active in gonadotrophs.	17046	17322
18310445	The LβT2 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of activin ± a daily 1-h pulse of GnRH ± BMP-4 for 3 days.	17323	17437
18310445	On day 4, a 10- or 20-min pulse of GnRH was given to cells previously exposed to GnRH and proteins extracted for western blot analysis, using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and CREB.	17438	17658
18310445	As expected, GnRH induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, with the same effect observed in the presence and absence of activin (P<0·001; Fig.	17659	17792
18310445	5A).	17793	17797
18310445	BMP-4 had no effect on ERK activation.	17798	17836
18310445	The results shown here were from cells that are given GnRH for 20 min on day 4.	17837	17916
18310445	After 10-min GnRH supply the same trend was observed, but the result did not reach significance (data not shown).	17917	18030
18310445	As shown in Fig.	12804	12820
18310445	5B, p38 MAPK was also activated by GnRH (P<0·01), but in this case activin increased the response observed with GnRH alone (P<0·05).	18048	18180
18310445	BMP-4 treatment, in the presence of activin+GnRH, reduced phosphorylated p38 levels (P<0·01).	18181	18274
18310445	In this case, the treatment 10-min GnRH supply gave the optimum result, as after 20 min GnRH levels of phosphorylated p38 were unmeasurable in our detection system.	18275	18439
18310445	CREB was activated by GnRH alone (P<0·001; Fig.	18440	18487
18310445	5C) and neither activin nor BMP-4 had a significant effect.	18488	18547
18310445	Again, 20-min GnRH produced the optimum result, although after 10 min a statistically similar effect was observed (data not shown).	18548	18679
18310445	Earlier studies have identified BMPs as modulators in the regulation of FSH synthesis and release.	18680	18778
18310445	In rodent primary pituitary cells and the mouse LβT2 gonadotroph cell line, different BMPs (BMP-15, as well as BMP-6 and -7 at high doses) exert a stimulatory effect on FSHβ transcription, whereas in ovine primary pituitary cells, BMP-4 and BMP-6 have inhibitory effects on FSHβ mRNA expression and FSH release.	18779	19090
18310445	In the present study we report that, in LβT2 mouse gonadotroph cells, BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSHβ mRNA and FSH release, as reported previously for BMP-2, -6 and -7 used at comparable doses.	19091	19286
18310445	Remarkably, BMP-4 increased both FSHβ mRNA and FSH secretion when combined with activin A and GnRH.	19287	19386
18310445	Recent studies observed synergistic effects on FSHβ transcription between BMP-2 and activin A in LβT2 cells.	19387	19495
18310445	Moreover, our data show for the first time that LHβ mRNA and LH secretion remained unaffected by BMP-4 treatment but that, interestingly, the up-regulation of LHβ mRNA in response to GnRH was reduced.	19496	19696
18310445	Our results underline the opposite actions of BMP-4 on FSH expression in ewe primary pituitary cells and murine homogeneous gonadotroph cells.	19697	19839
18310445	In ewe pituitary cells BMP-4 and BMP-6 decreased both basal and activin-stimulated FSHβ mRNA levels and FSH release.	19840	19956
18310445	The reasons for this differential effect are not clear.	19957	20012
18310445	They may reflect different specific patterns of BMP receptors between ewe gonadotroph cells and LβT2 cells leading to activation of different signalling pathways and/or different intra-cellular components.	20013	20218
18310445	The present results demonstrate that LβT2 cells express mRNAs encoding the BMP receptors BMPRIA, BMPRIB and BMPRII, confirming data from Lee et al. (2007), in contrast to another study in which only BMPRIA and BMPRII were found (Otsuka & Shimasaki 2002).	20219	20473
18310445	However, in our study, BMPRIB mRNA does appear to be expressed at lower levels than BMPRIA and BMPRII.	20474	20576
18310445	Furthermore, immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of proteins corresponding to the three types of receptors.	20577	20691
18310445	In contrast to LβT2 cells, BMPRIB was not detected in ewe gonadotroph cells.	20692	20768
18310445	The bioavailability of different receptors could dictate the FSH response to BMPs.	20769	20851
18310445	Even if BMP-4 is able to bind complexes of BMPRII and BMPRIA or BMPRIB, the two receptors may not be equivalent in activating signalling.	20852	20989
18310445	Alternatively, receptors other than BMPRIA or IB could be involved.	20990	21057
18310445	A previous report has shown that BMP-2 acts through BMPRII and ALK-2 in LβT2 cells.	21058	21141
18310445	Moreover, ewe primary pituitary cells are composed of different cell types and the target cell type(s) for BMP-4 are not known.	21142	21269
18310445	Whether BMP-4 acts directly on gonadotroph cells in sheep primary pituitary cells has yet to be determined.	21270	21377
18310445	The nature of the mechanisms by which BMP-4 interacts with activin and GnRH is still unclear.	21378	21471
18310445	The classical signalling pathway used by BMPs involves Smads 1, 5 and 8 activated by BMP receptors type II and type I.	21472	21590
18310445	As demonstrated by the phosphorylation of Smad1/5, BMP-4 activated the BMP pathway in LβT2 cells.	21591	21688
18310445	However, BMP-4 alone failed to modify the level of FSHβ or LHβ mRNA and gonadotrophin release.	21689	21783
18310445	It is possible that Smads 1/5 mediate other responses to BMP in LβT2 cells such as cell proliferation.	21784	21886
18310445	BMP-4 action required the presence of activin and was amplified when GnRH was added in combination with activin.	21887	21999
18310445	This action was not accompanied by changes in the level of P-Smad1/5, suggesting that other signalling proteins and/or pathways are involved.	22000	22141
18310445	A recent study suggested that Smad8 might be the preferred signalling protein in the BMP pathway since overexpression of Smad8, but not Smad1 or 5, enhanced the FSHβ promoter activity in response to BMP-2.	22142	22347
18310445	It is possible that BMP-4 may be acting through the modulation of activin and/or GnRH pathway.	22348	22442
18310445	Previous data have shown that activin transmits its signal through Smad2 and/or Smad3 phosphorylation.	22443	22545
18310445	While we detected an increase in the phosphorylated forms of Smad2/3 in the presence of activin, the addition of BMP-4± GnRH in LβT2 cell medium did not change the level of P-Smad2/3.	22546	22729
18310445	Thus, the interaction between BMP-4, activin and GnRH does not modify Smad1/5 or Smad2/3 phosphorylation.	22730	22835
18310445	It is unclear whether follistatin plays a role in this system, as the effects of BMP-4 on expression of follistatin mRNA were inconsistent.	22836	22975
18310445	Activin-stimulated mRNA was reduced by BMP-4 treatment, in contrast to activin+GnRH-stimulated mRNA which remained unaffected.	22976	23102
18310445	In addition, increased follistatin synthesis did not have any effect on Smad2/3 phosphorylation.	23103	23199
18310445	However, it should be emphasized that the activin and BMP-4 levels used in this study would most likely be sufficient to completely override any possible effects of endogenous follistatin, which may be more relevant in vivo, where levels of endogenous activin and BMPs would be lower.	23200	23484
18310445	The ability of follistatin to bind BMPs, albeit with a lower affinity than activin (Balemans & Van Hul 2002), suggests it may well be involved in the BMP-mediated regulation of FSH production in vivo.	23485	23685
18310445	Since there is evidence that BMPs can operate through Smad-independent pathways such as MAPK signalling molecules, changes in levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 were measured.	23686	23866
18310445	As expected, GnRH activated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but this response was not modified by activin, corroborating previous data.	23867	24001
18310445	The presence of BMP-4 did not affect GnRH-mediated activation of ERK1/2.	24002	24074
18310445	Previous studies have shown that BMPs can induce the p38 MAPK-dependent pathway.	24075	24155
18310445	In the current study we observed that the level of GnRH-enhanced p38 activation was increased by activin, confirming a previous report, and this correlated with increased FSHβ mRNA and FSH secretion.	24156	24355
18310445	This p38 activation in response to GnRH+activin was reduced by BMP-4, contrary to the increase in FSHβ mRNA and FSH secretion.	24356	24482
18310445	As GnRH alone induced the p38 activation, but had no effect on FSHβ mRNA and FSH secretion, which remained equivalent to those in untreated cells, the exact role of p38 in regulating FSH production is unclear.	24483	24692
18310445	The BMP-induced reduction in p38 MAPK does, however, correlate with a decrease in LHβ mRNA expression.	24693	24795
18310445	GnRH is also known to activate CREB protein in gonadotroph cell lines.	24796	24866
18310445	Our results confirm that GnRH activates CREB, but CREB phosphorylation was not significantly affected by activin and/or BMP-4.	24867	24993
18310445	Our current data, therefore, indicate that the classical upstream activin (Smad2/3) or GnRH (ERK, CREB) pathways are not modified in the presence of BMP-4.	24994	25149
18310445	The p38 MAPK signalling appears to be modulated by BMP-4, but whether this has direct effects on FSH production/secretion remains to be determined.	25150	25297
18310445	Considering the synergistic effects of BMP-2 and activin on FSHβ transcription in LβT2 cells, it has recently been suggested that each ligand employs different, non-overlapping mechanisms to generate their effects.	25298	25512
18310445	A summation of the independent signalling pathways activated by BMP-4, activin and GnRH could mediate their combined response with an amplified action occurring specifically at the level of the FSHβ promoter.	25513	25721
18310445	So far, it is not known if BMP-4 exerts its effect directly on the FSHβ promoter and detailed analyses will be necessary to localize the site of BMP action.	25722	25878
18310445	In addition to its effect on FSHβ mRNA and FSH release, BMP-4 also regulated LHβ expression.	25879	25971
18310445	In the present study, we obtained clear evidence that BMP-4 decreased levels of GnRH and activin-induced LHβ mRNA.	25972	26086
18310445	This effect appeared to be mediated, at least partly, by the down-regulation of GnRH-R mRNA.	26087	26179
18310445	The inhibitory effect of BMP-4 on LHβ and GnRH-R mRNA levels is contradictory to the stimulatory action of activin.	26180	26295
18310445	Several studies indicate a correlation between GnRH-R density and a differential gonadotrophin response to GnRH.	26296	26408
18310445	High levels of GnRH-R are associated with preferential LHβ gene expression whereas lower levels favour the stimulation of FSHβ gene expression, suggesting a role for GnRH-R levels in mediating these differential responses.	26409	26631
18310445	Thus, we propose that BMP-4, partly by inhibiting GnRH-R expression, could induce an inhibition of the LHβ mRNA level, potentially through p38 MAPK activation, and promote an increase in the level of FSHβ mRNA and FSH release.	26632	26858
18310445	The absence of any effect of BMP-4 on LH release compared with its effect on LHβ mRNA levels may simply reflect the release of stored LH via the regulated secretory pathway.	26859	27032
18310445	In conclusion, our results show that BMP-4, activin and GnRH act in a synergistic manner to up-regulate FSHβ mRNA and FSH release.	27033	27163
18310445	By contrast, BMP-4 reduces the GnRH and/or activin-induced up-regulation of LHβ and GnRH receptor mRNA.	27164	27267
18310445	We demonstrated that the classical upstream BMP signalling molecule(s) are activated in the LβT2 cells by BMP-4, but other signalling molecules/pathways must be involved in order to obtain the effects on FSH production observed in response to the interaction of BMP-4 with activin/GnRH.	27268	27554
18310445	Naturally, these results need to be checked in primary cell cultures to determine if the difference in the effects of BMP-4 in the present mouse LβT2 gonadotroph cell line and our previous studies in sheep primary cells is due to different paracrine or autocrine mechanisms involving an interaction with other pituitary cell types.	27555	27886
18310445	In contrast to mouse pituitary, BMP-4 mRNA was not detected in LβT2 cells arguing for a paracrine role.	27887	27990
18310445	Collectively, the present data reinforce the concept of a role for BMP-4 in the control of FSH and reveal a novel involvement in LH control.	27991	28131
18366737	Recently two proteins involved in the tricarboxcylic acid (TCA) cycle have been shown to be tumor suppressors.	0	110
18366737	Fumarate hydratase (FH) (also known as fumarase) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which also plays a role in oxidative phosphorylation, are enzymes involved in fundamental processes of energy production.	111	316
18366737	Deficiencies of FH and SDH(A) generally result in early-onset, severe encephalopathy.	317	402
18366737	The first description of fumarate hydratase deficiency was in 1986 by Zinn et al, followed in 1994 by the first molecular characterization of an FH mutation by Bourgeron et al.	403	579
18366737	In 2002, the Multiple Leiomyoma Consortium identified FH as the tumor suppressor gene responsible for MCUL/HLRCC.	580	693
18366737	The identification of these genes as tumor suppressors was an entirely unexpected finding and demonstrated for the first time the involvement of proteins of intermediary metabolism in tumorigenesis.	694	892
18366737	Mutations have been identified in both the gene encoding fumarate hydratase and three of the four genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase, subunits B, C and D (SDHB, -C and -D), while no cancer-related mutations have yet been reported in SDHA.	893	1135
18366737	Germline mutations in FH predispose individuals to multiple cutaneous leiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas and in some families renal cell cancer (HLRCC), whereas mutations in SDH cause hereditary paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas (HPGL).	1136	1371
18366737	Both of these cancer syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.	1372	1449
18366737	Despite the closely related function of FH and SDH proteins, the tumor spectra in HPGL and HLRCC show little overlap, indicating that although biochemically related, the mitogenic stimulus leading to tumor formation must be cell specific.	1450	1688
18366737	The principal phenotype of the FH-associated tumor syndrome is skin leiomyoma.	1689	1767
18366737	These are typically sensitive to cold or abrasion, appear to be more common in women than men, developing between the second and fourth decades as intradermal papules or nodules of up to 20 mm in diameter, with a disseminated or segmental distribution.	1768	2020
18366737	Germline FH mutations have been identified in the vast majority of patients with multiple skin leiomyomas, and the relatives of probands have often been subsequently diagnosed with skin leiomyomas, suggesting that many more cases are currently going unrecognized.	2021	2284
18366737	Female FH mutation carriers are also at high risk of early-onset uterine fibroids that frequently require hysterectomy.	2285	2404
18366737	Certain FH mutations have also been associated with uterine fibroids without skin leiomyomas.	2405	2498
18366737	Although uterine fibroids are the most common tumors in women during their reproductive years, FH mutations do not appear to play a major role in non-syndromic cases.	2499	2665
18366737	Although not always present in the FH syndrome, aggressive renal cell carcinomas of two unusual types, type II papillary and collecting duct morphology, also occur in certain families.	2666	2850
18366737	Both frequently present with metastatic disease before the age of fifty and are associated with high mortality.	2851	2962
18366737	A single case has also been reported with both papillary and conventional clear cell renal carcinoma, both tumors displaying loss of the wild type FH allele and immunostaining.	2963	3139
18366737	Recently Merino et al described a distinctive histological feature of these tumors, a characteristically large nucleus with a very prominent inclusion-like orangiophilic or eosinophilic nucleolus, surrounded by a clear halo.	3140	3364
18366737	Leiomyosarcomas also occur in association with FH mutations but appear to be rare in FH mutation carriers although a few cases, predominantly of Finnish origin, have been described.	3365	3546
18366737	Other reported pathology associated with FH mutations include cerebral cavernomas and Leydig cell tumors and ovarian mucinous cystadenoma.	3547	3685
18366737	A number of biochemical studies have shown that FH-deficient cells and tumors accumulate both fumarate and succinate, while SDH-deficient tumors mainly accumulate succinate.	3686	3859
18366737	Accumulation of these metabolic intermediates may affect other biochemical processes in the cell, and considerable evidence indicates that the inhibition of HIF prolyl hydroxylase leads to the over-expression of the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α).	3860	4134
18366737	HIF1α targets, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin (EPO), and glucose transporter1 (GLUT1), show activation on accumulation of TCA metabolites, and contribute to an increase in microvessel density.	4135	4364
18366737	This phenomenon has been described as "pseudo-hypoxia" and shows striking similarities with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.	4365	4490
18366737	In normoxia, HIF1α is hydroxylated at critical proline residues by a HIF prolyl hydroxylase, and targeted for degradation by an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex that includes the VHL protein.	4491	4677
18366737	In VHL disease, mutations in VHL inhibit this process and lead to the stabilization of HIF1α.	4678	4771
18366737	Phenotypically, both HPGL and VHL patients may develop pheochromocytomas, and the clear cell renal carcinomas that are a major feature of VHL disease have recently been reported in a HPGL family.	4772	4967
18366737	The FH mutation database is based on the recently described Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) system which, under the auspices of the Human Genome Variation Society, is rapidly becoming the standard for gene-specific databases.	4968	5208
18366737	The LOVD system was designed to be flexible so that it could be easily adapted to the needs of a wide range of locus specific databases.	5209	5345
18366737	Additional flexibility comes from the platform-independent design and the use of PHP and MySQL open source software.	5346	5462
18366737	The design is gene-centered and modular, and focuses on the collection and display of DNA sequence variations.	5463	5573
18366737	The LOVD platform is also easily extendable to include summary clinical data.	5574	5651
18366737	In addition, all database contents may be downloaded in flat text format and imported into a spreadsheet program for further analysis.	5652	5786
18366737	The LOVD database software is now in a new version, LOVD2, which has many additional features.	5787	5881
18366737	Researchers interested in contributing sequence variants to the database will be asked to register, (submitters can access and edit their personal data at any time), after which they can contribute the variant online.	5882	6099
18366737	During submission researchers are asked to provide those data that are deemed absolutely essential for mutation databases by the Human Genome Organization Mutation Database Initiative.	6100	6284
18366737	These include a patient ID, an exact molecular description of the variant (DNA-level), and details about the source of the material and detection method used.	6285	6443
18366737	Newly submitted variants are given a unique identifier, as recommended by Claustres et al. After the curator's approval the new variant is added to the database and all connected web pages are updated instantly.	6444	6655
18366737	Currently (Jan, 2008) all database content is derived from published, peer-reviewed literature.	6656	6751
18366737	We anticipate that directly submitted content will become an increasing proportion in the future.	6752	6849
18366737	As the submitted data are in the form of a submitter deduced mutation description, the curators can only check the feasibility and consistency of the description and not any original data.	6850	7038
18366737	DNA variation in populations is generally benign and as such should be termed a 'variant' or 'SNP'.	7039	7138
18366737	The term 'mutation' is reserved for cases were there is a reasonable suspicion that the variant is deleterious.	7139	7250
18366737	DNA variants submitted to the FH database should be described in accordance with the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS), update August 2004, and it is strongly recommended that authors consult the most up-to-date nomenclature guidelines, which can be found online at the HGVS website.	7251	7561
18366737	Unfortunately the mutation nomenclature currently used in the field of FH research is rarely in agreement with HGVS guidelines.	7562	7689
18366737	Reports contain a variety of annotations, and many are based on the annotation of the cytosolic protein, the function of which is currently poorly defined.	7690	7845
18366737	One of the aims of the HGVS is to establish a consistent nomenclature across all human genes.	7846	7939
18366737	The description of FH protein variants based on the cytosolic protein is often accompanied by the use of a truncated transcript to describe cDNA variants.	7940	8094
18366737	Other authors use the cytosolic protein numbering system, while applying the full-length coding transcript to describe cDNA variants.	8095	8228
18366737	This results in the loss of the simple approximation of 3 to 1 between the numbering.	8229	8314
18366737	The HGVS-recommended cDNA numbering starts from the first ATG of the full coding sequence.	8315	8405
18366737	Protein reference sequences should represent the primary translation product, not a processed mature protein, and thus include any signal peptide sequences Currently many variants are present in the literature under several titles, and the correct identification of intron variants is especially problematic.	8406	8714
18366737	No reliable overview of known FH variation can be achieved without a consistent nomenclature, which includes the appropriate numbering systems at both the DNA and protein level.	8715	8892
18366737	We now recommend that all authors implement the recommendations of the HGVS when describing future FH variants.	8893	9004
18366737	The FH mutation database will accept all variants and if necessary assist in assigning the correct nomenclature.	9005	9117
18366737	In light of the inconsistency of the recent FH mutation nomenclature, variants have been reassigned, where necessary, and an extra column has been generated clearly stating the originally reported description(s) of the mutation at the protein level, and where equivocal also at the cDNA level.	9118	9411
18366737	Inclusion of sequence variants in the FH mutation database does not imply that there is convincing evidence for pathogenicity.	9412	9538
18366737	Please refer to the disclaimer on the website.	9539	9585
18366737	Within the FH database, all variants that disrupt the reading frame, affect highly conserved residues (conserved by sequence alignment in at least Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or disrupt the consensus donor or acceptor splice sites (GT-AG), and are not found in healthy controls, should be suspected as potentially pathogenic.	9586	9909
18366737	Non-conserved missense variants and potential splice site mutations that do not disrupt the consensus splice sites, are considered to be SNPs or rare variants of uncertain significance.	9910	10095
18366737	Ideally, several lines of evidence should support publications which present mutations as "pathogenic", including screening DNA from a panel of 50–200 healthy individuals, describing the nature of the amino acid substitution (conservative/non-conservative) and the significance of the position in the protein (evolutionarily conservation or known functional domain).	10096	10462
18366737	It is important to note whether the mutation has previously been reported, if it has been found in several families, and if it segregates with the disease within the family.	10463	10636
18366737	Many FH variants have been analysed for effects on enzymatic function, and this data has, in many cases, allowed the classification of missense variants as pathogenic.	10637	10804
18366737	In addition a SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) analysis of missense FH variants has been included.	10805	10910
18366737	A high score (above 0.05) indicates that an amino acid is poorly conserved (alignment of 337 Uniprot proteins), indicating caution in assignment of function to the variant.	10911	11083
18366737	However none of these factors can be seen as definitive and each variant must be considered on its merits.	11084	11190
18366737	Unfortunately, most mutations are currently reported without this accompanying analysis, and many have been identified in a single case or family.	11191	11337
18366737	Thus caution should be exercised when attempting to derive clinically relevant information from the database, and users must carefully weigh all the evidence in the database and any additional data.	11338	11536
18366737	The FH gene is very highly conserved, showing 67% protein identity between humans and S. cerevisiae with the few coding SNPs described in dbSNP present in the HapMap population as very rare alleles (the minor allele being undetected).	11537	11771
18366737	Thus, current knowledge suggests that most missense changes will be pathogenic.	11772	11851
18366737	Polymorphisms, including intron variants, synonymous (silent) variants, nonsynonymous missense variants found in a healthy control panel and potential non-consensus splice site mutations but without evidence for transcript rearrangements are included in the database as such unless accompanied by clear evidence of pathogenic potential.	11852	12188
18366737	An abbreviated description of the FH related syndrome is given under "disease".	12189	12268
18366737	Refer to the database notes for an explanation of these abbreviations.	12269	12339
18366737	Further information can be found under "remarks", including the country of origin of the patient or study, together with other details such as the number of healthy controls tested for the variant, and any other supporting evidence.	12340	12572
18366737	The FH mutation database describes mutations exon by exon; giving a complete overview of all reported or directly submitted mutations in a single table.	12573	12725
18366737	This overview permits the swift appraisal of the status of any new variant.	12726	12801
18366737	The FH mutation database summary page lists general gene and database information and provides access to the tables containing the allelic variant information and several search options (Fig 1).	12802	12996
18366737	In addition, the complete contents of the public database can be downloaded here and imported into a spreadsheet program for further analysis.	12997	13139
18366737	The variant tables contain the sequence variants ordered by position, relative to the cDNA reference sequence (Fig 2).	13140	13258
18366737	Tables describing both unique variants and all reported variants can be selected.	13259	13340
18366737	Using the sort option in the column heading, variants can be re-ordered as required.	13341	13425
18366737	An up-to-date and fully referenced overview of FH mutations will be especially useful to clinical geneticists, research scientists, and physicians involved in the care and treatment of patients with HLRCC or congenital fumarase deficiency.	13426	13665
18366737	The FH database includes (as of Jan, 2008) 107 variants of which 93 are thought to be pathogenic and 14 may be non-functional intron variants.	13666	13808
18366737	The most common types of mutations at the protein level are missense (57%), frameshifts and nonsense (27%), with the remainder composed of deletions, insertions and duplications (Fig 3).	13809	13995
18366737	No mutation has yet been identified in exon 1 (often described as exon 0), and few large deletions have been reported but this probably reflects limited effort in this direction to date.	13996	14182
18366737	The missense mutations are concentrated in several central exons of the gene, particularly 4, 5, 7 and 8.	14183	14288
18366737	Unsurprisingly the most conserved exon is 7, followed by exon 4.	14289	14353
18366737	It can also be noticed that the missense mutations of exon 5 cluster in the proximal and distal regions of the exon, which are both highly conserved (Fig 4).	14354	14511
18366737	That conservation is not always a good predictor of function is seen with Lys467Arg (K424R) missense variant.	14512	14621
18366737	This amino acid is relatively poorly conserved, present in E. coli, but variable in many other species.	14622	14725
18366737	The SIFT score is 0.17, indicating that this is a tolerated variant, and should not affect protein function.	14726	14834
18366737	Other species variants include Asn, Ala, Met, and Glu, all of which are also predicted by SIFT analysis to be tolerated changes.	14835	14963
18366737	However, Ylisaukko-oja et al recently demonstrated that this variant has less than half the activity of the wt variant.	14964	15083
18366737	Context may also be important for the function of a variant, a case in point being Glu362Gln (Glu319Gln), the very first FH mutation, described by Bourgeron in 1994.	15084	15249
18366737	Two siblings with profound fumarase deficiency were found to be homozygous for this mutation, showing only residual fumarase activity of less than 0.5% of controls.	15250	15414
18366737	The glutamine (Gln) variant residue is the only change predicted by SIFT analysis to be tolerated.	15415	15513
18366737	It can be speculated that any other change in this highly conserved distal region of exon 7 would have resulted in such a complete loss of fumarase activity as to be incompatible with life.	15514	15703
18366737	Renal cell cancer (RCC) associated mutations occur throughout the gene with the exception of exons 1 and 6, though there are perhaps fewer RCC-associated mutations in exon 7 than one might expect (Fig 4).	15704	15908
18366737	The Arg233His (R190H) mutation is the most commonly described FH variant, so it is unsurprising this residue should be mutated in a few cases of RCC.	15909	16058
18366737	However, arginine 233 is also independently affected, with less common variants (Arg233Cys, Arg233Leu) and all changes have been associated with RCC.	16059	16208
18366737	This residue resides in the A-site which may be the main catalytically active site.	16209	16292
18366737	Previously Alam et al speculated that truncating mutations may be over-represented in renal cancer families.	16293	16401
18366737	Within the current database, truncating and missense mutations are equally represented (11 vs. 11) in renal cell cancer patients (Fig 4).	16402	16539
18366737	This still represents relatively more truncating mutations associated with RCC than in the overall database, but the current trend seems to indicate that the initial imbalance was an artefact of the limited numbers of variants then known.	16540	16778
18366737	Whether truncating mutations are more penetrant, leading to more cases of RCC than the missense variants, is currently unclear from the published clinical data.	16779	16939
18366737	A number of FH missense mutations have been reported to reduce FH activity below that seen for truncating mutations, indicating a dominant negative action.	16940	17095
18366737	A second study failed to confirm differential activities of truncating and missense mutations on FH enzyme activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines from HLRCC patients.	17096	17261
18366737	However, Lorenzato et al recently formally demonstrated the dominant negative action of the Arg233His (R190H) mutation.	17262	17381
18366737	For a more complete functional analysis of FH missense mutations see Alam et al. As described above, patients with mutations of FH display a range of pathologies, the most profound, FH deficiency, related to mutation of both FH alleles.	17382	17618
18366737	We have previously noted the tendency of FH deficiency-associated mutations to occur later in the gene (Fig 4) and to be less likely to include mutations leading to complete loss of protein function.	17619	17818
18366737	While several cases of FH deficiency have been reported together with truncating mutations, the other affected allele tended to carry a missense mutation.	17819	17973
18366737	The only case carrying two profound mutations was reported by Coughlin et al.	17974	18051
18366737	This patient (F1430) had only 2% residual FH enzyme activity, but did not show the most serious of the known clinical manifestations.	18052	18185
18366737	Even the mutations in this patient may have been attenuated by the fact that while one allele was affected by a 74 bp deletion in exon 2, the other truncating mutation occurred very late in the protein at the end of exon 10, leading to the loss of the last 10 amino acid residues.	18186	18466
18366737	These data suggest that some residual enzyme activity is required if an embryo is to develop to term.	18467	18568
18366737	Here we present an online database of FH gene variants that provides the only complete and up-to-date overview of all reported disease-related mutations.	18569	18722
18366737	Clearly, considering the geographical distribution of the studies to date, only a fraction of all FH mutations associated with MCUL/HLRCC have yet been identified.	18723	18886
18366737	While no unequivocal genotype-phenotype correlations associated with certain types of mutations or location in the gene have emerged so far, increasing knowledge of FH mutations may yet provide insight into sub-phenotypes or FH protein function.	18887	19132
18366737	Importantly, every FH mutation found in an MCUL/HLRCC patient increases confidence in the pathogenic role of that variant, improving the accuracy of clinical genetic counselling.	19133	19311
18366737	Equally it remains extremely important to test missense variants in sufficient, ethnically matched, healthy controls to aid in identifying SNPs in the coding sequence, which may currently be incorrectly classified.	19312	19526
18366737	We hope that the FH mutation database, which strives to systematically unify all current genetic knowledge of FH variants, will increase the confidence of clinical geneticists and treating physicians when advising patients and their families, will provide a convenient resource for research scientists, and may eventually assist in gaining novel insights into FH and its related clinical syndromes.	19527	19925
18439317	Low back pain (LBP) affects 70% to 80% of all people at some time during their life.	0	84
18439317	The annual prevalence ranges from 15% to 45%, with a point prevalence averaging 30%.	85	169
18439317	Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) in the lumbar spine or lumbar disc degeneration is a major cause of LBP.	170	274
18439317	Up to now, there is only a limited understanding of DDD, with the underlying pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms remain un-elucidated.	275	417
18439317	Studies suggested that environmental factors such as physical loading, motor vehicle driving, vibration and smoking may have a role.	418	550
18439317	However, there is increasing evidence that DDD is a genetic disorder, with reports of predisposition in association with certain genes, such as Taq I polymorphism of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, polymorphism of metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) gene, mutations in collagen IX genes (COL9A2 and COL9A3), Sp1 polymorphism of collagen I gene (COL1A1), polymorphism of cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP) as well as aggrecan gene polymorphism.	551	993
18439317	The involvement of multiple genes is not uncommon, as aetiology is often multifactorial in common diseases such as DDD.	994	1113
18439317	In the process of disc degeneration, degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key event.	1114	1212
18439317	Collagens are one of the major constituents of the ECM.	1213	1268
18439317	They make up 20% dry mass of the nucleus pulposus and 60% dry mass of the annulus fibrosis.	1269	1360
18439317	Approximately 80% of the collagens in the intervertebral disc consist of fibrillar collagen types I and II.	1361	1468
18439317	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are the family of degradation enzymes that break down the components of the ECM.	1469	1582
18439317	In particular, MMP1 is a collagenase which cleaves the triple helical part of the fibrillar collagen of types I, II and III, and is proposed to initiate the degradation process.	1583	1760
18439317	The cleaved fragments have a lower melting temperature than 37°C, which are then further cleaved by other MMPs.	1761	1872
18439317	Similarly, MMP1 can cleave aggrecan at the major MMP cleavage sites between the G1 and G2 domains contributing to the breakdown of aggrecan.	1873	2013
18439317	Expression of MMPs is generally low in normal cells which allows for healthy tissue turnover.	2014	2107
18439317	On the other hand, the level of MMPs increases substantially under pathological conditions and results in ECM degradation.	2108	2230
18439317	A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for guanine insertion/deletion (G/D) at position -1607 in the promoter region of the MMP1 gene (-1607 polymorphism) results in creation of binding sites for Ets transcription factor family.	2231	2459
18439317	Upon the interaction of adjacent AP-1 site, the promoter activity and hence the transcription level of MMP1 can be considerably increased.	2460	2598
18439317	In the present study, the association between this promoter SNP and DDD was investigated in a population-based dataset.	2599	2718
18439317	We demonstrated significant association with DDD and the deletion of guanine is suggested to be a possible genetic risk factor predisposing to DDD.	2719	2866
18439317	The study was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained.	2867	2954
18439317	Individuals of Southern Chinese origin were recruited by open invitation from the general population.	2955	3056
18439317	All the recruited subjects subsequently underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine and their blood was obtained for DNA extraction and genotyping analysis.	3057	3232
18439317	The MRI examinations were performed at the Jockey Club MRI Engineering Centre using a 0.2T Profile open MRI system (General Electric Medical System, Milwaukee, WI).	3233	3397
18439317	Sagittal T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 92 ms, slice thickness = 5 mm) were used to image the lumbar spine with a built-in flexible body coil.	3398	3566
18439317	Despite the relative low field, previous studies have demonstrated this to be sensitive enough to identify abnormalities associated with DDD.	3567	3708
18439317	DDD was diagnosed on the basis of signal intensity changes within the nucleus pulposus (NP) of the intervertebral discs (IVDs) of the lumbar spine and graded using the Schneiderman's classification scheme.	3709	3914
18439317	Grade 0 was used to indicate normal disc with hyperintense signal within the NP, grade 1 for a slight decrease in signal intensity in the NP, grade 2 for a generalized hypointense NP and grade 3 for a hypointense NP with disc space narrowing.	3915	4157
18439317	All the MRI scans were analyzed and rated by two experienced physicians blinded to the results of the genetic analysis and clinical history.	4158	4298
18439317	Differences were reviewed by the two raters and settled by consensus.	4299	4368
18439317	The score for each disc (0–3) was then summated to create a DDD score for the whole lumbar spine (0–15) as previously described.	4369	4497
18439317	To define the affection status using DDD score, a score of 0 was used to indicate the absence of disc degeneration, while a score of 2 or above was used to indicate the presence of degeneration.	4498	4692
18439317	Individuals with DDD score of 1 are considered as borderline degeneration and was the area of the majority of disagreements between the 2 raters and hence those with DDD score of 1 was considered unknown affection status and excluded from analysis.	4693	4941
18439317	Disc bulge was defined in discs where it has protruded posteriorly beyond a line connecting the posterior margins of the adjacent vertebral bodies.	4942	5089
18439317	In addition, annular tears and Schmorl's nodes were assessed.	5090	5151
18439317	Annular tears were defined as areas of high signal intensity within the posterior annulus surrounded by a dark rim.	5152	5267
18439317	Schmorl's nodes were defined as areas of endplate irregularities in which the darkened rim of the vertebral endplate has indented into the vertebral body.	5268	5422
18439317	Genomic DNA was isolated from the leukocytes and the quality as well as quantity measured by spectrophotometry.	5423	5534
18439317	Genotyping was performed using the Sequenom® platform.	5535	5589
18439317	The Mass ARRAY AssayDesign software (Sequenom) was used to design amplification and allele-specific extension primers.	5590	5708
18439317	The extension primer (5'-GTAGTTAAATAATTAGAAAG-3') was designed to hybridize to the amplicon near the SNP site for the extension of a single base or a few bases depending on the genotype of the allele.	5709	5909
18439317	PCR reactions (Forward primer: 5'-ACGTTGGATGGAACTCACATGTTATGCCAC-3'; Reverse-primer: 5'-ACGTTGGATGCTTCAGTATATCTTGGATTG-3') were set up in 384-well plates at 6 μL total volume per reaction and the reaction mix contains: 5 ng genomic DNA, 0.3 pmol each of specific forward and reverse primers, 200 μM of each dNTP, 3.25 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 unit of HotStarTaq polymerase (5U/μL, Qiagen, Valencia, CA).	5910	6305
18439317	The PCR condition was: 95°C for 15 min, 45 cycles of 95°C for 20 sec, 56°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 72°C for 3 min.	6306	6439
18439317	The treatment of PCR products with alkaline phosphatase and mass extend reactions were all performed according to manufacturer's (Sequenom) protocol.	6440	6589
18439317	The final base-extension products were desalted using SpectroClean resin (Sequenom), mixed with 3-hydroxypicolinic acid and analyzed using a modified Brucker Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Brucker, Billerica, MA).	6590	6810
18439317	Association and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium checking were assessed by χ2 test and Mann-Whitney U test.	6811	6912
18439317	Odds ratios and other statistical measures were calculated by SPSS 14.0 software.	6913	6994
18439317	A total of 691 individuals were genotyped for the study with 266 males and 425 females.	6995	7082
18439317	In common with previous studies, no significant differences could be detected in disease predisposition between the 2 genders and therefore no gender stratification was carried out.	7083	7264
18439317	Analysis of the D allele showed an over representation in the case group.	7265	7338
18439317	The D allele conferred a higher risk (1.4 times) of developing DDD when compared to the G allele (P-value = 0.027, odds ratio = 1.41 with 95% CI = 1.04–1.90) (Table 1).	7339	7507
18439317	Genotypic association on the presence of the D allele was also significantly associated with DDD (P-value = 0.046, odds ratio = 1.50 with 95% CI = 1.01–2.24) (Table 2).	7508	7676
18439317	Because DDD is age related and 2 risk factors, VDR and the COL9A2, have previously been demonstrated to be age-dependent, we also analyzed this MMP1 association to DDD stratified by age group.	7677	7869
18439317	Using a stratification as in a previous study, no significant association was detected in an under-40-year age group (P-value = 0.5, OR = 1.26 with 95% CI = 0.64–2.46).	7870	8038
18439317	However, in the over-40-year age group, the association was significant (P-value = 0.03, OR = 1.46 with 95% CI = 1.03–2.03) (Tables 1 &2).	8039	8177
18439317	In addition, we assessed the difference in the distribution of the DDD score for the D-allele+ (either DD or DG genotype) and D-allele- (GG genotype) groups by Mann-Whitney U test.	8178	8358
18439317	It was found that the distribution of the DDD score was significantly different between the D-allele+ and D-allele- groups (p value = 0.028) with D-allele+ group having higher DDD score.	8359	8545
18439317	Apart from DDD, association was tested on disc bulge, annular tear as well as Schmorl's nodes, no significant association with these phenotypes were found with the MMP1 promoter polymorphism (Table 3).	8546	8747
18439317	This is the first report of an association of a SNP in the promoter region of MMP1 with DDD.	8748	8840
18439317	DDD is a complex multifactorial disease.	8841	8881
18439317	It has been suggested that disc degeneration is highly correlated to age and age stratification was performed in previous studies.	8882	9012
18439317	Our results indicated that the association of DDD with the SNP is age-dependent, and is associated with subjects over 40 years of age.	9013	9147
18439317	MMP1 is involved in the cleavage of fibrillar collagens I, II and III.	9148	9218
18439317	Type I collagen is found extensively within the annulus fibrosus and bony end-plate, while Type II is the predominant collagen in the inner annulus, nucleus pulposus as well as the cartilaginous end-plate.	9219	9424
18439317	Previous studies in tumor cell lines showed that an over-representation of the G allele of this promoter SNP resulted in increased MMP1 transcriptional activity, hence more aggressive matrix degradation.	9425	9628
18439317	This was proposed to be a mechanism in cancer progression and was proven in subsequent functional studies which showed that the G allele created additional binding sites for the Ets family of transcription factors.	9629	9843
18439317	These Ets binding sites (-1607 bp) work cooperatively with a nearby AP-1 site (-1602 bp) to enhance promoter activity by at least 2 folds.	9844	9982
18439317	With the increased promoter activity and hence transcription level, the presence of the G allele could consider to be risk factor for matrix degradation.	9983	10136
18439317	Although we found an association with this promoter SNP in MMP1, our result showed the presence of the D allele resulted in an increased risk of DDD, and not the anticipated G allele.	10137	10320
18439317	Previous in vitro studies have shown that the G allele is associated with higher expression levels of MMP1.	10321	10428
18439317	Thus, individuals with the D allele with increase risk for DDD could not be explained by increased susceptibility to matrix degradation because there is no over-expression of MMP1.	10429	10609
18439317	This association may be explained in a number of ways.	10610	10664
18439317	First, the frequency for D allele is high in different ethnic populations with 62.5% and 56.7% for African and Caucasian respectively (NCBI database), and 36.4% for Southern Chinese.	10665	10847
18439317	The high frequency of D allele may indicate that the D allele is a common ancestor allele, which might be in linkage disequilibrium with unknown disease-causing polymorphism within the same gene.	10848	11043
18439317	Secondly, MMP1 is located in a gene cluster on chromosome 11 with other MMP genes (MMP-3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 20 and 26).	11044	11163
18439317	It is possible that the observed association is the result of linkage disequilibrium between this MMP1 promoter polymorphism and polymorphisms in other nearby MMP genes.	11164	11333
18439317	Moreover, despite the Ets binding site can cooperate with AP-1 site to enhance transcription of MMP1, this polymorphism has yet to be tested in intervertebral disc tissues, to see whether it affects the transcription level of MMP1.	11334	11565
18439317	It maybe that gene expression be differentially displayed in a tissue-specific manner.	11566	11652
18439317	In addition, expressional activity of MMP1 may also be influenced differentially in response to cytokines and growth factors.	11653	11778
18439317	Even in the case of cancer, allele corresponding to elevated MMP1 activity (expected to have increased susceptibility to cancer and poor prognosis) was unexpectedly found to have favourable prognosis with colorectal cancer and no association with tumor characteristics.	11779	12048
18439317	Thus further replications of association in other ethnic populations would help substantiate findings in this study.	12049	12165
18439317	In summary, we have performed a case-control association study to test for association between this promoter SNP (-1607 polymorphism) of MMP1 and DDD.	12166	12316
18439317	We have demonstrated this promoter polymorphism was significantly associated with increased susceptibility to DDD in our Southern Chinese population, especially in individuals over 40 years of age.	12317	12514
18439317	Disc bulge, annular tear as well as Schmorl's nodes were not associated with this polymorphism.	12515	12610
18470323	The corneal dystrophies are a group of genetically determined diseases usually characterized by loss of corneal transparency, which may be caused by a progressive accumulation of abnormal material within the cornea.	0	215
18470323	Lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD) is a distinct clinical entity characterized by the accumulation of amyloid throughout the middle and anterior stroma.	216	365
18470323	Lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCD1, OMIM 122200), also known as Biber-Haab-Dimmer dystrophy, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable clinical expression and a high degree of penetration.	366	574
18470323	Generally, the first clinical symptoms become evident in the first or second decade with the appearance of white-grayish opacities, which involve the superficial stromal layer of the cornea.	575	765
18470323	Thereafter, the lesions tend to become larger, aggregate, and extend deeper and toward the periphery.	766	867
18470323	In 1994, a gene for several corneal dystrophies and the transforming growth factor-induced gene (TGFBI, also known as BIGH3) were mapped to human chromosome 5 (5q31).	868	1034
18470323	During the same year, it was also discovered that the protein product of the TGFBI gene is expressed in the cornea.	1035	1150
18470323	Three years later, Munier et al. reported that these disorders are caused by mutations in TGFBI.	1151	1247
18470323	Mutations in the same gene also cause granular corneal dystrophies (GCD; reviewed by Kannabiran and Klintworth).	1248	1360
18470323	TGFBI encodes for a 68 kDa extracellular matrix protein.	1361	1417
18470323	So far, few mutations have been described in this gene as causative of LCD type I.	1418	1500
18470323	The mutation list includes R124C, V505D, L518P, V539D, A546D, P551Q, L569R, H572R, and V625D.	1501	1594
18470323	The mutation C>T at the nucleotide position 417 at codon 124 (R124C) in exon 4 is the most frequent throughout the world.	1595	1716
18470323	Considering that there are no genetic studies on lattice corneal dystrophy in our country, we determined the clinical, ophthalmic, and genetic characteristics in a Chilean family having this disease.	1717	1916
18470323	Our results suggest anticipation in the disease.	1917	1965
18470323	We report for the first time the presence of the TGFBI mutation segregating with lattice corneal dystrophy type I in Chilean patients.	1966	2100
18470323	The molecular basis of anticipation in LCDI, which is not mediated by trinucleotide repeat expansions in the BIGH3, remains elusive.	2101	2233
18470323	The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Hospital University of Chile and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.	2234	2391
18470323	The pedigree of the four-generation family was delineated (Figure 1).	2392	2461
18470323	After obtaining informed consent, nine members from three consecutive generations of a Chilean family with lattice corneal dystrophy were enrolled, six affected and three unaffected.	2462	2644
18470323	The proband was initially examined because of ocular pain and redness.	2645	2715
18470323	The LCD type I diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical examination.	2716	2787
18470323	The nine members of the family, affected and not affected, were examined over two years.	2788	2876
18470323	The family history suggests Spanish origin.	2877	2920
18470323	An extensive clinical history of participating members of the family was developed and particular attention was paid to the age of onset, initial signs and symptoms, and corneal structure.	2921	3109
18470323	Clinical examination included best corrected visual acuity according to the best line of Snellen acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, color cornea photography, applanation tonography, and dilated fundus examination.	3110	3321
18470323	Autorefractometry measurement and keratometry were performed (Topcon RM-A7000, Tokyo, Japan).	3322	3415
18470323	Stereopsis was quantitatively assessed with the Titmus Fly Stereo Test (Stereo Optical Co., Inc., Chicago, IL).	3416	3527
18470323	The lesions were considered to be synchronic if the patients perceived the first symptoms in both eyes with a time difference of less than a month.	3528	3675
18470323	All individuals with corneal commitment were considered clinically affected.	3676	3752
18470323	Patients were classified in degree of severity according to best-corrected vision (Table 1) and the number of lesions and corneal commitment.	3753	3894
18470323	The corneal phenotype of all index patients was assessed by slit lamp biomicroscopy examination and reviewed by an investigator ignorant of the genetic status.	3895	4054
18470323	Although the patients, II-1, III-2 and IV-2, were not examined in this study, their age of onset were obtained from an interview of patient II-1.	4055	4200
18470323	Blood samples were colleted in tubes containing EDTA and total DNA was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes.	4201	4315
18470323	Exon 4 of the proband was amplified using previously described primers.	4316	4387
18470323	The resulting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was purified using the Wizard® Gel purification kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) and sequenced using Big DyeTM sequencing reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA), and automated sequencing was performed by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI3700 (Applied Biosystems).	4388	4721
18470323	To analyze the same mutation in the nine family members, we designed a new simple and rapid detection method based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP).	4722	4927
18470323	To carry out the PCR-RFLP analyses, genomic DNA from nine family members was amplified by PCR using the primers BIGH3 F1: 5′-CTT TCC CAC ATG CCT CCT CGT-3′ (forward) and BIGH3 Rmut: 5′-TCT CAG GCC TCA GCT TCT CCC TGC-3′ (reverse).	4928	5158
18470323	The “T” nucleotide at position 21 in the sequence of the reverse primer was replaced for a “C” to generate the PstI restriction site in the mutated allele.	5159	5314
18470323	The 221 products were digested using the PstI restriction enzyme for 3 h at 37 °C.	5315	5397
18470323	Fragments were resolved by electrophoresis in a 4% Nusieve agarose (3:1) gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light.	5398	5546
18470323	After digestion, the “T” allele consisted of three fragments of 21, 76, and 124 base pairs (bp), and the “C” allele consisted of two fragments of 97 and 124 bp.	5547	5707
18470323	The four-generation lattice corneal dystrophy type I family studied consisted of nine affected and nine unaffected individuals (Figure 1).	5708	5846
18470323	Eight relatives of the proband were examined clinically.	5847	5903
18470323	Five of them were affected by LCD type I (two males and three females) and three were not affected (two males and one female), as shown in the pedigree (Figure 1).	5904	6067
18470323	The phenotypic features of affected and unaffected family members are summarized in Table 1.	6068	6160
18470323	The age of onset of patients II-1, III-2, and IV-2 were obtained from an interview of patient II-1, although they were not clinically analyzed in this study.	6161	6318
18470323	The proband was an eight-year-old boy (IV-5).	6319	6364
18470323	The presence of LCD type I in three continuous generations indicates an autosomal dominant transmission.	6365	6469
18470323	All patients clinically studied reported the beginning of lesions in a synchronic way in both eyes except for patient II-2 who noticed the lesion in the second eye one year after the lesion in the first eye.	6470	6677
18470323	Visual sharpness ranged from 1.0 to 0.13; the worst were in the older generations.	6678	6760
18470323	All patients had different degrees of astigmatism, with intraocular pressure (IOP) within the normal range (IOP<21) and had normal stereopsis.	6761	6903
18470323	The proband’s grandfather, at 69 years of age, was examined and diagnosed with LCD.	6904	6987
18470323	His symptoms initiated with sensitivity to sunlight, episodes of ocular pain, and redness at 42 years of age.	6988	7097
18470323	Slit-lamp examination revealed irregularity of the epithelial surface with subepithelial and anterior stromal scarring resulting in diffuse clouding of the central cornea (Figure 2A,B).	7098	7283
18470323	Asymmetric commitment and vascularization of the cornea was observed.	7284	7353
18470323	He was classified in maximal severity according to best-corrected vision (0.13 for both eyes) and corneal commitment.	7354	7471
18470323	Typical, fine branching lattice lines could be seen in the peripheral anterior stroma, which was outside the area of central opacification.	7472	7611
18470323	Central corneal sensation was significantly decreased, and the patient had a history of recurrent corneal erosions in the fourth and fifth decades of life.	7612	7767
18470323	The symptoms of the proband’s aunt began with episodes of acute ocular pain, redness, and photophobia at 30 years of age.	7768	7889
18470323	The frequency and severity of these episodes increased coincident with a gradual deterioration of vision in both eyes.	7890	8008
18470323	At 42 years of age, she was classified in maximal severity according to best-corrected vision (0.28 in the right eye [OD] and 0.13 in the left eye [OS]) and corneal commitment.	8009	8185
18470323	Slit-lamp examination revealed an irregular epithelial surface with subepithelial and anterior stromal scarring, resulting in diffuse clouding of the central cornea.	8186	8351
18470323	She showed a network of linear opacities associated with other smaller opaque spots and refractive lattice lines (Figure 2C).	8352	8477
18470323	No vascularization of the cornea was observed.	8478	8524
18470323	Central corneal sensation was decreased.	8525	8565
18470323	The proband’s mother, at 40 years of age, initially presented a mild subepithelial scarring and opacification, which gradually progressed to include elevated subepithelial opacities, fine lattice lines, diffuse “ground glass” haze in the anterior stroma, and corneal grafts (Figure 2D,E).	8566	8854
18470323	Best-corrected vision was 0.5 OD and 0.4 OS.	8855	8899
18470323	The left cornea contained opacifications from presumed recurrent disease.	8900	8973
18470323	Fine branching lattice lines could be seen in the peripheral anterior stroma.	8974	9051
18470323	Although patients IV-3 and IV-4 did not have lesions at time of the exams, they had a history of recurrent corneal erosions in both eyes since the ages of three and four, respectively.	9052	9236
18470323	The proband had a history of recurrent corneal erosions in both eyes, which began when he was four years old.	9237	9346
18470323	Slit lamp examination showed the presence of large, typical fine branching lattice lines in the anterior stroma in OD (Figure 2F).	9347	9477
18470323	A clear area was preserved around the corneal-scleral limbus.	9478	9539
18470323	Best-corrected vision was 0.5 in the right eye (OD) and 0.67 in the left eye (OS).	9540	9622
18470323	The average age at onset for affected family members was 18.9±15.7 years old (3–42 years old; Table 1).	9623	9726
18470323	However, the age of the beginning of symptoms has been progressively younger in succeeding generations.	9727	9830
18470323	Generation II includes two individuals (II-1 and II-3) with the age of onset at 37 and 42 years old, respectively; generation III includes three individuals (III-2, III-5, and III-6) with the age of onset at 17, 28, and 30 years old, respectively; and generation IV includes four individuals (IV-2, IV-3, IV-4, and IV-5) with the age of onset at 5, 3, 4, and 4 years, respectively.	9831	10212
18470323	Exon 4 of TGFB1 of the proband was analyzed by sequencing (Figure 3).	10213	10282
18470323	The sequence revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, R124C (417C>T).	10283	10354
18470323	To discriminate between normal and mutated alleles, we developed a new PCR-RFLP method.	10355	10442
18470323	The mutation was analyzed in six affected (including the proband) and three healthy family members, revealing an identical heterozygous change in all affected.	10443	10602
18470323	As expected, the mutation was absent in the unaffected individuals (Figure 4).	10603	10681
18470323	All affected family members showed phenotypic characteristics corresponding to LCDI.	10682	10766
18470323	Within the family group, the patients showed a variable commitment that might be explained not only with the course of the variant disease but also with the amount of stromal damage over the years, which apparently increased with age.	10767	11001
18470323	We report a case with a heterozygous mutation detected by sequencing in exon 4 of TGFBI.	11002	11090
18470323	This alteration has been reported previously in several ethnic groups.	11091	11161
18470323	The molecular analysis by the PCR-RFLP method developed here offers an easy, rapid, and accurate diagnosis of patients with R124C.	11162	11292
18470323	The genealogical information for the family allows us to trace the mutation only as far as the proband’s maternal grandfather who seems to be of Spanish origin.	11293	11453
18470323	There is no information indicating that the great grandparents had any ophthalmic disorder, which suggests this is a new mutation.	11454	11584
18470323	We observed a decrease in the age of onset in three succeeding generations in the family of the proband.	11585	11689
18470323	Analyzing previous reports of LCD1 families, we found one case describing the same point mutations in a family with decreasing age of diagnosis in successive generations similar to ours, although they do not document the age of onset.	11690	11924
18470323	This could be similarly interpreted as genetic anticipation of the disease.	11925	12000
18470323	Anticipation has been frequently described for diseases caused by the expansion of unstable triplet repeats, which is not the case with LCD1.	12001	12142
18470323	Anticipation has been also described for point mutations, insertions, and deletions of a small group of genes including TCOF1, located in 5q32 and mutated in Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS; OMIM 154500); EBP, a gene located in Xp11.22-p11.23 and mutated in X-chromosomal dominant chondrodysplasia syndrome (CHH, OMIM 302960); the transthyretin gene (TTR), located in 18q12.1 and mutated in familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP, OMIM:176300]); and copper–zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a gene located in 21q22.1 and mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, OMIM 105400).	12143	12723
18470323	In some of these diseases, a genetic explanation of anticipation has been suggested.	12724	12808
18470323	For example, in the chondrodysplasia syndrome, somatic mosaicism and differences in X chromosome inactivation can explain the phenomenon of anticipation and in amyloid polyneuropathy, the differences in the age of disease onset might be explained by genetic interactions among multiple loci.	12809	13100
18470323	In our case, genetic anticipation might be explained in at least three ways.	13101	13177
18470323	One way is the fact that a previous ophthalmic history of the parents and grandparents probably prompted the family to look earlier for medical examination.	13178	13334
18470323	It is possible that several mild cases of the syndrome, especially when the affected person does not feel impaired, will go undiagnosed until the occurrence of a more severely affected sibling or offspring.	13335	13541
18470323	Another explanation of anticipation may be the result of the loss of a protective allele or another interacting gene from the affected parent.	13542	13684
18470323	Thus the protective allele or interacting gene could ameliorate the effect of the mutated allele in the affected parent.	13685	13805
18470323	Since such protective allele or protective gene could be absent in the offspring, it can not exhibit any protective effect in these subjects.	13806	13947
18470323	The final possible way may be the gain of a susceptibility allele from the non-affected parent, which could worsen the effect of the mutated allele.	13948	14096
18470323	If we consider that individuals III-4 and III-7 are not related, the probability of gaining a susceptibility allele simultaneously by individuals IV-3, IV-4, and IV-5 is low.	14097	14271
18470323	In conclusion, since the mutation at the hot spot nucleotide 417 can be easily, rapidly, and cost-effectively evaluated by PCR sequencing or by PCR-RFLP, identification of this mutation will allow Chilean patients to benefit from a timely and accurate molecular diagnosis of LCD type I.	14272	14558
18470323	Genetic testing of TGFBI mutations in LCD type I patients will also contribute to improve their clinical classification, management, and eventual genetic counseling.	14559	14724
18470323	Although the R124C mutation is one of the genetic causes of the disease, different genetic and environmental factors may govern the age of onset.	14725	14870
28468941	Caveolae are bulb-shaped, 50- to 100-nm plasma membrane invaginations found in many cell types, including adipocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts.	0	153
28468941	They serve as signaling hubs and are involved in endocytosis and tension sensing (Parton and del Pozo, 2013).	154	263
28468941	Caveolae can flatten in response to stretching of the plasma membrane and reduce membrane tension (Sinha et al., 2011), and caveolae in part also regulate both rapid and long-term dilation of blood vessels in response to increased shear stress (Yu et al., 2006).	264	526
28468941	Caveolin and cavin families of proteins are essential for the characteristic shape of caveolae.	527	622
28468941	Deletion of caveolin-1 (Cav1) leads to loss of caveolae (Drab et al., 2001), except in cardiac and skeletal muscle, in which caveolin-3 compensates for the loss (Galbiati et al., 2001).	623	808
28468941	Another member of this family, caveolin-2, interacts with Cav1 but is not required to generate caveolae (Nassar and Parat, 2015).	809	938
28468941	The cavin family of proteins consists of four members (cavins 1–4), which form homo- and hetero-oligomers in the cytoplasm and are recruited to caveolae, where they stabilize caveolin oligomers (Kovtun et al., 2015; Nassar and Parat, 2015).	939	1179
28468941	Cavin-1 appears to be especially important because it interacts with caveolin-1, and knockout of cavin-1 leads to loss of caveolae (Liu et al., 2008).	1180	1330
28468941	The caveolar coat is believed to contain ∼150–200 caveolin subunits and 50 cavins, which function cooperatively to establish the caveolae shape (Gambin et al., 2014).	1331	1497
28468941	Cav1 contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic end responsible for oligomerization (amino acids 61–101; Sargiacomo et al., 1995) and a scaffolding domain (amino acids 82–101) responsible for interaction with a number of proteins, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptors (Li et al., 1995; Boscher and Nabi, 2012).	1498	1857
28468941	The adjacent stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (102–134) inserts into the plasma membrane (Monier et al., 1995).	1858	1971
28468941	The importance of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (amino acids 135–178) is less clear.	1972	2060
28468941	This region appears to be required for interactions of Cav1 oligomers and binding of Cav1 to trans-Golgi membranes during posttranslational modification of the protein before export to the plasma membrane (Schlegel and Lisanti, 2000).	2061	2295
28468941	The C-terminus also contains three palmitoylation sites (cysteines 133, 143, and 156) believed to stabilize Cav1 oligomers (Monier et al., 1996) and regulate their membrane association (Bakhshi et al., 2013).	2296	2504
28468941	Several germline and somatic mutations in Cav1 have been identified.	2505	2573
28468941	A germline homozygous nonsense mutation at position 38 of Cav1 (p.Glu38X) was identified in a patient with Berardinelli–Seip congenital lipodystrophy, which is characterized by the near absence of adipose tissue (Kim et al., 2008).	2574	2805
28468941	Hypertriglyceridemia and partial lipodystrophy affecting the upper part of the body were associated with a heterozygous nonsense mutation at position 134 of Cav1 (p.I134fsdelA-X137; Cao et al., 2008).	2806	3006
28468941	A heterozygous c.474delA frameshift mutation, which alters the final 20 amino acids (p.P158PfsX22), was identified in multiple members of a family with heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; Austin et al., 2012).	3007	3228
28468941	It is unclear how the frameshift c.474delA mutation at the C-terminal of Cav1, which alters only the final 20 amino acids but leaves other domains intact, affects the function of caveolae.	3229	3417
28468941	Because the molecular basis for the disease has not been studied, here we address the signaling abnormalities associated with this mutation, using dermal fibroblasts from the family carrying the c.474delA mutation (Austin et al., 2012).	3418	3654
28468941	Studying this mutation might provide clues about the pathogenesis of PAH seen in these patients.	3655	3751
28468941	The model in Figure 1A describes specific Cav1 domains and the site of the c.474delA mutation.	3752	3846
28468941	The resulting frameshift alters the final C-terminal 20 amino acids of Cav1 (Cav1*, Figure 1B).	3847	3942
28468941	Genomic sequencing confirmed the presence of Cav1* c.474delA mutation in primary patient fibroblasts from these patients (Figure 1C).	3943	4076
28468941	All patients were heterozygous for the c.474delA mutation, because the juxtaposition of one wild-type (WT) and one mutated sequence led to a double sequencing signal after the deletion.	4077	4262
28468941	Transmission electron microscopy showed that Cav1* fibroblasts formed caveolae having a normal size distribution (mean diameter 75.3 ± 0.5 nm in control fibroblasts vs. 76.0 ± 0.7 nm in Cav1* fibroblasts); however, their number in Cav1* fibroblasts was half that in controls (Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure S1).	4263	4577
28468941	Cav1 mRNA expression was not significantly different between fibroblasts from healthy control subjects and Cav1* patients (Figure 2A).	4578	4712
28468941	Total Cav1 protein level was investigated using an antibody against the N-terminal in WT Cav1 and Cav1*.	4713	4817
28468941	We observed no significant change in total Cav1 protein expression in Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 2B, top).	4818	4923
28468941	An antibody against the C-terminal, which is changed due to the frameshift mutation in Cav1*, detected only nonmutated Cav1.	4924	5048
28468941	In line with the sequencing data, we observed that the patient fibroblasts were heterozygous for c.474delA mutation, as they contained ∼50% nonmutated Cav1 expression compared with WT fibroblasts (Figure 2B, middle).	5049	5265
28468941	Moreover, the expression of cavin-1 was reduced (Figure 2C).	5266	5326
28468941	Cavin-1 expression correlates with the number of caveolae (Voldstedlund et al., 2003; Hill et al., 2008); therefore these results are in accordance with reduced caveolae numbers found by electron microscopy.	5327	5534
28468941	We next studied endocytosis of fluorescently labeled cholera toxin subunit B (CtxB).	5535	5619
28468941	After an acid wash to remove extracellular CtxB, all cells showed colocalization of Cav1 and CtxB (Figure 3A), with similar uptake of CtxB in WT and Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 3, B and C).	5620	5807
28468941	Furthermore, extraction of cholesterol using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) reduced the uptake of CtxB by 50% in both control and Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 3, B and D).	5808	5974
28468941	Caveolae fuse with early endosomes, and CtxB is subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus (Pelkmans et al., 2004).	5975	6095
28468941	To discriminate from clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we also looked at the uptake of CtxB in transferrin receptor (CD71)–positive endosomes.	6096	6235
28468941	We found a similar uptake of CtxB in the Golgi apparatus of both groups (colocalization with the Golgi marker GM130; Supplemental Figure S2, A and B), with almost the entire Golgi network stained by CtxB (Supplemental Figure S2C).	6236	6466
28468941	In contrast, low levels of endosomal labeling were seen in both groups (Supplemental Figure S2, D and E).	6467	6572
28468941	As a control, we repeated the foregoing experiments in Cav1−/− fibroblasts obtained from Cav1−/− mice and found that MβCD treatment of these cells had no significant effect on CtxB uptake (Supplemental Figure S3A).	6573	6787
28468941	Endosomal uptake was increased in Cav1−/− fibroblasts (Supplemental Figure S3B) perhaps as a compensation for the loss of Cav1.	6788	6915
28468941	These results show that patient Cav1* fibroblasts did not phenocopy Cav1−/− fibroblasts.	6916	7004
28468941	Next, to assess the functional significance of the mutant protein in Cav1* fibroblasts, we used fibroblasts from Cav1−/− mice (Zhao et al., 2009) and expressed control human WT Cav1, human Cav1*, or a combination of both to mimic heterozygous patient fibroblasts.	7005	7268
28468941	Sequencing of constructs after site-specific mutagenesis confirmed the deletion of adenine 474 (Supplemental Figure S4A).	7269	7390
28468941	As shown in Figure 4A, staining for Cav1 in transfected cells demonstrated that Cav1−/− fibroblasts transfected with Cav1* had a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern.	7391	7557
28468941	In contrast, fibroblasts transfected with WT Cav1 or fibroblasts having 1:1 WT Cav1 and Cav1* showed a punctate staining pattern (Figure 4A) resembling the staining pattern observed in human Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 3A).	7558	7779
28468941	To assess further the intracellular localization of Cav1* cells, we cotransfected Cav1* and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–targeted DsRed and found that cells expressing only Cav1* showed accumulation of the protein in the ER (Figure 4B), which we did not observe in cells expressing WT Cav1 or WT Cav1 in combination with Cav1* (Supplemental Figure S4B).	7780	8131
28468941	We also performed experiments using different ratios of WT and mutant Cav1*.	8132	8208
28468941	We observed a diffuse staining pattern at low levels of WT Cav1 (0–25%).	8209	8281
28468941	However, as the proportion of WT Cav1 increased relative to Cav1*, we observed distinctly more punctate staining (Figure 4C).	8282	8407
28468941	Moreover, using a Myc-tagged Cav1* construct, we found that Cav1* has a punctate staining pattern in the presence of WT Cav1, suggesting that WT Cav1 rescues the defective diffuse staining phenotype of mutant Cav1* (Figure 4C; see Supplemental Figure S4C for higher-magnification images).	8408	8696
28468941	Given the apparent colocalization of WT Cav1 and mutant Cav1*, we next addressed whether there was any direct interaction between the two.	8697	8835
28468941	For this, we generated two plasmids: WT Cav1 labeled with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; Zimnicka et al., 2016) and Cav1* labeled with a Myc tag.	8836	8983
28468941	As shown in Figure 5A, the YFP and Myc tag significantly overlapped, suggesting colocalization of WT and mutant Cav1*.	8984	9102
28468941	Specificity of the Myc staining was evident by the absence of staining in cells that were only transfected with WT Cav1 (Figure 5A, bottom).	9103	9243
28468941	Immunoprecipitation of WT Cav1 pulled down a significant amount of Myc-labeled mutant Cav1*, demonstrating that WT and mutant Cav1 indeed interacted (Figure 5B).	9244	9405
28468941	Cav1 molecules normally form oligomers consisting of 14–16 individual proteins (Sargiacomo et al., 1995), and we found that oligomerization was not impaired in Cav1* fibroblasts, as the ratio of oligomer/monomer was identical between WT and Cav1* human fibroblasts (Supplemental Figure S5A).	9406	9697
28468941	We observed a number of functional abnormalities in Cav1* human fibroblasts, with increased proliferation being the most striking.	9698	9828
28468941	Cav1* fibroblasts proliferated at twofold greater rate than control fibroblasts (Figure 6A).	9829	9921
28468941	In addition, Cav1* human fibroblasts had a modest increase in collagen3A1 expression (Supplemental Figure S5B) and collagen secretion (Figure 6B).	9922	10068
28468941	Synthesis of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) was also increased (Figure 6C), suggesting that Cav1* fibroblasts were activated.	10069	10197
28468941	Because Cav1 is known to suppress fibroblast proliferation (Razani et al., 2001a), we next addressed whether Cav1* could also inhibit proliferation.	10198	10346
28468941	Messenger mRNA levels revealed a similar transfection efficiency of both control Cav1 and Cav1* in Cav1−/− fibroblasts (Supplemental Figure S5C).	10347	10492
28468941	We observed, however, that transfection of WT Cav1 decreased fibroblast proliferation by 50%, whereas transfection with Cav1* had no effect (Figure 6D).	10493	10645
28468941	Because proliferation was markedly increased in fibroblasts from patients carrying the Cav1* mutation (Figure 6A), we addressed possible mechanisms.	10646	10794
28468941	Members of the TGFβ family of receptors interact with Cav1 (Razani et al., 2001b).	10795	10877
28468941	In most cases, signaling through these receptors leads to phosphorylation of mothers against decapentaplegic protein (Smad) 2/3 in response to TGFβ and activins, whereas Smad1/5/8 is phosphorylated in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; Horbelt et al., 2012).	10878	11146
28468941	At baseline, we observed marked increases in Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation in Cav1* fibroblasts, whereas Smad2/3 phosphorylation was not altered compared with controls (Figure 7A), consistent with activation of the BMP pathway.	11147	11370
28468941	Stimulation with TGFβ increased Smad2/3 phosphorylation to a similar extent in both cell types (Figure 7B), confirming that signaling downstream of TGFβ is normal both at baseline and after stimulation.	11371	11573
28468941	Furthermore, increasing WT Cav1 levels in human Cav1* fibroblasts did not reduce Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation (Figure 7C), arguing against Cav1 haploinsufficiency as an explanation for increased Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation.	11574	11792
28468941	Because phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 occurs through activin receptor–like kinase (ALK) 1/2/3/6 (Goumans et al., 2002; Schmierer and Hill, 2007), we next determined whether ALK1/2/3/6 activity was responsible for the hyperproliferation seen in Cav1* fibroblasts.	11793	12054
28468941	We used LDN193189, an inhibitor of these ALK receptors that blocks Smad1/5/8 activation (Cuny et al., 2008).	12055	12163
28468941	As shown in Figure 8A, LDN193189 significantly reduced proliferation of Cav1* fibroblasts but not WT cells.	12164	12271
28468941	In contrast, SB431542, an inhibitor of ALK4/5/7 upstream of Smad2/3, equally reduced proliferation rates in both WT and Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 8B).	12272	12422
28468941	Our results provide insights into the phenotype of the Cav1 c.474delA mutation of Cav1 at the C-terminus and underlying basis of PAH in these patients.	12423	12574
28468941	The p.P158PfsX22 frameshift mutation in Cav1 occurred at the final 20 amino acids of the C-terminus, leaving the rest of the protein unaffected, specifically the Cav1 oligomerization domain (residues 61–101), scaffolding domain (82–101), and transmembrane domain (residues 102–134; Li et al., 1995).	12575	12874
28468941	In the ER, 14–16 Cav1 proteins oligomerize through their oligomerization domain (residues 61–101; Sargiacomo et al., 1995).	12875	12998
28468941	Subsequently, in the Golgi apparatus, several oligomers interact and combine with cholesterol to form detergent-resistant complexes, after which fully formed caveolae are transported to the plasmalemma (Hayer et al., 2010).	12999	13222
28468941	Oligomerization in the ER is a prerequisite for successful trafficking of Cav1 to the plasma membrane (Ren et al., 2004).	13223	13344
28468941	We observed that the Cav1* patient fibroblasts formed normal-appearing and -sized caveolae, although their overall number was reduced by half.	13345	13487
28468941	We found, using Cav1−/− fibroblasts, that expression of Cav1* alone resulted in the failure of fibroblasts to generate caveolae, and Cav1* was trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum.	13488	13668
28468941	Supplying WT Cav1 to these cells expressing Cav1* rescued the trafficking defect of Cav1*.	13669	13759
28468941	We also observed that Cav1* colocalized and interacted with WT Cav1, consistent with the finding that oligomerization appeared normal in human Cav1* fibroblasts.	13760	13921
28468941	This is likely due to the intact oligomerization domain of Cav1*, which enabled mutant Cav1* to interact normally with WT Cav1.	13922	14049
28468941	The reason for the reduction in number of caveolae in Cav1* fibroblasts to half of normal values is not clear.	14050	14160
28468941	One possibility is that the frameshift mutation occurred at the final 20 amino acids of the C-terminus in proximity to palmitoylation sites interfered with formation and stability of caveolae (Schlegel and Lisanti, 2000).	14161	14382
28468941	We used CtxB to study endocytosis.	14383	14417
28468941	CtxB binds to ganglioside GM1 on the cell membrane and is internalized by endocytosis.	14418	14504
28468941	Several pathways for endocytosis, including clathrin-dependent and -independent pathways, have been described.	14505	14615
28468941	Among the clathrin-independent pathways are endocytosis mediated by caveolae and the recently described pathway clathrin-independent carriers (CLIC)/glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored proteins–enriched early endosomal compartment (GEEC) pathway.	14616	14865
28468941	Depending on the cell type and number of caveolae, different routes are used for endocytosis.	14866	14959
28468941	For example, in fibroblasts, the majority of CtxB (∼80%) was internalized via a caveolae-dependent pathway; however, cell types with a low level of Cav1 mostly internalized CtxB through the clathrin-dependent pathway.	14960	15177
28468941	Here we discriminated between clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis by staining for transferrin receptor CD71 (clathrin-mediated endocytosis; Supplemental Figure S2).	15178	15354
28468941	We found that human WT and Cav1* fibroblasts primarily used a clathrin-independent pathway to internalize CtxB.	15355	15466
28468941	A further complicating factor is that the CLIC/GEEC pathway plays an important role in the uptake of CtxB in fibroblasts and this pathway is up-regulated in the absence of caveolae.	15467	15648
28468941	Therefore it is possible that the observed normal CtxB uptake in human Cav1* fibroblasts, despite the reduction in number of caveolae, may be related to compensatory upregulation of the CLIC/GEEC pathway.	15649	15853
28468941	Another important difference between Cav1* fibroblasts and WT fibroblasts was the twofold greater proliferation rate of Cav1* fibroblasts.	15854	15992
28468941	Cav1* mutation was responsible for fibroblast hyperproliferation, because transfection of WT human Cav1 but not human Cav1* into mouse Cav1−/− fibroblasts reduced fibroblast proliferation.	15993	16181
28468941	We also investigated the activation of signaling pathways mediating the response.	16182	16263
28468941	We observed a marked difference between human WT and Cav1* fibroblasts in Smad signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in Cav1* fibroblasts.	16264	16430
28468941	Ligands from the TGFβ family (TGFβ, activins, BMPs) induce the association of two type I receptors (ALK1 to ALK7) with two type II receptors (Schmierer and Hill, 2007) and downstream phosphorylation of Smads 1/2/3/5/8 (Schmierer and Hill, 2007).	16431	16676
28468941	The phosphorylated Smads interact with Smad4 to activate gene transcription (Moustakas et al., 2001).	16677	16778
28468941	Distinct type I receptors phosphorylate different Smads: ALK1/2/3/6 phosphorylate Smads1/5/8, whereas ALK 4/5/7 phosphorylate Smads2/3 (Goumans et al., 2002; Schmierer and Hill, 2007).	16779	16963
28468941	We used LDN193189 to inhibit ALK1/2/3/6 (Cuny et al., 2008) and SB431542 to inhibit ALK4/5/7 (Inman et al., 2002).	16964	17078
28468941	Inhibition of ALK1/2/3/6 significantly reduced proliferation of Cav1* fibroblasts compared with control fibroblasts, suggesting that ALK1/2/3/6-mediated Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation was critical in mediating Cav1* fibroblast hyperproliferation.	17079	17320
28468941	Fibroblast hyperproliferation has been linked to the pathogenesis of PAH (Das et al., 2000), and, as our findings suggest, it may also be involved in the pathogenesis of PAH associated with c.474delA mutation of Cav1.	17321	17538
28468941	In summary, our findings provide the first molecular understanding of the c.474delA Cav1 mutation associated with PAH in patients.	17539	17669
28468941	This mutation in the C-terminus of Cav1 induced Smad1/5/8 hyperphosphorylation and increased fibroblast proliferation.	17670	17788
28468941	The results highlight an underappreciated role of the final 20 amino acids in the C-terminus of Cav1 in mediating Smad signaling and fibroblast hyperproliferation.	17789	17952
28468941	Primary skin fibroblasts from healthy subjects (n = 3) and members of the family carrying the c.474delA mutation in Cav1 (n = 3) were obtained from a punch biopsy as described previously (Austin et al., 2012).	17953	18162
28468941	Written informed consent for all studies was obtained according to protocols approved by the institutional review board at Vanderbilt University.	18163	18308
28468941	Fibroblasts were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).	18309	18509
28468941	For studies using mouse fibroblasts, cells were isolated from tail-tip biopsies of newborn Cav1−/− mice (Zhao et al., 2009).	18510	18634
28468941	After trypsinization for 20 min, fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin.	18635	18783
28468941	Proliferation was quantified by determining the incorporation of the thymidine analogue 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) with the Click-It EdU kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).	18784	18998
28468941	Cells were incubated with 10 μM EdU for 1 h. Specific ALK-pathway inhibitors LDN193189 (targeting the ALK1/ALK2/ALK3/ALK6 family; Cuny et al., 2008) and SB431542 (targeting the ALK4/ALK5/ALK7 family; Inman et al., 2002) were obtained from Stemcell Technologies (Vancouver, Canada).	18999	19280
28468941	These agents were incubated with cells for 24 h before EdU administration.	19281	19355
28468941	Collagen production was measured using the QuickZyme BioSciences soluble collagen assay kit (Leiden, Netherlands).	19356	19470
28468941	Fibroblasts (50,000) were grown for 4 d in six-well plates and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and collagen was solubilized by adding 0.5 M acetic acid overnight.	19471	19646
28468941	Measurements were normalized for total protein content.	19647	19702

28468941	Results were normalized to β2-microglobulin (B2M) and compared with control samples (2-ΔΔCt method).	20560	20660
28468941	Human Cav1 was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector, and a c.474delA mutation was introduced using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with specific primers (Supplemental Table S1).	20661	20881
28468941	To confirm the mutation, Sanger sequencing was performed using 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Figure 3; Life Technologies).	20882	20995
28468941	Immunoblotting was performed on proteins isolated using RIPA buffer.	20996	21064
28468941	Protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).	21065	21157
28468941	Primary antibodies used were against C-terminal Cav1 (Ab32577), N-terminal Cav1 (Ab2910), and Ki67 (Ab16667), all purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and cavin-1 (18892-1-AP; Rosemont, IL).	21158	21349
28468941	To confirm equal protein loading, blots were stripped in Restore Western Blot stripping buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 10 min and reprobed with anti–β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).	21350	21543
28468941	Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ.	21544	21590
28468941	After background subtraction, ratios were calculated (intensity of caveolin-1 band divided by intensity of corresponding actin band) and normalized to average ratio in the WT group.	21591	21772
28468941	To assess the ratio of oligomerized Cav1 to free monomer, samples were collected in 2% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside buffer and lysed using sonication before loading on SDS–PAGE gel as previously described (Bakhshi et al., 2013).	21773	22000
28468941	For immunofluorescence stainings, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS.	22001	22126
28468941	After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4°C.	22127	22254
28468941	Matching fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h and coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold antifade mountant containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen).	22255	22447
28468941	Images were obtained on a LSM710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) using a 63×/1.4 Oil Plan-Apochromat objective and a 25-mW argon laser.	22448	22604
28468941	We cloned human Cav1 cDNA into a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing an N-terminal Myc-His tag and introduced the c.474delA mutation using site-specific mutagenesis as described earlier.	22605	22793
28468941	Wild-type, C-terminal, YFP-tagged caveolin-1 was generated as previously described (Chen et al., 2012).	22794	22897
28468941	HEK293T cells were transfected with both plasmids, and after 3 d, proteins were isolated according to the Crosslink IP kit protocol (Pierce, Rockford, IL).	22898	23053
28468941	A total of 1000 μg of proteins was immunoprecipitated using 2 μg of antibodies against either Myc tag (MA1–21316; ThermoFisher Scientific) or GFP/YPF (Ab6556; Abcam).	23054	23220
28468941	After overnight incubation, proteins were eluted, and an immunoblot against Myc tag was performed.	23221	23319
28468941	Fibroblasts were transfected with FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 2 μg of DNA/8 μl of FuGENE according manufacturer’s recommendations.	23320	23490
28468941	Plasmids used were either pcDNA3vectors containing human Cav1 or p-DsRed2-ER plasmid to fluorescently label endoplasmic reticulum (632409; Clontech, Mountain View, CA).	23491	23659
28468941	Human WT caveolin-1 cDNA was cloned into the pLJM1 vector (19319; Addgene) using Nhe1 and EcoR1 restriction enzymes (NEB, Ipswich, MA) using the primers listed in the Supplemental Methods.	23660	23848
28468941	These restriction enzymes also removed the GFP sequence of pLJM1.	23849	23914
28468941	Plasmids were transfected together with pMD2.G and psPAX2 plasmids (12259 and 12260; Addgene) into HEK 293T cells to allow for lentiviral production.	23915	24064
28468941	After 2 and 3 d, supernatant was collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and concentrated using PEG-it solution (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA).	24065	24219
28468941	For transduction, 4 μg/ml Polybrene was added to the medium (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX).	24220	24319
28468941	Viral titers were determined on genomic DNA of fibroblasts 3 d after transduction using primers against the viral RRE element and the UCR111 region of human genomic DNA (Supplemental Table S1).	24320	24513
28468941	The absolute number of infectious units was calculated using a standard provided in the Global UltraRapid Lentiviral Titer Kit (System Biosciences).	24514	24662
28468941	Fibroblasts were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 5.	24663	24728
28468941	Endocytosis was assessed using CtxB.	24729	24765
28468941	Cells were labeled with 7.5 μg/ml Alexa 594–labeled CtxB for 15 or 30 min at 37°C in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml BSA.	24766	24881
28468941	For cholesterol depletion, cells were pretreated with 5 mM MβCD (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min before adding CtxB.	24882	24992
28468941	Excess CtxB at cell surface was removed by acid stripping (30 s with 0.2 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 2.5).	24993	25101
28468941	Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, and stained for Cav1.	25102	25210
28468941	For quantification of CtxB uptake in the Golgi or endosomes, cells were stained with GM130 or CD71 (both from ThermoFisher Scientific), and images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope using a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 oil objective.	25211	25460
28468941	Using ImageJ, the Otsu threshold tool was used to generate a binary image that was used as a mask to select the same region in the CtxB channel.	25461	25605
28468941	Mean pixel intensity and area were measured for the total cell and the masked region, and percentage uptake in the Golgi was subsequently calculated after subtracting background intensities.	25606	25796
28468941	Imaging parameters and settings for the generation of binary images were identical for all images.	25797	25895
28468941	For colocalization analysis, we used Zeiss Zen 2.1 software.	25896	25956
28468941	Cells were grown on 35-mm dishes, rinsed with prewarmed, serum-free DMEM, and fixed with prewarmed 2.5% glutaraldehyde in DMEM for 30 min.	25957	26095
28468941	Samples were then washed with PBS, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2–7.4) for 1 h, rinsed with the same buffer, and then dehydrated through an ascending series of ethanols (30–100%).	26096	26321
28468941	Cell layers were infiltrated for 30 min in a 50/50 mixture of 100% ethanol/epoxy resin, followed by 100% epoxy resin (LX-112; Ladd Research, Williston, VT), after which they were placed in a 60°C oven for 2 d. Blocks with monolayer cells were thin-sectioned (70–80 nm) using an UCT ultramicrotome (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL).	26322	26646
28468941	Resulting sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.	26647	26716
28468941	Digital images were acquired using a JEOL JEM-1220 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA), equipped with an Erlangshen ES1000W 11 MP charge-coupled device camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA).	26717	26917
28468941	Caveolae number and size were measured using ImageJ.	26918	26970
28468941	All values are given as mean ± SEM.	26971	27006
28468941	Intergroup differences were assessed by unpaired Student’s t test or analysis of variance with post hoc analysis using Tukey’s test when multiple groups were analyzed.	27007	27174
28468941	Wherever applicable, normality was confirmed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.	27175	27253
28468941	p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.	27254	27304
28468941	Significance is indicated as *** for p < 0.001, ** for p < 0.01, and * for p < 0.05.	27305	27389
28068934	Squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histological subtype of esophageal cancer in Asia, whereas adenocarcinomas predominate in the United Kingdom, some other Western European countries, and the United States.	0	214
28068934	To date, multidisciplinary treatment approaches for esophageal cancer with different histological subtypes including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation have been employed; however, the prognosis of these patients remains poor [2, 3].	215	450
28068934	For patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the available agents are quite limited.	451	575
28068934	A combination of platinum agents and fluorouracil derivatives is commonly used as first-line chemotherapy, and taxanes are options for second-line chemotherapy [1, 4].	576	743
28068934	In addition, no molecular-target therapies have been established for the treatment of ESCC.	744	835
28068934	Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for ESCC treatment, particularly for patients who are in good physical condition but who are refractory or intolerant to standard therapies.	836	1018
28068934	The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a pivotal role in cancer cell proliferation, and mutations in the PIK3CA gene are commonly found in various cancers regardless of histological subtypes.	1019	1263
28068934	More than 80% of PIK3CA mutations occur in two major regions: the helical domain (exon 9), and the kinase domain (exon 20); moreover, three mutations (E542K, E545K, and H1047R) have been regarded as hotspot mutations.	1264	1481
28068934	In a phase 1 trial evaluating an mTOR inhibitor, a case with advanced ESCC exhibited a partial response, although the PIK3CA mutation status was unknown.	1482	1635
28068934	In addition, PIK3CA mutations have been suggested to be a potential predictive biomarker for PI3K–Akt–mTOR inhibitors in a review of early phase clinical trials for the testing of such agents in various solid cancers.	1636	1853
28068934	In this report, a case with squamous cell head and neck carcinoma, which is genetically similar to ESCC, harboring a PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) demonstrated a partial response to a PI3K–Akt–mTOR inhibitor.	1854	2057
28068934	The frequency of PIK3CA mutations in ESCC has been reported to range from 2.2 to 21% [9–16], whereas mutations in genes in the RAS–RAF pathway are very rare [15, 17, 18].	2058	2228
28068934	Accordingly, PIK3CA mutations may be a potential target molecule in ESCC treatment.	2229	2312
28068934	Previous studies investigating the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in ESCC used available clinical samples obtained from either surgically resected specimens or biopsy specimens [9–16].	2313	2496
28068934	Clarifying whether PIK3CA mutations from biopsy specimens can be detected in corresponding surgically resected specimens is important for the future clinical development of ESCC treatment.	2497	2685
28068934	Therefore, the present study examined the frequency of PIK3CA mutations and the concordance between PIK3CA mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy specimens and those detected in corresponding surgically resected specimens in patients with ESCC.	2686	2931
28068934	Among 352 previously untreated patients with ESCC who underwent a curative-intent transthoracic esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy at the National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Japan, between January 2000 and December 2011, a total of 181 patients were enrolled according to the following selection criteria: (i) pathological T factor of at least T1b, (ii) availability of paired samples of endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens, (iii) patient age of ≤75 years, (iv) absence of past or concurrent history of cancer, (v) adequate organ function, and (vi) absence of in-hospital death following surgery.	2932	3564
28068934	Archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of paired endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from the enrolled patients were used for DNA extraction.	3565	3752
28068934	Thin tissue sections (4 μm) cut from an FFPE tissue block were placed on microscopic slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological examination.	3753	3919
28068934	Five unstained tissue sections (10 μm) were also continuously cut from the same tissue block and were placed on a glass slide.	3920	4046
28068934	The tumor histology was confirmed by a pathologist specializing in gastrointestinal cancer (SF) based on a microscopic examination of the H&E-stained slides.	4047	4204
28068934	For the endoscopic biopsy specimens, the entire biopsy specimen was manually microdissected after confirming that the ratio of tumor cells to whole cells was >20% on slides stained with H&E.	4205	4395
28068934	For the surgically resected specimens, a tumor area with a small amount of stromal cells where the ratio of tumor cells to whole cells was >50% on slides stained with H&E was manually microdissected (Fig.	4396	4600
28068934	1).	4601	4604
28068934	DNA extraction was performed using the heat-induced retrieval method, as described previously [19, 20].	4605	4708
28068934	PIK3CA mutations were detected using a Luminex (xMAP) technology-based multiplex gene mutation detection kit (GENOSEARCH Mu-PACK; MBL, Nagoya, Japan), which was developed prior to the present study; an optimal concordance between the kit and the conventional direct sequencing method was confirmed previously.	4709	5018
28068934	A total of five PIK3CA mutations, including codon 542 (E542K), codon 545 (E545K), and codon 546 (E546K) in exon 9 and codon 1047 (H1047R, H1047L) in exon 20, were investigated.	5019	5195
28068934	The lowest detection limit of the percentage of mutant allele was 5%.	5196	5265
28068934	The protocol details have been described previously.	5266	5318
28068934	Next-generation sequencing (NGS, Ion Ampliseq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was additionally performed using DNA obtained from the same FFPE block for cases in which the mutation status of the endoscopic biopsy specimen and the surgically resected specimen differed when assessed using the method described above.	5319	5666
28068934	In cases where NGS was not successfully performed, DNAs were extracted from two separate tumor portions of the same FFPE block as that used in the primary analysis, and PIK3CA mutations in each portion were measured using the kit.	5667	5897
28068934	The PIK3CA mutation frequency was determined as the proportion of specimens with a PIK3CA mutation among either all the endoscopic biopsy or all the surgically resected specimens.	5898	6077
28068934	In addition to the mutation frequency, the overall concordance rate, positive concordance rate, negative concordance rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the endoscopic biopsy specimens, compared with the surgically resected specimens as a reference, were evaluated and presented with the 95% confidence intervals (CI).	6078	6426
28068934	The associations between the PIK3CA mutation status and clinicopathological factors were assessed using the t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables or the Fisher’s exact test for dichotomous variables.	6427	6670
28068934	All P values were reported as two-sided, with a significance level of 0.05.	6671	6746
28068934	All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics 20 (IBM Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).	6747	6847
28068934	The clinicopathological characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown in Table 1.	6848	6934
28068934	The mean age of the patients was 62.7 years, with the majority of the patients being male (82.9%).	6935	7033
28068934	Most of the patients had T2 or T3 disease, but patients with T1b disease (28.2%) and curatively resected T4 disease (2.2%) were included.	7034	7171
28068934	One hundred twenty-five patients (68.5%) had lymph node metastases, while 56 (31.5%) did not.	7172	7265
28068934	Eleven patients (6.1%) had non-regional lymph node metastases (M1) but not distant organ metastases and were judged as Stage IV.	7266	7394
28068934	In total, 362 samples from 181 patients were included in the concordance analysis.	7395	7477
28068934	The median amount of extracted DNA was 11,268 ng (interquartile range [IQR]: 6558–18,268) for the surgically resected specimens and 2452 ng (IQR: 1748–3352) for the biopsy specimens.	7478	7660
28068934	For quality control, we checked the absorbance at 260 nm (A260) and 280 nm (A280), and the median A260/ A280 scores were 1.91 (IQR: 1.85–1.98) and 1.93 (IQR: 1.88–1.97) for the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens, respectively.	7661	7904
28068934	Mutation analyses were successfully performed for both the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in all the cases.	7905	8033
28068934	Among the endoscopic biopsy specimens, there were 11 cases with PIK3CA mutations: two with E542K, three with E545K, five with H1047R, and one with H1047L.	8034	8188
28068934	Among the surgically resected specimens, there were 12 cases with PIK3CA mutations: one with E542K, four with E545K, six with H1047R, and one with H1047L.	8189	8343
28068934	Overall, the PIK3CA mutation frequency based on a positive mutation status for either specimen was 7.2% (13/181, 95% CI: 3.9–12.0) (Table 2).	8344	8485
28068934	Figure 1 shows micrographs of the ESCC case that harbored a PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) in both the biopsy and the surgically resected specimens.	8486	8628
28068934	DNA was isolated from the entire biopsy specimen and the area marked by the solid line in the surgically resected specimen.	8629	8752
28068934	No histological findings specific to cases with a PIK3CA mutation were observed in the present study.	8753	8854
28068934	There were three cases with discordant results between the endoscopic biopsy and the surgically resected specimens.	8855	8970
28068934	The correlations between clinicopathological factors and the PIK3CA mutation status as detected using DNA extracted from either the endoscopic biopsy or surgically resected specimens are presented in Table 3.	8971	9179
28068934	No clear differences were observed between the PIK3CA mutation status and the clinicopathological factors that were examined.	9180	9305
28068934	As shown in Table 4, 168 cases and 10 cases were determined to have a wild-type and a mutant-type, respectively, in both the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens.	9306	9483
28068934	In contrast, a concordant result was not achieved in the remaining three cases.	9484	9563
28068934	The overall concordance rate for the PIK3CA mutation status between the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens was 98.3% ([168 + 10]/181, 95% CI: 95.2–99.7).	9564	9734
28068934	The positive and negative concordance rates were 83.3% (10/12, 95% CI: 51.6–97.9) and 99.4% (168/169, 95% CI: 96.7–99.9), respectively.	9735	9870
28068934	The positive and negative predictive values were 90.9% (10/11, 95% CI: 58.7–99.8) and 98.8% (168/170, 95% CI: 95.8–99.9), respectively.	9871	10006
28068934	The PIK3CA mutation genotypes in the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens obtained for the ten cases that exhibited a PIK3CA mutation in both specimen types are compared in Table 5.	10007	10203
28068934	The concordance of the PIK3CA mutation genotype was 100% (10/10, 95% CI: 74%–100%).	10204	10287
28068934	The details of the three cases with a discordant PIK3CA mutation status were as follows: two cases had mutation-positive surgical specimens but exhibited a wild-type profile for their biopsy specimens (Case No.	10288	10498
28068934	61 and No.	10499	10509
28068934	132), while the opposite pattern was observed in one case (Case No.	10510	10577
28068934	8; Table 2).	10578	10590
28068934	We performed NGS for these three cases; however, the DNA amplification was incomplete and the sequencing was not successful in both Case No.	10591	10731
28068934	8 and Case No.	10732	10746
28068934	61.	10747	10750
28068934	In Case No.	10751	10762
28068934	132, NGS revealed a PIK3CA mutation in H1047R with a mutant allele frequency of 4.5% in the surgically resected specimen; no PIK3CA mutations were detected in the endoscopic biopsy specimen.	10763	10953
28068934	In Case No.	10751	10762
28068934	8 and Case No.	10732	10746
28068934	61, PIK3CA mutations were detected in only one portion and were not detected in the other when two separate tumor portions from the same FFPE block were analyzed (Fig.	10981	11148
28068934	2).	8482	8485
28068934	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the concordance of the PIK3CA mutation status between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens using FFPE tissues from patients with ESCC.	11153	11372
28068934	In the present study, we demonstrated that, although not frequent, a certain proportion of patients with ESCC harbored PIK3CA mutations, and the mutation statuses of the two types of specimens were highly concordant.	11373	11589
28068934	Among the five hotspot mutations assessed in the present study, E542K, E545K and E546K are located in exon 9, corresponding to the helical domain, and H1047R and H1047L are located in exon 20, corresponding to the kinase domain.	11590	11818
28068934	The mutations in both of these domains increase the kinase activity of PI3K and activate the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway, resulting in the activation of cell signaling and the promotion of cell growth and invasion [23, 24].	11819	12036
28068934	The present study showed no significant association between the PIK3CA mutation status and the clinicopathological characteristics of the ESCC cases, suggesting that an examination of the clinicopathological factors prior to genetic analysis might not be capable of predicting the presence of a PIK3CA mutation.	12037	12348
28068934	In other words, ESCC patients with a PIK3CA mutation constitute a subgroup only in terms of the applicability of a PI3K inhibitor, since emerging evidence suggests that patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer might benefit from treatment with PI3K inhibitors [8, 25].	12349	12612
28068934	The high overall concordance rate (98.3%) between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens observed in this study suggests that PIK3CA mutations are homogeneously distributed in the primary tumor in most cases.	12613	12834
28068934	Although the intratumoral heterogeneity of the PIK3CA mutation status has not yet been investigated for ESCC, the results of our study are in line with the homogeneous distribution of the PIK3CA mutation status in the primary tumor observed in colorectal and breast cancers [26, 27].	12835	13118
28068934	In colorectal cancer, the concordance rate of the KRAS mutation status between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens is high, similar to that of the PIK3CA mutation status in ESCC demonstrated in the present study, and endoscopic biopsy specimens are used for the molecular analysis of KRAS mutations to evaluate the clinical indications for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy.	13119	13530
28068934	These findings suggest that FFPE clinical samples obtained from endoscopic biopsies are applicable to the identification of PIK3CA mutations in ESCC.	13531	13680
28068934	In contrast, the discordant mutation status between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens that was observed in three cases may be attributable to intratumoral heterogeneity.	13681	13868
28068934	Because endoscopic biopsy specimens represent a limited and superficial sampling of the primary tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity can be an obstacle to establishing a precise biomarker diagnosis.	13869	14064
28068934	Obtaining multiple endoscopic biopsy samples from primary tumors may improve the likelihood of detecting a mutation and may minimize potential mutational discordances.	14065	14232
28068934	The PIK3CA mutation frequency of 7.2% observed in this study is based on Luminex (xMAP) technology targeting five hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene with a detection limit of 5% and is compatible with the COSMIC database published by the Sanger institute (9.5%), and with those of the previous studies ranging from 2.2 to 21% [9–16].	14233	14568
28068934	The variation in mutation frequency among these studies is thought to be mainly attributable to differences in the methods used to detect PIK3CA mutations as well as differences in the patient cohorts, with factors such as disease stage, prior therapy, and ethnicity playing major roles.	14569	14856
28068934	The frequency of PIK3CA mutations has been reported to be 2.2%–7.7% using direct sequencing, 11.5%–21% using pyrosequencing or other high-sensitivity methods, and 4.5%–9.0% using NGS [9–12, 14–16, 29, 30].	14857	15062
28068934	The results of the present study were likely influenced by the sensitivity of the mutation testing.	15063	15162
28068934	Collecting a sufficient number of cancer cells and excluding non-cancerous cells from biopsy specimens is difficult using manual microdissection for DNA extraction because the original size of the biopsy specimens is considerably smaller than that of the surgically resected specimens.	15163	15448
28068934	One strategy is to use a detection method with a higher sensitivity, thereby reducing the risk of missing a relatively small fraction of cancer cells carrying a PIK3CA mutation.	15449	15626
28068934	However, the relationship between the proportion of cancer cells with a PIK3CA mutation and biological differences has not yet been reported, and the relationship between the proportion of cancer cells with a PIK3CA mutation and differences in the response to PI3K inhibitors for any cancer type, including ESCC, remains unknown.	15627	15956
28068934	Importantly, the present study revealed a case in which a PIK3CA mutation was observed in a biopsy specimen, but the wild-type was observed in the surgically resected specimen.	15957	16133
28068934	This event suggests the existence of another problem in the detection of PIK3CA mutations: that is, heterogeneity.	16134	16248
28068934	In addition to the sensitivity of mutation testing, tumor heterogeneity is also likely to influence the detection sensitivity.	16249	16375
28068934	Since the efficacy of agents inhibiting the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway has been demonstrated clinically, further investigation of the optimal detection method and its detection limit is needed to ensure that patients who might benefit from such treatment are accurately identified.	16376	16652
28068934	Recently, phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 clinical trials examining a number of PI3K inhibitors have begun for patients with various types of cancer [31, 32].	16653	16809
28068934	Among these agents, the clinical efficacy of buparlisib (BKM120), a pan-PI3K inhibitor, has been demonstrated in breast cancer patients in a phase 3 trial, and the presence of a PIK3CA mutation was shown to predict a response to this agent.	16810	17050
28068934	Several phase 2 trials examining buparlisib in ESCC patients are also currently ongoing (registration ID: NCT01806649, UMIN000011217).	17051	17185
28068934	Additional biomarker studies performed during these clinical trials may reveal whether the PIK3CA mutation can be used as a biomarker to predict the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in patients with ESCC.	17186	17385
28068934	Although heterogeneity in the PIK3CA mutation status between primary tumors and corresponding lymph nodes or distant organ metastases is reportedly rare for colorectal and breast cancers, limited information is available with regard to ESCC.	17386	17627
28068934	For the development of therapies targeting the PIK3CA mutation in patients with ESCC, the potential for heterogeneity between primary tumors and metastases must be further investigated.	17628	17813
28068934	The detection of PIK3CA mutations could be used to define a subset of patients who may be potential candidates for treatment with inhibitors of the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway.	17814	17984
28068934	The PIK3CA mutation status was highly concordant between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in patients with ESCC, suggesting that endoscopic biopsy specimens are clinically applicable for the detection of PIK3CA mutations.	17985	18225
26449539	The Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) represent an important group of receptors involved in mediating the pleiotropic effects of various environmental contaminants, food components, and drugs.	0	210
26449539	PPARs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and induce the expression of numerous genes by functioning as ligand-activated transcription factors.	211	366
26449539	The ligands for PPARs encompass a range of synthetic compounds and endogenous lipids, including various fatty acids and eicosanoids.	367	499
26449539	Three different PPAR subtypes can be distinguished: PPARα, PPARδ, and PPARγ, each characterized by a distinct tissue expression profile and set of functions [2, 3].	500	664
26449539	Multiple functions have been assigned to PPARδ, including roles in inflammation, lipid metabolism and cancer.	665	774
26449539	Due to its ubiquitous expression pattern and diverse cellular actions, no single descriptor appropriately captures the biological function of PPARδ.	775	923
26449539	The PPARγ is known as the key transcriptional regulator that drives adipogenesis, the process by which fat cells differentiate from pre-adipocytes into mature adipose cells.	924	1097
26449539	Apart from adipocytes, PPARγ is also expressed in a limited number of other cell types where it exerts anti-inflammatory actions and promotes lipid storage.	1098	1254
26449539	By serving as the molecular target of the insulin-sensitizing drugs pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, PPARγ is one of the key receptors in the pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes.	1255	1441
26449539	PPARα is best known for its role in the liver, where it acts as the master regulator of lipid metabolism, especially during fasting [8–10].	1442	1581
26449539	Fasting is associated with dramatic changes in lipid handling in the liver, which is coordinated by PPARα.	1582	1688
26449539	Specifically, low and high throughput gene expression analyses have demonstrated that PPARα governs expression of numerous genes involved in nearly every single aspect of lipid metabolism, including fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and formation and breakdown of triglycerides and lipid droplets.	1689	2036
26449539	Similar to other members of the PPAR family, PPARα is activated by a range of different fatty acids and eicosanoids [12–16].	2037	2161
26449539	In addition, PPARα serves as receptor for a diverse array of synthetic compounds collectively referred to as peroxisome proliferators.	2162	2296
26449539	These include phthalates, insecticides, herbicides, surfactants, organic solvents, and hypolipidemic fibrate drugs.	2297	2412
26449539	Fibrates have been used for several decades mainly for their ability to lower circulating triglycerides.	2413	2517
26449539	More recently, pharmacological targeting of PPARα has shown promise for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.	2518	2641
26449539	Specifically, the dual PPARα/δ agonist GFT505 was shown to improve liver dysfunction markers, decrease hepatic lipid accumulation, and reduce inflammatory gene expression in liver in several animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).	2642	2892
26449539	Furthermore, GFT505 treatment lowered liver dysfunction markers and improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in human subjects [19, 20].	2893	3040
26449539	Most of our insights into the physiological, toxicological and pharmacological role of PPARα has been derived from experiments in animals and in particular from rodent studies.	3041	3217
26449539	These studies have revealed that PPARα is not only involved in the adaptive response to fasting but also mediates the hepatocarcinogenic effects of peroxisome proliferators.	3218	3391
26449539	Whether PPARα exerts similar functions in human liver has been the subject of controversy, which has been fueled by the perceived lack of effect of PPARα agonists on peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in humans, as well as due to the presumed low expression of PPARα in human liver.	3392	3672
26449539	However, more recent studies have partly refuted those notions, showing that a) PPARα expression is similar in mouse and human liver, b) in human hepatocytes PPARα governs the expression of numerous genes in various lipid metabolic pathways, including peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation [25, 26].	3673	3967
26449539	Nevertheless, the absence of more complex human model systems has hampered our ability to gain insight into the molecular function of PPARα in human liver, in particular with respect to target gene regulation.	3968	4177
26449539	To overcome this limitation, we collected precision cut liver slices (PCLS) from human subjects and studied the effect of PPARα activation on gene expression using whole genome expression profiling.	4178	4376
26449539	In contrast to primary hepatocytes, PCLS mimic the multi-cellularity and structural organization of whole liver and thus represent a superior ex-vivo model system for human liver.	4377	4556
26449539	So far the use of PCLS for the study of nuclear receptors and specifically PPARα function has been limited [28–30].	4557	4672
26449539	Here we report the use of PCLS in combination with whole genome gene expression profiling to gain insight into PPARα-mediated gene regulation in human liver.	4673	4830
26449539	In all patients a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass was performed under general anesthesia as treatment for their morbid obesity.	4831	4964
26449539	Patients were instructed to fasten for solid foods and liquids starting at the night before surgery.	4965	5065
26449539	During surgery a biopsy of the liver was obtained with the help of ultrasound dissection (UltraCision®).	5066	5170
26449539	The biopsy was collected from the liver edge.	5171	5216
26449539	The majority of the liver biopsies collected (n = 15) were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.	5217	5335
26449539	The liver biopsies targeted for slicing (n = 4) were immediately placed in ice-cold oxygenated Belzer UW Cold Storage Solution (Bridge to Life Ltd, Columbia, SC, USA) and quickly transferred to our laboratory for further processing of PCLS.	5336	5576
26449539	Only macroscopically healthy livers were used for slicing.	5577	5635
26449539	Biopsies were provided by the biobank of the Rijnstate hospital.	5636	5700
26449539	Collection of biopsies for research purposes into the biobank was approved by the local institutional review board on behalf of the medical ethics review committee of the Radboud University Medical Centre.	5701	5906
26449539	All patients signed informed consent for collection of the biopsy prior to surgery.	5907	5990
26449539	Donor characteristics of the livers used for slicing are shown in Table 1.	5991	6065
26449539	PCLS were prepared and cultured as described previously.	6066	6122
26449539	5 mm cylindrical liver cores were prepared with a surgical biopsy punch and sectioned to 200 μm slices using a Krumdieck tissue slicer (Alabama Research and Development, Munford, AL, USA) filled with carbonated KHB (pH 7.4, supplemented with 25 mM glucose).	6123	6380
26449539	Liver slices were incubated in William’s E Medium (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin in 6-well plates at 37 °C/5 % CO2/80 % O2 under continuous shaking (70 rpm).	6381	6576
26449539	Duplicate wells were used per donor with 3 liver slices per well.	6577	6642
26449539	After 1 hour the media was replaced with fresh William’s E Medium in the presence or absence of Wy14643 (100 μM) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, final concentration 0.1 %).	6643	6822
26449539	This concentration was chosen based on the affinity of human PPARα for Wy14643.	6823	6902
26449539	After 24 h incubation, liver slices were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80 °C for RNA isolation.	6903	7014
26449539	The treatment of primary human hepatocytes with Wy14643 has been previously described.	7015	7101
26449539	Briefly, human hepatocytes from six different donors were purchased from Lonza (Verviers, Belgium).	7102	7201
26449539	Hepatocytes were isolated with two-step collagenase perfusion method.	7202	7271
26449539	Cell viability was over 80 %.	7272	7301
26449539	The cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of Wy14643 (50 μM) dissolved in DMSO, followed by RNA isolation.	7302	7427
26449539	Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).	7428	7485
26449539	RNA integrity number was found to be above 7.1 for all samples suggesting that the human liver slices were of good quality.	7486	7609
26449539	The RNA integrity number is based on a digital electropherogram generated using a Agilent bioanalyzer.	7610	7712
26449539	It describes the degree of degradation of RNA with level 10 representing completely intact RNA.	7713	7808
26449539	RNA was reverse transcribed using a iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories BV, Veenendaal, The Netherlands).	7809	7927
26449539	Real-time PCR was carried out using SensiMiX (Bioline) on a CFX 384 Bio-Rad thermal cycler (Bio-Rad).	7928	8029
26449539	36B4 was used as housekeeping gene.	8030	8065
26449539	Primer sequences used are shown in Table 2.	8066	8109
26449539	Total RNA was purified with RNeasy Minikit columns (Qiagen) and RNA quality was assessed using RNA 6000 Nano chips on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).	8110	8308
26449539	Purified RNA (100 ng) was labeled with the Ambion WT expression kit (Invitrogen) and hybridized to an Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST array plate (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).	8309	8482
26449539	Hybridization, washing, and scanning were carried out on an Affymetrix GeneTitan platform according to the instruction by the manufacturer.	8483	8622
26449539	Arrays were normalized using the Robust Multiarray Average method [33, 34].	8623	8698
26449539	Probe sets were defined according to Dai et al..	8699	8747
26449539	In this method probes are assigned to Entrez IDs as an unique gene identifier.	8748	8826
26449539	The P-value for the effect of Wy14643 treatment were calculated using an Intensity-Based Moderated T-statistic (IBMT).	8827	8945
26449539	The q-value was calculated as measure of significance for false discovery rate.	8946	9025
26449539	The microarray data for the human liver slices were submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE71731).	9026	9126
26449539	The microarray data for the human primary hepatocytes have been previously submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE17251).	9127	9250
26449539	Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to find enriched gene sets in the induced or suppressed genes.	9251	9358
26449539	Genes were ranked based on the paired IBMT-statistic and subsequently analyzed for over- or underrepresentation in predefined gene sets derived from Gene Ontology, KEGG, National Cancer Institute, PFAM, Biocarta, Reactome and WikiPathways pathway databases.	9359	9616
26449539	Only gene sets consisting of more than 15 and fewer than 500 genes were taken into account.	9617	9708
26449539	Statistical significance of GSEA results was determined using 1000 permutations.	9709	9789
26449539	First, we determined the relative expression level of PPARα in PCLS in comparison with human liver.	9790	9889
26449539	After correcting for the housekeeping gene 36B4, mRNA levels of PPARα in human PCLS after 24 h incubation were about ten-fold lower as compared to snap-frozen human liver biopsies (Fig.	9890	10075
26449539	1a).	10076	10080
26449539	To verify that the human liver slices maintain their ability to respond to PPARα activation, we exposed the PCLS to 100 μM Wy14643, isolated total RNA and performed qPCR to determine the expression of a number of well-established PPARα target genes, including PLIN2, VLDLR, ANGPTL4, CPT1A and PDK4 (Fig.	10081	10384
26449539	1b).	10385	10389
26449539	All PPARα target genes analyzed showed significant induction following Wy14643 treatment, indicating the validity of our model to study PPARα-mediated gene regulation.	10390	10557
26449539	To study the effect of PPARα activation on whole genome gene expression, we performed microarray analysis.	10558	10664
26449539	Wy14643-induced changes in expression of the selected PPARα target genes were very similar between the microarray and qPCR analysis (Fig.	10665	10802
26449539	1c).	10803	10807
26449539	Using a FDR q-value of 0.05 as cut-off (IBMT regularised paired t-test), the expression of 1282 genes (out of 19,654 genes on the array) was found to be significantly altered by Wy14643 treatment, of which 617 genes were upregulated and 665 genes were downregulated.	10808	11074
26449539	The top 25 of most significantly induced genes, ranked according to statistical significance, are shown in Fig.	11075	11186
26449539	2a.	11187	11190
26449539	The full list is available as Additional file 1.	11191	11239
26449539	The list includes many well-known PPARα target genes involved in lipid metabolism (e.g. VLDLR, ACADVL, PLIN2, ANGPTL4, CPT1A), as well as many other genes covering a wide variety of biological functions.	11240	11443
26449539	In addition, the list includes a number of genes with unknown function.	11444	11515
26449539	Figure 2b shows the top 25 of most significantly repressed genes, many of which are related to immune function and inflammation.	11516	11644
26449539	The full list of significantly downregulated genes is available as Additional file 2.	11645	11730
26449539	To gain better insight into the biological function of genes regulated by PPARα activation in human liver slices, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).	11731	11894
26449539	Pathways related to lipid metabolism or directly involving PPARα featured prominently among the gene sets induced by Wy14643 (Fig.	11895	12025
26449539	3).	12026	12029
26449539	Also, several gene sets induced by Wy14643 were related to the unfolded protein response and UPR signaling by IRE1α and XBP1.	12030	12155
26449539	Finally, we observed significant enrichment of genes related to oxidative stress and xenobiotic/drug metabolism.	12156	12268
26449539	Gene sets downregulated by PPARα activation were all related to immune function and inflammation, illustrating a potent anti-inflammatory/immuno-suppressive action of PPARα in human liver.	12269	12457
26449539	An important goal of the present work was to test the suitability of liver slices as a model to study PPARα dependent gene regulation and compare it with other available model systems for human liver.	12458	12658
26449539	To that end, we compared the whole genome expression profiles of human liver slices treated with Wy14643 with the expression profiles of primary human hepatocytes treated with Wy14643.	12659	12843
26449539	The expression profiles of primary human hepatocytes have been previously published but were re-analyzed.	12844	12949
26449539	The primary human hepatocytes were treated for the same duration and microarray analysis was performed in the same laboratory on the same microarray platform.	12950	13108
26449539	The comparative analysis between primary human hepatocytes and human liver slices was performed on a common gene set of 17,351 genes.	13109	13242
26449539	Using a statistical cut-off of P < 0.001 (IBMT regularised paired t-test) combined with a fold-change cut-off of 1.2, we found 347 genes to be upregulated in human liver slices, as compared to 121 genes in the hepatocytes (Fig.	13243	13470
26449539	4a), with an overlap of 47 genes.	13471	13504
26449539	Remarkably, whereas 401 genes were downregulated by Wy14643 in the liver slices, only 25 genes were downregulated by Wy14643 in the human hepatocytes, with an overlap of only 4 genes.	13505	13688
26449539	The data indicate that the human liver slices are much more sensitive towards especially downregulation of gene expression by Wy14643 as compared to human hepatocytes.	13689	13856
26449539	This notion was further supported by correlation analysis in the form of a scatter plot (Fig.	13857	13950
26449539	4b).	13951	13955
26449539	The upper right portion of the scatter plot was well filled (Fig.	13956	14021
26449539	4b), reflecting common induction by Wy14643 in PCLS and primary hepatocytes, including well-known PPARα targets such as FABP1, PLIN2, PDK4 and ANGPTL4.	14022	14173
26449539	In contrast, the lower left portion of the scatter plot was much less filled (Fig.	14174	14256
26449539	4b), reflecting little agreement between PCLS and primary hepatocytes with respect to downregulation of gene expression by Wy14643.	14257	14388
26449539	In fact, many genes were markedly downregulated by Wy14643 in the liver slices but showed no change in expression in the hepatocytes.	14389	14522
26449539	Nearly all genes conforming to this type of expression were involved in immune-related function, as illustrated by the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11.	14523	14679
26449539	Interestingly, a number of genes was explicitly induced by PPARα activation in primary hepatocytes but not in liver slices, including FABP3 as well as CREB3L3, a possible mediator of the stimulatory effects of PPARα on hepatic gene expression.	14680	14923
26449539	Subsequent analysis by Volcano plot confirmed the overall more pronounced effect of PPARα activation on gene expression in liver slices as compared to primary hepatocytes and also corroborated the relatively minor down-regulation of gene expression by PPARα activation in primary hepatocytes (Fig.	14924	15221
26449539	4c).	15222	15226
26449539	To further investigate this observation, we took the 40 genes most highly induced or repressed by Wy14643 in the liver slices (P < 0.001 and ranked according to fold-change) and studied the response to Wy14643 of the same genes in the primary hepatocytes.	15227	15482
26449539	Whereas the majority of genes induced by Wy14643 in the liver slices were also induced by Wy14643 in the hepatocytes (Fig.	15483	15605
26449539	5a)—as illustrated by the common induction of well-known targets such as FABP1, PLIN2, FADS1 and ANGPTL4—few genes that were downregulated by Wy14643 in liver slices were also consistently downregulated by Wy14643 in primary hepatocytes (Fig.	15606	15848
26449539	5b).	15849	15853
26449539	Also, the magnitude of gene suppression by Wy14643 was generally much less pronounced in primary hepatocytes.	15854	15963
26449539	Confirming the GSEA results, the majority of the most highly repressed genes were related to immunity and inflammation, including the aforementioned chemokines (CXCL9-11, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL6), interferon γ-induced genes (IFITM1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and other immune-related genes (TLR3, NOS2, and LCN2).	15964	16268
26449539	To further explore the similarity in gene regulation by Wy14643 between PCLS and primary hepatocytes, we took the enriched genes within the positively or negatively enriched gene sets “IRE1α activated chaperones”, “metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450”, and “Interferon alpha beta signaling” (Fig.	16269	16574
26449539	3), and compared gene expression changes between PCLS and primary hepatocytes.	16575	16653
26449539	Induction of most genes that are part of “metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450” was more pronounced in PCLS than in primary hepatocytes but reasonably well conserved between the two model systems (Fig.	16654	16863
26449539	6a).	16864	16868
26449539	A limited number of genes (i.e. CYP2J2) showed higher fold-inductions in the primary hepatocytes as compared to PCLS.	16869	16986
26449539	Induction of genes part of “IRE1α activated chaperones” was generally less pronounced in comparison with genes part of “metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450”, and was relatively weakly conserved between PCLS and primary hepatocytes (Fig.	16987	17232
26449539	6b).	17233	17237
26449539	An exception is ACADVL.	17238	17261
26449539	However, the inclusion of ACADVL (very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase = fatty acid oxidation) within “IRE1α activated chaperones” may be questioned.	17262	17413
26449539	Consistent with the other data showing potent downregulation of immune- and inflammation-related genes by PPARα activation in PCLS but not primary hepatocytes, suppression of genes part of “Interferon alpha beta signaling” was exclusively observed in PCLS (Fig.	17414	17675
26449539	6c).	17676	17680
26449539	Finally, we used the microarray data of the human primary hepatocytes and human PCLS treated with Wy14643 to generate a detailed gene map of known and putative PPARα target genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways (Fig.	17681	17902
26449539	7).	17903	17906
26449539	The map illustrates that regulation of bile acid synthesis and secretion, which is a well-established PPARα target pathway in mouse, was only evident in primary hepatocytes and not in liver slices.	17907	18104
26449539	Conversely, genes involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation were clearly induced by PPARα activation in human liver slices but not in primary hepatocytes.	18105	18268
26449539	The main conclusion of our study is that induction of gene expression by PPARα activation is generally well captured and shows significant overlap between human liver slices and primary human hepatocytes, showing consistent upregulation of genes involved in lipid and xenobiotic metabolism in the two model systems.	18269	18584
26449539	In contrast, downregulation of gene expression by PPARα activation is almost exclusively observed in human liver slices.	18585	18705
26449539	A previous study comparing mouse primary hepatocytes, mouse liver slices and mouse liver reached a similar conclusion.	18706	18824
26449539	Overall, our data indicate that human PCLS are a superior model to study PPARα-dependent gene regulation and PPARα functions in human liver.	18825	18965
26449539	As indicated above, PPARα activation caused major downregulation of gene expression in human liver slices but not in primary hepatocytes.	18966	19103
26449539	A key difference between primary hepatocytes and liver slices is that the primary hepatocyte culture consists of only hepatocytes, whereas the liver slices contain other cell types, including stellate cells and Kupffer cells.	19104	19329
26449539	A large portion of the downregulated genes and pathways in the liver slices was found to be connected to the immune system.	19330	19453
26449539	Genes that were highly repressed upon PPARα activation included several chemokines (e.g. CXCL9-11, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL6), interferon γ-induced genes (e.g. IFITM1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and numerous other immune-related genes (e.g. TLR3, NOS2, and LCN2).	19454	19705
26449539	Downregulation of gene expression is unlikely to be mediated by PPARα present in non-parenchymal cells, as PPARα expression in these cells is very low [30, 39].	19706	19866
26449539	Instead we prefer a scenario in which the immuno-suppressive action of PPARα activation in hepatocytes is dependent on (inflammatory) signals emanating from non-parenchymal cells.	19867	20046
26449539	Indeed, downregulation of inflammatory gene expression in primary hepatocytes and mouse liver by PPARα activation is sensitive to the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli [40, 41].	20047	20227
26449539	Previously, we and others already demonstrated that Kupffer cells promote fat storage in hepatocytes by releasing inflammatory signals such as IL-1β, causing downregulation of PPARα gene expression [42, 43].	20228	20435
26449539	Overall, these data suggest that the full scope of functions of PPARα in hepatocytes is critically dependent on the interaction with other liver cell types.	20436	20592
26449539	It is of interest to note that recently the anti-inflammatory action of PPARα in mouse liver was unequivocally attributed to the ability of PPARα to interact with other transcription factor pathways—a property referred to as transrepression—independent of the DNA-binding ability of PPARα, as shown in the context of steatohepatitis.	20593	20926
26449539	Despite the clear clinical efficacy of fibrates towards lowering of circulating triglycerides, the lack of peroxisome proliferation in human primary hepatocytes following PPARα activation has fed the idea that humans are largely insensitive to peroxisome-proliferator-induced hepatic effects and that the functional role of PPARα in human liver may be limited [45–47].	20927	21295
26449539	Subsequent whole genome expression profiling studies in primary human hepatocytes have mostly discounted these notions [25, 26].	21296	21424
26449539	We found that PPARα is highly expressed in human liver with Ct values ranging from 22 to 26, which is similar to the values observed in mouse liver (data not shown).	21425	21590
26449539	Importantly, despite the markedly lower expression of PPARα in human PCLS as compared to human liver, activation of PPARα in PCLS caused pronounced upregulation or downregulation of numerous genes, including many known PPARα targets, strongly supporting the functionality of PPARα in human PCLS and giving strong credibility to an important in vivo role of PPARα in human liver.	21591	21969
26449539	Recently, it was found that human liver PPARα gene expression correlates negatively with the severity of steatohepatitis and with measures of insulin resistance.	21970	22131
26449539	Furthermore, histological improvement in a follow-up biopsy was associated with increased expression of PPARα and its target genes, suggesting that PPARα is involved in and may be therapeutically targeted for human steatohepatitis.	22132	22363
26449539	The majority of gene sets enriched among the upregulated genes were related to lipid and xenobiotic metabolism, which are well-established target pathways of PPARα.	22364	22528
26449539	Intriguingly, several highly enriched gene sets were part of the unfolded protein response and IRE1α-XBP1 signaling, two key factors involved in governing UPR.	22529	22688
26449539	Currently, there are no published data linking PPARα to IRE1α-XBP1 signaling and regulation of UPR, though it has been observed that PPARα is involved in regulating proteome maintenance by inducing numerous heat shock proteins.	22689	22916
26449539	Surprisingly, recently it was demonstrated that IRE1α-XBP1 signaling leads to activation of PPARα via direct binding of XBP1s to the promoter of PPARα, thereby stimulating mitochondrial β-oxidation and ketogenesis.	22917	23131
26449539	Thus, there appear to be reciprocal interactions between PPARα and UPR.	23132	23203
26449539	The wider biological framework for regulation of UPR requires further clarification.	23204	23288
26449539	Our analysis reveals differential regulation of a number of PPARα targets between liver slices and primary hepatocytes.	23289	23408
26449539	For instance, VNN1 was significantly upregulated by PPARα activation in primary hepatocytes but showed no change in expression in liver slices.	23409	23552
26449539	Conversely, expression of FADS2 was significantly increased in human liver slices but showed no change in primary hepatocytes.	23553	23679
26449539	The differential regulation of specific PPARα target genes by Wy14643 between primary hepatocytes and liver slices may be a reflection of the different cellular context in the two models systems, with non-hepatocytes potentially exerting a stimulatory or inhibitory influence on PPARα-dependent gene induction.	23680	23990
26449539	However, it should be realized that for a number of genes the seemingly differential regulation may reflect a quantitative difference rather than a true qualitative difference.	23991	24167
26449539	For example, SLC25A20 was induced significantly by 1.58-fold in primary hepatocytes as compared to a non-significant 1.34-fold induction in liver slices, barely missing the statistical significance cut-off.	24168	24374
26449539	Our analysis yielded a number of relatively poorly characterized genes that showed a pronounced and consistent upregulation upon PPARα activation in the two human liver model systems.	24375	24558
26449539	These include TSKU, RHOF, CA12 and VSIG10L.	24559	24602
26449539	Interestingly, many genes that were found to be induced by PPARα in early microarray analyses and which did not have an assigned function at the time were later shown to be involved in some aspect of lipid metabolism.	24603	24820
26449539	Accordingly, it can be hypothesized that the above mentioned genes as well as other poorly characterized genes that are commonly induced by Wy14643 in various liver model systems may be directly or indirectly connected to lipid metabolism.	24821	25060
26449539	The comparative microarray analysis of the effect of PPARα activation in primary human hepatocytes and human liver slices is somewhat hampered by a number of different factors, including the use of different types of Affymetrix gene chips, different human donors, and an unequal number of biological replicates per group.	25061	25382
26449539	However, treatments of liver slices and hepatocytes were carried out for the same duration and with the same PPARα agonist.	25383	25506
26449539	Furthermore, RNA was isolated and labeled via the same technique, hybridizations were performed on the same platform by the same technician, and the microarray data were processed in parallel using the same analysis methods.	25507	25731
26449539	On a final note, the data collected in this paper were added to a publicly available overview map of known (lipid) metabolic genes upregulated by PPARα in human liver (accessible via: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_alpha), which was generated largely by using published transcriptome datasets.	25732	26066
26449539	In conclusion, our paper demonstrates the suitability and superiority of PCLS over primary human hepatocytes for studying the functional role of PPARα in human liver.	26067	26233
26449539	Our data underscore the major role of PPARα in regulation of hepatic lipid and xenobiotic metabolism and reveal a marked immuno-suppressive/anti-inflammatory effect of PPARα in human liver that may be therapeutically relevant for NAFLD.	26234	26470
26449539	The data add to our growing understanding of the critical role of PPARα in gene regulation in human liver.	26471	26577

25277705	A range of inflammatory responses are associated with RSV infection, such as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, such as GROα/CXCL1, IL-1β, IL1-RA, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-9, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL11, IL-15, IL-18, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP-1β, IFN-γ, CCL5/RANTES, epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), GM-CSF, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).	519	1069
25277705	The importance of this cytokine response is underscored by the fact that increased levels of IL-1β, IL1-RA, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, G-CSF, EGF and HGF are associated with RSV infection severity.	1070	1258
25277705	Others have found that SNPs in IL-19, IL-20, MUC5AC, TNFRSF1B, C3, CTLA4, CXCL9, IL4R, and IL-7 genes are associated with recurrent wheezing following RSV infections.	1259	1425
25277705	Although RSV-induced cytokines have been studied extensively, the signaling mechanisms that regulate their expression and whether specific host cytokines contribute to airway injury or inflammation resolution remain incompletely understood.	1426	1666
25277705	Pathological studies demonstrate that RSV primarily infects airway epithelial cells; therefore it is conceivable that a significant component of immune signaling associated with RSV infections originates from airway epithelial responses.	1667	1904
25277705	Cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are expressed in these cells in response to microbial stimuli with numerous pathogen recognition receptors playing a major role in cytokine responses.	1905	2096
25277705	Pathogen recognition receptors, such as TLRs and retinoic acid–inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)-like receptors, induce major signaling cascades following viral stimulation.	2097	2261
25277705	Indeed, the viral load of RSV correlates with RIG-I mRNA levels.	2262	2326
25277705	TLR3, −7, −8 and −9 recognize nucleic acid ligands but TLR4 proteins also bind to a major viral antigen of RSV F (fusion) protein.	2327	2457
25277705	Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) and melanoma differentiation–associated protein-5 (MDA5) equally could be associated with RSV-induced immune responses.	2458	2624
25277705	Additionally, ligands for nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD)-like receptors (NLR), such as NOD2, enhance TLR-ligand-induced activation and triggering such signaling cascades are plausible means of developing RSV-specific immunity.	2625	2887
25277705	Therefore, RSV can induce several pathogen recognition receptors resulting in multiple host immune responses.	2888	2997
25277705	In this study we employed in vitro and in vivo approaches to evaluate the cytokine/chemokine response to RSV infection.	2998	3117
25277705	Normal human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and A549 cells were utilized to examine 42 cytokine responses following RSV stimuli.	3118	3251
25277705	Several newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines (leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-β)) were induced in airways cells in vitro and in mouse lungs during a viral infection in vivo.	3252	3543
25277705	The influence of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) signaling pathways were examined on RSV-induced cytokine levels in mice and A549 cells.	3544	3760
25277705	The significance of LIF, an IL-6 cytokine family member, expression during RSV was also determined.	3761	3860
25277705	LIF is primarily recognized for its ability to preserve the totipotency of embryonic stem cells and is detected in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but recently LIF was described to protect the lung from injury during pneumonia.	3861	4099
25277705	Utilizing neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, LIF was observed to play a critical role in protecting the lung from injury during RSV infection.	4100	4234
25277705	Our findings indicate that RSV infection induces a significant host cytokine response associated with viral clearance and airway protection.	4235	4375
25277705	A human cytokine array was used to simultaneously detect the levels of 36 different cytokines, chemokines, and acute phase proteins in A549 cells treated with mock and RSV for 24 hours.	4376	4561
25277705	Protein array analysis identified that a large number of cytokines are released from A549 cells upon RSV stimuli (Additional file 1: Figure S1).	4562	4706
25277705	The most striking RSV inducible cytokines were IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1/CCL2, MIF, GROα/CXCL1, and RANTES/CCL5 (Additional file 1: Figure S1).	4707	4842
25277705	To complement the cytokine array analysis, multiplex analysis was performed to examine 42 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors released from A549 cells, in addition to human SAE cells.	4843	5031
25277705	Both SAE and A549 cells released similar cytokines in response to RSV infection (Table 1).	5032	5122
25277705	In both A549 and SAE cells, RSV significantly induced IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, CXCL1, CCL11, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), G-CSF, IFN-γ, CXCL10, CCL2, MIF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), TNF-α, VEGF, LIF, CCL27, CXCL12, SCGF-β and SCF release into media.	5123	5405
25277705	Interestingly, SAE cells also released IL-16, IL-18, CXCL9, CCL7 and HGF upon RSV stimulation.	5406	5500
25277705	A549 cells differed to SAE cells in releasing IL-10, IL-12(p70), GM-CSF, CCL3, CCL4 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) upon RSV stimulation.	5501	5656
25277705	RSV-inducible cytokines were examined following stimulation with UV-inactivated RSV in A549 cells, to determine if cytokines are induced following viral detection or viral replication.	5657	5841
25277705	RANTES/CCL5, CXCL12, SCGF-β, CCL27, LIF, MIF, CXCL10, CXCL1, CCL2, IL-6, SCF, IL-7, TNF-α and G-CSF were all secreted following stimuli with live RSV only (Figure 1).	5842	6008
25277705	IL-8 and IFN- γ was secreted at significantly higher levels from UV-RSV treated cells compared to mock treated cells but at lower levels to live RSV (Figure 1A).	6009	6170
25277705	Therefore, RSV replication induces a plethora of immune responses in airway epithelial cells.	6171	6264
25277705	Gene expression and BALF protein levels for MIF, LIF, CCL27, CXCL12/SDF-1α, SCGF-β and SCF were examined in wild-type (FVB/NJ) mice 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days post mock, RSV or UV-RSV intranasal challenge (Figure 2), as these cytokines have not been reported in the literature to be RSV inducible.	6265	6561
25277705	Increased gene expression of MIF, LIF, CXCL12, SCGF-β and SCF was observed following 1 day of RSV challenge (Figure 2A).	6562	6682
25277705	RSV inducible CCL27 was only observed 5 days post challenge.	6683	6743
25277705	UV-inactivated RSV did not alter airway expression of these cytokines (Figure 2A).	6744	6826
25277705	Multiplex or ELISA was performed to examine BALF protein levels of LIF, CCL27, CXCL12/SDF-1α, and SCF.	6827	6929
25277705	Similarly to gene expression profiles, BALF levels of SCF, LIF, CCL27/CTAK and CXCL12/SDF-1α were all enhanced in mice exposed to RSV infection compared to mock or UV-RSV treated animals (Figure 2B).	6930	7129
25277705	These new RSV-inducible targets represent new plausible targets for investigation in the human disease.	7130	7233
25277705	Nasopharyngeal cells from infants with RSV infection have gene expression differences for MDA-5, RIG-1, TLR-7, and TLR-8.	7234	7355
25277705	Since RSV infection induces a large repertoire of host cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, several of the major pathogen recognition receptors were profiled in each cell type to determine the potential regulators of the immune response to RSV infection.	7356	7615
25277705	Therefore, qPCR and immunoblots were performed for p-IRF3(ser396), IRF3, p-TBK1(ser172), TBK-1/NAK, RIG-I, LGP2, MDA5, MAVS, LGP2, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, Trif, MyD88, IRAK1, NOD2 and β-actin.	7616	7808
25277705	The remaining TLR genes and other NOD genes (NOD1 and NLXR1) were also profiled in both cell types.	7809	7908
25277705	A549 and SAE cells became readily infected with RSV 24 hours after incubation (Figure 3A) and had significant increases in RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, NOD2, Trif, TLR2 and TLR3 gene expression in both cell types (Figure 3B).	7909	8124
25277705	TLR1, 6 and 10 gene expressions were also enhanced in SAE cells following RSV infection.	8125	8213
25277705	TLR4 gene expression was increased in A549s cells.	8214	8264
25277705	Protein profiles were analyzed for several of the receptors with the greatest gene induction with RSV infection, by immunoblots.	8265	8393
25277705	Increased cellular protein levels of RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, Trif and TLR3 were observed by immunblotting in both A549 and SAE cells (Figure 3C).	8394	8534
25277705	Utilizing densitometry analysis, no significant changes in NOD2 and TLR2 protein levels were observed in either A549 or SAE cells possibility due to lower induction of gene expression for these targets (Additional file 1: Figure S2).	8535	8768
25277705	To investigate the activation status of receptors, downstream signaling transduction analysis was performed for the phosphorylation of IRF3, TBK1, degradation of IRAK1 and increased expression of Trif and MyD88.	8769	8980
25277705	IRF3 and TBK1 underwent phosphorylation following RSV infection, confirming activation of these pathways (Figure 3C and Additional file 1: Figure S2).	8981	9131
25277705	Equally, increases in Trif and decreased IRAK1 levels were observed after RSV challenge (Figure 3C and Additional file 1: Figure S2), further confirming that several receptors underwent activation.	9132	9329
25277705	Due to the activation intensity of the RLR, activation of IRF3 and induction of the Trif/TLR3, in vivo studies were undertaken specifically examining the Trif and RLR pathways.	9330	9506
25277705	Others have reported that RIG-I is essential for host immune defenses against RSV and our in vitro studies suggest that both TLR3 and RLR signaling are highly responsive to RSV.	9507	9684
25277705	To assess the importance of RSV-induced TLR3 and RLR signaling on cytokine production, wild-type (FVB/NJ), Trif and Mavs KO mice were infected with RSV and cytokines levels were investigated by qPCR on lung tissue and multiplex analysis on BALF.	9685	9930
25277705	Mavs KO mice were utilized as MAVS links RIG-I and MDA5 to antiviral effectors responses.	9931	10020
25277705	Mice were exposed to RSV and euthanized days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 days after the RSV challenge.	10021	10112
25277705	Loss of Trif and Mavs expression in mice did not significantly alter loss in body weight following RSV infection compared to wild-type mice (Figure 4A) but loss of Mavs or Trif resulted in a greater viral load in the airway tissue on day 9 following infection compared to wild-type mice (Figure 4B).	10113	10412
25277705	Cytokine release into the airways was assessed by multiplex analysis 3 days post RSV challenge and RSV infection yielded a significant release of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IFN-γ, MCP-1/CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CCL4, CCL11, LIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1α/CXCL12, SCF and CXCL1 into the BALF of control mice (Table 2).	10413	10765
25277705	RSV also increased gene expression of IL-27, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, MIF and SCGF-β in the airways of control mice 1-day post RSV challenge (Table 3).	10766	10915
25277705	Loss of Mavs expression subdued RSV-induced IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL1 release into the airways (Table 2).	10916	11066
25277705	Mavs KO mice also had significantly reduced IL-22, CXCL9, CXCL10 and MIF gene expression compared to wild-type mice (Table 3).	11067	11193
25277705	Loss of Trif expression altered the RSV induced release of IL-1β, IL-5, CXCL12 and IFN-γ (Table 2) and airway gene expression of MIF, LIF and CXCL12 (Table 2).	11194	11353
25277705	RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2) and Trif were silenced in A549 cells to establish which RLR signaling was required for RSV inducible host cytokines (See Additional file 1: Figure S3 for RLR and Trif knockdown).	11354	11560
25277705	Loss of RIG-I expression significantly decreased RSV induced IL-1β, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12(p70), MCP-1/CCL2, IP-9/CXCL11, IP-10/CXCL10, TNF-α, MIF, RANTES/CCL5 and SCGF-β (Figure 5).	11561	11738
25277705	Interestingly, SCGF-β release was altered following loss of expression of RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 (Figure 5A).	11739	11846
25277705	CTAK/CCL27 release was only altered following silencing of MDA5 or Trif expression (Figure 5A).	11847	11942
25277705	Trif expression regulated MIF, LIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1α/CXCL12 and IL-1β (Figure 5).	11943	12026
25277705	Therefore, these results show that host RIG-I is the primary RLR to regulate RSV-mediated immune responses.	12027	12134
25277705	Administration of recombinant LIF to the airways has a protective effect in response to LPS treatment, hyperoxia and to bacterial pneumonia.	12135	12275
25277705	The functional relevance of LIF expression during a RSV infection is unknown.	12276	12353
25277705	Administration of anti-LIF IgG resulted in RSV-infected animals losing weight faster than control IgG treated littermates (Figure 6A).	12354	12488
25277705	The total number of immune cells in the BALF was comparable between RSV treated groups (Figure 6B).	12489	12588
25277705	However, BALF cells in the animals administered anti-LIF IgG were undergoing apoptosis at a greater rate than control IgG animals (Figure 6B).	12589	12731
25277705	Inhibition of LIF signaling also subdued RSV induced airway hyperresponsiveness, demonstrated by respiratory system resistance (Rn) measurements during a methacholine dose challenge (Figure 6C).	12732	12926
25277705	Anti-LIF IgG treated mice had significantly higher protein concentration (Figure 6D) in the BALF compared to infected control IgG treated mice, suggesting potentially increased damage and disruption of the epithelial cell barrier.	12927	13157
25277705	Lung RSV burdens were not significantly affected by LIF blockade seven days following RSV challenge (Figure 6E).	13158	13270
25277705	Lung cytokine gene expression was determined by qPCR and blocking LIF signaling resulted in enhanced CXCL1, RANTES/CCL5, CXCL10/IP-10, MIP-1α/CCL3 and MCP-1/CCL2 compared to control IgG treated mice, 7-days post RSV infection (Figure 6F).	13271	13509
25277705	Altogether, these results suggest that LIF expression suppresses lung cell apoptosis, airway hyperresponsiveness, epithelial cell barrier damage, cytokine production and subsequently airway injury.	13510	13707
25277705	To our knowledge, these findings represent the first evidence that MIF, LIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1α/CXCL12, SCGF-β and SCF are expressed during an RSV infection and LIF signaling is critical to prevent lung damage.	13708	13918
25277705	Others and we demonstrate that a spectrum of cytokines is released to counter RSV infection but further analysis is required to determine the role of these immune responses in RSV pathology.	13919	14109
25277705	The results of this study demonstrate that RLRs and Trif signaling pathways play major roles in the immune response to RSV infection for both inflammation induction and resolution.	14110	14290
25277705	Interestingly, 34 of the 42 cytokines examined in A549 and SAE cells were released upon RSV stimulation.	14291	14395
25277705	This study highlights the robust epithelial responses to RSV infection, characterizes two major signaling cascade needed to counter viral infectivity and identified the role of LIF signaling during an RSV infection.	14396	14611
25277705	Many of the RSV-inducible cytokines described in this study have already been described in clinical samples, in vitro epithelial cell culture or in animals models, such as elevated MIG/CXCL9 levels in BALB/c mice inoculated with RSV.	14612	14845
25277705	Importantly, increases in media or mouse BALF IL1-RA, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/ MIP-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ and CCL5/RANTES following RSV infection reflects similar observations from clinical studies.	14846	15082
25277705	To our knowledge, we are the first to identify that RSV infection in epithelial cells and mice can induce MIF, LIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1α/CXCL12, SCGF-β and SCF expression and secretions.	15083	15267
25277705	This is an important finding as each new target can potentially play a different role in RSV clearance.	15268	15371
25277705	MIF activates lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages and plays a key role in several host immune cell responses.	15372	15497
25277705	CTAK/CCL27 is a cytokine associated with T cell activation and migration and is elevated in severe tuberculosis cases.	15498	15616
25277705	Recombinant protein SDF-1α/CXCL12 does not prevent RSV infection of Hep2 cells but SDF-1α/CXCL12 is strongly chemotactic for lymphocytes and contributes to pulmonary fibrosis.	15617	15792
25277705	The potential role of SCGF-β in RSV infections is not as straightforward to elucidate but SCGF-β can support growth of primitive hematopoietic cells and can promotes proliferation of erythroid or myeloid progenitors.	15793	16009
25277705	SCF and its soluble receptor c-kit correlate with asthma severity.	16010	16076
25277705	This study identified an important role for LIF in RSV infection.	16077	16142
25277705	Therefore, identifying these new RSV inducible targets in clinical samples and their role in viral clearance may provide important insights into host responses to RSV infection.	16143	16320
25277705	Other investigators have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of LIF expression in other models of lung injury, as it protects against lung injury.	16321	16470
25277705	Recombinant LIF reduces cytokine expression and alters alveolar neutrophil numbers.	16471	16554
25277705	Lif KO animals have increased expression of CXCL1, GM-CSF, RANTES/CCL5 and MIP-1α/CCL3 early during an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model and reduced CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL10 at a later stage of the disease.	16555	16773
25277705	In this study neutralizing LIF signaling enhanced CXCL1, RANTES/CCL5, CXCL10/IP-10, MIP-1α/CCL3 and MCP-1/CCL2 at day 7 of an RSV infection.	16774	16914
25277705	Therefore LIF expression has the potential to regulate key factors in the immune system.	16915	17003
25277705	Targeted overexpression of LIF in mouse airway epithelial cells significantly protects the airways during hyperoxia, with improved survival and decreased pulmonary edema.	17004	17174
25277705	Other IL-6 family members (IL-6 and IL-11) have similar functions, which suggest that IL-6 family cytokines may collectively protect lungs from injury.	17175	17326
25277705	LIF is a prominent STAT3-activating cytokine that facilitates tissue protection during pneumonia and plays a similar airway protective role during RSV infection.	17327	17488
25277705	The significance of LIF expression and STAT3 activation in RSV infection represents an intriguing area for further study.	17489	17610
25277705	LIF has been shown to regulate apoptosis with some investigators suggesting LIF acts as a pro-apoptotic mediator while others have demonstrated LIF to have anti-apoptotic potential.	17611	17792
25277705	In this study increased apoptotic BAL cells were observed in animals administered anti-LIF IgG prior to RSV infection.	17793	17911
25277705	Enhanced Fas, Fap, Il24, and Tnfsf15 expression is observed following LIF depletion in animals with bacterial pneumonia, which could contribute to the increased apoptosis observed here.	17912	18097
25277705	Whether this induction of apoptosis contributes to the pathology observed in this study is unknown and requires further investigation.	18098	18232
25277705	Epithelial damage correlates with airway hyperreactivity in asthma patients and the increased protein levels in the BALF of animals treated with anti-LIF IgG prior to RSV infection could also contribute to the enhanced airway resistance observed in these animals.	18233	18496
25277705	LIF enhances the maintenance of stem cells, which may directly impact lung tissue regeneration and repair, similar to IL-6 activation of STAT3.	18497	18640
25277705	These data reveal the vast biological processes of LIF signaling during RSV infection.	18641	18727
25277705	Whether the other cytokines identified in this study also play such major roles on disease pathology needs to be addressed.	18728	18851
25277705	Our study also reveals that Trif and RLR signaling regulate a significant proportion of the cytokines induced by RSV infection, with LIF expression sensitive to Trif activation.	18852	19029
25277705	Prior to undertaking this study, several pathogen recognition receptors were associated with regulating the immune response against RSV infection, with RIG-I, TLR7 and TLR3 known to affect numerous cytokine responses.	19030	19247
25277705	Several investigators characterized the RIG-I-like family proteins as critical for the detection of RSV, using human cell lines and knockout mice.	19248	19394
25277705	RIG-I principally recognizes dsRNA; however Sendai virus defective interfering RNA and the genomic “panhandle” structure of influenza virus activate RLR signaling.	19395	19558
25277705	These “panhandle” structures allow negative-strand RNA viral genomes to achieve partially double-stranded RNA, which may allow RSV to induce RLRs.	19559	19705
25277705	Our study observed early cytokine responses following RSV infection and identified a pronounced RIG-I response, which could be lost over time following NS1 or NS2 binding to RIG-I/MDA5 as reported by others.	19706	19913
25277705	Also, RSV induction of TLR3 is regulated by RIG-I-dependent IFN-β secretions from infected epithelial cells, which is mediated by both IFN response-stimulated element (ISRE) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) sites in its proximal promoter.	19914	20179
25277705	Therefore there are multiple levels of RLRs regulation in RSV infections that can both trigger RLRs responses or subsequently adapt to block RLR-mediated signaling.	20180	20344
25277705	Recently, several investigators have utilized well-defined primary cell culture techniques to investigate viral-host interactions, which may be a closer representation of human RSV infections compared to the approach we employed here.	20345	20579
25277705	IFN-α/β are not secreted by RSV-infected well-defined bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that there could be major signaling differences in well-defined primary cell culture techniques and monolayers.	20580	20784
25277705	However, our overall findings suggest that utilizing cell monolayers in combination with mouse models is an acceptable approach as our cytokine profile are comparable to that observed in the human disease state.	20785	20996
25277705	In addition, our study has exposed new RSV inducible host immune response cytokines.	20997	21081
25277705	Since we only explored epithelial cell responses in vitro, our in vivo parallel approach also validates our monolayer results and suggests that the epithelium is a significant source of initial immune responses following RSV infection.	21082	21317
25277705	Our studies demonstrate that RSV exposure stimulates a cascade of early immune response in epithelial cells and a large number of these responses act in an RLR/Trif dependent manner.	21318	21500
25277705	These findings also identified new cytokines that are triggered by RSV lung infection, with LIF signaling critical for the protection of the lung from injury during RSV infection.	21501	21680
25277705	Profiling the loss and gain of the other identified cytokines (MIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1α/CXCL12, SCGF-β and SCF) over the course of an RSV infection may help to decipher the relevancy of these cytokines in viral clearance and lung integrity, and represents important questions to be addressed by future studies.	21681	21990
25277705	Human RSV strain A2 (ATCC, Manassas, VA; #VR-1540) was infected at a multiplicity of 0.1 into Hep2 cells.	21991	22096

25277705	All analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Software (Version 5 for Mac OS X).	27250	27332
21070631	The loss of noradrenergic neurones of the locus coeruleus is a striking feature of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD).	0	117
21070631	A gradual, moderate loss is found with ageing in healthy people, but a more dramatic loss is seen in AD.	118	222
21070631	A meta-analysis showed similarly high losses of noradrenergic neurones (24 studies) as of cholinergic neurones (33 studies), with losses four times greater than those of dopaminergic cells in AD.	223	418
21070631	Noradrenergic neurones project from the brainstem to innervate wide areas of the forebrain.	419	510
21070631	Levels of noradrenaline (NA, norepinephrine) in target regions have also sometimes been reported lowered in ageing, e.g. in the hippocampus and hypothalamus.	511	668
21070631	They have generally been found to be further reduced in AD, e.g. in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen and neocortex, although not in one small study.	669	840
21070631	Both the loss of noradrenergic neurones and that of NA in target regions have been correlated with the severity of the disease.	841	968
21070631	Changes in the noradrenergic system in AD are reviewed in Hermann et al 2004.	969	1046
21070631	Dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyses the conversion of dopamine to NA.	1047	1119
21070631	Its activity is also reduced in postmortem hippocampus and neocortex in AD, without correlating with the loss of noradrenergic neurones.	1120	1256
21070631	Variation in DBH activity both in serum and in CSF has been reported to be over 80% heritable.	1257	1351
21070631	The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), -1021C/T (rs1611115), has been identified as the main predictor of DBH activity in plasma.	1352	1484
21070631	It is responsible for ~30% to ~50% of the considerable variation in such activity between people, as replicated in several different populations.	1485	1630
21070631	The -1021T allele contributes to greatly lowered DBH activity through codominant inheritance.	1631	1724
21070631	In view therefore of the chronic inflammation seen in the AD brain and of the anti-inflammatory role of NA, Mateo et al 2006 investigated interactions between the -1021T allele and SNPs of the regulatory regions of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, IL1A and IL6.	1725	1990
21070631	They reported interactions between DBH -1021TT and both IL1A -889T (rs1800587) and IL6 -174GG (rs1800795).	1991	2097
21070631	In the Epistasis Project, we recently confirmed reported interactions between the inflammation-related cytokine genes, IL6 and IL10, that contribute to the development of AD.	2098	2272
21070631	We therefore now decided also to examine the interactions between DBH and both IL1A and IL6 in the Epistasis Project, with 1757 cases of AD and 6294 controls.	2273	2431
21070631	In view of the age and sex differences that have been reported in brain inflammation in the elderly, and of the relevant influence of sex steroids, we also examined possible interactions of DBH with age and sex.	2432	2643
21070631	We found an association of the low-activity DBH -1021T allele with the risk of AD.	2644	2726
21070631	The Epistasis Project aims primarily to replicate interactions that have been reported to affect the risk of AD.	2727	2839
21070631	Sample-sets were drawn from narrow geographical regions with relatively homogeneous, Caucasian populations, by seven AD research groups: Bonn, Bristol, Nottingham, OPTIMA (Oxford), Oviedo, Rotterdam and Santander.	2840	3053
21070631	Sample characteristics by geographical region are given in Additional file 1: Table S1.	3054	3141
21070631	All AD cases were diagnosed "definite" or "probable" by CERAD or NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.	3142	3229
21070631	AD cases were sporadic, i.e. possible autosomal dominant cases were excluded, based on family history.	3230	3332
21070631	The median ages (interquartile ranges) of AD cases were 79.0 (73.0-85.2) and of controls were 76.9 (71.3-83.0).	3333	3444
21070631	Fuller details of our sample-sets are given elsewhere.	3445	3499
21070631	Ethical approval was obtained by each of the participating groups (Additional file 1: Table S2).	3500	3596
21070631	Blood samples were taken after written informed consent had been obtained from the subjects or their representatives.	3597	3714
21070631	Genotyping for the six centres other than Rotterdam (below) was performed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, using the iPLEX Gold assay (Sequenom Inc.).	3715	3872
21070631	Whole genome amplified DNA was used for 82% of samples; genomic DNA was used for the 18% of samples that were not suitable for whole genome amplification.	3873	4027
21070631	A Sequenom iPLEX, designed for quality control purposes, was used to assess genotype concordance between genomic and whole genome amplified DNA for 168 individuals.	4028	4192
21070631	Assays for all SNPs were designed using the eXTEND suite and MassARRAY Assay Design software version 3.1 (Sequenom Inc.).	4193	4314
21070631	Samples were amplified in multiplexed PCR reactions before allele specific extension.	4315	4400
21070631	Allelic discrimination was obtained by analysis with a MassARRAY Analyzer Compact mass spectrometer.	4401	4501
21070631	Genotypes were automatically assigned and manually confirmed using MassArray TyperAnalyzer software version 4.0 (Sequenom Inc.).	4502	4630
21070631	Gender markers were included in all iPLEX assays as a quality control metric for confirmation of plate/sample identity.	4631	4750
21070631	Genotyping of DBH intron 10 A/G (rs1611131) and IL6 intron 2 A/G (rs2069837) was carried out using KASPar technology by KBioscience http://www.kbioscience.co.uk.	4751	4912
21070631	No SNPs were imputed.	4913	4934
21070631	Genotyping in the Rotterdam cohort was done on Version 3 Illumina-Infinium-II HumanHap550 SNP array (Illumina, San Diego, USA) and additionally, SNPs were imputed using MACH software http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/ with HapMap CEU Release 22 as a reference.	4935	5204
21070631	The reliability of imputation was estimated for each imputed SNP with the ratio of expected and observed dosage variance (O/E ratio).	5205	5338
21070631	Only samples with high-quality extracted DNA were genotyped; 5974 were available with good quality genotyping data; 5502 of these had reliable phenotypes.	5339	5493
21070631	For this study, DBH exon 3 Ala197Thr (rs5320), IL1A exon 5 Ala114Ser (rs17561) and IL6 intron 2 A/G (rs2069837) were genotyped, and the other SNPs (Table 1) were imputed.	5494	5664
21070631	We assessed associations with logistic regression models, controlling for age, gender, study centre and the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOEε4), using R Version 2.10.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).	5665	5894
21070631	The adjusted synergy factors were derived from the interaction terms in those models.	5895	5980
21070631	Since both -1021TT and -1021TC are associated with reduced plasma DBH activity, although the former more so than the latter, we combined the two genotypes in all analyses, i.e. using a model that assumes that the -1021T allele is dominant.	5981	6220
21070631	For reasons of power, it is usual to use minor-allele-dominant models in interaction analyses, even where a codominant model might produce a better fit.	6221	6373
21070631	This is the almost invariable practice with the APOEε4 allele.	6374	6436
21070631	Heterogeneity among centres was controlled thus.	6437	6485
21070631	We first fitted a model including random effect terms by centre, which accounts for correlated (clustered) observations within populations while avoiding estimating extra parameters in the regression models.	6486	6693
21070631	We then fitted centre as a fixed effect term with six contrasts.	6694	6758
21070631	We compared the goodness of fit of both approaches using Akaike's Information Criterion, which penalises the model's likelihood by a function of the number of parameters in the model.	6759	6942
21070631	We found that the model with fixed effect terms by centre was preferable and used it to control for different frequencies between populations.	6943	7085
21070631	Overdispersion was controlled by fitting generalized linear models with a quasi-binomial family with logit link.	7086	7198
21070631	Where the overall synergy factor was significant at p < 0.05, the seven individual centres and the two geographical regions, North Europe and North Spain, were also examined.	7199	7373
21070631	In view of the genetic differences found between North and South Europe in previous studies and in the Epistasis Project (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S1, and), we included separate analyses for North Europe and North Spain.	7374	7603
21070631	North Europe here comprises Bonn, Bristol, Nottingham, Oxford and Rotterdam; North Spain comprises Oviedo and Santander.	7604	7724
21070631	Power calculations were based on the observed synergy factor values.	7725	7793
21070631	A Cox proportional hazards model, with a frailty term to account for centre differences, controlling also for sex and APOE4, was fitted to see whether the DBH -1021T allele was associated with the onset age of AD, after confirming the assumption of proportional hazards.	7794	8064
21070631	Comparisons of allelic frequencies between North Spain and North Europe were by Fisher's exact test.	8065	8165
21070631	Linkage disequilibrium data were estimated using the R genetics library http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/genetics/index.html.	8166	8297
21070631	All tests of significance and power calculations were two-sided.	8298	8362
21070631	Table 1 shows the allelic frequencies and patterns of linkage disequilibrium of the eight studied SNPs in controls.	8363	8478
21070631	There were differences between North Europe and North Spain in allelic frequencies of five SNPs.	8479	8575
21070631	IL1A -889C/T and exon 5 Ala114Ser were in almost 100% linkage disequilibrium.	8576	8653
21070631	Genotype distributions of the eight SNPs in AD and controls from each of the seven centres are shown in Additional file 1: Table S3; allelic frequencies by country are given in Additional file 1: Table S4.	8654	8859
21070631	Hardy-Weinberg analysis was performed for both cases and controls, both in the Rotterdam samples and in the samples from the other six centres, which were genotyped by the Sanger Institute.	8860	9049
21070631	In three of these 32 analyses, the samples were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, compared with two as would be expected by chance.	9050	9182
21070631	Those three sample-sets were all AD cases from the six centres: IL1A -889C/T (p = 0.03) and intron 6 A/C (p = 0.004), and IL6 -174G/C (p = 0.02).	9183	9328
21070631	Since another SNP, Arg535Cys in exon 11 of DBH (rs6271), has also been reported to influence plasma DBH activity, although much less so than -1021C/T, we performed preliminary analysis of that SNP on data from six centres, i.e. excluding Rotterdam.	9329	9577
21070631	DBH -1021TT+TC versus CC was associated with AD overall: odds ratio = 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.4, p = 0.005).	9578	9699
21070631	There were interactions with sex and age (Table 2).	9700	9751
21070631	The interaction with sex was significant overall and in North Europe, while that with age was significant overall and in North Spain.	9752	9885
21070631	In view of those interactions, we stratified our analyses by age and by sex.	9886	9962
21070631	Those stratified analyses established that the observed association of DBH -1021TT+TC with AD in the population was due to an association nearly restricted to men < 75 years old: odds ratio = 2.2 (1.4-3.3, 0.0004) (Table 3).	9963	10187
21070631	Similar results were obtained in North Europe and North Spain (Table 4).	10188	10260
21070631	The DBH -1021T allele was not associated with onset age of AD.	10261	10323
21070631	We found an interaction between DBH -1021TT+TC and IL1A -889TT (Table 5): synergy factor = 1.9 (1.2-3.1, 0.005).	10324	10436
21070631	This interaction was consistent between North Europe and North Spain.	10437	10506
21070631	We also found a possible interaction between DBH -1021TT+TC and IL6 -174GG (Table 5), but only in North Europe: synergy factor = 1.5 (1.07-2.0, 0.02) (Table 5).	10507	10667
21070631	We also analysed the results for DBH -1021TT+TC and IL1A -889TT when stratified by each other (Table 6).	10668	10772
21070631	Those analyses showed that each risk factor was only associated with AD in the presence of the other factor.	10773	10881
21070631	There were no main effects of any of these SNPs.	10882	10930
21070631	The overall odds ratio for 197Ala homozygotes (versus carriers of one or two copies of Thr) was 1.01 (0.8-1.25, 0.9) and for intron 10 AA (versus AG+GG) was 0.97 (0.85-1.1, 0.7).	10931	11109
21070631	However, the interaction of 197Ala homozygotes with sex was slightly stronger than that of -1021TT+TC, but only in Northern Europeans: synergy factor = 2.3 (1.4-3.9, 0.001).	11110	11283
21070631	The only apparently significant result for intron 10 AA was an interaction with age, only in Northern Spanish, very similar to that of -1021TT+TC: synergy factor = 2.1 (1.1-3.95, 0.025).	11284	11470
21070631	The only apparently significant result in the preliminary analysis of Arg535Cys was probably due to chance (data not shown).	11471	11595
21070631	We have shown a clear association between the presence of the DBH -1021T allele and AD (Table 4): odds ratio for -1021TT+TC versus CC = 1.2 (1.06-1.4, 0.005), controlling for centre, age, sex and APOE ε4 genotype.	11596	11809
21070631	This association was nearly restricted to men < 75 years old: 2.2 (1.4-3.3, 0.0004).	11810	11894
21070631	The interactions with sex and age were both significant (p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively, Table 2).	11895	11994
21070631	Table 3 shows that the effect of age was consistent between men and women and the effect of gender was consistent between the two age groups.	11995	12136
21070631	All these results were consistent between North Europe and North Spain (Tables 2 &4).	12137	12222
21070631	We therefore believe these associations to be real.	12223	12274
21070631	However, large numbers will be needed to replicate these interactions (see the power estimates in Tables 2 &5).	12275	12386
21070631	We also found a probable interaction between the presence of DBH -1021T and IL1A -889TT (Table 5), thus partially replicating Mateo et al 2006, who reported an interaction between DBH -1021TT and IL1A -889T.	12387	12594
21070631	The synergy factors were consistent between North Europe and North Spain (Table 5).	12595	12678
21070631	Also, each risk factor, i.e. DBH -1021T and IL1A -889TT, was only associated with AD risk in the presence of the interacting factor (Table 6), thus indicating epistasis.	12679	12848
21070631	However, although the results were consistent in the three largest sample-sets, Rotterdam, Santander and OPTIMA, models for the smaller sample-sets proved unreliable.	12849	13015
21070631	Thus we can only describe this interaction as probable, not definite.	13016	13085
21070631	The IL1A -889TT genotype has been found to increase transcriptional activity in assays of promoter function.	13086	13194
21070631	Meta-analyses have shown heterogeneity between studies, but a possible, weak association of the -889T allele with AD: odds ratio = 1.07 (0.99-1.16) (23 Sept 2010, 29 sample-sets: http://www.alzgene.org/).	13195	13399
21070631	We also found a possible interaction between DBH -1021T and IL6 -174GG, partially replicating that between DBH -1021TT and IL6 -174GG reported by Mateo et al.	13400	13558
21070631	However, in this case the interaction was only seen in North Europe and the results were inconsistent between the two European regions (Table 5) and between the seven centres.	13559	13734
21070631	Thus, this apparent interaction may not be real.	13735	13783
21070631	The only apparently significant results for the other two DBH SNPs studied in our full dataset, exon 3 Ala197Thr (rs5320) and intron 10 A/G (rs1611131), were somewhat inconsistent, precluding any firm conclusions.	13784	13997
21070631	The -1021T allele has consistently been associated with strikingly reduced plasma DBH activity.	13998	14093
21070631	The allele partially disrupts consensus transcriptional motifs for n-MYC and MEF-2.	14094	14177
21070631	When DBH promoter/reporters were cotransfected with n-MYC or MEF-2, the allele affected the response.	14178	14279
21070631	The allele is thus functional and, although we cannot assume that it has the same effect in the brain as in the plasma, we may plausibly speculate that it does also have some influence on DBH activity in the brain.	14280	14494
21070631	DBH catalyses the conversion of dopamine to NA.	14495	14542
21070631	The -1021C/T SNP may therefore affect levels of both catecholamines.	14543	14611
21070631	However, although reduced levels of NA are seen in AD brain, raised levels of dopamine have generally not been found.	14612	14729
21070631	We will therefore base the discussion below on the hypothesis that the association of the -1021T allele with AD risk is mainly due to an effect on NA levels in the brain.	14730	14900
21070631	One likely result of changed DBH activity is misregulation of inflammation in the brain.	14901	14989
21070631	The mechanisms that control inflammation in the brain differ from those in the periphery; an important part of the former control system is the noradrenergic network (reviewed in).	14990	15170
21070631	The anti-inflammatory role of NA has been shown in cultured cells and rodent brains (reviewed in).	15171	15269
21070631	Raised levels of NA reduced activation of astrocytes and microglia, and lowered expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.	15270	15406
21070631	Noradrenergic depletion increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and activation of astrocytes and microglia, and impaired microglial phagocytosis of β-amyloid.	15407	15592
21070631	Astrocytes are considered major targets of noradrenaline in the brain (reviewed in), through their β2-adrenoceptors, which activate the cyclic AMP pathway, which may lead to the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).	15593	15837
21070631	These receptors down-regulate expression of pro-inflammatory genes (PPARγ:; PPARδ:).	15838	15922
21070631	The importance of the cyclic AMP pathway in AD was underlined by the recent identification of the cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein as the transcription factor of most relevance to networks of AD-related genes.	15923	16143
21070631	The inhibition of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor κB, by its endogenous inhibitor, IκB, may also mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of NA.	16144	16311
21070631	However, the anti-inflammatory role of NA remains controversial and it may even have pro-inflammatory actions in certain conditions.	16312	16444
21070631	Nevertheless, the predominant evidence suggests a mainly anti-inflammatory, regulatory role of NA in the brain.	16445	16556
21070631	This role is weakened in ageing and seriously disrupted in AD.	16557	16619
21070631	Thus, elderly non-demented carriers of the DBH -1021T allele with presumed low activity may be more vulnerable to low-grade inflammation in the brain.	16620	16770
21070631	This effect has been reported to be stronger in elderly men < 80 years old, consistent with our results.	16771	16875
21070631	In cell cultures and rodent brains, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been reported: to be induced by NA in astrocytes and neurones; to exert certain neuroprotective actions (reviewed in); and to promote synaptic plasticity and contribute to learning and memory (reviewed in).	16876	17163
21070631	BDNF levels have been found to be decreased in the postmortem hippocampus and neocortex in AD.	17164	17258
21070631	A large recent meta-analysis of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism found that the Met allele was associated with AD in women, but not men.	17259	17393
21070631	Noradrenergic neurones also produce and secrete other neuromodulators and neurotrophins (reviewed in).	17394	17496
21070631	These neurones also have roles in glial energy metabolism and the maintenance of the microvasculature and of the blood-brain barrier.	17497	17630
21070631	NA has actions against oxidative stress and against excitotoxicity.	17631	17698
21070631	Downstream of NA, the cyclic AMP pathway has neuroprotective and antioxidant actions in neuronal cultures.	17699	17805
21070631	NA protects against the neurotoxicity of β-amyloid (reviewed in).	17806	17871
21070631	However, potentially pathogenic contributions of NA to AD have also been reported.	17872	17954
21070631	Our results support an association of the functional DBH -1021T allele with increased risk of AD in men < 75 years.	17955	18070
21070631	Any of the above neuroprotective effects of NA (reviewed in) may influence that risk and that association.	18071	18177
21070631	However, there is considerable evidence for the role of NA in the control of inflammation in the brain (reviewed in).	18178	18295
21070631	In view therefore also of the likely interaction between DBH and the pro-inflammatory gene, IL1A, we suggest that the predominant, although not sole, mechanism of the above association with AD is misregulation of inflammation in the brain.	18296	18535
21070631	There is substantial evidence that inflammation is an early, pre-clinical factor in the development of AD (reviewed in).	18536	18656
21070631	We have previously proposed that inflammation is not only a reaction to the pathology of AD, but contributes to its onset.	18657	18779
21070631	Our present results support that view.	18780	18818
29183288	Allergic asthma is a prevalent disease characterized by airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and eventually remodeling.	0	124
29183288	Development of allergic asthma starts upon binding of inhaled allergens to their complementary IgEs, which activates IgE receptor-bearing mast cells and basophils.	125	288
29183288	These cells, in turn, activate an inflammatory cascade that causes lung infiltration with eosinophils, neutrophils, alternatively activated (M2) macrophages and (TH2) lymphocytes.	289	468
29183288	The inflammatory response is typically accompanied by mucus production, mucosal edema, and smooth-muscle hyperresponsiveness, which all contribute to the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) upon exposure to e.g. histamine and methacholine [1, 2].	469	727
29183288	Repeated episodes of allergic inflammation eventually lead to fibrosis and wall thickening in large and small airways (“airway remodeling”).	728	868
29183288	Adult women suffer more often and more severely from asthma than men do (for a recent review, see:).	869	969
29183288	Female (BALB/c) mice develop a more severe airway inflammation with more myeloid dendritic cells, effector T cells, alternatively activated macrophages, eosinophils, and higher concentrations of IgE and cytokines than male mice in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma models [4–6].	970	1254
29183288	Male (C57BL/6) [7, 8] and progesterone-treated female mice, on the other hand, develop stronger AHR due to the relaxing effect of estrogens on airway smooth muscle [8, 10, 11].	1255	1431
29183288	Taken together, these data reveal a sex difference in mice with respect to the respiratory and immune responses to allergens (for a recent review, see).	1432	1584
29183288	Depending on the pro-inflammatory agent, alveolar macrophages can develop into classically activated (M1) macrophages, alternatively activated M2) macrophages, and intermediate forms.	1585	1768
29183288	Alternatively activated lung macrophages appear to be major players in the development of airway inflammation of OVA-sensitized and -challenged (OVA/OVA) mice, and are more prevalent in female than in male mice.	1769	1980
29183288	The arginase1 (Arg1) gene is highly expressed in the cytoplasm of M2 macrophages [13, 15].	1981	2071
29183288	Accordingly, OVA-induced Arg1 expression is present in cells with the morphological characteristics of macrophages [16, 17].	2072	2196
29183288	The prominence of ARG1-containing macrophages underlies the hypothesis that arginine availability plays a key role in the development and presentation of asthma [18–20].	2197	2366
29183288	Arginase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) share, and compete for the substrate L-arginine.	2367	2456
29183288	Since NO relaxes the smooth-muscle cells of the bronchi and blood vessels, insufficient NO production may underlie AHR.	2457	2576
29183288	A high concentration of NO, however, promotes inflammation, mucosal swelling, and mucus secretion in the lung [21, 22].	2577	2696
29183288	Although the NOS enzymes have a ~500-fold higher affinity for arginine than arginase, the Vmax of arginase is ~1000-fold higher than that of NOS, which makes regional substrate depletion of arginine possible [21, 23].	2697	2914
29183288	Inhibition of arginine uptake into macrophages by ablation of the arginine transporter Cat2 and excess cationic proteins, such as eosinophil-derived major basic protein (MBP), also inhibits NO production, whereas pharmacological inhibition of arginase activity attenuates AHR, Arg1 expression, cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and expression of the inflammatory markers IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and NOS2 [26–29], and induces NO-mediated smooth-muscle relaxation.	2915	3383
29183288	Furthermore, supplementation of arginine mitigates the inflammatory airway response, increases arginase expression and activity, and elevates NOx levels [31, 32].	3384	3546
29183288	These findings suggest that arginase-mediated differences in substrate availability for NO synthesis may determine the clinical presentation of allergic asthma.	3547	3707
29183288	In an earlier study, we reported that Arg1 ablation in macrophages improved peripheral lung function and decreased mRNA expression of arginine-metabolizing and -transporting genes in OVA/OVA-treated male C57Bl/6 mice, but had no effect on airway inflammation.	3708	3967
29183288	In a similar study with Arg1 fl/fl /Tie2Cre tg/− mice, in which Arg1 exons 7 and 8 instead of exon 4 were flanked by loxP sites, Barron et al. also reported the lack of an effect of Arg1 elimination in myeloid cells on allergic lung inflammation, but found no effect on peripheral lung mechanics.	3968	4264
29183288	However, these authors did not differentiate between male and female mice.	4265	4339
29183288	In the present study, we examined the role of ARG1 on lung function and inflammation in OVA/OVA-treated female Arg1 fl/fl /Tie2Cre tg/− mice.	4340	4481
29183288	We report that Arg1 ablation in the lung of female C57Bl/6 mice did not protect peripheral lung mechanics, as in male mice, but did cause a smaller increase in the expression of L-arginine-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.	4482	4755
29183288	All animal experiments were approved by the Committee for Animal Care and Use of Maastricht University (DEC2005-146).	4756	4873
29183288	The generation of the transgenic mice was described before.	4874	4933
29183288	In brief: exon 4 of the mouse Arg1 gene was flanked with loxP sites and offspring were genotyped with primers Arg1-F1 and Arg1-R1 (Additional file 1: Table S1).	4934	5094
29183288	To ablate the floxed Arg1 allele (Arg1 fl) specifically in macrophages, Arg1 fl/fl mice were crossed with either LysM-Cre or Tie2-Cre mice.	5095	5234
29183288	The resulting Arg fl/fl /LysM-Cre tg/− (Arg1-KOLysM) mice and their Arg fl/fl /LysM-Cre −/− littermates (Arg1-Con) or Arg fl/fl /Tie2-Cre tg/− (Arg1- KOTie2) mice and Arg fl/fl /Tie2-Cre −/− littermates (Arg1-Con) were analyzed for the presence of the LysM-Cre or Tie2-Cre transgene by PCR using primer pairs LysM-F and LysM-R or Tie2-F and Tie2-R, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S1).	5235	5627
29183288	The Cre-excised Arg1 allele (298 bp) was detected with the primers Arg1-F2 (Additional file 1: Table S1) and Arg1-R1.	5628	5745
29183288	Mice were kept with 2-3 animals per filter-top cage with wood shavings as bedding on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with standard chow and water ad libitum.	5746	5896
29183288	Mice were checked daily for their well being by dedicated personnel of the animal facility.	5897	5988
29183288	Antigen sensitization and challenge have been described before.	5989	6052
29183288	In brief, ten-week old female mice were injected intraperitoneally on days 0 and 14 with 10 μg of ovalbumin (OVA), grade V (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) in the presence of 1 mg/mL of alum adjuvant (Imject Alum®, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).	6053	6319
29183288	On days 21-27, mice were exposed daily for 30 min to 1% (w/v) aerosolized OVA in PBS.	6320	6405
29183288	Lung function was assessed 12 h after the last challenge.	6406	6463
29183288	Groups, each containing 2-3 Arg1-Con or Arg1-KO mice pretreated with PBS or OVA (in total 7-8 mice per genotype and treatment), were tested at 3-4 different occasions to correct for any “session” effects.	6464	6668
29183288	Assessment of methacholine responsiveness was carried out as previously described.	6669	6751
29183288	Briefly, 7-8 mice per genotype and treatment were anesthetized with 80 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and an additional 40 mg/kg 30 min later.	6752	6890
29183288	An 18-gauge blunt needle was inserted into the trachea and connected to a mechanical small-animal ventilator (FlexiVent, Scireq, Montreal, Canada).	6891	7038
29183288	Mice were ventilated at 200 breaths/min with a delivered tidal volume of 0.25 mL against a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3 cm H2O applied by a water trap.	7039	7206
29183288	Lungs were challenged by delivering successively 0, 3.1, 12.5 and 50 mg/mL aerosolized methacholine (Sigma) in PBS through the tracheal cannula using an ultrasonic nebulizer during 10 deep inhalations with a tidal volume of 0.8 mL.	7207	7438
29183288	Following each methacholine challenge, the input impedance (Zrs) of the respiratory system was measured.	7439	7543
29183288	Parameters measured were: RN, the Newtonian airflow resistance, mostly in the conducting pulmonary airways; H, “tissue elastance”, or the elastic energy stored in tissues; G, “tissue resistance”, or viscous dissipation of energy in respiratory tissues and airflow heterogeneity.	7544	7822
29183288	After each experiment, blood was collected from the inferior caval vein of 7-8 mice per group in heparin-coated tubes, centrifuged 3 min at 5000*g, snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C as described previously.	7823	8028
29183288	Plasma OVA-specific IgE levels were determined by ELISA (MD Biosciences, M036005, Zürich, Switzerland).	8029	8132
29183288	For the determination of plasma amino acids, 50 μL of plasma was added to 4 mg sulfosalicylic acid, vortexed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use.	8133	8305
29183288	Plasma amino-acid concentrations were measured as described.	8306	8366
29183288	Following euthanasia, the left lung was filled with 10% buffered formalin (Klinipath, Deventer, The Netherlands) for 10 min at a pressure of 20 cm H2O and submersed overnight in 4% formaldehyde at room temperature prior to paraffin embedding.	8367	8609
29183288	The right lung was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized in a liquid-nitrogen-chilled mortar, and stored at −80 °C as described previously.	8610	8754
29183288	Immunostaining was performed as described previously.	8755	8808
29183288	In brief, paraffin-embedded tissue was cut into 4 μm sections and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E), reticulin, or Sirius red.	8809	8940
29183288	Epitope retrieval was carried out by heating the slides for 5 min in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6 at room temperature (RT)) at 95 °C and cooling to RT for 30 min.	8941	9101
29183288	Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with peroxidase block (DAKO, S2001, Enschede, the Netherlands) for 10 min at RT.	9102	9216
29183288	Non-specific antibody binding was blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 30 min.	9217	9297
29183288	After washing in PBS, slides were incubated with anti-ARG1 (Amsterdam Liver Center, AMS40.11.13), anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO; DAKO), or anti-major basic protein (MBP; kindly provided by Dr. James Lee, MT14.3.7, Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, AZ, USA) as described.	9298	9554
29183288	After washing, sections were incubated with a 1:200 diluted biotinylated rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody (DAKO) for 45 min at RT, washed, incubated with streptavidin/HRP (Vector) for 30 min at RT, and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) for 10 min.	9555	9815
29183288	Sections stained for ARG1 were incubated with an AP-labeled secondary antibody (DAKO) for 45 min, developed with nitroblue-tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche, Almere, The Netherlands) dissolved in 50 mM MgSO4, 100 mM Tris·HCl (pH 9.5) for 30 min, and cover-slipped with an aqueous mounting medium (DAKO).	9816	10145
29183288	To facilitate quantification, the immunostained slides were not counterstained.	10146	10225
29183288	Lung inflammation was assessed on H&E-stained sections.	10226	10281
29183288	MBP and MPO images were digitized with the Pannoramic slide scanner 250 (3DHistech, Budapest, Hungary), and counted using the Pannoramic viewer software application.	10282	10447
29183288	Color deconvolution was adjusted to detect diaminobenzidine-stained cells.	10448	10522
29183288	Only cells with a diameter between 10 and 15 μm were included.	10523	10585
29183288	Arginase-positive cells were counted manually in three different locations (peribronchiolar, perivenous and in the intervening parenchyma).	10586	10725
29183288	The density of the counted cells was expressed per mm2 tissue.	10726	10788
29183288	Tissue powder was homogenized in PBS, pH 7.6, in the presence of a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche).	10789	10904
29183288	Cytokines (CCL11 (eotaxin-1), IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, TNFα, and IFNγ) were quantified using a Luminex ® xMAP® multiplex platform, combined with a customized Milliplex™ mouse chemokine/cytokine panel from Millipore™, as described previously.	10905	11147
29183288	RNA purification and quantification was performed as described previously.	11148	11222
29183288	In brief, tissue powder was homogenized in Tri reagent (Sigma) with the Mini Bead-Beater (Biospec products, Bartlesville, OK, USA).	11223	11354
29183288	To remove genomic DNA, RNA was precipitated with 2 M LiCl for at least 30 min at −20 °C.	11355	11443
29183288	RNA integrity was checked by denaturing gel electrophoresis.	11444	11504
29183288	RNA concentration was determined with a NanoDrop-ND-1000 spectrophotometer at 260 nm (Isogen Life Sciences, Wilmington, DE, USA).	11505	11634
29183288	400 ng of total RNA was transcribed using a first-strand synthesis kit (Roche).	11635	11714
29183288	Quantitative PCR was performed in a Lightcycler 480 (Roche), using Lightcycler 480® SYBRgreen mastermix (Roche) and the following settings: denaturation: 30 s at 95 °C; annealing 30 s at 60 °C; elongation 30 s at 72 °C; 45 cycles; and a final elongation step for 5 min at 72 °C.	11715	11993
29183288	If reverse transcriptase was omitted, no product was formed.	11994	12054
29183288	Primary fluorescence data were quantified as described and expressed relative to that of 18S rRNA.	12055	12153
29183288	Primer sequences are given in Additional file 1: Table S1.	12154	12212
29183288	Western blot analysis was performed as described previously.	12213	12273
29183288	In brief, tissue powder was homogenized in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, containing Complete® cocktail (Roche).	12274	12446
29183288	Protein concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic-acid assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).	12447	12544
29183288	Twenty-five μg protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes, using a wet transfer system (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA).	12545	12702
29183288	Equal loading of lanes was confirmed by Ponceau S staining, followed by a wash-step with TBS (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) and blocking of non-specific binding with 5% skimmed milk in TBS/0.5% Tween-2.	12703	12908
29183288	Rabbit anti-ARG1 antibody (1:200), followed by an HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody (DAKO) was used to visualize ARG1.	12909	13045
29183288	Signal was developed with the Super Signal West Pico Substrate (Pierce) and quantified in a Fuji systems darkbox (Fuji Film Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan).	13046	13199
29183288	Groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test for PBS/OVA- versus OVA/OVA-treated, and Arg1-Con versus Arg1-KOTie2 mice, as described previously.	13200	13350
29183288	If this nonparametric test indicated a difference, a multiple comparison of the groups was carried out.	13351	13454
29183288	Values were considered as statistically significant if P < 0.05, and as indicating a trend if P < 0.10.	13455	13558
29183288	The bivariate two-tailed Pearson correlation coefficients between each of the lung-function parameters, mRNA and protein concentrations, histology quantification data and plasma amino-acid concentrations were determined after combining the data from the comparable PBS/OVA and OVA/OVA groups.	13559	13851
29183288	In the Tables, P-values of the resulting correlation coefficients were color-coded, with red indicating a P < 0.001, orange 0.01 > P > 0.001, and yellow 0.05 > P > 0.01.	13852	14021
29183288	Arg1-KOLysM mice, Arg1- KOTie2 mice, and their Arg1-Con littermates were either sensitized-and-challenged with ovalbumin (OVA/OVA), or mock-sensitized and then challenged with ovalbumin (PBS/OVA).	14022	14218
29183288	As expected, we found no ARG1-positive cells in the lungs of PBS/OVA-treated mice, whereas the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice contained many ARG1-positive cells (Fig.	14219	14393
29183288	1a).	14394	14398
29183288	ARG1-positive cells were completely absent from the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2, whereas the number of ARG1-positive cells was reduced, but not eliminated, in the lungs of similarly treated Arg1-KOLysM mice.	14399	14615
29183288	Of note, we observed no appreciable ARG1 in the endothelial cells in PBS/OVA (Fig.	14616	14698
29183288	1a) or OVA/OVA-treated lung blood vessels (Fig.	14699	14746
29183288	1d).	14747	14751
29183288	Furthermore, we did not observe any ARG1 protein or mRNA expression in the lungs of mice undergoing the PBS/OVA protocol, whereas a robust induction of ARG1 protein and mRNA expression was found in the lungs of Arg1-Con mice exposed to the OVA/OVA protocol (black columns in Figs.	14752	15032
29183288	1b and 2).	15033	15043
29183288	Pulmonary Arg1 mRNA and protein concentration in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice were reduced to 5 ± 2% and 2 ± 0.2%, respectively, and in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOLysM mice to 20 ± 8% and 19 ± 10%, respectively, of that found in similarly treated Arg1-Con littermates (Figs.	15044	15318
29183288	1b and 2, white columns).	15319	15344
29183288	We also counted ARG1-positive cells surrounding bronchioles and arteries, and in parenchyma of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con and Arg1-KO Tie2 mice, and found no ARG1-positive cells in lung tissue of Arg1-KO Tie2 mice (Fig.	15345	15562
29183288	1c).	15563	15567
29183288	From this finding, we conclude that the floxed 4th exon of Arg1 was accessible to the Cre enzyme and that the reduction in Arg1 expression was near complete in female Arg1-KOTie2 mice (reduction to ~2%), whereas residual Arg1 expression was present in female Arg1-KOLysM mice (reduction to ~20%).	15568	15864
29183288	Since Arg1-KOLysM mice showed an incomplete elimination of Arg1 expression and an intermediate phenotype, we limit the description of our study to Arg1-KOTie2 mice and their Arg1-Con littermates.	15865	16060
29183288	We investigated to what extent ablation of Arg1 in the lung caused changes in the expression of arginine-metabolizing enzymes and arginine transporters.	16061	16213
29183288	Figure 2 shows that the pulmonary mRNA abundance of Arg1, Arg2, Nos2, Slc7a1, Slc7a2 and Slc7a7 was induced by the OVA/OVA protocol compared to the PBS/OVA protocol.	16214	16379
29183288	More importantly, the induction was consistently lower in Arg1-KOTie2 than in Arg1-Con female mice subjected to the OVA/OVA protocol.	16380	16513
29183288	As a result, OVA/OVA treatment no longer induced the expression of Arg2, Nos2, Slc7a1, Slc7a2, and Slc7a7 in Arg1-KOTie2 mice.	16514	16640
29183288	These data clearly show that effective ablation of Arg1 expression in macrophages suppressed the induction of arginine-metabolizing enzymes and arginine transporters in the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated female mice.	16641	16851
29183288	OVA/OVA treatment of female Arg1-Con mice caused a significant drop in the concentration of circulating arginine levels relative to their PBS/OVA-treated littermates (Additional file 1: Table S2).	16852	17048
29183288	The decline was not seen in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice, implying an effect of ARG1.	17049	17138
29183288	In both Arg1-KOTie2 and Arg1-Con mice, OVA/OVA treatment also caused an increase in the plasma concentration of ornithine and a decline in that of glycine relative to the corresponding PBS/OVA-treated mice (Additional file 1: Table S2).	17139	17375
29183288	As a result, the arginine bioavailability index (the ratio of arginine and ornithine plus lysine concentrations) decreased non-significantly to ~71% (P = 0.369) in OVA/OVA-treated Arg-Con, but remained unchanged in Arg1-KOTie2 mice.	17376	17608
29183288	To address the question whether Arg1 ablation in the lung affects respiratory mechanics, we measured methacholine responsiveness in PBS/OVA- and OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice and their Arg1-Con littermates (Fig.	17609	17823
29183288	3).	17824	17827
29183288	Compared to PBS/OVA treatment, OVA/OVA treatment increased airway resistance (RN), tissue elastance (H), and tissue resistance (G) in female Arg1-Con and Arg1-KOTie2 mice, without an effect of Arg1 depletion.	17828	18036
29183288	Collectively, these findings show that Arg1 ablation in the lung did not affect AHR in female mice.	18037	18136
29183288	We investigated whether Arg1 ablation in the lung affected the expression of asthma-associated cytokines (Fig.	18137	18247
29183288	4).	18248	18251
29183288	OVA/OVA treatment increased the abundance of Il13, Il4, Il5, Ccl2, Ccl11 (Eotaxin-1), and Il10 mRNAs in Arg1-Con mice as expected, while the expression of Tnfa and Ifng remained unchanged.	18252	18440
29183288	Furthermore, OVA/OVA treatment of Arg1-Con mice increased gene expression of respiratory epithelium-specific Muc5ac and Clca3.	18441	18567
29183288	OVA/OVA-treated female Arg1-KOTie2 mice differed from their OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con littermates by showing a significantly lower expression of the Il13, Il4, Ccl2, Ccl11, Ifng, Muc5ac, and Clca3 mRNAs.	18568	18770
29183288	These findings imply a direct relation between Arg1 elimination in the lung and the decreased expression of inflammatory genes in the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated mice.	18771	18935
29183288	To determine whether Arg1 ablation in the lung had an effect on the protein concentration of pulmonary cytokines and chemokines, we measured IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, CCL11, TNFα and IFNγ protein in extracts of whole-lung homogenates (Fig.	18936	19175
29183288	5).	19176	19179
29183288	Compared to PBS/OVA-treated female mice, OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con and Arg1-KOTie2 mice had increased concentrations of IL-5, CCL11 and TNFα in their lungs, whereas the concentration of IL-4, IL-13, and IFNγ was unchanged.	19180	19401
29183288	IL-10 was lower in OVA/OVA- than in PBS/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice and higher in OVA/OVA- treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice than in similarly treated Arg1-Con mice.	19402	19556
29183288	Apart from IL-10, no differences in cytokine and chemokine protein concentration were found between OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con and Arg1-KOTie2 mice.	19557	19703
29183288	We investigated whether the production of ovalbumin-specific IgE antibodies was affected by the ablation of Arg1.	19704	19817
29183288	OVA-specific IgE was not detectable in plasma of PBS/OVA-treated mice.	19818	19888
29183288	OVA-specific IgE levels in OVA/OVA-treated female Arg1-KOTie2 mice were reduced to ~50% of that in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice, but due to the high variance in plasma IgE concentrations this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.14).	19889	20143
29183288	We investigated the effect of Arg1 ablation on the OVA/OVA-induced inflammatory response in lung tissue (Fig.	20144	20253
29183288	6).	4870	4873
29183288	H&E-stained sections of lung tissue did not reveal any inflammatory cells in PBS/OVA-treated mice (Fig.	20258	20361
29183288	6A).	20362	20366
29183288	This finding was confirmed by staining the same lungs for the presence of eosinophils and neutrophils using MBP and MPO as markers, respectively (Fig.	20367	20517
29183288	6A).	20362	20366
29183288	As expected, many inflammatory cells were present in the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated mice, but their number was not different between female Arg1-KOTie2 mice and their Arg1-Con littermates (Fig.	20523	20714
29183288	6B).	20715	20719
29183288	To investigate whether there was a difference in lung remodeling between female Arg1-KOTie2 mice and their Arg1-Con littermates, we stained slides for reticulin and collagen (Sirius red), but did not detect differences either (Fig.	20720	20951
29183288	7).	20952	20955
29183288	To investigate whether the presence or absence of ARG1 activity affected the adaptive responses to OVA-induced asthma in a quantitatively similar way, we also investigated to what extent changes in lung-function parameters, mRNA and protein concentrations, histology quantitation and plasma amino-acid concentrations correlated in either Arg1-Con or Arg1-KOTie2 mice (Fig.	20956	21328
29183288	8).	21329	21332
29183288	Strikingly, lung-function parameters and mRNA concentrations in Arg1-Con females strongly corresponded within, but hardly between both categories.	21333	21479
29183288	Noticeable exceptions were a correlation between the response of lung-function parameters H and G and the expression of Il4 mRNA, and the near absence of a correlation between the response of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Tnfa and especially Ifng, and all other mRNAs measured.	21480	21758
29183288	Female Arg1-KOTie2 differed from Arg1-Con mice (Fig.	21759	21811
29183288	8) by a pronounced decrease in the tightness of the correspondence between the adaptive responses that were mounted.	21812	21928
29183288	Striking examples were the loss of correspondence between the response of H and G, and Il4 mRNA expression, and the loss of correspondence of the expression of the mRNAs of arginine transporters Slc7a7 and Slc7a1, and that of all other mRNAs.	21929	22171
29183288	Tie2Cre-dependent deletion of Arg1 expression in myeloid cells prevented the expression of ARG1 in lung inflammatory cells of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice.	22172	22331
29183288	Compared to female OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice, Arg1-KOTie2 mice had lower OVA-specific IgE levels and a lower expression of arginine-metabolizing or -transporting genes (Arg2, Nos2, Slc7a1, Slc7a2, and Slc7a7), of cyto- and chemokine genes (Il4, Il13, Il5, Ccl11, Ccl2, and Ifng), and of epithelial marker genes (Muc5ac and Clc3a), but Arg1 deficiency did not affect airway resistance (RN), tissue elastance (H), or tissue resistance (G).	22332	22773
29183288	Furthermore, the tightness of the correspondence between the adaptive responses that were mounted in OVA/OVA-treated female mice were strongly reduced if these mice were unable to express Arg1 in their alveolar macrophages.	22774	22997
29183288	Tie2Cre mice excise loxP-flanked DNA in both endothelial and early hematopoietic progenitor cells [36, 38].	22998	23105
29183288	As in male mice and in other studies [34, 36, 39, 40], Tie2Cre-mediated excision of Arg1 resulted in a near-complete deletion of Arg1 mRNA and protein expression in macrophages.	23106	23283
29183288	A near-complete Arg1 excision was also observed in peritoneal macrophages of Arg1-KOTie2 mice.	23284	23378
29183288	Importantly, we did not observe ARG1 protein in the endothelium of the pulmonary blood vessels of PBS/OVA- or OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice (Fig.	23379	23524
29183288	1a,d), even after prolonged incubation with the alkaline-phosphatase substrate (up to 90 min).	23525	23619
29183288	In support of this finding, most other studies found no or only minimal arginase1 protein in lung epithelium and smooth muscle [42–44], also after inducing allergic inflammation [45–47].	23620	23806
29183288	Based on these findings, we conclude that Arg1-KOTie2 mice can be used for the ablation of Arg1 in macrophages of allergically inflamed lungs.	23807	23949
29183288	The near 100% efficacy of Tie2Cre-mediated excision of loxP-flanked Arg1 fl sequences contrasts with the 70-80% efficacy LysMCre-mediated Arg1 fl excision found in the present study and in our earlier study in male Arg1-KO mice.	23950	24178
29183288	Other studies [35, 48–50] also report LysMCre-mediated target excision in only 50-80% of the target cells.	24179	24285
29183288	Since the 20% remaining expression of Arg1 in the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOLysM mediated an intermediate phenotype between OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con and Arg1-KOTie2Cre mice, we limited our description of the effects of pulmonary Arg1 deficiency on allergic asthma to Arg1-KOTie2Cre mice.	24286	24579
29183288	Lung mechanics were measured using the forced-oscillation technique, which yields data on airway resistance (RN) in the large airways, and on tissue elastance (H) and resistance (G) that reflect the function of the peripheral parts of the lung [51, 52].	24580	24833
29183288	Arg1-KOTie2 and Arg1-Con mice did not differ in any of these parameters with or without OVA/OVA treatment.	24834	24940
29183288	This finding in female mice contrasts with our earlier observation in male mice, in which Arg1 deficiency in macrophages improved the peripheral lung mechanics parameters H and G. Since the experiments in male and female mice were carried out concurrently with mice from the same litters, the difference cannot be attributed to a session effect.	24941	25286
29183288	However, the present finding does agree with studies in which deficiency of Arg1 in macrophages was mediated by bone-marrow transfer of constitutively Arg1-deficient stem cells or Tie2Cre-mediated elimination of Arg1 exons 7 and 8.	25287	25518
29183288	Both studies tested, in addition to the OVA/OVA protocol, allergic inflammation in response to Aspergillus fumigatus and Schistosoma mansoni eggs in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, but did not state whether the lung function tests were carried out in male and/or female mice.	25519	25792
29183288	The lack of an effect of Arg1 deficiency on lung mechanics is in line with a smaller increase in the expression of arginine-metabolizing and -transporting genes upon OVA/OVA treatment (Fig.	25793	25982
29183288	2).	15040	15043
29183288	Administration of pharmacological arginase inhibitors reduced AHR of allergen-induced asthma in both male and female mice.	25987	26109
29183288	Whereas arginase inhibitors reduced lung inflammation in male mice [28, 29], they enhanced inflammation in female mice.	26110	26229
29183288	Because we observed no effect on AHR and a reduced inflammatory response in Arg1-deficient lungs, the effects of systemic inhibition of arginase-1 and -2 activities apparently differ from those of a deletion of Arg1 from macrophages.	26230	26463
29183288	Arginine analogues may exert additional effects, as NOS2 depletion or inhibition did not affect AHR, but that of NOS1- and −3 did [30, 54, 55].	26464	26607
29183288	The circulating concentration of L-arginine (Additional file 1: Table S2) was ~17% lower in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice than in similarly treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice, showing that Arg1 expression in hematopoietic tissue had an impact on plasma arginine.	26608	26860
29183288	Because the concentration of plasma ornithine increased and that of citrulline was unchanged, the plasma [Arg]/([Orn] + [Cit]) index decreased, in agreement with a recent report in female BALB/c mice.	26861	27061
29183288	Scott et al. attributed an important role to lung arginase in the increase of plasma ornithine, but we observed a similar increase in plasma ornithine in mice with and without arginase1 in their lungs.	27062	27263
29183288	Furthermore, we did not find an increase in plasma ornithine or a decrease in the arginine availability index in OVA/OVA-treated male Arg1-Con and Arg1-KO mice, even though methacholine responsiveness was decreased by Arg1 deletion in male mice.	27264	27509
29183288	The plasma [Arg]/([Orn] + [Lys]) index, which may reflect the availability of basic amino acids, only declined in OVA/OVA-treated female Arg1-KO mice.	27510	27660
29183288	The question, therefore, is whether plasma arginine concentration or any plasma arginine availability index is important for respiratory function.	27661	27807
29183288	Barron et al. suggested that the enormous perfusion of the lung, which equals the cardiac output, assures that the supply of arginine from plasma to tissue cells is hardly impaired by local arginase activity.	27808	28016
29183288	In addition, we have recently shown that citrulline rather than arginine is the more efficient extracellular source for intracellular arginine.	28017	28160
29183288	OVA/OVA treatment of Arg1-KO mice resulted in a similar degree of lung infiltration with inflammatory cells as seen in Arg1-Con littermates, but Il13, Il4, Il5, Ccl2, Ccl11, Ifng, Muc5ac, and Clca3 were expressed to a lesser extent in Arg1-KO Tie2 than in Arg1-Con mice.	28161	28431
29183288	Such a coordinated transcriptional response of genes probably reflects the activity of one or more common regulatory genes or proteins.	28432	28567
29183288	However, as far as measured, changes in mRNA abundance of the chemo- and cytokines were not reflected in the corresponding protein concentrations in lung tissue (Fig.	28568	28734
29183288	8).	21329	21332
29183288	This finding can be explained by the fact that cyto- and chemokines are secreted proteins, but inefficient translation of the mRNAs in Arg1-KO mice can also contribute, because posttranscriptional regulation of expression is a well-known feature of cyto- and chemokines.	28739	29009
29183288	In OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con males, we did observe a reasonable correspondence between mRNA and protein levels in 4 out of 8 combinations measured, but this correspondence disappeared in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KO male mice.	29010	29230
29183288	The decline in circulating arginine concentration in OVA/OVA-treated males was similar to that observed in females.	29231	29346
29183288	Low circulating arginine concentrations are known to affect translation by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.	29347	29465
29183288	In a parallel study, we investigated the effects of Arg1 ablation in the lung of genetically identical, similarly treated male mice.	29466	29598
29183288	Since the biology of female mice is underreported and since females are more often affected by allergic asthma than males [4–6, 60], we compared the adaptive responses of Arg1-Con mice in both sexes (Additional file 1: Table S3).	29599	29828
29183288	The OVA-specific IgE concentration was ~3-fold higher in plasma of OVA/OVA-treated female than male mice.	29829	29934
29183288	The sex difference in IgE accumulation is well-established.	29935	29994
29183288	Arg1 deficiency did not reduce the induction of plasma IgE concentration in males, but tended to reduce it by ~2-fold in females.	29995	30124
29183288	However, this reduction in plasma IgE did not modify the inflammatory response in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-deficient lungs.	30125	30244
29183288	OVA/OVA-treated BALB/c female mice further have higher lung concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-γ, and TNF-α protein [4, 6, 61] than male BALB/c mice, but we observed similar IL-4, IL-13, IL10, CCL11, TNFα, and IFNγ concentrations in OVA/OVA-treated male and female C57BL/6 mice.	30245	30536
29183288	It is well-recognized that C57BL/6 and BALB/C mice differ in their response to OVA/OVA treatment [62, 63].	30537	30643
29183288	OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con females accumulated ~3-fold more Arg1 mRNA than similarly treated males, without showing different numbers of arginase1-positive macrophages in the lung.	30644	30822
29183288	As far as we are aware, a sex difference in macrophage Arg1 mRNA and protein expression in OVA/OVA-treated mice has not yet been reported.	30823	30961
29183288	Furthermore, the expression of Il4, Il13 and, to a lesser extent, Il5 was affected by Arg1 deletion in female mice only, suggesting a sex difference in the expression of M2 cytokines in OVA/OVA-treated mice.	30962	31169
29183288	In Coxsackie virus-induced myocarditis, the ~4-fold higher Arg1 expression in macrophages of female over male mice was attributed to skewing of the macrophage polarization towards an M2 phenotype in females, and towards an M1 phenotype in males.	31170	31415
29183288	Depending on the inducing agent, alveolar macrophages can also develop an M1, M2, or even an intermediate phenotype.	31416	31532
29183288	These sex difference may arise because female steroid hormones promote alternative activation of macrophages, whereas testosterone inhibits the M2 phenotype [65, 66].	31533	31699
29183288	We also studied whether there were sex differences in the coordination of the responses to OVA/OVA treatment (Additional file 2: Figure S1).	31700	31840
29183288	Adaptive changes in methacholine responsiveness and mRNA expression (except the M1-macrophage markers Ifng and, to a lesser extent, Tnfa) correlated more strongly within their category in females than in males, whereas, as already discussed, IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, CCL11, and TNFα protein concentrations correlated better with the corresponding mRNA concentrations and with lung function parameters H and G in males.	31841	32253
29183288	These data imply that the respiratory responses to OVA/OVA treatment were less integrated with the inflammatory responses in female than in male mice.	32254	32404
29183288	Complete ablation of Arg1 in the lung does not affect methacholine responsiveness or the invasion of inflammatory cells, but does change the gene-expression profile of these cells in OVA/OVA-treated female mice.	32405	32616
29183288	Since the asthmatic responses in mice and humans show similar sex-related differences, and since ablation of Arg1 did improve peripheral lung function in male mice only, we hypothesize that treatment of asthma by modulating arginase activity in the lung will primarily benefit male patients.	32617	32908
19536134	During endochondral ossification, mesenchymal stem cells undergo a highly organized differentiation program during which they condense and differentiate into chondrocytes, forming the template for bone formation (Kronenberg, 2003; Yoon and Lyons, 2004).	0	253
19536134	Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) were originally isolated as proteins that promote ectopic cartilage and bone formation.	254	374
19536134	Further studies have confirmed the role of BMPs in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during cartilage and bone formation and revealed additional functions in other developmental processes (Yoon and Lyons, 2004).	375	603
19536134	For example, BMP-2 and BMP-4 are essential for the induction of ventral mesoderm formation during early mouse development.	604	726
19536134	BMP family members transduce signals through heteromeric complexes of type II and type I transmembrane serine/threoine kinase receptors.	727	863
19536134	Type II receptor ligation initiates the recruitment of type I receptors to form heteromeric receptor complexes that are then transphosphorylated.	864	1009
19536134	The type I receptors in turn initiate Smad signalling by phosphorylating the receptor-regulated Smads, R-Smad1/5/8.	1010	1125
19536134	Once phosphorylated, R-Smads associate with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Massague, 1998).	1126	1251
19536134	In addition to the Smad-dependent pathway, BMPs can also activate TGFβ activated kinase 1 (TAK1) leading to MKK3/6-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation.	1252	1402
19536134	However, the mechanism by which TAK1 regulates BMP signalling in chondrocytes is largely unknown (Derynck and Zhang, 2003).	1403	1526
19536134	TAK1, a member of the MAPKKK family, was originally identified as a key regulator of MAPK kinase activation in TGFβ and BMP signalling pathways.	1527	1671
19536134	In Xenopus development, TAK1 mediates mesoderm induction and patterning downstream of BMP ligands.	1672	1770
19536134	Mutations in the mouse Tak1 gene causes defects in the developing intraembryoinc vasculature and yolk sac, phenotypes similar to those caused by loss of function mutations in SMAD5, suggesting that TAK1 may be important for Smad activation downstream of BMP stimulation.	1771	2041
19536134	However, no biochemical or in vivo functional data currently exist to support this hypothesis.	2042	2136
19536134	Because of the early lethality of mice with a germline deletion of Tak1, cellular studies in these mice were limited to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).	2137	2292
19536134	TAK1-deficient MEFs displayed normal activation of canonical Smads after TGFβ stimulation, despite displaying a block in NF-κB and JNK activation by microbial products in the innate immune system.	2293	2489
19536134	TAK1 also has critical functions in the regulation of adaptive immunity where it is required for antigen receptor signalling in both T cells and B cells through its regulation of NF-κB and JNK activation.	2490	2694
19536134	In addition to its role in the immune system, TAK1 functions as a key regulator of vascular development and keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and mediates survival of hematopoietic cells and hepatocytes through its regulation of NF-κB and JNK activation.	2695	2974
19536134	Given earlier studies suggesting a role for TAK1 in signalling downstream of both the BMP and TGFβ signalling pathways and the importance of these pathways for chondrocyte biology, we decided to generate mice with cartilage-specific deletion of the Tak1 gene to address the physiological roles of mammalian TAK1 in cartilage.	2975	3300
19536134	Deletion of Tak1 in chondrocytes resulted in a dramatic runting phenotype with chondrodysplasia and joint abnormalities similar to that seen in mice deficient in BMP signalling.	3301	3478
19536134	Biochemical analysis of TAK1-deficient chondrocytes confirmed a defect in BMP signalling that unexpectedly resulted in impaired Smad1/5/8 activation in addition to defective p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinase signalling.	3479	3687
19536134	We provide the first evidence that TAK1 is required for the normal development and preservation of cartilage.	3688	3797
19536134	As the expression pattern for TAK1 in cartilage is unknown, we stained for TAK1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on coronal tibial sections from a postnatal day 20 (p20) mouse (Figure 1).	3798	3985
19536134	TAK1 staining was largely restricted to prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes.	3986	4072
19536134	Hypertrophic chondrocytes from both the terminal growth plate and the area surrounding the secondary centre of ossification showed positive staining.	4073	4222
19536134	Additionally, TAK1 expression in E16.5 embryos was examined.	4223	4283
19536134	TAK1 is widely expressed in multiple embryonic cartilage tissues, including the chondroepiphyses of the long bones, the laryngeal and tracheal cartilage, and the developing frontal bone (Supplementary Figure S1).	4284	4496
19536134	To determine the role of TAK1 in cartilage development, we generated mice lacking Tak1 in cartilage by intercrossing a Tak1 floxed-allele strain of mice with a type II collagen-cre deleter strain.	4497	4693
19536134	IHC for TAK1 expression confirmed deletion specifically in chondrocytes, with staining absent in both the terminal growth plate and the hypertrophic chondrocytes surrounding the secondary centre of ossification (Figure 1).	4694	4916
19536134	Animals homozygous for the floxed allele expressing the cre transgene (hereafter referred to as Tak1col2 mice) displayed severe postnatal growth retardation culminating in death by 2–3 weeks of age (Figure 2A).	4917	5127
19536134	As shown in Alizarin red S/Alcian blue stained skeletal preps of p20 mice, Tak1col2 mice showed proportional shortening of the long bones of the limbs, a ‘doming' of the cranium, malocclusion, and kyphosis of the thoracic spine (Figure 2A).	5128	5368
19536134	Tak1col2 postnatal day 0 (p0) offspring showed a modest reduction in the length of long bones and disorganization of proliferating chondrocyte columns in the growth plate (Supplementary Figure S2A and B).	5369	5573
19536134	Animals heterozygous for the floxed allele expressing the cre transgene showed no appreciable phenotype at any age (data not shown).	5574	5706
19536134	Histologic analysis of coronal sections of Tak1col2 tibias confirmed a marked reduction in overall size (Figure 2B).	5707	5823
19536134	Additionally, the formation of secondary ossification centres was delayed, with Tak1col2 mice showing only minimal vascular invasion and calcification within the secondary centre of ossification.	5824	6019
19536134	Notably, Tak1col2 chondrocytes surrounding the secondary ossification centre progressed normally through the hypertrophic stage of differentiation (Figure 2B, arrow).	6020	6186
19536134	To determine whether the runting observed in Tak1col2 mice is the result of a delay in endochondral ossification of long bones, we performed in situ hybridization for osteopontin on femurs from E16.5 embryos to highlight the ossified portion of the bone (Supplementary Figure S2C).	6187	6468
19536134	As Tak1col2 embryos displayed a similar extent of ossification, it is unlikely that the runting phenotype observed postnatally is the result of defects in the early stages of endochondral ossification.	6469	6670
19536134	The long bones of E18.5 embryos were similarly of comparable length to wild-type controls (data not shown).	6671	6778
19536134	Finally, in situ hybridization of Collagen Xα (ColX) was performed to determine the effects of TAK1 deletion on chondrocyte maturation (Figure 2C).	6779	6926
19536134	Although p20 mice displayed a moderate reduction in the size of the prehypertrophic/hypertrophic zone of ColX-positive chondrocytes, E16.5 and E18.5 embryos were found to display normal growth plate architecture.	6927	7139
19536134	Taken together, these data indicate that the runting phenotype observed in Tak1col2 mice has an onset sometime between E18.5 and birth.	7140	7275
19536134	The overall reduction in the size of the Tak1col2 chondroepiphysis could be due to increased chondrocyte apoptosis or decreased chondrocyte proliferation.	7276	7430
19536134	To determine the relative contributions of each, Tak1col2 chondroepiphyses were stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an index of cell proliferation and by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) as a marker for apoptotic cells (Figure 2D).	7431	7720
19536134	Tak1col2 chondroepiphyses displayed both a decrease in chondrocyte proliferation in the prehypertrophic/proliferating zone of the growth plate and an increase in the apoptosis of terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes, indicating that both mechanisms contribute to the decrease in the size of the chondroepiphysis.	7721	8031
19536134	Radiographs revealed dislocation of the elbow and a corresponding lateral deviation of the forearm in Tak1col2 mice (Figure 2E, upper panels).	8032	8174
19536134	The penetrance of this phenotype was ∼80% by two weeks of age.	8175	8237
19536134	Alizarin red/alcian blue stained skeletal preparations of the elbow showed a similar disruption of the elbow architecture with the formation of ectopic calcifications in the joint space (Figure 2E, lower panels).	8238	8450
19536134	Tissue sections taken parallel to the long axis of the forelimb showed that this phenotype corresponds with an overgrowth of the articular cartilage on the distal humerus facing the radius (Figure 2F, upper panels).	8451	8666
19536134	The proximal end of the radius has expanded extensively around the protruding articular cartilage of the humerus to the point of displacing the normal articulation between the ulna and the distal humerus.	8667	8871
19536134	To determine whether the elbow phenotype observed postnatally represents a developmental defect in joint formation, we examined the elbow joint of E14.5 embryos (Figure 2F, lower panels).	8872	9059
19536134	The distal humerus and the proximal radius were present as a single continuous skeletal element in Tak1col2 embryos, whereas control embryos showed a clear cavitation of the joint and a separation of the two skeletal elements.	9060	9286
19536134	Cavitation of the joint between the humerus and the ulna occurred normally (data not shown).	9287	9379
19536134	Considering that histologic analysis of the p20 elbow joint shows the presence of a joint space between the distal humerus and proximal radius, this indicates that Tak1col2 mice display a delay in cavitation of the humero-radial joint space.	9380	9621
19536134	In addition, as shown in the high-power views of skeletal preparations (Figure 2G), the phalanges of the hindlimbs show a marked medial deviation and the tarsals show a failure to separate during development, the cuboid, lateral cuneiform, intermediate cuneiform, navicular, and calcaneus all forming a continuous skeletal element.	9622	9953
19536134	Although the tarsals of the littermate control mouse show complete ossification by 20 days of age, the fused tarsal element of Tak1col2 mice shows incomplete ossification with a layer of Alcian blue positive cartilage surrounding the ossified centre.	9954	10204
19536134	In contrast, the hip, shoulder, and temperomandibular joints showed no signs of developmental abnormalities (data not shown).	10205	10330
19536134	Thus, Tak1col2 mice show both impaired growth of skeletal elements and defects in the elbow and tarsal joints.	10331	10441
19536134	In this respect, they resemble a mixture of the tarsal and elbow abnormalities observed in GDF5-deficient mice and the long bone abnormalities present in mice lacking BMP 2/4/7.	10442	10619
19536134	Overall phenotypic similarities between Tak1col2 mice and mice with specific deletions of multiple BMP receptor subunits in chondrocytes suggested a role for TAK1 in BMP signalling pathways.	10620	10810
19536134	To address this possibility directly, we performed immunostaining analysis for the phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 (BMP-responsive Smads) in the proximal tibia of Tak1fl/fl and Tak1col2 mice.	10811	11000
19536134	Phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/8 were significantly reduced in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of Tak1col2 mice (Figure 3A).	11001	11126
19536134	Similarly, immunoblotting analysis of primary chondrocytes showed decreased basal levels of phosphorylated Smad 1/5/8 in TAK1-deficent chondrocytes derived from p0 Tak1col2 mice, as compared with littermate control chondrocytes (Figure 3B).	11127	11367
19536134	However, Tak1 deletion did not affect the ex vivo basal phosphorylation levels of Smad2, and levels of Smad1 and Bmpr1A protein in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes were comparable to wt chondrocytes (Figure 3B).	11368	11574
19536134	Hence, Tak1 deletion results in reduced levels of activated Smad1/5/8 in vivo implying that TAK1 may regulate BMP-responsive Smad activation (Smad1/5/8), but not TGFβ-responsive Smad activation (Smad2).	11575	11777
19536134	In addition, TAK1 appears to regulate Smad phosphorylation rather than altering expression of BMP signalling components.	11778	11898
19536134	P38 is also known to be phosphorylated downstream of BMP stimulation; however, we were unable to determine phospho-p38 levels in cartilage in vivo by IHC, despite multiple attempts.	11899	12080
19536134	As BMP signalling was reduced in both in vivo and ex vivo measurements of phosphorylated signalling intermediates in Tak1col2 mice, we examined expression levels of known BMP target genes in vivo. Indian hedgehog (IHH) is a key regulator of bone formation that coordinates both chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation and osteoblast differentiation (Kronenberg, 2003).	12081	12451
19536134	Mice in which chondrocytes are genetically unable to respond to BMPs show decreased expression of IHH in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, and this is proposed as a major contributor to the limb growth retardation seen in these mice.	12452	12681
19536134	We tested whether a similar reduction in IHH might contribute to the runting seen in Tak1col2 mice (Figure 3C, left panels).	12682	12806
19536134	In situ hybridization of the proximal tibia with IHH probes showed a moderate decrease of IHH transcript levels in the hypertropic chondrocytes of Tak1col2 mice.	12807	12968
19536134	To show that this reduction in IHH transcript levels resulted in a functional decrease in IHH signalling in vivo, we also performed in situ hybridization to quantify levels of the IHH target gene, patched (Figure 3C, left panels).	12969	13199
19536134	Patched expression was reduced in both prehypertrophic chondrocytes and in the bone collar.	13200	13291
19536134	The reduction in patched expression even outside of cartilage strongly suggests that TAK1 functions upstream of IHH expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes and not in signal transduction downstream of IHH.	13292	13497
19536134	To confirm a functional defect in BMP signalling in vivo, we performed in situ hybridization to measure the transcript levels of Id1, a known BMP target gene in multiple systems (Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002).	13498	13706
19536134	ID1 expression was almost completely ablated in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of Tak1col2 mice, whereas expression of type X collagen (ColX), the major extracelluar matrix marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes, was little affected by Tak1 deletion, showing only a modest reduction in the overall size of the hypertrophic zone (Figure 3C, right panels).	13707	14058
19536134	These findings suggest that TAK1 is indispensable for the in vivo response to BMPs in the terminal growth plate.	14059	14171
19536134	BMP signalling through Smad1/5/8 is required for the induction of several canonical BMP target genes, including Id1, Msx1, and Noggin.	14172	14306
19536134	We analysed the induction of these BMP target genes in primary TAK1-deficient chondrocytes by using a quantitative RT–PCR assay (Figure 4A).	14307	14447
19536134	After activation by BMP2/7, wt but not TAK1-deficient chondrocytes showed an appreciable induction in levels of Id1, Msx1, and Noggin transcripts consistent with a role for TAK1 in mediating BMP-induced gene expression in chondrocytes.	14448	14683
19536134	To facilitate further biochemical analysis, we immortalized primary chondrocytes derived from Tak1fl/fl and Tak1col2 newborn offspring by stably transfecting them with the SV40 large T antigen.	14684	14877
19536134	Immunoblotting for TAK1 confirmed a significant reduction in TAK1 expression in Tak1col2 relative to Tak1fl/fl chondrocytes (Supplementary Figure S3A).	14878	15029
19536134	As deletion of Tak1 by col2-cre is not 100% efficient and chondrocytes were maintained as bulk cultures rather than colonies to avoid clonal artifacts, residual TAK1 expression is present in Tak1col2 chondrocyte cultures.	15030	15251
19536134	We tested the requirement for TAK1 in BMP or TGFβ signalling by measuring BMP/TGFβ-dependent promoter activation.	15252	15365
19536134	Cells were transfected with BMP or TGFβ-responsive luciferase reporters and stimulated with BMP2/7 or TGFβ (Figure 4B and C).	15366	15491
19536134	Tak1fl/fl chondrocytes showed approximately two-fold induction in luciferase reporter activity in response to BMP2/7, whereas Tak1col2 chondrocytes showed no response.	15492	15659
19536134	Similarly, overexpression of a catalytically inactive TAK1 mutant (ΔN/K63W; hereafter CI) blocked gene induction in wt chondrocytes in response to BMP2/7 (Figure 4B, right panel).	15660	15839
19536134	TGFβ-induced luciferase reporter activity was not affected by Tak1 deletion, suggesting that, in chondrocytes, TAK1 is important for BMP but not TGFβ signalling (Figure 4C).	15840	16013
19536134	It has been reported that BMP signalling is mediated by two distinct pathways: the canonical Smad pathway and the TAK1-p38 MAP kinase pathway (Derynck and Zhang, 2003).	16014	16182
19536134	We examined the activation of these two arms of BMP signalling in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for phospho-Smad1/5/8 and phospho-p38 (Figure 4D).	16183	16370
19536134	In the absence of TAK1, Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation was moderately decreased, and a small, but reproducible decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated Smad proteins was detected.	16371	16563
19536134	However, Tak1 deletion did not affect total Smad1 protein levels, implying that TAK1 regulates Smad phosphorylation rather than altering expression of Smad1/5/8 (Supplementary Figure S3C).	16564	16752
19536134	Tak1col2 chondrocytes exhibited impaired activation of p38, Erk1/2, and Jnk1/2 MAP kinases in response to BMP2/7, implying that TAK1 may function as a key regulator of BMP-mediated MAP kinase activation (Figure 4D and E).	16753	16974
19536134	Immunofluorescence staining for phospho-Smad1/5/8 after BMP2/7 stimulation showed that phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 was still able to translocate to the nucleus in the absence of TAK1, though the total levels of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 were decreased (Supplementary Figure S3D).	16975	17250
19536134	Next, we examined TGFβ-induced activation of the canonical Smad and MAP kinase pathway in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes by immunoblotting for phospho-Smad2 and phospho-p38 (Figure 4F).	17251	17433
19536134	Tak1col2 cells exhibited a significant decrease in TGFβ-induced p38 phosphorylation, whereas Smad2 phosphorylation occurred normally.	17434	17567
19536134	This is consistent with earlier studies showing a requirement for TAK1 in the MAP kinase but not the canonical Smad pathway downstream of TGFβ.	17568	17711
19536134	Taken together, these results suggest that TAK1 is important for the activation of both the canonical Smad (Smad1/5/8) and MAP kinase pathways downstream of BMP2/7, whereas downstream of TGFβ, TAK1 is important for the activation of p38 MAP kinase but not Smad2.	17712	17974
19536134	The decreased levels of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation in Tak1col2 chondrocytes might be explained by a requirement for TAK1 in the association of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) complex with phosphorylated Smad1/5/8.	17975	18202
19536134	However, immunoprecipitation analysis showed that in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes, the interaction between BMPR1A and phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 occurs normally, 5–15 min postinduction with BMP2/7 (Supplementary Figure S3E).	18203	18424
19536134	Thus, Tak1 deletion does not affect the stability of the interaction between the BMPR complex and phosphorylated Smad proteins.	18425	18552
19536134	To test whether TAK1 interacts with Smad proteins, HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged Smad proteins along with HA-tagged TAK1 (Supplementary Figure S4A).	18553	18718
19536134	When overexpressed, Smad1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 all interact with TAK1, although the Smad4 association was weak.	18719	18825
19536134	To test for direct interactions between TAK1 and BMP-responsive Smad proteins, we performed a Flag pull down analysis with Flag-tagged Smad proteins and in vitro translated, 35S-labelled TAK1 (Figure 5A, upper panel).	18826	19043
19536134	Under these conditions, TAK1 interacted directly with Smad1, 5, and 8 and this likely occurs through the conserved MH2 domain of Smad proteins as shown in an earlier study.	19044	19216
19536134	The TAK1 domain located between aa 200 and 300 is required for binding to Smad1 (Supplementary Figure S4B).	19217	19324
19536134	This was confirmed by a GST pull down assay with GST-Smad1 and in vitro translated, 35S-labelled TAK1 (Figure 5A, lower panel).	19325	19452
19536134	Importantly, analysis of endogenous TAK1 and Smad1 showed an association 5–15 min after stimulation with BMP2/7, kinetics similar to the rate of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation indicating that TAK1 interacts with BMP-responsive Smad proteins in chondrocytes in an inducible manner (Figure 5B).	19453	19740
19536134	In contrast, catalytically inactive TAK1 did not associate with Smad 1/5/8 although it did interact with TAB1, a known TAK1-binding protein (Supplementary Figure S4C and D).	19741	19914
19536134	These results indicate that the kinase activity of TAK1 is necessary for its interactions with Smad proteins.	19915	20024
19536134	As TAK1 interacts directly with Smad proteins after BMP stimulation, we tested whether TAK1 is able to induce phosphorylation of Smad proteins.	20025	20168
19536134	In vitro kinase assays using HA-TAK1 immunoprecipitates from HEK293 cells transfected with HA-tagged constitutively active TAK1 (ΔN) or catalytically inactive TAK1 (CI; ΔN/K63W) were incubated with recombinant GST, GST-Smad1, -Smad2, or -Mkk6 (Figure 5C).	20169	20424
19536134	As expected, GST-Mkk6, a known TAK1 substrate, was phosphorylated by HA-TAK1 (ΔN), but not HA-TAK1 (CI).	20425	20529
19536134	Notably, GST-Smad1 and -Smad2 were also both phosphorylated by HA-TAK1 (ΔN) but not HA-TAK1 (CI), indicating that TAK1 can phosphorylate Smad proteins.	20530	20681
19536134	Given that TAK1 can bind and phosphorylate both Smad1 and Smad2, it may be important for Smad phosphorylation in both BMP and TGFβ signalling pathways.	20682	20833
19536134	To test this hypothesis, we analysed TAK1-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1 and 2 after BMP and TGFβ stimulation using in vitro kinase assays (Figure 5D).	20834	20988
19536134	Surprisingly, little GST-Smad2 phosphorylation was detected in response to TGFβ, whereas GST-Smad1 was strongly phosphorylated with peak activity 15 min postinduction by BMP2/7.	20989	21166
19536134	However, GST-Mkk6 was equivalently phosphorylated after stimulation with either TGFβ or BMP2/7, indicating that TAK1 is similarly activated downstream of TGFβ and BMP2/7 signalling (Figure 5E).	21167	21360
19536134	Thus, differences in the intrinsic activation status of TAK1 are unlikely to account for the selective phorphorylation of Smad1 and not Smad2 by endogenous TAK1.	21361	21522
19536134	This may explain why the Tak1col2 mice bear a much greater resemblance to mice with defects in BMP but not TGFβ signalling in chondrocytes.	21523	21662
19536134	Coomassie blue staining showed a slight mobility shift of the isolated Smad1 protein when co-expressed with TAK1, implying that TAK1 induces posttranslational modification of Smad1 (Figure 6A).	21663	21856
19536134	To identify the TAK1-mediated phosphorylation sites in Smad1, we performed mass spectrometry analysis.	21857	21959
19536134	HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-Smad1 together with either vector control or constitutively active TAK1 (ΔN), and immunoprecipitated using Flag-conjugated agarose.	21960	22131
19536134	As Smad1 interacts with TAK1 through its MH2 domain, phosphopeptide analysis initially focused on this region (Figure 6A, lower panel).	22132	22267
19536134	Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that, when co-expressed with TAK1, Smad1 is phosphorylated at C-terminal serines (S463 and S465), the same phosphorylation sites targeted by the BMP type I receptor kinase (Tables I and II).	22268	22494
19536134	This is consistent with the immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 (S463/S465, S426/S428) showing that Flag-Smad1 is phosphorylated at C-terminal serines in the presence of HA-TAK1 (ΔN) (Figure 6B).	22495	22706
19536134	BMPR1 was not detectable in co-immunoprecipitations with HA-TAK1 (ΔN), making it unlikely that the S463/S465 phosphorylation observed was mediated by BMPR1 that co-purified with HA-TAK1 (Supplementary Figure S4E).	22707	22920
19536134	TAK1-induced phosphorylation at C-terminal serines was weaker than phosphorylation by constitutively active BMPR1B (Q203D), implying that BMPR1B is able to phosphorylate Smad1 at C-terminal serines more efficiently than TAK1 (Figure 6B).	22921	23158
19536134	To test the ability of TAK1 to induce Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serines, we generated recombinant GST-Smad1 containing the SSVS to AAVA mutation, which is a poor substrate for the BMP type I receptor kinase.	23159	23376
19536134	Mutation of the S463/S465 site to AAVA led to a moderate decrease in TAK1 (ΔN)-induced phosphorylation, although it significantly decreased BMPR1B (Q203D)-induced phosphorylation (Figure 6C and D).	23377	23574
19536134	This is consistent with immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 (S463/S465, S426/S428) showing that the phosphorylation level of Smad1 at S463/S465 was moderately decreased in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes in response to BMP2/7 (Figure 4D).	23575	23825
19536134	Similarly, the AAVA mutated Smad1 only showed a partial reduction in the level of phosphorylation by the endogenous TAK1 complex immunoprecipitated from the wt chondrocyte line after BMP stimulation (Figure 6D).	23826	24037
19536134	Thus, these results strongly suggest that TAK1 may phosphorylate Smad1 at sites in addition to S463/S465.	24038	24143
19536134	To test the absolute requirement for TAK1 kinase activity in BMP signalling, TAK1-deficient chondrocytes were reconstituted with exogenous TAK1 using a lentiviral system (Figure 7).	24144	24325
19536134	Tak1col2 chondrocytes were infected with either wt or CI TAK1 lentiviruses and selected in puromycin-containing medium.	24326	24445
19536134	As expected, TAK1 (WT)-expressing cells exhibited an increase in Smad1/5/8 and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in response to BMP2/7.	24446	24578
19536134	In contrast, exogenous expression of catalytically inactive TAK1 (CI) failed to restore Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation (Figure 7A).	24579	24705
19536134	The functional response to BMP2/7 in Tak1col2 chondrocytes could also be reconstituted by TAK1 expression.	24706	24812
19536134	Exogenous expression of TAK1 (WT) significantly increased ID1 expression after BMP2/7 stimulation of Tak1col2 chondrocytes (Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002), whereas little induction of ID1 was detected in vector or TAK1 (CI)-expressing cells (Figure 7B).	24813	25064
19536134	Therefore, TAK1 activates both the canonical Smad and the p38 MAP kinase pathways through its kinase activity, and this activity is important for the transcriptional response to BMP2/7.	25065	25250
19536134	TAK1, a MAP3K kinase family member, was originally identified as a key mediator of the p38 MAPK kinase pathway that was activated downstream of both TGFβ and BMP4.	25251	25414
19536134	However, with the exception of a study in Xenopus demonstrating that TAK1 mediates ventral mesoderm induction and patterning downstream of BMPs, the in vivo role of TAK1 in BMP signalling remained unexplored.	25415	25623
19536134	The involvement of BMPs in growth, patterning, and maintenance of cartilage made this organ system an attractive in vivo model to explore.	25624	25762
19536134	Early embryonic lethality in germline TAK1-deficient mice precluded genetic studies of mammalian TAK1 in skeletal biology.	25763	25885
19536134	We took advantage of an earlier generated strain of mice with a conditional deletion of Tak1 to generate mice lacking Tak1 selectively in chondrocytes.	25886	26037
19536134	TAK1 deficiency in chondrocytes caused a severe chondrodysplasia with runting, elbow dislocation, cartilage overgrowth, and tarsal fusion, abnormalities that are variously present in mice lacking BMPR1B, GDF5, or multiple BMP ligands.	26038	26272
19536134	The observation that the Tak1 phenotype represents a mixture of BMP-associated phenotypes indicates that TAK1 serves an essential function downstream of multiple BMP family members.	26273	26454
19536134	Signal transduction downstream of BMPs can be considered as a dichotomy between the activation of MAP kinase pathways and the canonical Smads (Derynck and Zhang, 2003; Yoon and Lyons, 2004).	26455	26645
19536134	Earlier, TAK1 was largely considered as a proximal activator of the MAP kinase arm of signalling, without a clear role in Smad activation.	26646	26784
19536134	However, the reduction in both Smad and p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinase responses in Tak1col2 chondrocytes indicates that TAK1 has an important but distinct function in both signalling arms downstream of BMP2/7.	26785	26987
19536134	The Tak1col2 phenotype is not identical to that of any single member of the BMP signalling pathway.	26988	27087
19536134	The degree of runting and the delay in secondary ossification centre formation in Tak1col2 mice resemble that seen in mice with a conditional deletion of Smad4 in chondrocytes.	27088	27264
19536134	Additionally, the magnitude of IHH downregulation in Tak1col2 hypertrophic chondrocytes is similar to that observed in both Smad4 and BMPR1A conditional knockout mice.	27265	27432
19536134	Hence, these aspects of the Tak1col2 phenotype may be due to dysregulation of Smad signalling downstream of BMPs.	27433	27546
19536134	However, mice with a conditional deletion of Smad4 in chondrocytes do not display elbow dislocation or fusion of the tarsal bones.	27547	27677
19536134	These features are reminiscent of the defects seen in BMPR1B and GDF5 knockout mice, suggesting that the GDF5 to BMPR1B signalling module that maintains the integrity of the elbow joint also uses TAK1 as a necessary signalling intermediate.	27678	27918
19536134	The penetrance of the elbow dislocation phenotype in TAK1-deficient mice is higher (∼80% by 2 weeks of age) than that observed in BMPR1B-deficient mice (23%).	27919	28077
19536134	Combined with the earlier onset of the dislocation phenotype in TAK1-deficient mice, this finding suggests that BMPR1B may have partial functional redundancy with another receptor subunit acting upstream of TAK1.	28078	28290
19536134	This receptor subunit is highly likely to be BMPR1A, but the severe cartilage defects in mice lacking both BMPR1A/B in cartilage make analysis of this redundancy difficult in vivo.	28291	28471
19536134	This similarity between GDF5 and Tak1col2 phenotypes is further supported by the finding of tarsal bone fusion.	28472	28583
19536134	However, mice with a spontaneous loss-of-function mutation in GDF5 show only a slight shortening of the long bones, implicating other BMP family members upstream of TAK1.	28584	28754
19536134	Additionally, although GDF5 mutant mice do have fusion of the tarsal bones, they do not display the marked medial deviation of the hindlimb phalanges seen in Tak1col2 mice, indicating that this deviation is not simply secondary to ankle bone malformation.	28755	29010
19536134	As these aspects of the phenotype (elbow dislocation, tarsal fusion) are present in GDF5 and BMPR1B but not Smad4-deficent mice, they may be MAP kinase dependent.	29011	29173
19536134	However, the role of the MAP kinase pathway in postnatal cartilage growth and development has not been explored as thoroughly in vivo as the role of the Smad pathway, making it difficult to examine the contribution of MAP kinase signalling to the Tak1col2 phenotype.	29174	29440
19536134	The TAK1 phenotype is notable for the absence of specific features of mice genetically unable to respond to TGFβ in chondrocytes.	29441	29570
19536134	In particular, mice with a deletion of TGFβR2 in chondrocytes display abnormalities in the axial skeleton, including bifurcation of the xiphoid process, abnormal morphogenesis of the C1, C2 vertebrae, and malformation of the vertebral transverse processes, which are not present in Tak1col2 mice.	29571	29867
19536134	In our study, analysis of primary and transformed chondrocytes revealed that TAK1 is able to phosphorylate Smad proteins in response to BMP2/7 but not TGFβ.	29868	30024
19536134	However, Smad1 (a BMP-responsive Smad) and Smad2 (a TGFβ-responsive Smad) can both be phosphorylated by overexpressed, constitutively active TAK1, indicating that TAK1 has an equivalent intrinsic ability to phosphorylate both substrates.	30025	30262
19536134	Additionally, phosphorylation of MKK6 by TAK1 is similar after BMP2/7 and TGFβ stimulation, indicating that the activation of TAK1 kinase is similar downstream of each ligand.	30263	30438
19536134	Recently, it has been reported that the activated TGFβ receptor 1 recruits TRAF6 to the receptor complex and subsequently induces ubiquitination of TRAF6 and promotes TRAF6 interaction with TAK1, thereby resulting in activation of p38/JNK MAP kinases.	30439	30690
19536134	However, the mechanism of TAK1-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation downstream of BMP signalling has not been explored.	30691	30808
19536134	Given these observations, the most likely explanation for the selective involvement of TAK1 in Smad phosphorylation downstream of BMP but not TGFβ stimulation is that another component of the TGFβ receptor complex acts to block TAK1 access to Smad2.	30809	31058
19536134	For such a mechanism to be effective, the active fraction of TAK1 must be sequestered at the TGFβ receptor complex.	31059	31174
19536134	Likewise, either the BMP receptor complex is permissive for TAK1 and Smad1/5/8 interactions or TAK1 is released from the receptor complex to phosphorylate Smad1/5/8 in the cytosol.	31175	31355
19536134	The finding that phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/8 at C-terminal serines were reduced both in vivo and in vitro in response to BMP stimulation suggested an unexpected role for TAK1 in regulating the activity of BMP-responsive Smads.	31356	31590
19536134	As the immunoprecipitated TAK1 protein was able to phosphorylate Smad1 protein in in vitro kinase assays, we undertook a systematic analysis of Smad1 phosphorylation using a mass spectrometry approach (Figure 6A; Tables I and II).	31591	31821
19536134	This analysis showed that phosphorylation of Smad1 at the C-terminal serines S463/S465 was increased by co-expression of constitutively active TAK1.	31822	31970
19536134	Mutation of this site confirmed this finding, showing an approximately 40% reduction in TAK1-mediated phosphorylation.	31971	32089
19536134	Additionally, our in vivo and in vitro data show that S463/S465 phosphorylation was moderately decreased in both hypertrophic chondrocytes and the Tak1col2 chondrocyte line after BMP2/7 stimulation (Figures 3A, B and 4D).	32090	32311
19536134	As S463/S465 phosphorylation is critical for Smad1 activity, a reduction in S463/S465 phosphorylation would explain the reduction in BMP signalling observed both in vivo and in vitro in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes.	32312	32526
19536134	This implies that TAK1 may have a function in amplification of the signal from the BMP receptor by increasing phosphorylation at the same S463/S465 site targeted by the BMPR1 kinase activity.	32527	32718
19536134	The partial reduction in Smad1 phosphorylation observed in S463/S465 mutated Smad1 (AAVA Smad1) indicates that additional sites are phosphorylated by TAK1 (Figure 6C and E).	32719	32892
19536134	Further, the absence of detectable phosphorylation sites in the MH1 and MH2 domain by the phosphopeptide analysis suggests that these additional sites might lie inside the linker region.	32893	33079
19536134	Unfortunately, the lack of Trypsin and Lys-C cleavable sites precluded finding phosphorylation site in this region.	33080	33195
19536134	It has been reported that the Smad1 linker region contains four MAPK phosphorylation sites and two Gsk3β sites and MAPK and Gsk3β phosphorylation of the linker region restricts Smad1 activity by recruiting the ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, leading to degradation of Smad1.	33196	33463
19536134	As phosphorylation of these sites is important for the regulation of FGF/BMP pathway crosstalk, it will be interesting to test the possibility that TAK1 is involved in the regulation of BMP signalling by FGF through its phosphorylation of those linker phosphorylation sites.	33464	33738
19536134	However, the critical role of TAK1 in BMP signalling precludes an analysis of this crosstalk until a component of the MAPK cascade downstream of TAK1-mediated BMP signalling is identified.	33739	33927
19536134	Analysis of the associations among TAK1, BMPR1A, and the adaptor proteins XIAP and TAB1 suggests a mechanism for TAK1 recruitment to the BMP receptor complex.	33928	34086
19536134	In BMP signalling pathways, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) functions as an adapter protein that connects the BMPR complex with the TAB1–TAK1 complex through its association with TAB1 and BMPR1A.	34087	34297
19536134	Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that BMPR1A binds to XIAP, XIAP in turn mediates the interaction between BMPR1A and TAB1, and TAB1 mediates the interaction between XIAP and TAK1 (Supplementary Figure S5A–C).	34298	34510
19536134	As the interaction of BMPR1A with XIAP occurs normally in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes, TAK1 functions downstream of the BMPR–XIAP complex (Supplementary Figure S5D).	34511	34676
19536134	Hence, we propose a model wherein BMPR1A is connected to the TAK1 complex (TAK1–TAB1) through XIAP, and TAK1 mediates canonical Smad and p38 MAP kinase activation downstream of BMP signalling (Figure 7C).	34677	34881
19536134	On BMP stimulation, the activated BMPRI recruits Smad 1/5/8 directly, and the TAK1 complex (TAK1–TAB1) is recruited to the receptor by the adaptor XIAP.	34882	35034
19536134	R-Smads can be phosphoryated by the type I BMPR and TAK1 at either S463/465 (Smad1/5) or S426/428 (Smad8).	35035	35141
19536134	Activated R-Smads, in turn, bind to Smad4, translocate into the nucleus, and mediate BMP-responsive gene expression (i.e. IHH, ID1, Noggin, and Msx1).	35142	35292
19536134	Alternatively, the TAK1 complex can activate the MKK3/6-p38 MAP kinase pathway.	35293	35372
19536134	Our results do not exclude the possibility that TAK1 may participate in the regulation of other BMP signalling intermediates and other signalling pathways.	35373	35528
19536134	Indeed, in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes, a decreased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was detected in response to TGFβ, and phosphorylation of JNK and ERK MAP kinases and IκBα was also decreased after BMP stimulation (Figure 4D and F and data not shown).	35529	35783

19536134	For in vitro kinase assays, immortalized chondrocytes grown on 10 cm petri dishes were serum starved for 12 h before treatment with either BMP2/7 (100 ng/ml) or TGFβ (2 ng/ml) and then lysed in TNT lysis buffer (1% triton X-100, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, protease inhibitors).	43180	43463
19536134	Alternatively, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with vector, HA-tagged TAK1 (ΔN or CI).	43464	43560

28148288	Members of the ADAM family of cell surface metalloproteases catalyze cell context-dependent cleavage of transmembrane receptors, growth factor precursors, or adhesion molecules [1, 2].	0	184
28148288	ADAM substrates include many cancer-related proteins, such as Notch receptors and their ligands, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands [4, 5], interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its receptors, E-cadherin, and CD44.	185	438
28148288	Because ADAMs are often aberrantly expressed or misregulated in human cancers, they may contribute to tumor progression, metastasis, or therapy resistance [10–12].	439	602
28148288	Among twelve catalytically active human ADAMs, ADAM12 possesses unique characteristics that make it an attractive candidate for future use as a target or a biomarker in breast cancer.	603	786
28148288	ADAM12 expression is strongly elevated in most human breast cancers compared to normal mammary epithelium [13, 14].	787	902
28148288	ADAM12 mRNA is alternatively spliced, and high levels of ADAM12 transcript variant 1 (encoding the transmembrane protein isoform ADAM12-L) are associated with poor prognosis and decreased metastasis-free survival times in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple-negative) early stage breast cancers without systemic treatment, but not in HER2-positive or ER-positive tumors [15, 16].	903	1385
28148288	ADAM12-L expression is induced during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in mammary epithelial cells and appears to be upregulated in the claudin-low intrinsic subtype of breast cancer, which harbors molecular signatures of EMT.	1386	1622
28148288	Claudin-low tumors represent ~5-10% of all breast cancers, are often triple-negative and poorly differentiated, and have elevated activities of EGFR, proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase Src, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways [19–21].	1623	1926
28148288	Importantly, the gene expression signatures of claudin-low tumors show a significant similarity to the signature of CD44hi/CD24-/lo mammosphere-forming cells [20, 22], suggesting an enrichment in cancer stem cell (CSC)-like or tumor-initiating cell features.	1927	2185
28148288	Breast CSCs are thought to be largely responsible for tumor maintenance, treatment resistance, and disease recurrence [23–25].	2186	2312
28148288	Our previous analysis of two clinical datasets showed that elevated expression of ADAM12 mRNA is predictive of resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative breast cancer, independent of age, tumor size, grade, and the lymph node status.	2313	2558
28148288	These observations raise a possibility that ADAM12 may serve as a marker or a therapeutic target in CSCs in ER-negative or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).	2559	2719
28148288	The goal of the current study was to assess a possible contribution of ADAM12 to the CSC phenotype of claudin-low TNBC cells.	2720	2845
28148288	By comparing the properties of sorted cell populations with high versus medium expression of ADAM12, and by analyzing the effect of ADAM12 knockdown on cell migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, mammosphere formation, known CSC markers, tumor formation after xenotransplantation in mice in vivo, and global gene expression, we have determined that ADAM12 actively supports the CSC phenotype of claudin-low TNBC cells.	2846	3266
28148288	This function of ADAM12 appears to be mediated by sustained, ligand-dependent activation of EGFR.	3267	3364
28148288	Thus, we have identified ADAM12 as an important modifier of the EGFR pathway in claudin-low TNBC and a potential target in CSC-directed therapies.	3365	3511

28148288	Non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) female mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.	13112	13232
28148288	One week prior to injection, mice were randomized to either control or doxycycline diet (2 g/kg, Bio-Serv) and they remained on this diet throughout the experiment.	13233	13397
28148288	shControl and shADAM12 SUM159PT cells were pre-treated for 4 days with or without 1 μg/ml doxycycline.	13398	13500

28148288	Genes that were significantly changed by ADAM12 knockdown were further evaluated by QIAGEN’s Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®) using the Canonical Pathways and Upstream Regulator features.	15459	15648
28148288	RNA sequencing data have been deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and are available at the accession number SRP077683.	15649	15781
28148288	Expression levels of ADAM12 (transcript variant 1, NM_003474) in 295 breast tumors from the NKI dataset were retrieved from the Computational Cancer Biology website at The Netherlands Cancer Institute (http://ccb.nki.nl/data/) as ratios of fluorescence intensities to the intensity of a reference pool.	15782	16084
28148288	Tumors were assigned to individual subtypes of breast cancer according to ref..	16085	16164
28148288	Expression data for ADAM12 in 508 breast invasive carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (Nature 2012 dataset) were accessed via the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/) [34, 35].	16165	16382
28148288	Since cBioPortal contains only gene-level data and it does not contain probe-level data, ADAM12 expression values obtained through cBioPortal represent merged data for different ADAM12 splice variants.	16383	16584
28148288	P-values for a t-test of ADAM12 expression in each TNBC subtype versus all other TNBC subtypes were retrieved from ref..	16585	16705
28148288	The list of genes whose expression was most highly correlated with the expression of the ADAM12 gene was acquired from the TCGA (Nature 2012 dataset) via the cBioPortal using the mRNA co-expression feature.	16706	16912
28148288	Overlaps between ADAM12-correlated genes and gene sets from the MSigDB collection were computed using the GSEA website (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/annotate.jsp).	16913	17094
28148288	Genes (n = 45) significantly changed after ADAM12 knockdown in SUM159PT cells (Fig.	17095	17178
28148288	5b and Additional file 1: Table S5) were used to construct an ADAM12 gene expression signature.	17179	17274
28148288	Genes (355 different genes corresponding to 493 individual transcripts) significantly upregulated or downregulated in CD44hi/CD24-/lo subpopulations of primary breast cancer cells and in cancer mammospheres were used to calculate the CSC signature scores.	17275	17530
28148288	Expression values for these CSC-related genes in 51 different breast cancer cell lines were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), using accession number GSE69017.	17531	17735
28148288	The top 250 genes whose expression was most significantly changed upon stable expression of EGFR in MCF7 cells were used to calculate EGFR-responsive gene signature scores.	17736	17908
28148288	Expression values for these EGFR-regulated genes were retrieved from GEO, using accession number GSE3542.	17909	18014
28148288	The expression values for ADAM12-, CSC-, and EGFR-related genes in breast invasive carcinomas were extracted from TCGA (Cell 2015 dataset) via the cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/).	18015	18216
28148288	The signature scores were then calculated for all tumors for which gene expression values were available (a total of 421 tumors) as:s=∑iwixi/∑iwiwhere w is the weight +1 or –1, depending on whether the gene was upregulated or downregulated in the signature, and x is the normalized gene expression level.	18217	18521
28148288	The effect of ADAM12 expression on relapse-free survival rates of breast cancer patients was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter (http://kmplot.com/analysis/).	18522	18685
28148288	This online tool uses manually curated database containing gene expression data and relapse free and overall survival information downloaded from GEO, the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA), and TCGA.	18686	18889
28148288	The parameters were set as follows: Affymetrix probeset: 202952_s_at (as this probeset is specific for ADAM12 transcript variant 1, encoding ADAM12-L); Auto select best cutoff: On; Use array quality control: Remove redundant samples, Exclude outlier arrays; Check proportional hazards assumption: On; Restrict analysis to subtypes: All, or ER-negative (derive ER status from gene expression data: On), PR-negative, HER2-negative, or Mesenchymal stem-like; Restrict analysis to selected cohorts: none; Database release: 2017; Datasets: all.	18890	19429
28148288	By analyzing gene expression profiles of 337 breast tumors from the University of North Carolina database, we previously noted that ADAM12 mRNA levels (transcript variant 1 encoding ADAM12-L protein isoform, but not transcript variant 2 encoding ADAM12-S) were significantly elevated in the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer.	19430	19758
28148288	Here, we extended our observations to two other tumor gene expression repositories: the Netherlands Cancer Institute database (NKI, 295 breast cancers) and The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA, 508 breast cancers).	19759	19975
28148288	In the NKI database, ADAM12 mRNA levels (transcript variant 1) were more frequently upregulated in claudin-low (CL) tumors compared to basal (B), luminal A/B (LumA/B), HER2-enriched (HER2+), or normal-like (NL) cancers (Additional file 2: Figure S1a).	19976	20227
28148288	Similarly, ADAM12 mRNA expression levels in the TCGA database (retrieved as merged values for different splice variants) were significantly higher in claudin-low tumors than in other tumor subtypes (Additional file 2: Figure S1b).	20228	20458
28148288	Furthermore, among different subtypes of TNBCs, ADAM12 mRNA levels (transcript variant 1) were previously found significantly elevated (P = 5.19E-08) in the mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) subtype compared to the mesenchymal (M), basal-like 1 (BL1), basal-like 2 (BL2), immunomodulatory (IM), or luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtypes (Additional file 1: Table S2).	20459	20822
28148288	Notably, the MSL subtype shares many features with the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, including high expression of EMT- and CSC-related genes.	20823	20972
28148288	Investigation of the top 40 genes which are most closely correlated with ADAM12 expression in breast invasive carcinomas from the TCGA database (Additional file 1: Table S3) revealed a very significant enrichment (P = 7.43E-50) in the EMT hallmark signature from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis/Molecular Signature Database (GSEA/MSigDB, ref.)	20973	21317
28148288	(Additional file 1: Table S4).	21318	21348
28148288	These findings corroborate a recent report, in which ADAM12 mRNA expression was correlated with EMT markers N-cadherin, vimentin, and TGFβ, but not E-cadherin, in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines and in 79 breast cancer biopsies.	21349	21587
28148288	Here, we examined ADAM12 protein levels in several cell lines representing different intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer: claudin-low cell lines Hs578T, SUM1315MO2, BT549, and SUM159PT, basal cell lines SUM102PT and SUM149PT, and luminal cell lines MCF-7 and SUM225CWN.	21588	21857
28148288	Cell surface levels of ADAM12-L were evaluated by flow cytometry after staining of live cells with an antibody specific for the extracellular domain of ADAM12-L (Fig.	21858	22024
28148288	1a).	20223	20227
28148288	Also, total cellular levels of ADAM12-L, after partial purification on concanavalin A agarose, were detected by Western blotting using an antibody specific for the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12-L (Fig.	22030	22230
28148288	1b).	20454	20458
28148288	The specificity of ADAM12 bands was confirmed after ADAM12 knockdown using an inducible shRNA construct (see below).	22236	22352
28148288	In accordance with ADAM12 mRNA expression data [17, 42], ADAM12-L protein (from now on referred to as ADAM12) was most abundantly expressed in claudin-low cell lines.	22353	22519
28148288	Since the gene expression signatures of claudin-low tumors and claudin-low cell lines show a significant similarity to the signature of CSCs [20, 22], we examined the relationship between ADAM12 mRNA expression and the CSC signature scores in a panel of 51 breast cancer cell lines from Neve at al..	22520	22819
28148288	The CSC scores were calculated based on the genes whose expression was most significantly changed in CD44hi/CD24-/lo populations and in mammosphere-forming cells, as reported by Creighton et al. and described in Methods.	22820	23040
28148288	As shown in Fig.	23041	23057
28148288	1c, there was a significant positive correlation between CSC scores and ADAM12 mRNA levels (P = 1.4E-07).	23058	23163
28148288	One of the characteristic features associated with the CSC phenotype is the resistance to anoikis, an apoptotic cell death upon matrix detachment.	23164	23310
28148288	When SUM159PT cells were grown as mammospheres in ultra-low attachment plates in serum-free medium, ADAM12 was more abundant in mammospheres than in attached cells grown as monolayers (Fig.	23311	23500
28148288	1d, see also).	23501	23515
28148288	Since mammosphere-forming cells are largely anoikis-resistant, this result suggested that ADAM12 expression might be upregulated in breast CSCs.	23516	23660
28148288	Another characteristic feature of CSCs is their resistance to chemotherapy.	23661	23736
28148288	It was shown previously that overexpression of ADAM12 in MCF10A cells, a non-transformed human breast epithelial cell line, increased cell resistance to cisplatin.	23737	23900
28148288	Here, we asked whether cells with high endogenous expression of ADAM12 would preferentially survive treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent.	23901	24041
28148288	To this end, non-confluent adherent cultures of SUM159PT cells were treated for 6 days with 10 nM paclitaxel, which induced death in ~90% of cells.	24042	24189
28148288	The surviving ~10% of cells were subsequently incubated for 6 additional days in the absence of paclitaxel, during which they resumed proliferation (a “recovery phase”).	24190	24359
28148288	In DMSO-treated cultures, ~1.5% of cells expressed ADAM12 at the level that was equal to or exceeded an arbitrarily defined “high” expression level (ADAM12hi), whereas in paclitaxel-treated cultures, the percentage of ADAM12hi cells was increased ~3-fold (Fig.	24360	24620
28148288	1e and Additional file 3: Figure S2).	24621	24658
28148288	This result indicated that cells with high expression of ADAM12 might be more chemoresistant than cells with lower ADAM12 expression, as it appears that they preferentially survived paclitaxel treatment.	24659	24862
28148288	Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we next isolated two subpopulations of SUM159PT cells: ADAM12hi representing ~1.5% of cells with the highest cell surface expression of ADAM12, and ADAM12med representing cells with medium ADAM12 expression levels (Additional file 4: Figure S3).	24863	25151
28148288	ADAM12hi cells grew slower than ADAM12med cells under standard 2D conditions in complete growth medium (doubling time 19 ± 0.9 h versus 14 ± 0.2 h, P < 0.0001, Additional file 5: Figure S4a).	25152	25343
28148288	However, ADAM12hi cells formed more primary and secondary mammospheres than ADAM12med cells (Additional file 5: Figure S4b).	25344	25468
28148288	ADAM12hi cells also expressed higher levels of several CSC markers, mesenchymal markers, and cancer drug resistance genes than ADAM12med cells (Additional file 5: Figure S4c-e, respectively).	25469	25660
28148288	These results indicated that, in SUM159PT cells, a subpopulation characterized by high endogenous expression levels of ADAM12 was enriched in features commonly attributed to CSCs.	25661	25840
28148288	To examine whether ADAM12 plays an active role in supporting the CSC phenotype, we first examined the effect of ADAM12 knockdown on cell migration, invasion, and mammosphere formation using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system.	25841	26068
28148288	ADAM12 shRNA (shADAM12) or control shRNA (shControl) cloned into pInducer10 vector (Additional file 6: Figure S5a) was stably transduced into SUM159PT cells.	26069	26226
28148288	Treatment with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 4 days significantly decreased the level of ADAM12 mRNA (Additional file 6: Figure S5b) and protein (Additional file 6: Figure S5c, d) in SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells, but not in SUM159PT_shControl cells.	26227	26465
28148288	ADAM12 knockdown did not have a significant effect on cell proliferation or survival rates (results not shown).	26466	26577
28148288	In the Transwell migration assay, SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells treated with doxycycline were less motile than untreated cells (Fig.	26578	26704
28148288	2a).	26705	26709
28148288	In three-dimensional Matrigel cultures, doxycycline-treated SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells were less invasive than shADAM12 cells incubated without doxycycline (Fig.	26710	26868
28148288	2b).	26869	26873
28148288	Doxycycline treatment did not have a significant effect on the migration or invasion of SUM159PT_shControl cells (Fig.	26874	26992
28148288	2a, b).	26993	27000
28148288	Furthermore, induction of ADAM12 knockdown decreased the ability of SUM159PT cells to survive under detachment conditions.	27001	27123
28148288	Using an apoptosis assay based on measuring DNA fragmentation by ELISA, we observed an increased amount of cell death in doxycycline-treated detached SUM159PT_shADAM12, but not in SUM159PT_shControl cells (Fig.	27124	27334
28148288	2c).	27335	27339
28148288	Accordingly, the number of mammospheres formed by doxycycline-treated SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells was lower than the number of mammospheres formed by untreated SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells or by SUM159PT_shControl cells (Fig.	27340	27556
28148288	2d).	27557	27561
28148288	Thus, ADAM12 knockdown decreased the migration, invasion, anoikis-resistance, and mammosphere-forming potential of SUM159PT cells.	27562	27692
28148288	Breast CSCs are characterized by high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and have CD44hi/ CD24-/lo cell surface marker profile [23, 43].	27693	27843
28148288	To evaluate the effect of ADAM12 knockdown on ALDH (measured as ALDEFLUOR+ cells), CD44, and CD24 expression, we used flow cytometry-based assays.	27844	27990
28148288	To minimize possible inaccuracies that might be introduced during compensation protocols (required to correct for spectral overlaps between different fluorochromes and a strong fluorescence signal of red fluorescent protein (RFP), which was co-expressed with shRNAs from the pInducer10 vector), we used siRNA transfection to knockdown ADAM12.	27991	28333
28148288	First, SUM159PT cells were transfected with a pool of four siRNAs targeting ADAM12, all of which had different ADAM12-targeting sequences than shADAM12.	28334	28486
28148288	Downregulation of ADAM12 at the cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometry (Additional file 7: Figure S6a).	28487	28596
28148288	The amount of ALDEFLUOR+ cells was decreased ~3-fold in siADAM12-transfected SUM159PT cells compared to siControl-transfected cells (Fig.	28597	28734
28148288	3a-c).	28735	28741
28148288	A similar effect of ADAM12 knockdown was observed in Hs578T cells, in which the number of ALDEFLUOR+ cells was diminished ~2-fold upon siADAM12 transfection (Fig.	28742	28904
28148288	3d).	28905	28909
28148288	An efficient ADAM12 knockdown in siADAM12-transfected Hs578T cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (Additional file 7: Figure S6b).	28910	29041
28148288	ADAM12 knockdown using pooled siRNAs resulted in a significant reduction of the CSC-containing CD44hi/CD24-/lo population and expansion of the non-CSC CD44hi/CD24+ population in SUM159PT cells (Fig.	29042	29240
28148288	3e, f) and Hs578T cells (Fig.	29241	29270
28148288	3g).	29271	29275
28148288	Increased expression of CD24 (and thus an expansion of the non-CSC population) was also observed in shADAM12-expressing SUM159PT cells treated with doxycycline, but not in shControl-expressing SUM159PT cells upon the same treatment (Additional file 8: Figure S7a and b, respectively).	29276	29560
28148288	To examine the role of ADAM12 in tumor initiation in vivo, we performed limiting dilution transplantation experiments.	29561	29679
28148288	SUM159PT_shADAM12 or SUM159PT_shControl cells, pre-treated with doxycycline or vehicle, were injected into NOD-SCID mice as a 10-fold dilution series from 1x104 to 1x102 cells per mammary gland.	29680	29874
28148288	Mice injected with doxycycline-treated cells were maintained on a doxycycline-containing diet for continuous expression of shRNA.	29875	30004
28148288	Mice injected with vehicle-treated cells were maintained on a doxycycline-free diet.	30005	30089
28148288	After monitoring mice for 21 days for tumor formation, the frequency of CSCs among SUM159PT_ shADAM12 cells without or with doxycycline treatment was estimated as ~1/6,808 and ~1/18,399 cells, respectively, using the ELDA algorithm (P-value of the difference between groups 0.156; Fig.	30090	30375
28148288	4a).	25339	25343
28148288	Among SUM159PT_shControl cells, without or with doxycycline treatment, the frequency of CSCs was estimated as ~1/8,447 and ~1/4,885 cells, respectively (P = 0.359; Fig.	30381	30549
28148288	4a).	25339	25343
28148288	The difference in CSC frequencies between shADAM12 and shControl cells in doxycycline-treated mice was statistically significant (P = 0.042, Fig.	30555	30700
28148288	4a).	25339	25343
28148288	In another approach, 1x105 cells were injected into mouse mammary glands, and tumor growth rates were monitored for up to 38 days.	30706	30836
28148288	Tumors formed by SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells in doxycycline-treated mice were significantly smaller than tumors detected in untreated mice (P < 0.0001; Fig.	30837	30989
28148288	4b, c).	30990	30997
28148288	There was no statistical difference between the growth rates of tumors formed by SUM159PT_shControl cells in doxycycline-treated and untreated mice (Fig.	30998	31151
28148288	4d, e).	31152	31159
28148288	Collectively, these results suggested that ADAM12 knockdown decreased both tumor initiation and tumor growth in mice in vivo. To gain insight into global gene expression networks regulated by ADAM12 in breast cancer cells, we performed RNA sequencing of SUM159PT_shADAM12 and SUM159PT_shControl cells, before and after doxycycline treatment.	31160	31501
28148288	We used two types of comparisons to identify ADAM12-regulated genes (Fig.	31502	31575
28148288	5a).	31576	31580
28148288	First, using a cut-off for | fold change| >1.2 and False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted P <0.05, we identified 340 genes that were differentially expressed in SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells with versus without doxycycline treatment and 96 genes that were significantly altered in SUM159PT_shControl cells by doxycycline treatment.	31581	31903
28148288	Eighty-six genes that were common to these two gene lists were removed from further analysis because their expression was, presumably, affected by doxycycline.	31904	32063
28148288	Second, we identified 175 genes that were differentially expressed between SUM159PT_shADAM12 versus SUM159PT_shControl cells, in the presence of doxycycline and 100 genes that were differentially expressed in these cells in the absence of doxycycline.	32064	32315
28148288	Seventy-three genes that were present in both gene sets were removed from further analysis because they presumably represented intrinsic variations between SUM159PT_shADAM12 and SUM159PT_shControl cells.	32316	32519
28148288	Finally, by combining these two analyses, we generated a high confidence list of 45 genes that were consistently changed in both comparisons and showed the same direction of change (Fig.	32520	32706
28148288	5a).	31576	31580
28148288	Among these, 25 genes were downregulated and 20 genes were upregulated in response to ADAM12 knockdown (Fig.	32712	32820
28148288	5b, Additional file 1: Table S5).	32821	32854
28148288	An ADAM12 gene expression signature score derived from the expression levels of these 45 genes was significantly correlated with ADAM12 expression in breast tumors from the TCGA database (P = 2.6E-14, Fig.	32855	33060
28148288	5c).	33061	33065
28148288	Remarkably, there was also a significant positive correlation between the ADAM12 score and the CSC score in the same tumor dataset (P = 2.1E-15, Fig.	33066	33215
28148288	5d).	33216	33220
28148288	We computed overlaps of the 45 genes altered after ADAM12 knockdown with gene sets from GSEA/MSigDB (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb).	33221	33365
28148288	We noted that genes downregulated after ADAM12 knockdown significantly overlapped with genes transiently induced by EGF (CD55, IER3, ITGA2, MCL1, SERPINE1, ZFP36L1; P = 1.95E-09), and genes constituting HRAS oncogenic signature (CD55, EREG, IER3, ITGA2, MCL1; P = 2.75E-07) (Additional file 1: Table S6).	33366	33670
28148288	To further determine which canonical signaling pathways might have been over-represented among ADAM12-regulated genes, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, http://www.ingenuity.com).	33671	33857
28148288	Canonical pathways analysis identified “Signaling by Rho Family GTPases” as the only pathway that was significantly enriched (P = 1.25E-04) among genes altered in response to ADAM12 knockdown and had a non-zero (negative) z-score (Additional file 9: Figure S8), indicating that this pathway might have been downregulated after ADAM12 knockdown.	33858	34202
28148288	To better understand gene expression changes observed in response to ADAM12 knockdown, we applied the IPA Upstream Regulator analysis.	34203	34337
28148288	The goal of the IPA Upstream Regulator analysis is to identify a cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators that can explain the observed gene expression changes in a user’s dataset.	34338	34524
28148288	This approach indicated that there was a statistically significant overlap between genes altered after ADAM12 knockdown and the genes regulated by LPS, SP1, EGFR, MTOR, SMARCA4 and NEDD9 transcriptional regulators (Fig.	34525	34744
28148288	5e).	34745	34749
28148288	Among those, an overlap between ADAM12-modulated genes and genes changed in response to EGFR inhibition was the most significant (P = 3.97E-09).	34750	34894
28148288	Our investigation of genes changed in response to ADAM12 knockdown in SUM159PT cells using GSEA/MSigDB and IPA gene sets consistently pointed to alterations in the EGFR pathway.	34895	35072
28148288	Therefore, we tested a hypothesis that ADAM12 supports the CSC phenotype via modulation of the EGFR pathway.	35073	35181
28148288	First, we examined the effect of erlotinib, a specific inhibitor of EGFR, on SUM159PT cells.	35182	35274
28148288	Treatment of SUM159PT cells with 1 μM erlotinib inhibited the basal phosphorylation level of EGFR at Y1068, one of the major phosphorylation sites in response to ligand-mediated EGFR activation (Fig.	35275	35474
28148288	5f).	35475	35479
28148288	Importantly, erlotinib elicited a similar effect on the CD44hi/CD24-/lo cell population as ADAM12 knockdown did (Fig.	35480	35597
28148288	5g, h), suggesting that ADAM12 knockdown might have indeed resulted in inhibition of EGFR signaling.	35598	35698
28148288	Next, we examined the effect of ADAM12 knockdown on the basal activation level of EGFR.	35699	35786
28148288	We observed that incubation of SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells, but not SUM159PT_shControl cells, with doxycycline, or transfection of SUM159PT cells with pooled ADAM12 siRNAs decreased the level of EGFR phosphorylation at Y1068 by ~40% and ~55%, respectively (Fig.	35787	36044
28148288	6a).	28592	28596
28148288	Similar results were obtained for Hs578T cells, although the effects were somewhat more modest than in SUM159PT cells (Fig.	36050	36173
28148288	6b).	29037	29041
28148288	Thus, ADAM12 is a positive regulator of EGFR in both cell lines.	36179	36243
28148288	Activation of EGFR at the basal level and its susceptibility to inhibition by erlotinib suggested the presence of EGF-like ligands in culture medium.	36244	36393
28148288	These ligands might have been endogenously expressed by cells and released from the cell surface by ADAM12 and, possibly, other ADAM proteases.	36394	36537
28148288	Alternatively, low concentrations of EGF-like growth factors might be present in the serum used to supplement culture media.	36538	36662
28148288	To discriminate between these two possibilities, cells were incubated for 24 h with batimastat (BB-94), a metalloprotease inhibitor, in serum-free medium or in complete medium containing serum.	36663	36856
28148288	Regardless of the presence or absence of serum, treatment with BB-94 decreased the phosphorylation level of EGFR by 70-80% (Fig.	36857	36985
28148288	6c).	36986	36990
28148288	These results indicated that the basal activation of EGFR was achieved through interactions with endogenous EGF-like ligands that were released from cells via ADAM-mediated cleavage and that were acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner.	36991	37227
28148288	To further determine whether ADAM12 played a role in EGFR activation in response to endogenous ligands, we examined the effect of BB-94 or exogenously added EGF on EGFR phosphorylation in cells transfected with control or ADAM12 siRNAs.	37228	37464
28148288	In these experiments, we used two individual siRNAs from the pool of four siRNAs targeting ADAM12, which diminished cell surface expression of ADAM12 with the highest potency, namely siADAM12#1 and #2, (Additional file 7: Figure S6c).	37465	37699
28148288	These two individual siRNAs reduced the level of pEGFR_Y1068 by ~50% (Fig.	37700	37774
28148288	6d), as seen before with shRNA or pooled siRNAs.	37775	37823
28148288	Importantly, the effects of siADAM12 #1 and siADAM12 #2 on pEGFR_Y1068 were significantly reduced or eliminated when cells were further incubated with 10 μM BB-94 or 20 ng/ml of EGF (Fig.	37824	38011
28148288	6d).	38012	38016
28148288	These results supported a model in which ADAM12 sustained the basal level of activation of EGFR by mediating the release of endogenous EGF-like ligands.	38017	38169
28148288	Since claudin-low tumors have elevated activities of the EGFR pathway, we next asked whether reduced activation of EGFR in ADAM12-deficent cells might directly impact the expression of genes associated with claudin-low tumors and cell lines.	38170	38411
28148288	Indeed, we observed that the expression of several claudin-low-enriched transcripts, ALDH1A1, IL8, SERPINE1, VCAM1, and CD44, was decreased in doxycycline-treated SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells versus SUM159PT_shControl cells (Fig.	38412	38636
28148288	6e).	38637	38641
28148288	These results underscore the role of ADAM12 in promoting the claudin-low phenotype, which is associated with the CSC features.	38642	38768
28148288	To determine whether modulation of the EGFR pathway by ADAM12 is prerequisite for the ADAM12-mediated effect on CSC features, cells were transfected with siADAM12, treated for two days with exogenous EGF, and the cell surface expression of CD44/CD24 markers was evaluated by flow cytometry.	38769	39059
28148288	Importantly, while EGF increased the pool of CD44hi/CD24-/lo cells, as expected, ADAM12 knockdown did not have any effect on CD44 or CD24 expression in the presence of EGF (Fig.	39060	39237
28148288	7a).	39238	39242
28148288	These results suggested that downregulation of EGFR activation by ADAM12 knockdown was required for a reduction of CSC-containing CD44hi/CD24-/lo cell population.	39243	39405
28148288	We further explored the relationships between ADAM12 expression and the EGFR-responsive gene signature scores in 421 tumors from the TCGA database.	39406	39553
28148288	The EGFR scores were calculated based on the gene expression profiling of MCF-7 breast cancer cells overexpressing EGFR.	39554	39674
28148288	We observed positive correlations between ADAM12 and the EGFR score (P = 3.2E-13, Fig.	39675	39761
28148288	7b).	39762	39766
28148288	Importantly, ADAM12 expression itself was not significantly changed by manipulations of EGFR in MCF-7 cells.	39767	39875
28148288	Based on our results, we propose a model where ADAM12 contributes to the activation of EGFR by releasing EGF-like ligands from the cell surface, and ultimately to the expansion of CSC populations.	39876	40072
28148288	As the EGFR signaling pathway is frequently activated in TNBC, ADAM12-mediated increase of EGFR activity should be the most relevant in this type of cancer.	40073	40229
28148288	Our model is further supported by the fact that high expression of the ADAM12 gene correlates with poor prognosis in 196 patients with TNBC and, most importantly, in 59 patients with the MSL subtype of TNBC, but not in a general breast cancer patient population (Fig.	40230	40497
28148288	7c, assessed by the Kaplan-Meier Plotter online tool, ref.).	40498	40558
28148288	The EGFR pathway activation has been frequently observed in claudin-low TNBCs and cell lines bearing CSC-like features, and several reports indicated that EGFR is a positive regulator of CSCs.	40559	40751
28148288	For example, stimulation of the EGFR pathway promoted mammosphere formation by normal breast stem cells and by ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-derived epithelial cells.	40752	40920
28148288	Recently, it has been reported that cetuximab, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, reduced mammosphere formation and CSC populations in breast cancer cells in vitro and potentiated the effect of Ixabepilone, a new generation microtubule-stabilizing agent, in treating orthotopic TNBC xenografts.	40921	41213
28148288	Furthermore, in A431 epidermoid cancer cells, treatment with cetuximab upregulated the expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and occludin, downregulated the epithelial transcriptional repressors Zeb, Snail, and Slug, and reduced the CD44hi/CD24-/lo phenotype.	41214	41483
28148288	EGFR activation also promoted acquisition of CSC properties in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [51, 52] and in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, pointing to a more general function of EGFR in CSC biology.	41484	41686
28148288	The postulated mechanisms by which EGFR promotes the CSC features in TNBC cells include the activation of MEK/ERK signaling, the STAT3 pathway, and/or autophagy.	41687	41848
28148288	For example, blocking ERK activation in claudin-low cell lines by MEK inhibitors or by forced expression of DUSP4, dual specificity phosphatase-4 that is a negative regulator of ERK, has been shown to reduce the CD44hi/CD24-/lo populations in vitro and to diminish tumor initiating populations in vivo. STAT3, which is another downstream effector of EGFR, has been recently reported to be preferentially activated in tumor-initiating cells/CSCs in claudin-low breast cancer, raising a possibility that it might, at least partially, mediate the downstream effects of EGFR on CSC properties of claudin-low cells.	41849	42459
28148288	EGFR is activated by soluble ligands that are synthesized as transmembrane precursors and need to be released from the cell surface by ADAM proteases [5, 55].	42460	42618
28148288	In many cell types and tissues, ADAM17 or ADAM10 act as dedicated and robust EGFR ligand “sheddases” [1, 10].	42619	42728
28148288	Likewise, it has been postulated that ADAM17 is the main ADAM responsible for EGFR ligand cleavage and activation of EGFR in breast cancer [56–58].	42729	42876
28148288	However, other ADAMs, including ADAM12, may mediate the release of soluble EGFR ligands as well.	42877	42973
28148288	For example, ADAM12 was shown to act as a sheddase for heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) during cardiac hypertrophy and under hypoxia in head and neck, lung, and pancreatic cancer cells, leading to the formation of invadopodia and increasing cancer cell invasion.	42974	43251
28148288	Whether ADAM12 activates EGFR in breast cancer cells and, in particular, whether ADAM12-mediated EGFR activation promotes the acquisition of the breast CSC phenotype, has not been sufficiently explored.	43252	43454
28148288	In this report, we have identified ADAM12 as a modifier of the EGFR activation in claudin-low TNBC.	43455	43554
28148288	In existing microarray datasets, ADAM12 mRNA levels were the highest in claudin-low and MSL TNBCs, and they strongly correlated with the EMT hallmark gene signature.	43555	43720
28148288	Among breast cancer cell lines, claudin-low cells expressed the highest levels of ADAM12.	43721	43810
28148288	Down-regulation of ADAM12 decreased the basal activation levels of EGFR, diminished the expression of claudin-low transcripts, reduced the CSC phenotype in vitro, and decreased the tumorigenic potential of engrafted cells in mice in vivo.	43811	44049
28148288	In addition, ADAM12 mRNA expression was strongly correlated with the EGFR activation score in 421 breast invasive cancers.	44050	44172
28148288	Our previous analysis of two clinical datasets showed that high expression of ADAM12 was predictive of resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative breast cancer.	44173	44344
28148288	This is fully consistent with ADAM12 being an EMT- and CSC-related gene, as both EMT and CSCs contribute to drug resistance [61, 62].	44345	44478
28148288	Finally, in a dataset of 196 TNBCs and 59 MSL TNBCs analyzed here, and previously in 53 TNBC patients without systemic treatment [15, 16], high ADAM12 expression was associated with decreased metastasis-free survival times.	44479	44702
28148288	Current treatments of TNBC rely mainly on chemotherapy, as there are no targeted therapies specifically approved for this type of breast cancer.	44703	44847
28148288	EGFR is expressed in 60-70% of TNBCs [64, 65], raising an early hope for EGFR-targeted therapies in TNBC.	44848	44953
28148288	Two completed clinical trials investigated the therapeutic potential of cetuximab, as a single agent or in addition to cisplatin chemotherapy, in unselected TNBC patients with metastatic disease [66, 67].	44954	45158
28148288	While the results have been disappointing and there was no significant effect on progression-free or overall patient survival, it is becoming clear that EGFR expression alone does not necessarily indicate tumor cell dependence on EGFR signaling and further molecular stratifications and patient selections are needed in future trials [63, 68, 69].	45159	45506
28148288	We propose that ADAM12 may be an important biomarker in identifying TNBCs with over-activation of the EGFR pathway and may help select patients that would better respond to EGFR inhibitors.	45507	45696
28148288	In addition, further detailed studies of ADAM12-mediated regulation of the EGFR pathway should establish whether ADAM12 itself may be a suitable target for CSC-like populations in claudin-low TNBC.	45697	45894
28148288	ADAM12 supports the CSC phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer cells via modulation of the EGFR activation.	45895	46002
28148288	Therefore, ADAM12 may be an important biomarker in identifying TNBCs that might respond to EGFR inhibition.	46003	46110
22051099	The human chemokine receptor CXCR-1 (or IL8R-alpha) is a specific receptor for the chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8).	0	114
22051099	Initially identified as a chemoattractant for neutrophils, IL-8 has been demonstrated to have pro-inflammatory effects including stimulation of neutrophil degranulation.	115	284
22051099	Cellular activities of IL-8 are mediated by CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 (IL8R-beta), which maintain 78% of amino acid similarity and are encoded by two single-copy genes that are located on chromosome 2q34-35.	285	484
22051099	However, CXCR-1 is more specific for IL-8 in comparison with CXCR-2.	485	553
22051099	The involvement of IL-8, CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 has been extensively investigated in different diseases such as pyelonephritis, hepatitis B, rapid disease progression of HIV-1+, lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, bronchiectasis, systemic sclerosis and lung cancer.	554	851
22051099	Some of these studies have reported positive associations between the diseases and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CXCR1 gene.	852	992
22051099	Indeed, a significant association was demonstrated between the 860G > C (S276T) SNP in the CXCR1 gene with decreased lung cancer risk.	993	1127
22051099	Haplotypes formed by SNPs in the CXCR1 and CXCR2 genes where also previously identified.	1128	1216
22051099	The 860G > C (S276T) SNP in CXCR1 gene was identified by comparison of multiple sequences deposited in the GenBank/EMBL data banks.	1217	1348
22051099	These authors named this polymorphism differently: +2607 (position 6334 of sequence accession number [GenBank: L19592.1]) in exon 2, and +827 (starting from the initiation of the ATG codon in exon 2 of [GenBank: L19592.1]), respectively.	1349	1586
22051099	The variant position 860G > C is based on the [NCBI: NM000634.2] exon 2 initiations, however it is important to be clear that all these different positions at the CXCR1 gene refer to the same polymorphism (G > C), which results in a conservative amino acid substitution from serine to threonine at the 276 amino acid residue of the CXCR-1 (or IL8R-alpha) protein.	1587	1950
22051099	Here, we preferred to use the reference sequence number [refSNP ID: rs2234671] in NCBI's Entrez system (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP).	1951	2088
22051099	Predominantly in the last decade, many candidate-gene investigations have been conducted in order to find genetic risk factors associated with chronic periodontitis (CP).	2089	2259
22051099	Epidemiological studies indicate that CP is an important cause of teeth loss in adults, since 5% to 15% of any population suffers from this disease.	2260	2408
22051099	CP is a multifactorial disease, initiated by bacterial infection which can progress to the damage and destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth.	2409	2562
22051099	The host response is influenced by both environmental (e.g. smoking, oral hygiene) and genetic factors.	2563	2666
22051099	Some studies have demonstrated association between polymorphisms in genes of the immune system and CP, such as Interleukin 2 (IL2), IL4, IL6 and IL10.	2667	2817
22051099	Recently, we have reported association between haplotypes in the IL8 and in the CXCR2 genes with CP.	2818	2918
22051099	Because those previous findings and the biological relationship of the CXCR-1 with the IL-8 and the CXCR-2 we have hypothesized whether a SNP in the CXCR1 gene would also influence the host susceptibility to CP.	2919	3130
22051099	In this regard, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of the rs2234671 SNP in the CXCR1 gene in a Brazilian population with chronic periodontitis.	3131	3296
22051099	In total, 395 individuals in good general health and having similar socioeconomic status were recruited from the patient pool of the School of Dentistry at Araraquara, São Paulo State University - UNESP between November 2004 and May 2007.	3297	3535
22051099	The study was approved by the Committee for Ethical Affairs of the São Paulo State University (Protocol number 57/04).	3536	3654
22051099	To verify statistical power of our sample, we used the G*POWER 3 software with the following parameters: logistic regression; two tail, odds ratio = 1.56, α error probability = 0.05.	3655	3837
22051099	Detailed clinical criteria for include patients in this study are described in Viana et al..	3838	3930
22051099	Briefly, the following clinical signs and parameters were assessed at six sites around each tooth: probing pocket depth (PPD) (measured as distance from the free gingival margin to the base of the pocket), clinical attachment loss (CAL) (as the distance from the cement-enamel junction to the base of the periodontal pocket) and bleeding on probing (BOP) (registered as present or absent).	3931	4320
22051099	These measurements were performed in millimeters using a periodontal probe with Williams markings.	4321	4419
22051099	All fully erupted teeth, except third molars and retained roots, were examined.	4420	4499
22051099	The diagnosis of subjects was established on the basis of clinical criteria proposed by the 1999 International World Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions.	4500	4686
22051099	The subjects were categorized into two groups: controls (n = 191), subjects exhibiting no sites with CAL and PPD ≥ 3 mm and no BOP; and CP (n = 200), subjects exhibiting one or more sites with CAL and PPD ≥ 3 mm and BOP.	4687	4907
22051099	Information on smoking status was obtained using a self-reported questionnaire, and subjects were classified as a "smoker" or "nonsmoker" according to Kornman et al.. DNA was obtained from buccal epithelial cells, extracted with sequential phenolchloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) solution and precipitated with a salt ethanol solution.	4908	5246
22051099	The SNP was identified using the sequence-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction method (SSP-PCR) according to Renzoni et al..	5247	5376
22051099	The PCR products were electrophoresed (100 V, 120 min) in 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining.	5377	5493
22051099	The chi-squared test was used to determine whether the groups were composed of patients with the same proportion of males and females and whether they had similar smoking habits.	5494	5672
22051099	Onset age distribution between the two groups was evaluated by Students't-test.	5673	5752
22051099	Those statistical analyses, as well as deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, were performed using BioEstat software version 5.0 (UFPA, MCT, CNPq, Belém, PA, Brazil).	5753	5924
22051099	In addition, a forward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis was used for estimating the relationships between the SNP rs2234671 in the CXCR1gene and periodontal disease susceptibility and the other covariates.	5925	6144
22051099	This multivariate logistic regression modeling was executed using the R statistical package (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria).	6145	6280
22051099	Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05.	6281	6341
22051099	The power calculations showed that the sample size of 395 individuals demonstrated a power of 93%.	6342	6440
22051099	Therefore, the number of subjects enrolled in this study is large enough to detect association with an acceptable level of confidence.	6441	6575
22051099	The population investigated here was composed mainly of female subjects (59.7%) and nonsmokers (84.8%) and the mean age of the individuals was 39.49 years (Table 1).	6576	6741
22051099	The minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0.087, and the genotype distribution of the rs2234671 SNP in the CXCR1 gene was consistent with the assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the control (p = 0.1719) and CP groups (p = 0.2777).	6742	6980
22051099	Significant associations between age and periodontitis were observed by univariate analysis, mainly considering the ORs for age groups 30-39 to the 50-59.	6981	7135
22051099	We consider that besides the 60-69 and > 70 age groups showed significant OR values they were uncommon and demonstrated a wide range of CI.	7136	7275
22051099	Significant association was also found between smoking status and periodontitis (OR = 3.8).	7276	7367
22051099	Therefore, age and smoking status were considered confounding factors.	7368	7438
22051099	Even though gender was not found to be associated with periodontitis, we included it in the confounding factors in the multivariate analysis, to adjust for any small confounding effects.	7439	7625
22051099	To more accurately evaluate the strength of any association and to eliminate the distortion caused by confounding effects, multivariate analysis was performed.	7626	7785
22051099	The multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that neither genotypes nor alleles were associated with periodontitis, even after adjusting for covariates, including age, gender and smoking status (Table 2).	7786	8000
22051099	Therefore, this polymorphism could not be considered a genetic risk for CP in the studied Brazilian population.	8001	8112
22051099	To our knowledge, this is the first time that the rs2234671 SNP in the CXCR1 gene was investigated regarding the CP.	8113	8229
22051099	Single nucleotide polymorphisms are mainly useful in studies of human population genetics and candidate-gene studies for disease association.	8230	8371
22051099	This makes possible the development of the susceptibility profile concept for specific diseases, like the risk of Alzheimer's, which has been considered to be substantially influenced by a total of ten genetic polymorphisms of inflammation-related molecules.	8372	8630
22051099	If the high-susceptibility profile for CP be determined, genetically susceptible subjects would be identified earlier and therapeutic intervention strategies could be envisaged aiming prevention of disease establishment.	8631	8851
22051099	However, many studies with different populations would be needed to reach a high-risk profile for periodontal disease.	8852	8970
22051099	Another important point to be considered in studying genetic variations is about the functionality of a polymorphism.	8971	9088
22051099	Considering that the rs2234671 SNP causes a conservative amino acid substitution (S276T) in the third extracellular loop of the CXCR-1 protein, one can suppose whether this event would influence the ligand/binding interaction of the chemokine receptor.	9089	9341
22051099	This speculation was raised by Liu and colleagues, which found four SNPs (including the rs2234671) in human populations, that were not found in nonhuman primate species when the gene sequences were compared.	9342	9549
22051099	The authors concluded that there is an accelerated CXCR-1 protein evolution in the human lineage.	9550	9647
22051099	However, more studies are necessary in order to clarify whether this SNP is functional, and whether it would be under selective pressure aiming to improve innate immunity.	9648	9819
22051099	Relevant factors known to influence the pathogenesis of periodontitis were assessed by multivariate analysis.	9820	9929
22051099	Regarding age, there is evidence that both the prevalence and severity of periodontitis increase with increasing age.	9930	10047
22051099	This can be explained by the cumulative effect of prolonged exposure to other risk factors.	10048	10139
22051099	There is a multitude of studies (more than 325) that have shown a relationship between smoking and periodontitis.	10140	10253
22051099	In the present study, smoking was found as a risk factor for periodontitis (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.97-7.33).	10254	10359
22051099	Interestingly, Tonetti et al. reported that cigarette smoking is associated with two- to threefold increases in the odds of developing periodontitis.	10360	10509
22051099	Also similar with our results, Tomar & Asma found that current smokers were about four times as likely to have periodontitis than persons who never smoked, after adjusting for covariates such as age, gender and education.	10510	10731
22051099	Some studies have shown that smokers had significantly worse clinical symptoms of periodontitis than non-smokers.	10732	10845
22051099	We did not take into account ancestry in our study because we only obtained the skin color information.	10846	10949
22051099	Although Brazilian population is admixtured, the skin color is not related with ancestry according to Pena et al., Parra et al. and Pimenta et al..	10950	11097
22051099	In regards to our hypothesis whether the rs2234671 SNP in the CXCR1 gene would be associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis, the obtained results showing a lack of association permit us to conclude that this SNP was not useful as a genetic risk factor for CP in the studied Brazilian population.	11098	11407
22051099	This study was supported by CAPES and FAPESP grants (03/10424-0, 06/04492-1, 05/03231-7, 2005/04553-8).	11408	11511
20034406	Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that direct the migration of cells that express the appropriate chemokine receptor.	0	120
20034406	Chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) is a potent attractant protein for monocytes, therefore being previously denominated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).	121	285
20034406	The biological effects of CCL2 are mediated via interactions with its receptor, chemokine C-C motif receptor 2 (CCR2).	286	404
20034406	CCR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor and has also been designated as CD192, CC-CKR-2; CKR2; CMKBR2; MCP-1-R.	405	513
20034406	Upon binding to CCR2, CCL2 regulates the migration and infiltration of monocytes, T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells to regions of inflammation.	514	662
20034406	Studies using CCL2 and CCR2 knockout mice have shown that this ligand-receptor complex is involved in mononuclear cell infiltration at sites of inflammation.	663	820
20034406	In the CNS of several different species including humans, CCR2 expression has been demonstrated in endothelial cells, astrocytes, microglia and neurons.	821	973
20034406	In addition, CCL2 and CCR2 expressing cells are observed in multiple brain regions including the hippocampus and the expression patterns of CCR2 are altered in human neuropathological conditions.	974	1169
20034406	These conditions include: multiple sclerosis, HIV encephalopathy, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy.	1170	1269
20034406	Thus, CCL2 and CCR2 are expressed by several cell types throughout the CNS and this expression is altered in conditions of neuroinflammation.	1270	1411
20034406	Neuroinflammation occurs after seizures and may contribute to a pro-epileptogenic neural system.	1412	1508
20034406	This is especially true in the hippocampus, where inflammation has been shown to contribute to neuroplastic changes that may have detrimental consequences.	1509	1664
20034406	However, alterations to the expression patterns of CCL2 and CCR2 have not been examined following status epilepticus (SE) in a rat experimental model.	1665	1815
20034406	Such data could contribute greatly to our understanding of this component of the neuroinflammatory response following an initial precipitating injury such as SE.	1816	1977
20034406	Thus, this study investigated whether CCL2 or CCR2 expression is altered in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced SE.	1978	2103
20034406	The results show that both CCR2 and CCL2 are increased in the hippocampus following seizures.	2104	2197
20034406	In addition, it was observed that seizures result in neuroplastic changes to the cell numbers and types that express CCR2.	2198	2320
20034406	All experimental procedures were approved by the IACUC of the Texas A&M University Health Science Center and the Scott & White Hospital.	2321	2457
20034406	Animals were housed 2 per cage and maintained in a 12 hour light-dark cycle (06:00-18:00) with food and water provided ad libitum.	2458	2588
20034406	Adult Sprague Dawley rats (230-235 g) were treated with methyl-scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.; Sigma) 30 min before pilocarpine hydrochloride i.p. injection (320 mg/kg; Sigma).	2589	2760
20034406	Animal behavior was observed and the onset of SE was considered when animals exhibited a Racine class 3 seizure, that lasted more than 5 minutes and progressed to uncontrollable stage 5 seizures.	2761	2956
20034406	Ninety minutes after SE onset diazepam i.p. (10 mg/kg; Sigma) was administrated to stop seizures.	2957	3054
20034406	Only animals that presented at least stage 5 seizures based on Racine's scale were included in the SE group (n = 10).	3055	3172
20034406	Control rats (n = 10) received the same treatment but were injected with saline instead of pilocarpine.	3173	3276
20034406	Five days after seizure induction rats were sacrificed for analysis.	3277	3345
20034406	For immunohistochemical analysis, animals (n = 4 per group) were deeply anesthetized with Euthasol (pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium; 175 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer.	3346	3579
20034406	The brains were removed, postfixed for 24 hours and cryoprotected in sucrose solution.	3580	3666
20034406	Forty μm thick sections were cut using a cryostat (Microm HM 505 E) and were processed for immunohistochemistry with anti- CCR2 (rabbit anti-CCR2, 1:200; Abcam).	3667	3828
20034406	The antibody specificity was verified by omitting the primary CCR2 antibody and also by blocking of CCR2 antibody with the CCR2 peptide (Abcam) that was used as an immunogen for the antibody production.	3829	4031
20034406	In order to decipher the cell types that express CCR2, double-labeling immunohistochemistry was performed using the following antibodies combined with CCR2 staining: neuronal nuclei protein (mouse anti-NeuN, 1:1000; Chemicon) that stains neurons; microtubule-associated protein 2 (mouse anti-MAP-2, 1:1000; Millipore), a neuron-specific microtubule protein; glial fibrillary acidic protein (mouse anti-GFAP-Cy3, 1:500; Sigma), a marker of astrocytes; ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (goat anti-Iba1, 1:500; Abcam) that stains macrophage/microglia and a marker of endothelial cells (mouse anti-ICAM-1, 1:200, R&D Systems).	4032	4664
20034406	Tissue processing for immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described.	4665	4746
20034406	Briefly, sections were incubated in 0.5% H2O2 for 30 min and 1% H2O2 for 1 hr, followed by PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) rinsing.	4747	4866
20034406	Nonspecific staining was blocked by incubating the tissue for 1 hr in 3% normal goat serum (Vector Labs), in PBS.	4867	4980
20034406	Sections were next incubated in primary antibodies, in PBS with 3% normal goat serum and 0.05% Tween-20, rotating for 48 hr, at 4°C.	4981	5113
20034406	Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated with secondary fluorescent antibodies (Alexa 488 and 555, 1:200; Millipore), rotating at RT for 90 min.	5114	5264
20034406	The tissue was next rinsed in PBS baths.	5265	5305
20034406	It should be noted that the anti-GFAP (Sigma) is conjugated to CY3, thus no secondary antibody was used.	5306	5410
20034406	It should also be noted that for the anti-Iba1 reaction, normal horse serum (3%; Vector Labs) was used instead of normal goat serum.	5411	5543
20034406	Brain sections were then mounted onto glass slides and coverslips were applied with hard set mounting medium with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Labs), to allow nuclear visualization.	5544	5740
20034406	All immuno-labeling was verified using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview 1000).	5741	5841
20034406	The sequential scanning feature was used to ensure that cross-excitation did not occur.	5842	5929
20034406	The 3-D confocal images were processed and analyzed with FV10-ASW (version 1.7a) software.	5930	6020
20034406	To confirm double-labeling of CCR2 with NeuN and GFAP, quantitative co-localization analyses were employed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient, overlap coefficient and co-localization coefficients M1 and M2.	6021	6236
20034406	Pearson's correlation coefficient is used to describe the correlation of the intensity variation between channels.	6237	6351
20034406	Overlap coefficient indicates the intersecting volume of the signals.	6352	6421
20034406	The co-localization coefficients M1 and M2 indicate the contribution of one color channel in the co-localized area.	6422	6537
20034406	In this study M1 represent a contribution of CCR2, while M2 show a contribution of NeuN or GFAP.	6538	6634
20034406	In order to generate the co-localization coefficients the regions of interest of each image were selected and the average of the result of each slice that composed the final image was used.	6635	6824
20034406	Once staining was verified using the confocal microscope, the number of cells expressing CCR2 was estimated using the optical dissector method.	6825	6968
20034406	Analysis was performed in different hippocampal regions using a microscope (Nikon Eclipse MU) with a motorized stage connected to a computer running the Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience).	6969	7168
20034406	Briefly, the dentate gyrus, and hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3 were examined in 5 sections per rat.	7169	7267
20034406	For the dentate gyrus tracing, molecular and granular layers were delineated together and are referred as ML/GCL in the text.	7268	7393
20034406	Preliminary population estimates were performed.	7394	7442
20034406	Based on these population estimates, a counting frame of 100 × 100 μm was distributed in a randomly positioned lattice of 200 × 200 μm.	7443	7578
20034406	CCR2 positive (CCR2+) cells were counted using as criteria staining in defined round cell bodies.	7579	7676
20034406	Cellular processes were not considered for stereological counting.	7677	7743
20034406	In addition to CCR2-labeled cells, the number of CCR2/NeuN double-labeled cells was also counted within the same counting frame.	7744	7872
20034406	Results were statistically analyzed using a t-test and are presented as density of cells/mm3 ± SEM.	7873	7972
20034406	The 3-D images of microglia cells stained with Iba1 and CCR2 + cells were captured as described in the section "Confocal images".	7973	8102
20034406	Using the Olympus FV10-ASW (version 1.7a) software, the CCR2+ cell body and the cell body of the closest Iba1+ cell were traced using the Free Area tool.	8103	8256
20034406	Using the Line tool, a line was traced between the closest drawn borders of the two cell bodies.	8257	8353
20034406	The Measurement command calculated the length of the line traced indicating the distance between the CCR2+ cell and microglia in μm.	8354	8486
20034406	Results were statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test and are presented as mean distance (μm) ± SEM.	8487	8602
20034406	Animals (n = 6 per group) were deeply anesthetized and then decapitated.	8603	8675
20034406	The brain was quickly removed from the skull and the hippocampus and cerebellum were dissected and immediately frozen in methylbutane in dry ice.	8676	8821
20034406	CCL2 tissue levels were assayed against a standard curve provided by the Milliplex MAP kit (Millipore) and was performed per manufacturer instructions.	8822	8973
20034406	Briefly, 25 μl of standard, control or a tissue homogenate sample was added to 25 μl assay buffer.	8974	9072
20034406	To this solution, 25 μl of beads were added and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 4°C.	9073	9174
20034406	The beads were washed twice with wash buffer and incubated with 25 μl of detection antibody at RT for 2 hrs, followed by the addition of 25 μl of Streptavidin-Phycoerythrin compound and allowed to incubate 30 min at RT.	9175	9394
20034406	The beads were then washed twice with wash buffer and incubated with 150 μl of Sheath Fluid for 5 min at RT.	9395	9503
20034406	The fluorescence intensity was measured on the Luminex machine (Millipore, 100 μl, 50 beads per bead set) and the analyte concentration was determined using the BioRad software (BioPlex Manager version 5.0).	9504	9711
20034406	The assay was run in triplicate to confirm the results.	9712	9767
20034406	The tissue concentration of CCL2 was normalized to the total protein concentration and presented as pg/μg of total protein ± SEM.	9768	9897
20034406	In normal adult rats, the CCR2 immunohistochemical analysis revealed a sparse distribution of cells expressing CCR2 in the hippocampus.	9898	10033
20034406	In rats that experienced SE, although still sparse, there were significantly more cells labeled with CCR2 (Figure 1).	10034	10151
20034406	These cells were characterized mainly by punctate staining of cell bodies with limited staining over proximal processes.	10152	10272
20034406	In addition to increased cell body staining in SE rats, CCR2 labeling was observed in isolated processes that appeared to have either a neuronal or glial phenotype (Figure 1).	10273	10448
20034406	This pattern of staining was most robust in the dentate gyrus and CA1 region of the hippocampus.	10449	10545
20034406	Control rats exhibited similar cell body staining, but rarely presented isolated stained processes.	10546	10645
20034406	Any visible staining was eliminated when the primary antibody was omitted or was conjugated with the CCR2 peptide (data not shown).	10646	10777
20034406	Quantitative stereological analysis showed that rats with SE have a significantly increased expression of CCR2 in hippocampal CA1 compared with control rats (p = 0.003, t-test; Figure 1).	10778	10965
20034406	Results from the cytokine assay also showed a significant increase (p = 0.001) in the expression of CCL2 in the hippocampus of SE rats compared with control animals (Figure 1).	10966	11142
20034406	There was no change in the CCL2 expression in the cerebellum (Figure 1).	11143	11215
20034406	This region was used as a control area because it is not greatly affected relative to limbic structures by pilocarpine-induced seizures.	11216	11352
20034406	Double-labeling immunohistochemistry revealed CCR2+ cells that co-label for NeuN-labeled neurons (Figure 2).	11353	11461
20034406	The CCR2 staining appeared punctiform and predominantly localized to the surface of the neuron cell body.	11462	11567
20034406	Since NeuN primarily stains the nucleus of the neuron and to a lesser extent labels the peripheral cytoplasm and proximal processes, the co-localization coefficients were not very robust in these double-labeled preparations (Table 1).	11568	11802
20034406	Stereological quantification revealed a significant increase in the density of CCR2/NeuN double-labeled cells in CA1 of SE rats (p = 0.029, Figure 3).	11803	11953
20034406	Further analyses showed that almost all (> 99%) CCR2-expressing cells were double-labeled with NeuN in the molecular and granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus and CA1 region of the hippocampus in control animals.	11954	12169
20034406	Alternatively, in SE rats, this percentage significantly decreased to approximately 80% of CCR2-labeled cells that co-label with NeuN (p = 0.029; Figure 3).	12170	12326
20034406	Additional qualitative examination of the neuronal population expressing CCR2 showed a sub-population of MAP-2 labeled cell bodies that also expressed CCR2 (Figure 4).	12327	12494
20034406	However, MAP-2 labeled neuronal processes were rarely found to double-label with CCR2 (Figure 4).	12495	12592
20034406	In addition to the neuronal localization of CCR2, the SE rats had a population of non-neuronal processes labeled for CCR2.	12593	12715
20034406	These processes were primarily observed in hippocampal area CA1, as well as in the dentate gyrus.	12716	12813
20034406	Such a robust labeling was not observed in the control rats.	12814	12874
20034406	Double-labeling immunohistochemistry with anti-GFAP demonstrated that the majority of these CCR2-labeled processes from SE rats were astrocytic (Figure 5).	12875	13030
20034406	These double-labeled astrocytic processes often appeared hypertrophied (Figure 5).	13031	13113
20034406	In the dentate gyrus, some of the CCR2-labeled astrocytic processes were the radial glial processes that extend through the granule cell layer and this pattern of labeling was more pronounced in the SE rats.	13114	13321
20034406	In addition, a relatively robust population of CCR2-labeled astrocytic processes were orientated into the hilus (Figure 5).	13322	13445
20034406	Such processes were not observed in the control group.	13446	13500
20034406	The high co-localization coefficients presented in Table 1 confirm the extent of CCR2 and GFAP double-labeling in CA1 and dentate gyrus of SE rats.	13501	13648
20034406	Double-labeling with the microglial cell marker Iba1 and CCR2 did not reveal CCR2/Iba-1 double labeling in either the control or SE rats (data not shown).	13649	13803
20034406	A significant difference was found in the relationship of the proximity between microglial cells and CCR2-labeled cells following SE, such that the microglial cells are more closely apposed to the CCR2-labeled cells.	13804	14020
20034406	In fact, in some cases, microglial cells appeared to be engulfing the CCR2+ cells (Figure 6).	14021	14114
20034406	On the other hand, in control animals, there were less microglial cells and these cells did not exhibit an activated morphology that was seen in SE rats.	14115	14268
20034406	The decrease in the distance between CCR2+ cell and the closest microglia cell was significant in CA1, CA3, hilus, and in the ML/GCL of the dentate gyrus in SE rats when compared with control rats (p ≤ 0.001 in all regions; Figure 6).	14269	14503
20034406	In addition to the neuronal and glial characterization of CCR2 expressing cells, the double immunohistochemistry for CCR2 and ICAM-1, showed that a small population of CCR2-labeled cells were double-labeled for the endothelial cell marker ICAM-1 in SE rats (Figure 7).	14504	14772
20034406	Additionally, in the SE rats, CCR2+ cells were more frequently observed juxtaposed with endothelial cells, in the perivascular regions, relative to controls (Figure 7).	14773	14941
20034406	The results of the present study show that CCR2 and CCL2 are increased in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced seizures.	14942	15071
20034406	These data also demonstrate that seizures result in selective changes to the cell types that express CCR2.	15072	15178
20034406	Analysis of the cell types expressing CCR2 shows that SE rats had an increased density of NeuN-labeled neurons expressing CCR2, compared to control rats.	15179	15332
20034406	However, the fraction of CCR2-labeled cells that double-labeled for NeuN in control rats was almost 100%, compared to about 80% in SE rats.	15333	15472
20034406	Therefore, in addition to the increased neuronal CCR2 expression, other cell types are induced to express CCR2 following seizures.	15473	15603
20034406	It seems that GFAP-labeled astrocytes, more specifically their processes, are a major source of increased CCR2 labeling in the hippocampus following SE.	15604	15756
20034406	This data is consistent with reports of CCR2 expression by astrocytes in other conditions of neuroinflammation.	15757	15868
20034406	It is important to note that CCR2 labeling in astrocytic processes was not considered for stereological cell counts and the additional CCR2-labeled cell bodies did not appear to be astrocytes.	15869	16061
20034406	Therefore, other cell types might contribute to increased cellular expression of CCR2 after seizures.	16062	16163
20034406	Although no Iba1/CCR2 co-labeling was observed, it is possible that these cells might express CCR2 at different timepoints after injury.	16164	16300
20034406	Increased expression of CCL2 in this study is consistent with data from humans, showing elevated levels of CCL2 in tissue from patients with intractable epilepsy.	16301	16463
20034406	Functionally, increased CCL2 and CCR2 expression in the hippocampus might be a mechanism to activate and recruit inflammatory cells to this injured site after seizures.	16464	16632
20034406	It is known that that CCL2 binds to CCR2 on brain endothelial cells and contributes to increased brain endothelial permeability.	16633	16761
20034406	This increased permeability promotes the recruitment of inflammatory cells, such as monocytes and leukocytes at sites of inflammation.	16762	16896
20034406	Following pilocarpine-induced SE, it was shown that CCR2 is expressed by some endothelial and perivascular cells.	16897	17010
20034406	These cells partially account for the non-neuronal increase in cellular expression of CCR2 after SE.	17011	17111
20034406	The close relationship between activated microglia and CCR2-labeled cells in SE animals suggest that the chemokine-receptor interaction might influence the glial reactivity.	17112	17285
20034406	Since CCR2-labeled cell bodies presented neuronal morphology it is possible that the microglial activity may be related with neuronal damage following SE.	17286	17440
20034406	Through activation of CCR2, the chemokine CCL2 is able to direct the movement of astrocytes.	17441	17533
20034406	The fact that CCR2 expression by astrocytes was robustly observed in CA1 and the dentate gyrus following SE, is consistent with the idea that these regions are typically damaged after prolonged seizures.	17534	17737
20034406	The data showing CCR2 expression by hypertrophied astrocytes in the dentate gyrus following seizures is of particular interest because previous studies have shown astrocyte and microglial activation in the dentate gyrus at the same 5 day timepoint following pilocarpine-induced seizures.	17738	18025
20034406	In addition, previous studies have shown that after SE, hilar basal dendrites from immature neurons aberrantly grow along an ectopic glial scaffold into the hilus.	18026	18189
20034406	The astrocytic processes that contribute to the ectopic glial scaffold were observed to be in a similar location as the CCR2-labeled astrocytic processes in this study.	18190	18358
20034406	It is pertinent to note that the hilar basal dendrites that grow along these astrocytic processes are integrated into an aberrant circuit that may facilitate seizure activity.	18359	18534
20034406	Thus, astrocytic CCR2 may be involved in mediating neuroplastic changes to newly generated neurons and their associated astrocytes following seizures.	18535	18685
20034406	Consistent with the notion that CCR2 may play a role in adult neurogenesis are the data showing neural progenitor cells in the adult brain that express CCR2.	18686	18843
20034406	It is thought that this expression is involved in directing migration of neuronal progenitor cells to sites of neuroinflammation.	18844	18973
20034406	Interestingly, ectopic migration of newborn neurons into the hilus is another seizure-induced neuroplastic change that contributes to a hyper-excitable circuitry.	18974	19136
20034406	Thus, it is plausible that increased CCL2 and CCR2 expression in the dentate gyrus are involved in pro-epileptogenic, neurogenic alterations.	19137	19278
20034406	Future experiments using knockout mice and/or pharmacological manipulations will be needed to test this hypothesis.	19279	19394
20034406	In conclusion, this study shows increased expression of CCL2 and CCR2 in the hippocampus following seizures.	19395	19503
20034406	The results also demonstrate that CCR2 is preferentially increased in neurons and astrocytic processes after SE.	19504	19616
20034406	In light of the existing literature suggesting an inflammatory role in epileptogenesis, the data suggest that this chemokine-receptor interaction might be involved in the epileptogenic progression.	19617	19814
20034406	Future studies should examine the effect of manipulating this chemokine/receptor complex and its effect on seizures.	19815	19931
26115410	It is estimated that 10% of the worldwide disease burden is attributable to inadequate standards in drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene.	0	140
26115410	One of the largest threats to human health worldwide, particularly in rural and developing areas, is the presence of high levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in drinking water.	141	315
26115410	Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that the levels of iAs in drinking water should not exceed 10 ppb (WHO 2011), > 100 million people worldwide are believed to be exposed to levels in drinking water that exceed this limit (Uddin and Huda 2011).	316	586
26115410	Much of this exposure is attributable to the use of iAs-contaminated groundwater as a source of drinking water.	587	698
26115410	Although groundwater may be contaminated with iAs due to anthropogenic activities, it is most often contaminated due to geological leaching.	699	839
26115410	Rural areas and developing countries are often particularly impacted based on their reliance on groundwater as a source of drinking water.	840	978
26115410	In terms of affected populations, the impact of this exposure is perhaps most evident in areas of Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh and India.	979	1124
26115410	For instance, it has been estimated that 35–77 million of the 125 million inhabitants of Bangladesh may have been exposed to iAs levels in drinking water that exceed the WHO standard.	1125	1308
26115410	In addition to the situation in Southeast Asia, it is becoming increasingly clear that iAs contamination of groundwater and surface waters is a worldwide problem.	1309	1471
26115410	Inorganic As concentrations in groundwater have been detected around the globe at levels that greatly exceed the WHO standard, suggesting many more populations may be at risk.	1472	1647
26115410	Although countries such as the United States have adopted the WHO standard for limiting iAs exposure via municipally supplied water, many people in these countries, perhaps numbering in the millions, may still be exposed to relatively high levels of iAs via use of unregulated private wells supplied with groundwater.	1648	1965
26115410	Exposure for populations who generally have more moderate iAs exposure from drinking water than Southeast Asian populations also may occur through the consumption of certain foods such as rice and rice products [Cottingham et al. 2013; Davis et al. 2012; European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2009].	1966	2265
26115410	This is of particular concern to vulnerable subpopulations such as infants and young children who have increased susceptibility to toxicants and may consume relatively large proportions of rice-containing products compared with adults.	2266	2501
26115410	Numerous and varied health effects are attributed to iAs exposure in human populations, such as adverse pregnancy/birth outcomes, increased morbidity and mortality in infants and children, cognitive impairments in children, and the development of noncommunicable diseases in adults including cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and various cancers.	2502	2896
26115410	The carcinogenic impacts of chronic iAs exposure are among the best-characterized and most intensely studied effects of iAs.	2897	3021
26115410	These effects have been reported at a wide variety of iAs concentrations including relatively low concentrations observed in the United States.	3022	3165
26115410	Inorganic As is classified as a known human carcinogen that targets multiple organs including the skin, lung, urinary bladder, and liver (International Agency for Research on Cancer 2012; National Research Council 2001).	3166	3386
26115410	Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that link iAs exposure to disease has proven to be a daunting task given the complexity of disease states and multiplicity of factors that likely influence disease development.	3387	3600
26115410	Several mechanisms have been implicated in the development of iAs-associated cancers, including the generation of oxidative stress, interference with DNA repair, alterations in cellular signaling, and alterations to the genome and epigenome.	3601	3842
26115410	No single mechanism has emerged as a key event, and it is likely that iAs exerts carcinogenic effects via multiple mechanisms.	3843	3969
26115410	In the present commentary we summarize the current state of knowledge of the relationship between early-life iAs exposure and altered disease risk.	3970	4117
26115410	In particular, we highlight research needs that would best elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking early-life exposure to iAs and cancer development later in life.	4118	4284
26115410	Epigenetic reprogramming has been a major research focus in this area, and we highlight this as well as two additional and likely interacting mechanisms that may contribute to carcinogenic effects associated with early-life iAs exposure, namely the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and perturbed immune function.	4285	4604
26115410	In both exposed human populations and experimental animals, exposure to iAs during critical developmental periods has been shown to be sufficient to alter the risk of developing adverse health effects much later in life.	4605	4825
26115410	For instance, iAs has been shown to cause delayed carcinogenic effects in several strains of mice when they are exposed briefly during the prenatal period.	4826	4981
26115410	This effect was first observed in C3H mice, in which offspring born to pregnant females exposed briefly to high doses of sodium arsenite [NaAs2O3; iAs(III)] in drinking water [42.5 or 85 ppm arsenic during gestational days (GD) 8–18] resulted in increased incidence and/or multiplicity of tumors in multiple organs in both female and male adult offspring.	4982	5337
26115410	Sex-specific effects were observed, including a pronounced dose–response effect in the incidence and multiplicity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a major form of cancer associated with chronic iAs exposure in humans, in male offspring.	5338	5576
26115410	Exposure to iAs(III) prenatally as described above followed by postnatal application of tumor-promoting agents was also found to produce cancers, tumors, and/or proliferative lesions in some organs, and to have initiating effects in other organs in several strains of mice.	5577	5850
26115410	Prenatal iAs exposure is also associated with accelerated/exacerbated atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein A-knockout (ApoE–/–) mice, a mouse strain used to study atherosclerotic disease.	5851	6035
26115410	In this model, male offspring born to pregnant ApoE–/– mice administered 85 ppm iAs(III) from GD8 to birth (GD20) is associated with evidence of increased atherosclerotic disease in male offspring 10 and 16 weeks after birth compared to controls.	6036	6282
26115410	Other effects have also been reported at significantly lower doses, such as cognitive impairments in adult C57B16/J mice that were born to dams exposed to 100 μg/L iAs in drinking water from 1 week before conception until birth.	6283	6511
26115410	In epidemiologic studies with an ecological design, a defined period of iAs exposure in northern Chile revealed several similarities to the mouse studies cited above, namely that early-life exposure to iAs was associated with a variety of latent health impacts, some of which are sex dependent.	6512	6806
26115410	For instance, young adults (age 30–49 years) who experienced prenatal and/or childhood exposure via high levels of iAs in municipally supplied drinking water (average level, 860 μg/L) in the Antofagasta region of northern Chile between 1958 and 1970 had increased mortality from both cancerous and noncancerous effects, including chronic renal disease, chronic lung disease, acute myocardial infarction, and cancers of the urinary bladder, larynx, kidney, lung, and liver.	6807	7279
26115410	Although ecologic studies may be limited by a lack of individual exposure and outcome data, these findings have been supported by a case–control study in the same part of Chile with individual data linking the early life exposures with increased cancer risk in adults.	7280	7548
26115410	Taken together, these results highlight the sensitivity of early-life periods to the effects of iAs, notably at very high levels of exposure, and a major research focus in recent years has been to understand the molecular alterations that link exposure during these periods to delayed effects, particularly cancers, later in life.	7549	7879
26115410	As discussed in more detail below, analyses of tissue from target organs in C3H and ApoE–/– mice that were prenatally exposed to iAs indicated that this altered disease susceptibility was associated with persistent changes in the expression and epigenetic landscape of genes implicated in disease development.	7880	8189
26115410	These observations are consistent with theories that suggest permanent alterations or “reprogramming” of the epigenome is a critical link between toxicant exposure in early life and altered disease risk later in life (Bollati and Baccarelli 2010; Jirtle and Skinner 2007).	8190	8462
26115410	The epigenome, widely considered to include DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and microRNAs (miRNAs), plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression; therefore, epigenetic reprogramming by toxicants may alter the susceptibility to adverse health outcomes by causing persistent changes in expression patterns of genes involved in disease development.	8463	8849
26115410	Epigenetic reprogramming has been a major focus of research efforts that have set out to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the link between early-life iAs exposure and altered disease risk.	8850	9054
26115410	Epigenetic reprogramming/alterations in gene expression.	9055	9111
26115410	There are several indications in transplacental exposure models that iAs may alter disease risk in adulthood via epigenetic reprograming and altered gene expression.	9112	9277
26115410	For instance, liver tissue isolated from newborn male mice exposed to hepatocarcinogenic doses of iAs in utero had alterations in GC-rich regions throughout the genome and altered expression of genes implicated in liver tumorigenesis.	9278	9512
26115410	The expression profiles of similar disease-associated genes were also observed in HCCs and peritumorous tissue in transplacentally exposed adult male mice.	9513	9668
26115410	Of particular interest was the increased expression of estrogen receptor alpha (Er-α), which was concurrent with hypomethylation of several regions of DNA in the Er-α promoter.	9669	9845
26115410	This is of potential significance because there is often an inverse relationship between promoter methylation status and transcriptional competency.	9846	9994
26115410	In the ApoE–/– atherosclerosis model, brief prenatal exposure to 49 ppm iAs(III) in maternal drinking water was shown to alter the transcriptional profiles in the livers of male mice that were evident at postnatal day (PND) 1 and PND 70; interestingly, the altered mRNA and miRNA profiles differed between these two time points, which is consistent with reprogramming of gene expression profiles in the liver.	9995	10404
26115410	Although the mouse transplacental carcinogenesis models support an associative relationship between alterations in DNA methylation and the altered expression of key genes, it is unknown whether this relationship is causal, and the mechanisms that underlie the altered DNA methylation patterns are unknown.	10405	10710
26115410	The molecular events that cause the reprogramming of gene expression in the mouse atherosclerosis model are also unknown and must be explored.	10711	10853
26115410	In addition, the impact of other epigenetic alterations in the developmental origins of iAs-based disease has been relatively unexplored in animal models.	10854	11008
26115410	One study revealed an association in C57B16/J mice between transplacental exposure to 100 μg/L iAs in maternal drinking water, alterations in global H3K9 acetylation patterns, and cognitive impairments in adulthood, which is of potential significance because changes in histone acetylation patterns have been reported in cognitive insufficiencies.	11009	11356
26115410	These studies also highlight that epigenetic alterations may be a mechanism by which iAs may cause a variety of adverse health effects throughout the lifetime of an individual, many of which are likely unrecognized.	11357	11572
26115410	Chronic respiratory symptoms have been reported to be increased in children following early-life exposure to iAs in Bangladesh, although without evidence of reduced lung function.	11573	11752
26115410	A recent study reported that early-life exposure to iAs was associated with reduced lung function in children.	11753	11863
26115410	The results of these studies need to be confirmed, but they underscore that long latency periods are not necessarily associated with all adverse health effects associated with early-life iAs exposure.	11864	12064
26115410	A major area of focus in recent years has been the examination of alterations in gene expression and epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and miRNAs, that are associated with early-life iAs exposure in humans.	12065	12287
26115410	Many of these analyses have focused on alterations observed in cord blood leukocytes.	12288	12373
26115410	Related to prenatal iAs exposure and transcriptional change, a transcriptomics approach identified 447 iAs-responsive genes in cord blood leukocytes in newborns from Thailand (n = 32; range of maternal toenail arsenic levels in unexposed subjects, 0.10–0.38 μg/g; or exposed subjects, 0.50–68.63 μg/g).	12374	12676
26115410	Most of these genes had increased expression levels associated with iAs exposure and were enriched for roles in immune and inflammatory response, stress response, and cancer/tumorigenesis.	12677	12865
26115410	Related to epigenetic regulation of the transcriptional response, in Mexican newborns (n = 40; range of iAs in maternal drinking water = < 1 to 236 μg/L), 12 miRNAs and 334 mRNAs were identified that were correlated with arsenic levels of total urinary arsenic in maternal urine (range of U-tAs, 6.2–319.7 μg/L).	12866	13178
26115410	Functional analyses indicated the modulated miRNAs are known to be regulators of cellular responses such as inflammation and diseases with known links to iAs exposure including cancer and diabetes mellitus.	13179	13385
26115410	Nine of the modulated miRNAs were predicted to regulate the expression levels of approximately 20% of the U-tAs-associated mRNAs, providing an indication that miRNAs regulate, at least to some extent, the transcriptional response to prenatal iAs exposure.	13386	13641
26115410	Several analyses have examined iAs-associated perturbations of cord blood proteins.	13642	13725
26115410	For instance, the level of several proinflammatory cytokines in the cord blood of Bangladeshi newborns (n = 130; median U-tAs = 66 μg/L), namely interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon gamma (INF-γ), had U-shaped curves across quartiles of maternal U-tAs at gestational week 30 (GW30).	13726	14065
26115410	Using a proteomic strategy, Bailey et al. (2014) identified a total of 111 maternal U-tAs–associated cord blood proteins in Mexican newborns (n = 50; range of U-tAs, 6.2–319.7 μg/L).	14066	14248
26115410	These proteins were enriched in functions related to immune/inflammatory response and cellular development/proliferation, and the majority were predicted to be regulated by TNF, a protein that is implicated in the development of several adverse health effects associated with iAs exposure.	14249	14538
26115410	Most newborns had a positive association between the levels of proteins and U-tAs, which was consistent with a proinflammatory response.	14539	14675
26115410	However, this relationship was inverted in some newborns, underscoring an interindividual response to prenatal iAs exposure that may impact susceptibility to adverse health outcomes.	14676	14858
26115410	The basis for these interindividual differences remains unknown but may be related to iAs metabolism.	14859	14960
26115410	These studies reveal that at the mRNA, miRNA, and protein levels, genes with similar functions such as immune response are altered in the cord blood of prenatally exposed newborns across several populations.	14961	15168
26115410	As discussed below, alterations in immune function are implicated in a variety of adverse health impacts associated with early-life iAs exposure.	15169	15314
26115410	Still, a precise mechanistic relationship between these alterations and adverse health impacts remains unknown.	15315	15426
26115410	Furthermore, although leukocytes have roles in immune function, the relevance of altered gene expression profiles in leukocytes to the development/susceptibility of adverse effects in other target tissues is unclear.	15427	15643
26115410	Studies that have examined epigenetic effects associated with early-life iAs exposure have focused on changes in DNA methylation at both the gene-specific level and global level.	15644	15822
26115410	Gene-specific changes may be significant because they impart functional changes in gene expression levels.	15823	15929
26115410	Global changes in methylation status of the genome may also be important because such changes may be associated with genetic instability.	15930	16067
26115410	More recent studies have used genome-wide approaches to identify associations between iAs exposure and the methylation status of individual CpG sites, the primary target of DNA methylation in humans.	16068	16267
26115410	Sex-dependent relationships have been observed between the global DNA methylation status of cord blood leukocytes of Bangladeshi newborns (n = 101; range of iAs in maternal drinking water, 0.01–66.1 μg/L), and prenatal iAs exposure, in which this relationship was positive in newborn males and negative in newborn females.	16268	16590
26115410	In Thailand (n = 71; range of iAs in maternal drinking water, 0.18–8.38 μg/L), the methylation status of long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1) elements was used as an indicator of changes in global DNA methylation levels.	16591	16811
26115410	No associations between LINE-1 methylation and indicators of prenatal iAs exposure were observed, but this study did identify a positive relationship between in utero arsenic exposure and DNA methylation of the tumor protein 53 (TP53) promoter.	16812	17056
26115410	In iAs-exposed mother–child pairs in Bangladesh (n = 113; range of iAs in maternal drinking water, < 1 to 230 μg/L), the relationship between iAs exposure and DNA methylation patterns of LINE-1 and the TP53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A/p16) promoters were examined in maternal and umbilical cord leukocytes.	17057	17384
26115410	Similar DNA methylation patterns were observed in mothers and newborns, which included a positive association between maternal U-tAs and LINE-1 methylation and some CpG sites within the p16 promoter.	17385	17584
26115410	Evidence of a nonlinear dose–response relationship was also observed, as the most effects were observed in the middle tertiles of exposure.	17585	17724
26115410	These results raise the possibility that epigenetic effects may be observed at relatively moderate levels of exposure, and that dose–response relationships may be complex, thus underscoring the need for follow-up studies.	17725	17946
26115410	Several genome-wide analyses have identified changes in cord blood DNA methylation profiles associated with prenatal iAs exposure.	17947	18077
26115410	One study identified changes observed in New Hampshire newborns exposed to relatively low levels of iAs in utero (average iAs in maternal drinking water, 1.2 μg/L; average U-tAs, 4.1 μg/L).	18078	18267
26115410	Several DNA regions were identified in which there was a relationship between DNA methylation levels and maternal U-tAs, but no overall change in the global DNA methylation status was observed.	18268	18461
26115410	Most of these differentially methylated regions were found to be within CpG islands, the CpG-rich areas of euchromatin known to epigenetically regulate gene expression.	18462	18630
26115410	In Bangladesh (n = 127; median maternal U-tAs at GW30, 89 μg/L), an inverse correlation was observed between maternal U-tAs and the DNA methylation status of cord blood CpG sites predominantly in boys, and pathway-level analyses of differentially methylated genes revealed an overrepresentation of functions associated with cancer development in boys compared with girls.	18631	19002
26115410	Another genome-wide analysis of cord blood of prenatally exposed Bangladeshi newborns identified differential methylation within CpG regions of cord blood leukocytes in relationship to prenatal arsenic exposure.	19003	19214
26115410	Importantly, this analysis identified a positive association of DNA methylation of CpG regions within 71 genes and levels with iAs in maternal drinking water after adjusting for U-tAs–associated shifts in leukocyte populations, thus highlighting that alterations in DNA methylation profiles must be corrected for shifts in leukocyte populations that may occur due to iAs exposure.	19215	19595
26115410	To date, one genome-wide study has investigated the relationship between changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in prenatally exposed newborns.	19596	19747
26115410	In this Mexican population (n = 38; arsenic in maternal drinking water, 1–236 μg/L; mean U-tAs, 73.87 μg/L), the methylation status of CpG sites from 2,919 genes isolated from newborn cord blood was found to be associated with prenatal iAs exposure.	19748	19997
26115410	DNA methylation changes within the first exon and within 200 bp of the transcription start site yielded the most significant association with gene expression profiles.	19998	20165
26115410	In addition, a set of 7 target genes including growth-associated and diabetes-associated genes such as the imprinted gene KCNQ1 (potassium voltage–gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1) were differentially methylated, differentially expressed, and associated with birth outcomes/measures in relationship to prenatal arsenic exposure.	20166	20505
26115410	This research identified a commonality at the sequence level of the differentially methylated genes related to transcriptional factor binding.	20506	20648
26115410	This transcription factor occupancy was proposed as a basis for gene-specific DNA methylation patterning that could underlie responses to iAs and other environmental contaminants.	20649	20828
26115410	Taken together, these studies reveal several important findings: that iAs-associated alterations in DNA methylation patterns are observed across populations that are exposed to varying levels of iAs, and that complex dose–response relationships have been observed.	20829	21093
26115410	Effects may be sex-dependent and mother–child pairs have similar alteration patterns, which may have relevance to sex-dependent and interindividual susceptibility to iAs-associated disease.	21094	21283
26115410	The relevance of these alterations to long-term disease susceptibility and, to a large extent, changes in gene expression patterns at the mRNA or protein level remains unknown and must be explored.	21284	21481
26115410	As with gene expression patterns, the relevance of changes in DNA methylation patterns in blood leukocytes to disease risk in various target organs is also unknown.	21482	21646
26115410	Cancer stem cells.	21647	21665
26115410	In vitro and in vivo evidence has indicated that the emergence of CSCs after prenatal iAs exposure may play important roles in the development of some iAs-associated cancers, including those associated with prenatal iAs exposure.	21666	21895
26115410	CSCs have altered stem cell (SC) functions but retain some characteristics that are key for their survival and later development into cancers such as self-renewal, quiescence, ability to differentiate, and conditional mortality.	21896	22124
26115410	In the iAs-exposed fetus, CSCs are believed to arise from normal SCs or slightly differentiated SC progeny and remain quiescent in target organs until ultimately transforming into malignant cells.	22125	22321
26115410	Interestingly, evidence suggests that CSC overabundance is a characteristic not of all carcinogens but of at least some iAs-associated cancers; for instance, the malignant transformation of the prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 by iAs exposure in vitro resulted in an overabundance of CSCs compared with RWPE-1 cells transformed by cadmium or N-methyl-N-nitrosurea.	22322	22690
26115410	Arsenic-transformed malignant epithelial cells have also been shown to “recruit” normal SCs into a CSC phenotype, which may help explain the CSC overabundance often observed in iAs-induced tumors and iAs-transformed cell lines.	22691	22918
26115410	The triggers that end the quiescent state to produce cancers are unknown but may include the effects of continued exposure to iAs during the postnatal period or postnatal exposure to other chemicals.	22919	23118
26115410	For instance, an overabundance of CSCs was observed in the highly aggressive squamous-cell carcinomas (SSCs) that developed in Tg.AC mice after prenatally exposure to carcinogenic doses (42.5 and 85 ppm) of iAs(III) followed by postnatal application of 2 μg/0.1 mL acetone 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate to the skin for 36 weeks.	23119	23455
26115410	There is evidence that aberrant gene expression is a key, early event in the development of CSCs.	23456	23553
26115410	For instance, the fetal skin of Tg.AC mice that were prenatally exposed to iAs demonstrated increased expression of several genes associated with SC/carcinogenesis functions including the oncogene v-Ha-ras, a cell surface marker of keratinocyte SCs and cancer skin cells (CD34), and a gene involved in keratinocyte SC renewal, namely ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1).	23554	23938
26115410	Similar to results observed in fetal skin, an examination of the highly aggressive SCCs that developed in Tg.AC mice after prenatal arsenic exposure and postnatal TPA exposure also revealed high expression of v-Ha-ras and the CSC markers CD34 and Rac compared with tumors that arose after TPA treatment alone.	23939	24248
26115410	A comparison of the tumors arising from these two treatment groups showed increased expression levels of the pro-growth gene Cd1 and decreased expression of tumor suppressor p16 in the aggressive SCCs in the iAs arsenic/TPA group.	24249	24479
26115410	These data demonstrate a relationship between gene expression and the acquisition of malignant phenotype.	24480	24585
26115410	The mechanisms that link iAs exposure and changes in gene expression patterns of these key genes in CSCs remain understudied and must be addressed.	24586	24733
26115410	No alterations were shown in the DNA methylation status of the v-Ha-ras promoter concurrent with increased v-Ha-ras expression, even though v-Ha-ras expression has been shown to be controlled by promoter DNA methylation status in Tg.AC mice.	24734	24975
26115410	These results underscore that both epigenetic and non-epigenetic regulatory mechanisms must be explored as potential mechanisms of iAs-induced changes in gene expression, and that it must be taken into account that experimental outcomes depend on a variety of factors including differences in experimental design and methods used.	24976	25306
26115410	Immunomodulatory effects.	25307	25332
26115410	There is considerable evidence from in vitro studies, a range of animal models, and chronically/prenatally exposed human populations that iAs has various immunomodulatory effects.	25333	25512
26115410	Interestingly, the effects of iAs on the immune system are complex and seemingly divergent as they include evidence of both immunosuppression and inflammation, and markers of both effects have been observed simultaneously in exposed populations.	25513	25758
26115410	At the molecular level, there are several indications that the immune system is a major target of iAs toxicity as immune response is a predominant function associated with perturbed mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins in the cord blood of iAs-exposed newborns from Mexico or Thailand.	25759	26035
26115410	As discussed below, the immunosuppressive and proinflammatory effects may contribute not only to long-term health effects of iAs such as cancers but to adverse short-term health effects associated with early-life iAs exposure as well.	26036	26270
26115410	Immunosuppression is a significant health concern because of the major roles of the immune system in functions such as healing wounds and providing defense against microbial infections and cancers.	26271	26468
26115410	Indicators of immunosuppression that have been observed in prenatally exposed infants in Bangladesh include higher mortality, reduced thymic indices, reduced T-cell function, and higher morbidity rates from pneumonia and diarrhea.	26469	26699
26115410	There is evidence that more moderate levels of prenatal exposure can also affect immune response, as prenatal iAs exposure was associated with total number of infections requiring physician visit/prescription medication in infants in New Hampshire.	26700	26948
26115410	It is currently unknown whether immunosuppressive effects associated with prenatal iAs exposure persist into later life.	26949	27069
26115410	If these effects are sustained, they will likely increase the susceptibility to infections and chronic diseases including cancers that have been associated with iAs exposure.	27070	27244
26115410	There are also indicators of proinflammatory effects in prenatally exposed infants such as the increased expression of proinflammatory genes at the mRNA and protein levels in newborn cord blood, evidence of oxidative damage in the placenta, and increased expression of proinflammatory proteins in the placenta such as IL1-β, TNF, and IFN-γ.	27245	27585
26115410	As a potent producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), iAs can stimulate proinflammatory effects that not only cause macromolecule damage but also activate ROS-sensitive signaling pathways implicated in disease development such as those that involve mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB).	27586	27978
26115410	Of note, inflammation is associated with several diseases associated with iAs exposure including adverse birth/pregnancy outcomes, and a sustained inflammatory state is implicated in the development of several chronic diseases associated with iAs exposure including cancers, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and liver fibrosis.	27979	28309
26115410	Therefore, it is likely that susceptibility to early- and later-life disease development may be linked in part to the complex impacts of prenatal iAs exposure on the immune system.	28310	28490
26115410	Studies in both animal models and human populations have revealed that exposure to iAs during key developmental periods is associated with the development of latent health effects including cancers.	28491	28689
26115410	Because of the latent nature of many of the effects of iAs exposure, the actual extent of the impact of such exposure is likely underestimated.	28690	28833
26115410	Although the research relating early-life exposure to iAs and the development of long-term health effects continues to advance, many knowledge gaps remain.	28834	28989
26115410	Detailed molecular analyses in animal models that employ gene knockouts or chemical inhibition of targeted pathways are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms linking iAs exposure and adverse health effects.	28990	29203
26115410	In addition, relationships must be identified between early-life iAs exposure, molecular alterations, and short-term and long-term health impacts.	29204	29350
26115410	In many cases, it is unknown whether molecular alterations associated with iAs exposure are persistent.	29351	29454
26115410	Thus future research should help to differentiate between adaptive versus adverse alterations and may establish biomarkers of exposure and disease susceptibility.	29455	29617
26115410	It is also clear that some disease-specific mechanisms such as CSCs exist, but that others such as epigenetic reprogramming and alterations in immune function may contribute to the development of numerous adverse health impacts.	29618	29846
26115410	Studies must also continue to examine effects observed across a wide range of iAs exposure levels in different populations across the globe, which will help inform dose–response relationships, sex-dependent impacts, and cofactors contributing to disease susceptibility.	29847	30116
26115410	Taken together, the studies described here underscore that there are likely multiple mechanisms that contribute to the development of latent diseases associated with early-life iAs exposure.	30117	30307
27930654	The cilium is a conserved organelle, inferred to have existed in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) and now present in most extant protists, as well as all multicellular animals.	0	186
27930654	Motile cilia generate cell movement or fluid flow, whereas non-motile (primary) cilia have evolved as specialised ‘antennae’ that capture extracellular sensory cues and orchestrate extrinsic signal transduction pathways linked to development (e.g., Sonic hedgehog).	187	452
27930654	Cilium dysfunction in humans is associated with a growing number of so-called ciliopathies that affect virtually all physiological and developmental functions.	453	612
27930654	For example, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) includes retinal degeneration, cystic kidneys, obesity and skeletal anomalies (polydactyly) as primary ailments.	613	766
27930654	Cilia are subdivided into distinct subcompartments, each with unique structural and functional features, as well as molecular compositions.	767	906
27930654	The canonical cilium of 9 doublet microtubules (MTs) extends from a mother centriole-derived basal body, which connects via distal appendages (transition fibers) to the plasma membrane.	907	1092
27930654	The proximal-most 0.2–1.0 μm of the axoneme, called the transition zone, functions in early ciliogenesis, and together with basal body structures provides a permeability barrier that separates the ciliary cytosol and membrane from the cell body [6–8].	1093	1344
27930654	Additional subregions include the inversin and distal tip compartments, as well as the ciliary pocket, which is a depression of the periciliary membrane where the basal body is rooted.	1345	1529
27930654	Many ciliopathy proteins and associated complexes localise to particular ciliary subcompartments, where they conduct subdomain-specific functions.	1530	1676
27930654	Cilia rely on various intracellular transport systems to sort and deliver the protein cargo required for cilium formation, maintenance and function.	1677	1825
27930654	The best understood is intraflagellar transport (IFT), which consists of large macro-molecular assemblies that move bidirectionally between the ciliary base and tip, driven by kinesin-2 anterograde (base to tip) and IFT-dynein retrograde (tip to base) motors [11–13].	1826	2093
27930654	Associated with the motors—and essential for IFT—are the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes, which likely serve as cargo adaptors.	2094	2215
27930654	The IFT-associated BBS complex (BBSome) also tethers ciliary cargo and regulates the coupling of IFT-A and IFT-B complexes.	2216	2339
27930654	Also important are membrane trafficking pathways that regulate vesicle formation and transport between post-Golgi sorting stations and the periciliary membrane, as well as endocytic retrieval and recycling events at the periciliary membrane and within the ciliary pocket [15–19].	2340	2619
27930654	Various IFT and ciliary membrane trafficking regulators have been identified, including small GTPases of the RAB, ARF and ARL families, that function during early cilium formation as well as transport events post-ciliogenesis.	2620	2846
27930654	Given the multifaceted roles of cilia, together with its prevalent disease association, there have been major efforts to identify the ‘ciliome’, or complete molecular parts list of cilia, using a wide range of cell types and organisms [22–24].	2847	3090
27930654	Approaches have included comparative genomics of ciliated versus non-ciliated species, identification of binding sites for the ciliogenic transcription factors DAF-19/RFX or FOXJ1 [26–31], expression analyses involving microarray, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and RNA-Seq [25,28,32–37], as well as proteomics [38–41].	3091	3421
27930654	Data from such studies are compiled in the online ciliary database, Cildb.	3422	3496
27930654	Whilst the studies have contributed immensely to understanding cilia biology, each approach has limitations and additional ciliary components almost certainly remain unidentified.	3497	3676
27930654	C. elegans represents a powerful genetic model for investigating cilium formation and function.	3677	3772
27930654	Hermaphrodite worms possess 60 ciliated cells (of 960 total), all of which are sensory neurons.	3773	3868
27930654	The non-motile sensory cilia extend from the dendritic tips and many are contained within bilateral chemo- and thermo-sensory cuticular organs, supported by glial cell (sheath and socket) processes that establish environmentally exposed channels [42–44].	3869	4123
27930654	C. elegans cilium morphologies range from the canonical rod-like to forked, multi-branched and membrane-expanded structures.	4124	4248
27930654	Worm cilia also possess ultrastructural features conserved in vertebrate/mammalian cilia; for example, amphid (head) and phasmid (tail) channel cilia possess long A-tubule extensions that establish a proximal axonemal region or ‘middle segment’ of 9 outer doublet MTs and a ‘distal segment’ of 9 outer singlet MTs.	4249	4563
27930654	Because many ciliary genes and pathways are conserved in nematodes, and complete loss of cilia is non-lethal, C. elegans has been a leading metazoan model for discovering new ciliary genes and uncovering new insight into ciliary transport, function and disease mechanisms.	4564	4836
27930654	In this study, we identified a unique expression profile for ciliary genes using a series of RNA-Seq libraries generated specifically to improve annotation of the transcriptome [45–47].	4837	5022
27930654	We confirmed that our clustering analysis identifies known ciliary proteins, including several not previously studied in C. elegans, and uncovers novel conserved ciliary proteins.	5023	5202
27930654	One of these proteins is RAB-28, which is expressed exclusively in ciliated cells, where it associates with the periciliary membrane and behaves as an IFT cargo via BBSome- and nucleotide binding-dependent mechanisms.	5203	5420
27930654	Overexpression of predicted active or inactive forms of RAB-28 leads to variant-specific ciliary and cell non-autonomous sensory pore morphogenesis defects.	5421	5577
27930654	Together, our work provides a novel approach to finding new ciliary proteins, and uncovers a functional association between the BBSome, IFT and the orthologue of the cone-rod dystrophy protein, RAB28.	5578	5778
27930654	To provide a complementary approach to ciliary gene discovery, we took advantage of the temporally-invariant birth of all C. elegans cells and tissues, including ciliated neurons, during development (Fig 1A).	5779	5987
27930654	Nearly all of the 60 ciliated neuronal cell types in C. elegans hermaphrodites are born within a discrete embryonic time period 300–450 minutes post-fertilisation, with cilium formation occurring very shortly thereafter (Fig 1A).	5988	6217
27930654	We hypothesised that ciliogenesis genes are highly expressed during this time period and therefore distinguishable from genes required for general neuronal formation and development, which are expressed during a broader time window (Fig 1A).	6218	6459
27930654	Using an available whole-organism developmental series of RNA-seq libraries from C. elegans [45–47], we confirmed this hypothesis: many well-characterised cilia genes are highly expressed in the early embryo, display peak expression in the late embryo and first larval stage, and show greatly reduced expression during subsequent developmental stages (Fig 1B).	6460	6820
27930654	Next we sought to identify novel ciliary/ciliogenic genes displaying a similar cilia-related expression pattern.	6821	6933
27930654	Using a set of 41 well-characterised ciliary component genes as “baits”, representing the cilia-related gene expression profile during development (sheet 1 in S1 Table), we queried our ciliary transcriptome to identify other gene “preys” with similar expression profiles across the RNA-Seq libraries (Fig 1B and sheet 2 in S1 Table).	6934	7267
27930654	Hierarchical clustering of genes based on temporal expression reveals a tight cluster of 34 of the bait genes with 151 prey genes (cluster 1), many of which are uncharacterised (S1 Fig and sheet 3 in S1 Table).	7268	7478
27930654	We also filtered the gene list to only include those with human orthologues.	7479	7555
27930654	To validate our dataset, we determined if filtered cluster 1 is enriched for genes with >12 hits in the ciliary database Cildb (sheets 3 and 4 in S1 Table).	7556	7712
27930654	We found that conserved Cildb-represented genes are significantly enriched (84.5 fold) in filtered cluster 1 compared to the entire genome (p<0.0001, chi-squared test; sheet 4 in S1 Table).	7713	7902
27930654	We further compared the cluster 1 gene set to two previous expression studies and see significant overlap between lists (p<0.0001; sheet 4 in S1 Table).	7903	8055
27930654	Because our genes were identified by shared temporal gene expression, we reasoned that they may share common promoter regulatory elements beyond the previously identified X-box motif and so we performed a motif discovery analysis on the conserved genes in cluster 1 (sheet 3 in S1 Table).	8056	8344
27930654	Not surprisingly, we find several motifs that are significantly enriched, including matches to the GAGA factor binding site (S2 Fig).	8345	8478
27930654	As might be expected, the 14-bp X-box was not identified by the motif elucidation program despite its enrichment in our dataset (sheet 4 in S1 Table), likely due to the number of degenerate bases in its consensus sequence and because the program identifies motifs only up to 8-bp long [26–28,51].	8479	8775
27930654	None of the elements we identified have been previously associated with cilia gene expression.	8776	8870
27930654	We observed that chemoreceptors (G protein-coupled receptors or GPCRs), many of which are known to be cilium-localised, are largely absent from our ciliary dataset (sheet 3 in S1 Table).	8871	9057
27930654	We hypothesised that such genes might be transcribed post-ciliogenesis.	9058	9129
27930654	Using a statistical predictive modelling strategy similar to that used above, we identified 80 genes sharing the expression profile of srg-36, a cilium-localised dauer pheromone receptor required for entry into the dauer larval diapause life stage (Fig 1C and sheet 5 in S1 Table).	9130	9411
27930654	Of the 80 genes, 27 are serpentine transmembrane receptors, representing a significant 7-fold enrichment over all such genes in the genome (p<0.0001, chi-squared test).	9412	9580
27930654	Analysis of the upstream regulatory regions revealed that 25 of the 28 chemoreceptor genes (including srg-36) possess an E-box regulatory element (S3 Fig).	9581	9736
27930654	This suggests that their similar temporal expression profiles stem from regulation by the same, or similar, transcription factors such as the E-box-binding Basic Helix-Loop-Helix bHLH transcription factor.	9737	9942
27930654	Interestingly, 4 of the predicted serpentine receptors, including srg-36, are known to be expressed in ciliated sensory neurons.	9943	10071
27930654	We note that the rise and fall of chemosensory/GPCR gene expression trails that of the cilia-related genes (Fig 1C), indicating that these two expression profiles of related developmental processes are temporally discrete.	10072	10294
27930654	To confirm that our predictive expression profiling model identifies novel ciliary proteins in C. elegans, we used GFP reporters to investigate the cell and tissue expression patterns, and subcellular protein localisations, of seven previously uncharacterised C. elegans proteins from filtered cluster 1, namely FAM-161 (Y38H6C.14), CCDC-104 (Y108G3Al.3), RPI-1 (W07G1.5), RAB-28 (Y11D7A.4), CCDC-149 (F29G6.2), MAPH-9 (C34D4.1) and YAP-1 (F13E6.4).	10295	10744
27930654	These were chosen because at the onset of this study there was little or no published evidence of ciliary associations for most of these proteins in any system.	10745	10905
27930654	Specifically, we made transcriptional ‘promoter fusion’ reporters (endogenous gene promoter fused to GFP) for CCDC-104, CCDC-149 and RAB-28, and translational ‘protein fusion’ reporters (endogenous gene promoter + genomic exon/intron or cDNA sequence fused to GFP) for all 7 candidates.	10906	11192
27930654	The only exception was the YAP-1 translational reporter, where the bbs-8 gene promoter active only in ciliated cells was used because of the widespread expression of YAP-1 in multiple tissues and cell types.	11193	11400
27930654	We also made a second RAB-28 translational reporter driven by the bbs-8 gene promoter.	11401	11487
27930654	All reporters employing the endogenous gene promoter show enriched or almost exclusive expression within ciliated cells (S4A Fig), thus validating the predictions from our coexpression profiling.	11488	11683
27930654	Specifically, maph-9, rpi-1, ccdc-104, rab-28, and fam-161 are exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons, with ccdc-149 expressed in most ciliated neurons as well as pharyngeal neurons, touch receptor neurons, and motor neurons as previously reported (Figs 2 and S4A).	11684	11952
27930654	Furthermore, the translational reporters reveal that all 7 proteins localise at the base of, or within, cilia (Fig 2 and Fig 3A).	11953	12082
27930654	FAM-161::GFP signals are found at the ciliary base and within the proximal part of the ciliary axoneme, including the transition zone (TZ) (Fig 2).	12083	12230
27930654	This localisation is similar to that of the mammalian protein implicated in retinitis pigmentosa, and is consistent with the suggested role of FAM161b in cargo delivery to photoreceptor outer segments (cilia).	12231	12440
27930654	Both GFP reporters for RAB-28 (driven by bbs-8 gene or endogenous promoter), the orthologue of the small ciliary GTPase RAB28 linked to human autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy [62–64], localise along the entire cilium.	12441	12664
27930654	(Fig 2 and Fig 3A).	12063	12082
27930654	Ciliary axoneme localisations are also observed for the GFP-tagged RPI-1, MAPH-9, YAP-1 and CCDC-104 translational reporters; in contrast, CCDC-149::GFP is absent from the ciliary axoneme, although a pool of signal is evident at the ciliary base (Fig 2).	12685	12939
27930654	The ciliary localisation of CCDC-104::GFP is consistent with the mammalian ciliary base and axonemal localisations reported for the ARL3 interacting protein, CCDC104/BARTL1.	12940	13113
27930654	We also found that RPI-1::GFP appears to localise to ciliary and cytoplasmic microtubules, similar to its mammalian orthologue (RP1) implicated in retinitis pigmentosa (Fig 2).	13114	13290
27930654	Our finding of ciliary localisations for YAP-1, MAPH-9 and CCDC-149 are the first in any cellular system or organism, and is consistent with a known ciliogenesis role for mammalian YAP, and cilia-related phenotypes in MAP9 (MAPH9 orthologue)-disrupted zebrafish and dachshunds [67–70].	13291	13576
27930654	YAP is regulated by the ciliary protein NPHP4, and MAP9 is phosphorylated by the cilia-disassembly/centrosomal kinase PLK1.	13577	13700
27930654	We also examined genes excluded from filtered cluster 1 due to a reported lack of predicted human orthologues (according to the Ortholist database;).	13701	13850
27930654	Highly ranked in unfiltered cluster 1 is an uncharacterised gene with an X-box promoter element, tza-3, which we demonstrate is expressed exclusively in ciliated neurons, and encodes a ciliary TZ protein (S4B Fig).	13851	14065
27930654	Whilst TZA-3 is not conserved, the TZ localisation of this predicted transmembrane protein depends on the highly conserved core TZ scaffolding protein MKS-5 and “MKS module” components MKSR-1 and MKSR-2, but not the “NPHP module” protein NPHP-4 (S4B Fig).	14066	14321
27930654	These findings are consistent with TZA-3 associating with the MKS module, which plays a role in ciliary gating [6–8].	14322	14439
27930654	Thus, our expression profiling approach identifies non-conserved ciliary proteins in addition to conserved ciliary proteins.	14440	14564
27930654	Of the novel C. elegans ciliary proteins we identified, we sought to characterise RAB-28 further for the following reasons: (1) human RAB28 is associated with a possible ciliopathy (cone-rod dystrophy), (2) many small GTPases play essential roles in ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane trafficking pathways, and (3) aside from reports of RAB28 localising at the basal body or the cilium, there is a complete absence of molecular studies on this evolutionarily conserved protein that support a functional and mechanistic link to cilia.	14565	15097
27930654	We further investigated the ciliary localisation of GFP::RAB-28 using time-lapse imaging and found that this GTPase undergoes continuous, bidirectional, IFT-like movement along ciliary axonemes (S1 Movie).	15098	15303
27930654	In contrast, the additional non-ciliary GFP::RAB-28 signals present throughout the neurons are diffuse, with no processive movement detected.	15304	15445
27930654	In C. elegans amphid and phasmid cilia, anterograde IFT is driven by two kinesin-2 motors (kinesin-II and OSM-3) to yield distinct anterograde rates along the middle and distal segments.	15446	15632
27930654	Kymograph analysis of phasmid (tail) cilia confirm that ciliary GFP::RAB-28 moves at IFT-associated velocities, displaying characteristic average anterograde rates of ~0.7 μm/sec (middle segment; proximal part of axoneme) and ~1.2 μm/sec (distal segment; distal part of axoneme), and retrograde rates of ~1.4 μm/sec (along entire cilium length) (Fig 3A and 3B and S1 Movie).	15633	16007
27930654	To examine if this ciliary trafficking is truly associated with IFT, we examined GFP::RAB-28 in worms with disrupted CHE-11 (IFT140), which is a component of IFT-A essential for IFT.	16008	16190
27930654	Although GFP::RAB-28 is observed within the truncated cilia of che-11 mutants, we could not detect processive movement of the GFP signals, indicating that the trafficking behaviour of RAB-28 within cilia is bona fide IFT (Fig 3A and S1 Movie).	16191	16434
27930654	In contrast to observations for other IFT-associated proteins in IFT deficient-worms, GFP::RAB-28 does not abnormally accumulate at the ciliary base or tip, or along the axoneme of these animals (Fig 3A).	16435	16639
27930654	This lack of accumulation, despite the active transport defect, suggests that our GFP::RAB-28 reporter also freely diffuses within (and between) the ciliary and dendritic compartments, in addition to undergoing IFT.	16640	16855
27930654	We confirmed this hypothesis using a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay in wild type and che-11 mutant worms, which show that GFP::RAB-28 is highly mobile, displaying very rapid exchange kinetics between ciliary and dendritic pools (Fig 3C).	16856	17111
27930654	Thus, in addition to active transport via IFT, GFP::RAB-28 undergoes IFT-independent free diffusion, which explains why this reporter does not abnormally accumulate within che-11 mutant cilia.	17112	17304
27930654	To determine if RAB-28 is required for IFT, we examined ciliary structure, function and protein transport in worms containing a deletion (gk1040) in rab-28.	17305	17461
27930654	The gk1040 mutation removes the GTP-binding switch II domain and the farnesylated C-terminal CAAX motif (S5A Fig), both of which are critical for RAB protein function; thus, gk1040 is likely a severe loss-of-function or null allele.	17462	17694
27930654	We outcrossed the gk1040 background at least 3 times with wild type worms to remove background mutations unlinked to gk1040.	17695	17819
27930654	We find that ciliated amphid and phasmid sensory neurons in rab-28 mutant worms display a normal dye filling response, which suggests that ciliary structures are intact (short cilia usually abrogate dye uptake due to lack of environmental exposure) (S5B Fig).	17820	18079
27930654	Localisation of an IFT protein, OSM-6 (IFT52 orthologue), throughout normal-length cilia confirms this finding (S5C Fig).	18080	18201
27930654	In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses reveal that ciliary ultrastructures appear normal in rab-28 mutants (S5D Fig).	18202	18341
27930654	Furthermore, these worms are normal for cilia-related sensory behaviours (S5E Fig), as well as cilium-dependent carbon dioxide avoidance and development (body size) (S5F Fig) [78–80].	18342	18525
27930654	Finally, the localisation (and movement) of BBSome (BBS-5), IFT-A/B and various ciliary membrane proteins is also grossly normal in rab-28 mutants (S5G Fig).	18526	18683
27930654	Thus, unlike the disruption of IFT proteins, loss of RAB-28 does not affect ciliary structure, transport, or function, at least for those proteins and cilia that were analysed.	18684	18860
27930654	We conclude, therefore, that RAB-28 behaves more like an IFT cargo, or peripherally-associated component of IFT complexes, rather than a central component of the machinery required for bidirectional movement (IFT).	18861	19075
27930654	Next, we assessed the requirements of GDP and GTP nucleotide binding for RAB-28 localisation and transport.	19076	19183
27930654	We made GFP-tagged constructs containing T49N or Q95L mutations in RAB-28, which are predicted to trap the GTPase in GDP (inactive) or GTP (active)-locked states, respectively.	19184	19360
27930654	These constructs were injected into wild type worms at the same concentration (5 ng/μl) as the GFP::RAB-28(WT) construct described above (Fig 3), and all appear to be expressed at similar levels.	19361	19556
27930654	Like the RAB-28(WT) reporter, RAB-28(T49N) (hereafter termed RAB-28(GDP)) displays diffuse localisation throughout the entire neuron, including the cilium and its associated periciliary membrane compartment (PCMC) (Fig 4A).	19557	19780
27930654	However, unlike wild type RAB-28, RAB-28(GDP) fails to undergo detectable IFT, indicating a highly reduced ability to associate with IFT trains (Fig 4A and S1 Movie).	19781	19947
27930654	In contrast, the localisation of the RAB-28(Q95L) (hereafter termed RAB-28(GTP)) is highly enriched at the PCMC compared with the rest of the cell, forming a ‘tunnel-like’ localisation indicative of association with the periciliary membrane (Fig 4A).	19948	20198
27930654	RAB-28(GTP) also undergoes clearly detectable IFT, albeit at an apparently reduced frequency compared to the wild type reporter (Fig 4A and S1 Movie).	20199	20349
27930654	Notably, the localisation and IFT behaviour of all three GFP::RAB-28 reporters (WT, GDP-locked, GTP-locked) is not altered when expressed in the rab-28(gk1040) null background (S6 Fig), indicating that endogenous RAB-28 does not affect the distribution and transport behaviour of the RAB-28 markers.	20350	20649
27930654	Furthermore, transgenic worms expressing GFP::RAB-28(GTP) at a very low level (injected at 0.5 ng/μl; oqEx304) is exclusively localised at the periciliary membrane and undergoes IFT (S7 Fig and S2 Movie), thus confirming our observations with the higher expressing marker, and indicating that the periciliary membrane is the primary site of activated RAB-28 function in nematode sensory neurons (Fig 4A).	20650	21054
27930654	Taken together, these data show that GTP binding targets RAB-28 to the periciliary membrane and facilitates its association with IFT trains.	21055	21195
27930654	These observations for C. elegans RAB-28 are reminiscent of those for mammalian RAB8, whose ciliary targeting also depends on GDP-GTP exchange, via a mechanism involving RABIN8 (RAB8 guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and BBSome functions at the base of cilia [82–84].	21196	21465
27930654	We therefore examined the localisation and transport behaviour of all three GFP-tagged RAB-28 reporters (WT, GDP-locked and GTP-locked) in a likely null allele (nx77) of a C. elegans BBSome gene orthologue, bbs-8.	21466	21679
27930654	The bbs-8(nx77) mutation does not alter the ciliary targeting and distributions of RAB-28(WT) and RAB-28(GDP) compared to a wild type background (Fig 4B).	21680	21834
27930654	In contrast, BBS-8 loss has a striking effect on both of our RAB-28(GTP) reporters, preventing their accumulation at periciliary membranes (Fig 4B and S7 Fig).	21835	21994
27930654	Furthermore, the IFT movement of RAB-28(WT) and RAB-28(GTP) is abolished in bbs-8 mutant cilia (Fig 4B and S1 Movie).	21995	22112
27930654	From these data, we conclude that the IFT-associated BBSome is required for targeting activated RAB-28 (GTP-locked) to periciliary membranes and loading onto IFT trains.	22113	22282
27930654	The differences in localisation and IFT behaviour between the constitutively inactive (GDP-locked) and active (GTP-locked) forms of RAB-28 prompted us to investigate cilium structure and function in worms overexpressing these small GTPase variants.	22283	22531
27930654	Assessment of dye-filling reveals reduced levels of dye uptake in the amphid neurons of wild type worms expressing RAB-28(GTP), compared to normal dye-filling for wild type worms expressing RAB-28(WT) or RAB-28(GDP) (Fig 5A).	22532	22757
27930654	Similar dye-filling results were obtained when these variants were expressed in rab-28(gk1040) worms, although worms expressing RAB-28(GDP) may display a very weakly penetrant phenotypic defect (S8A Fig).	22758	22962
27930654	Despite the distinct dye-filling phenotypes, worms expressing RAB-28(GTP) or RAB-28(GDP) both show a reduced roaming behaviour (Fig 5B), suggestive of cilia-related sensory abnormalities.	22963	23150
27930654	To investigate the structural basis of these defects, we examined amphid pore ultrastructure in wild type (N2) worms expressing GFP-tagged RAB-28(GTP) or RAB-28(GDP).	23151	23317
27930654	Somewhat surprisingly, despite the dye uptake phenotype, RAB-28(GTP)-expressing amphid channel cilia are of normal length and morphology, with intact middle and distal segments, as well as TZ compartments (Fig 5C).	23318	23532
27930654	However, an increased number of ciliary axonemes possess B-tubule seam breaks (‘unzipped’ microtubules), indicative of incomplete protofilament formation (S8B Fig).	23533	23697
27930654	A more striking phenotype is that the proximal region of the sheath cell-defined amphid channel is greatly enlarged, and the ciliary axonemes are less tightly bundled (Fig 5C).	23698	23874
27930654	Also, the channels of RAB-28(GTP) expressing worms display reduced electron densities, potentially indicating abnormally low concentrations of matrix material, which is thought to be secreted by the sheath cell (Fig 5C).	23875	24095
27930654	In contrast, although the amphid channel in RAB-28(GDP)-expressing worms is not expanded, these worms exhibit a number of abnormally large dense matrix-filled vesicles (MFVs) in the sheath, in that portion of the cell surrounding the channel (Fig 5C).	24096	24347
27930654	Such electron dense vesicles are not found in the channel region of the amphid sheath cell of wild type (N2), rab-8(gk1040) or RAB-28(GTP) overexpressing worms (Fig 5C), indicating this phenotype is specific to RAB-28(GDP) overexpression.	24348	24586
27930654	A second phenotype unique to RAB-28(GDP)-expressing worms is that one channel axoneme is missing from the amphid pore, and instead lies adjacent to the channel, embedded in the sheath (Fig 5C).	24587	24780
27930654	Together, these findings indicate that overexpression of constitutively active or inactive RAB-28 cause variant-specific defects in the amphid sheath (enlarged channel; dense MFV accumulation) and ciliated cells (dye-filling defect; misplaced amphid channel axoneme), although shared phenotypes are also observed (roaming defect).	24781	25111
27930654	The sheath cell phenotypes likely represent a cell non-autonomous function because our transcriptional reporter for RAB-28 (GFP under the control of the rab-28 promoter) is not expressed in the sheath cell (S9 Fig).	25112	25327
27930654	Thus, we conclude from these overexpression data that RAB-28 serves ciliated cell autonomous and sheath cell non-autonomous roles in sensory pore formation and function.	25328	25497
27930654	In this study, we identified a specific C. elegans ciliary gene expression profile using a set of RNA-Seq libraries, originally produced to annotate the transcriptome, that together provide a temporal landscape of whole-organism gene expression [45–47].	25498	25751
27930654	A major advantage of C. elegans as a model for ciliary biology is that ciliogenesis occurs during a temporally discrete window of embryonic development (Fig 1), making it well suited for this type of temporal gene expression analysis.	25752	25986
27930654	The expression profile for known cilia genes peaks at the onset of ciliogenesis and decreases post-ciliogenesis, likely to levels adequate to maintain cilium structure.	25987	26155
27930654	Using this pattern, we uncover new ciliary associations for several conserved, but poorly characterised proteins, including the orthologues of YAP, MAP9 and CCDC149.	26156	26321
27930654	The ciliary localisation of MAPH-9 (microtubule-associated protein 9) is consistent with a known functional association between MAP9 and the centrosomal regulatory kinase PLK1, the centrosomal localisation and suggested ciliary functions for MAP9 in zebrafish, and a role for MAP9 as a modifier of retinal degeneration in Dachshunds.	26322	26655
27930654	YAP also has previous links to cilia, including a role in ciliogenesis as well as being regulated by the ciliary gate protein, NPHP4.	26656	26789
27930654	Although we do not understand the exact ciliary functions of MAP9 and YAP, their suggested roles in other contexts include regulation of ciliary microtubules (MAP9) and cilium-based signalling (YAP) [67–72].	26790	26997
27930654	Since 64 of the 185 genes in our predicted list of ciliary genes (cluster 1) possess known ciliary associations, we are confident that additional cilia-related components can be uncovered from this dataset.	26998	27204
27930654	One of the highest ranked hits in our candidate list of ciliary genes is RAB-28, a small GTPase whose human counterpart is linked to autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy and vision impairment.	27205	27399
27930654	Although recent studies show that mammalian RAB28 is localised to the mammalian photoreceptor basal body and cilium, its role in photoreceptors and in other tissues and organisms remains unknown.	27400	27595
27930654	Here, we show that C. elegans RAB-28 is specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons, and undergoes IFT.	27596	27706
27930654	RAB-28 IFT association depends on its GTPase activity; whereas the GDP-locked inactive form localises diffusely with little or no observable IFT, the GTP-locked active form concentrates almost exclusively at the periciliary membrane and undergoes IFT.	27707	27958
27930654	Moreover, the periciliary membrane association and IFT behaviour of active RAB-28 depends on the BBSome, which functions as an IFT cargo-adaptor.	27959	28104
27930654	We conclude that C. elegans BBSome complexes recruit activated RAB-28 to the periciliary membrane, and regulate docking to IFT trains (Fig 6).	28105	28247
27930654	Our findings also demonstrate that RAB-28 is probably not a ‘core’ component of the BBSome or IFT particles, since ciliary structures, as well as BBSome and IFT-subcomplex A/B protein localisations, are unaffected in rab-28 mutant worms.	28248	28485
27930654	Instead, RAB-28 may associate with these complexes as part of a ‘peripheral’ submodule, performing auxiliary functions unrelated to ciliogenesis, such as those described for metazoan IFT27 (Rab-like 4; RABL4), ARL6 (BBS3) and RAB8, whose ciliary targeting or removal also depend on GTP binding and the BBSome (ARL6, RAB8) [86–89].	28486	28816
27930654	Consistent with a non-essential global requirement for ciliogenesis, IFT and BBSome integrity, patients carrying predicted strong loss-of-function or possibly null alleles in RAB28 do not present with wider ciliopathy symptoms beyond cone-rod dystrophy.	28817	29070
27930654	Another revealing observation from our work is that overexpression of constitutively active (GTP-locked) or inactive (GDP-locked) RAB-28 cause variant-specific defects in the non-ciliated amphid sheath cell that supports the ciliated endings of amphid neurons.	29071	29331
27930654	Specifically, RAB-28(GTP) overexpression causes an enlargement of the sheath cell-defined portion of the amphid sensory pore, whereas RAB-28(GDP) overexpression causes the accumulation of abnormally dense matrix-filled vesicles (MFVs) in the sheath cell.	29332	29586
27930654	The RAB-28 variant constructs, as well as the RAB-28(WT) construct, are expressed at similar levels, using the same promoter sequence; thus, the observed variant-specific phenotypes are not likely due to differences in expression level, but instead are linked to the nucleotide bound state of RAB-28.	29587	29887
27930654	Most interestingly, the abnormal sheath cell phenotypes appear to reflect a cell-non autonomous effect because RAB-28 is expressed in ciliated sensory neurons, and not in the amphid sheath cell (S9 Fig).	29888	30091
27930654	In C. elegans, the amphid channel is fashioned from glial cell (sheath and socket) processes which extend to the nose tip in close proximity to the dendritic processes of the ciliated sensory neurons.	30092	30292
27930654	The proximal part of the channel forms from a hole in the sheath process which the channel cilia fully penetrate, whereas the distal part of the channel derives from a doughnut-shaped ending of the socket process that fuses with the cuticle and the underlying sheath (Fig 5C).	30293	30569
27930654	The formation and function of neurons and glia in the amphid pore appear tightly linked, with channel morphogenesis thought to depend on signals from both cell types.	30570	30736
27930654	It is also suggested that amphid channel size is regulated via a balance of ‘exocytic’ membrane delivery via MFVs (increases channel size) and ‘endocytic’ membrane retrieval (reduces channel size) at the sheath cell plasma membrane.	30737	30969
27930654	By integrating this model with our findings, we hypothesise that constitutively active RAB-28 may enhance MFV delivery to the sheath cell membrane, leading to an enlarged channel, whereas constitutively inactive RAB-28 blocks MFV delivery and results in abnormally dense MFVs in the sheath.	30970	31260
27930654	One prediction of this model is that expression of constitutively inactive RAB-28 would reduce amphid channel size, and consistent with this idea, one channel axoneme fails to enter the amphid pore of RAB-28(GDP) expressing worms.	31261	31491
27930654	How RAB-28 expressed in ciliated amphid neurons might control morphogenesis events in the supporting non-ciliated sheath cell is unclear.	31492	31629
27930654	One scenario is that RAB-28 regulates extracellular release of neuronal factors purported to signal to the sheath cell during channel morphogenesis in the embryo [42–44] (Fig 6).	31630	31808
27930654	In support of this notion, activated RAB-28 is almost exclusively concentrated at the periciliary membrane, which is the site of ectosome release in certain nematode sensory neurons; also, RAB-28 expression is elevated in nematode ectosome-releasing cells.	31809	32065
27930654	Future work will be required to investigate possible roles for RAB-28 in cilia-related ectosome release, and to identify sheath cell morphogenic factors released by the ciliated neurons.	32066	32252
27930654	A surprising observation is that sensory pore structure and function appears grossly normal in the rab-28 deletion mutant, which is likely a null allele.	32253	32406
27930654	This indicates that other genes or pathways can compensate for rab-28 loss-of-function, but that the phenotypic effects of the overexpressed dominant active and inactive RAB-28 variants are more severe and cannot be as easily compensated.	32407	32645
27930654	One possibility is that the cilium structure, and cilium-dependent behavioural phenotypes in worms overexpressing RAB-28(GTP) and/or RAB-28(GDP) derive from excessive activation of downstream effectors or possibly aberrant sequestration of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) or GDP-GTP exchange proteins (GEFs) common to RAB-28 and other ciliary GTPases.	32646	32999
27930654	To fully decipher the mechanistic basis of the RAB-28 gain vs loss of function phenotypes, and the physiological relevance of our findings, future efforts should include an examination of worms expressing RAB-28 variants expressed at endogenous or near-endogenous levels and the identification of currently unknown regulators of RAB-28 (GEF and GAP proteins).	33000	33359
27930654	Given the close sequence similarity between RAB28 and IFT27, and some of their common functional properties discussed below, we suggest that these two RAB GTPases may have similar or partially overlapping ciliary functions.	33360	33583
27930654	RAB28 is conserved across metazoans and many ciliated protists (S10 Fig), and inferred to be one of 23 founding RAB family members present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA).	33584	33769
27930654	Phylogenetically, RAB28 is most closely related to IFT27 (RABL4), which likely also existed in LECA and is dispersed throughout the eukaryotic lineage (S10 Fig).	33770	33931
27930654	Like the majority of ciliary and IFT components, both RAB28 and IFT27 are restricted to organisms that have cilia (S10 Fig).	33932	34056
27930654	Interestingly, although RAB28 and IFT27 are present in most metazoans and many protists (e.g., Chlamydomonas and Trypanosoma have both), neither protein appears to be present in Drosophila and IFT27 is missing from C. elegans (S10 Fig).	34057	34293
27930654	RAB28 and IFT27 appear to share overlapping functional properties.	34294	34360
27930654	As we show for nematode RAB-28, Trypanosome and mammalian IFT27 associate with IFT in a GTP-dependent manner.	34361	34470
27930654	Also, cilium formation is unaffected in mammalian cells with null mutations in IFT27 (similar to C. elegans rab-28 mutants), although disruption of IFT27 in protists results in short flagella.	34471	34663
27930654	In addition, mutations in IFT27 cause BBS, displaying a broad spectrum of ciliopathy phenotypes, including the cardinal retinal degeneration phenotype observed in RAB28 patients.	34664	34842
27930654	Furthermore, both small GTPases are functionally associated with the BBSome, albeit in different ways.	34843	34945
27930654	The localisation and IFT motility of nematode RAB-28 is BBSome-dependent, but not vice versa (i.e., BBS-5 localisation is normal in rab-28 mutants), whereas mammalian IFT27 regulates BBSome assembly and removal from the cilium.	34946	35173
27930654	When taken together, the above observations could suggest that in vertebrates RAB28 and IFT27 function at distinct steps of a common pathway, potentially ‘upstream’ (IFT27) and ‘downstream’ (RAB-28) of the BBSome.	35174	35387
27930654	Since IFT27 and the BBSome remove proteins from cilia, RAB28 may perform a similar function by facilitating the BBSome-mediated removal of a more-restricted set of cargo.	35388	35558
27930654	In further support of a common, yet tissue-specific, transport role for related ciliary GTPases such as IFT27 and RAB28, it is noteworthy that disruption of the short ARL6/BBS3 isoform in mice and zebrafish results in broad spectrum BBS-related phenotypes, whereas disruption of the long isoform causes a retina-specific phenotype.	35559	35890
27930654	Transition zone-localised RPGRIP1 and RPGRIP1L represent additional examples of very closely related ciliopathy proteins linked to a broad tissue pathogenesis (RPGRIP1L), versus a retinal-specific disease (RPGRIP1) [101–104].	35891	36116
27930654	Finally, whereas IFT27 is known to regulate the ciliary localisation of sonic hedgehog proteins, the identity of RAB28-associated cargoes is currently unknown.	36117	36276
27930654	Interestingly, RAB28 itself may be a cargo of the prenyl-binding protein PDE6D (cGMP phosphodiesterase delta subunit) which immunoprecipitates RAB28; in agreement with this possibility, loss of PDE6D in the mouse phenocopies the photoreceptor degeneration of RAB28 patients.	36277	36551
27930654	In light of our worm data, it is possible that PDE6D delta functions with the BBSome, either together or at distinct parts of a transport pathway, to target RAB28 to ciliary membranes.	36552	36736
27930654	Our study describes a novel method for identifying genes with ciliary functions that complements other studies (bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics) aimed at deciphering a complete ‘ciliome’.	36737	36929
27930654	From our list of candidates, we uncover several novel, evolutionarily-conserved cilium-associated proteins.	36930	37037
27930654	Our in-depth analysis of RAB-28 in C. elegans reveals it to be a novel IFT- and BBSome-associated protein with cell autonomous and non-autonomous roles in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cilia, and of the sensory neuron-supporting cells.	37038	37298
27930654	Further analyses of mammalian RAB28 are required to reveal its functional similarities and differences with IFT27, and possible functional associations with PDE6D and ARL6, to help explain its seemingly specific function in ciliary photoreceptors, and thus specific association with cone-rod dystrophy.	37299	37601
27930654	We curated a list of 41 C. elegans genes with established roles in ciliary function and used these to search for genes with correlated expression.	37602	37748
27930654	These “bait” genes included: R148.1, F38G1.1, Y75B8A.12, F20D12.3, Y41G9A.1, R01H10.6, C54G7.4, C27A7.4, R31.3, C48B6.8, F32A6.2, C27H5.7, T28F3.6, Y37E3.5, F59C6.7, F19H8.3, ZC84.2, F35D2.4, H01G02.2, B0240.3, ZK520.3, C02H7.1, ZK418.3, K08D12.2, F23B2.4, Y105E8A.5, F46F6.4, K07G5.3, F33H1.1, F02D8.3, K03E6.4, C38D4.8, T26C12.4, T27B1.1, Y110A7A.20, F53A9.4, M04C9.5, C30B5.9, C09G5.8, R13H4.1 and F54C1.5.	37749	38158
27930654	We used expression data derived from RNA-seq for seven developmental stages (EE = early embryo, LE = late embryo, L1 = mid-L1 larvae, L2 = mid-L2 larvae, L3 = mid-L3 larvae, L4 = mid-L4 larvae and YA = young adult) obtained from [45–47].	38159	38396
27930654	As the expression values were relative to individual isoforms, we first computed an average RPKM (reads per kilobase per million) value for each gene across all isoforms.	38397	38567
27930654	Using these 41 genes, we next computed the pairwise Pearson correlation of each gene against all 20,363 C. elegans genes in the data set across all libraries and estimated a P value for each test.	38568	38764
27930654	As we were interested in capturing genes with expression correlates to any of these known ciliary genes, we retained the smallest P value from these 41 tests for subsequent calculations.	38765	38951
27930654	To avoid circularity, we retained the second-smallest P value for correlation tests involving one of the bait genes.	38952	39068
27930654	In addition to direct correlation, we sought to identify genes exhibiting a developmental expression pattern similar to known ciliary genes.	39069	39209
27930654	We observed that all ciliary genes exhibit at least a 10-fold reduction in expression level (relative to their peak expression level) in the latter three developmental stages.	39210	39385
27930654	A total of 5960 genes showed this expression trend.	39386	39437
27930654	Following the identification of those genes exhibiting strongly correlated expression to any of the known ciliary genes, this set was further clustered to search for sub-groupings of genes with strongly coordinated expression.	39438	39664
27930654	The distance between individual genes was calculated using the ‘dist’ function in R and hierarchical clustering was performed using single, average and complete linkage.	39665	39834
27930654	S1 Fig shows a heat map representation of the expression for each of the candidate ciliary genes with the dendrogram derived from clustering using complete linkage and cluster 1 at the top.	39835	40024
27930654	Using the method described above, we used srg-36 as a bait to identify co-expressed genes.	40025	40115
27930654	We found 80 genes (p < 0.001), including 27 other predicted chemoreceptors.	40116	40191
27930654	The 1000 bp upstream from the start codon of all 28 chemoreceptors (including the bait srg-36) were entered into the program MEME, which found a consensus that matches the published E-box sequence.	40192	40389
27930654	Separately, the 1000 bp upstream of all the conserved cluster 1 were entered into the MEME suite program DREME, which found several potential transcription factor binding sites.	40390	40567
27930654	We used the MEME suite program TomTom to compare identified sites to known sites.	40568	40649
27930654	Identified promoter elements were compared to consensus splice and trans-splice sites and any that matched were subsequently removed.	40650	40783
27930654	All nematode strains were maintained and cultured at 20°C on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with OP50 Escherichia coli using standard techniques.	40784	40941
27930654	Standard genetic crossing techniques were used to introduce transgenes into genetic backgrounds.	40942	41038
27930654	The rab-28(gk1040) mksr-1(ok2092), mksr-2(tm2452), mks-5(tm3100), mks-3(tm2547), mks-6(gk674), and nphp-4(tm925) mutations were followed using genotyping PCR (primer sequences available upon request).	41039	41239

27930654	After incubation, worms were recovered on seeded nematode growth medium plates for a further 30 min and then mounted on slides.	43261	43388
27930654	Epifluorescence wide-field imaging under the red filter was used to image DiI uptake into the ciliated amphid and phasmid cells.	43389	43517
27930654	For the roaming (foraging) assay, single worms were placed for 18 hours onto seeded NGM plates and track coverage assessed using a grid reference.	43518	43664
27930654	For the osmotic avoidance assay, 5–6 worms were placed within a ring of 8M glycerol (Sigma) supplemented with Bromophenol Blue (Alfa Aesar) on unseeded NGM plates and observed for 10 min.	43665	43852
27930654	Worms that crossed the barrier were removed from the assay.	43853	43912
27930654	Chemotaxis attraction assays (towards isoamyl alcohol) were performed as previously reported, with a chemotaxis index calculated at 30 min and 60 min.	43913	44063
27930654	All constructs were generated by PCR fusion.	44064	44108
27930654	For the transcriptional (promoter) Prab-28::gfp construct, gfp amplified from pPD95.67 was fused to an 432-bp fragment of the 5’UTR of rab-28 that included the first 14 bp of exon 1 (start codon thymine mutated to guanine).	44109	44332
27930654	For the transcriptional reporters for Pccdc-104 and Pccdc-149, gfp amplified from pPD95.77 was fused to 1997 and 395 bp, respectively, of the 5’UTR for each gene.	44333	44495
27930654	For the translational (promoter + protein) fam-161, rpi-1, maph-9, ccdc-149 and tza-3 reporters, the entire genomic sequence (exons and introns) were fused to gfp including promoter sequences of 1373 bp, 2317 bp, 973 bp, 395 bp and 457 bp, respectively.	44496	44749
27930654	For the translational reporter for rab-28 and yap-1 in Fig 2, 341 bp of the bbs-8 promoter followed by gfp were fused to the genomic sequence including 3’ UTR for each gene.	44750	44923
27930654	For the ccdc-104 translational reporter, 1997 bp of the bbs-8 promoter followed by gfp were fused to the ccdc-104 cDNA and 3’ UTR.	44924	45054
27930654	For the translational Prab-28::gfp::rab-28 reporter (Figs 3 and 4), the entire genomic sequence and 970-bp of the 3’UTR of rab-28 was first fused 5’ to a gfp fragment, amplified from pPD95.77.	45055	45247
27930654	The resulting gfp::rab-28 amplicon was subsequently fused to a 422-bp fragment consisting of the 5’UTR (promoter) sequence of rab-28.	45248	45381
27930654	To make the Prab-28::gfp::rab-28(GDP) and Prab-28::gfp::rab-28(GTP) constructs, primers incorporating the corresponding T49N and Q95L mutations were first used to amplify 5’ and 3’ fragments of the rab-28 genomic sequence, and these were fused by PCR to establish the rab-28(T49N) and rab-28(Q95L) amplicons.	45382	45690
27930654	These amplicons were subsequently fused to a Prab-28::gfp fragment, generated by fusing the rab-28 promoter sequence (see above) to gfp amplified from pPD95.77.	45691	45851
27930654	Transgenic worms expressing the above constructs were generated by gonadal transformation of N2 hermaphrodites via microinjection and subsequent screening for transgenic progeny.	45852	46030
27930654	rab-28 constructs were injected at a concentration of either 5 ng/μl (all translational constructs except oqEx304 which was injected at 0.5 ng/μl) or 50 ng/μl (transcriptional constructs), together with a coelomocyte (Punc-122::gfp) or pRF4 (rol-6(su1006)) co-injection marker at 50–100 ng/μl.	46031	46324
27930654	Strains in Fig 2 and S4B Fig were anaesthetised with 10 mM levamisole in M9 buffer, mounted on slides with 8% agarose pads, and observed by epifluorescence or spinning-disc (WaveFX; Quorum Technologies) confocal microscopy performed on an Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 with a Hamamatsu 9100 EMCCD camera.	46325	46622

27930654	Epifluorescence images were taken on an upright Leica DM5000B and confocal images on an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with a Yokogawa spinning-disc unit (Andor Revolution).	46851	47030
27930654	Images were acquired using a charge-coupled device camera (iXon+EM-CCD, Andor Technology) and analysed using Image J software.	47031	47157
27930654	For IFT assays, time-lapse (multi tiff) movies of IFT along phasmid cilia were taken at 200 ms exposure and 4 fps.	47158	47272
27930654	Separated anterograde and retrograde kymographs were generated from multi tiff files using Icy image analysis software (http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/) and rates determined using ImageJ.	47273	47461
27930654	Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays were performed using the above confocal microscope with an attached FRAPPA unit (Andor Technology).	47462	47618
27930654	Samples were bleached using a single pulse of the 488nm laser at 100% with a dwell time of 100 μs.	47619	47717
27930654	Images were recorded immediately post-bleach and continuously thereafter.	47718	47791
27930654	Fluorescence intensities measured with image J software following a recently described protocol.	47792	47888
27930654	Values were normalised to pre-bleach values and corrected for signal intensity loss during image acquisition.	47889	47998
27930654	Young adult worms were fixed, sectioned and imaged as previously reported.	47999	48073
26270232	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invariably develops within a setting of chronic inflammation caused by hepatotropic viruses, toxins, metabolic liver disease or autoimmunity.	0	172
26270232	HCC is the sixth most prevalent cancer and the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death.	173	270
26270232	Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HCC are of great concern.	271	335
26270232	Fine-needle biopsy or other investigations such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or digital subtraction angiography were used as the gold standard diagnosis in HCC.	336	518
26270232	The prognosis at early stages relies on tumour status, liver function and the applied treatment.	519	615
26270232	Tumour status is defined by so-called BCLC Classification.	616	674
26270232	Early HCC diagnosis is essential, as only in early stages (BCLC A) the tumour is curable by resection, LTx or ablation therapy.	675	802
26270232	Patients with small solitary tumours (single lesion <5 cm) and very well preserved liver function are the best candidates for liver resection or transplantation.	803	964
26270232	LTx is most beneficial for individuals who are poor candidates for resection due to cirrhosis as the underlying disease.	965	1085
26270232	Screening of the serum tumour marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and imaging with ultrasound (US) every 6 months in patients with liver cirrhosis have been recommended to detect HCC at earlier stages amenable to effective treatment strategies.	1086	1325
26270232	Serum AFP is the most widely used marker for HCC.	1326	1375
26270232	However, its sensitivity and specificity for HCC is poor and varies with the cutoff value, ethnicity of the patient, etiology of liver disease and tumour stage.	1376	1536
26270232	The sensitivity of AFP decreases from 52% to 25% when tumour diameter is >3 and <3 cm, respectively.	1537	1637
26270232	Besides AFP, AFP lectin fraction 3 (AFP-L3) and DCP are widely used clinically as serum tumour markers of HCC.	1638	1748
26270232	These serum biomarkers (AFP, DCP and AFP-L3) are not accurate enough for the early diagnosis of HCC.	1749	1849
26270232	Association of immune parameters such as apoptosis markers CK18 (M65) and CK18 fragment (M30), chemokines CCR2, CXCR2, CXCR4, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL15, CCL17, CCL22, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL12, CXCL14, Chromogranin A and high-mobility-group-protein B1 (HMGB1) with cirrhosis and HCC have been studied previously in patients with end-stage liver diseases.	1850	2226
26270232	Development of new reliable serological biomarkers for early stages of HCC is needed to improve clinical diagnosis and outcomes.	2227	2355
26270232	Furthermore, the marker should be sensitive, easily measurable, reproducible and minimally invasive.	2356	2456
26270232	Our aim in the present study is to assess the diagnostic value of cell death markers HMGB1, M65 and M30, growth factors TPO, GCSF, FGF basic and VEGF and inflammatory chemokines CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1), CCL4 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta), CCL5 (RANTES) and CXCL5 (epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating peptide-78) and IL-8 (CXCL8) for early detection of HCC in cirrhotic patients.	2457	2915
26270232	The following parameters were measured in 139 cirrhotic patients (aged 52.0±11.2 years, 32 female, 61 cirrhotic HCC+ and 78 cirrhotic HCC−) who underwent deceased donor LTx between January 2008 and April 2011.	2916	3125
26270232	HCC diagnosis was confirmed by pathological reports.	3126	3178
26270232	Original liver diseases were chronic viral hepatitis C and/or B in 40 patients, alcohol abuse in 41, congenital or autoimmune disease, including cryptogenic cirrhosis, biliary disease, metabolic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis and amyloidosis, in 58 patients.	3179	3442
26270232	Preoperative and demographic parameters, including age, gender, severity of liver diseases (determined by MELD score), bilirubin, INR, albumin, viral infection statuses such as CMV, HBV and HCV IgG, retransplantation, serum levels of CRP and neopterin as inflammatory markers and serum levels of cell death markers M65 and M30, TPO, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 CXCL5 and CXCL8 (IL-8), were analysed.	3443	3837
26270232	We examined the association between HCC with mentioned parameters.	3838	3904
26270232	Thirty-nine healthy volunteers (HCs) served as controls to establish references for studied parameters such as cytokines and chemokines.	3905	4041
26270232	Controls were free of infectious and other inflammatory illnesses.	4042	4108
26270232	The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee.	4109	4163
26270232	Serum separator tubes were centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m.	4164	4217
26270232	for 15 min at 4 °C.	4218	4237
26270232	Serum was collected after the blood clotting process.	4238	4291
26270232	Serum was snap frozen within 2 h, after the blood was drawn and stored at −30 °C until testing.	4292	4387
26270232	All serum samples were thawed only once before testing.	4388	4443
26270232	Cell apoptotic marker (M30; CK18 fragment), growth factors thrombopoietin (TPO) and chemokines C-X-C motif ligand 5 (ENA-78, CXCL5), C-C motif ligand 2 (MCP-1, CCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a, CCL3), macrophage inflammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b, CCL4) and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES, CCL5) were measured by ELISA using the Quantikine Kits (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany).	4444	4877
26270232	Categorical and continuous variables were analysed using chi square, Fisher exact and Mann–Whitney U-tests.	4878	4985
26270232	Continuous variables were modelled stratifying by median.	4986	5043
26270232	Correlation between variables was analysed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.	5044	5133
26270232	The most sensitive cutoff values were calculated by receiver operating curve (ROC) curve analysis.	5134	5232
26270232	Univariable and multivariable forward stepwise logistic regression analyses were applied and identified the greatest association of parameters with HCC.	5233	5385
26270232	All statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).	5386	5521
26270232	After Bonferroni correction, P values ⩽0.05 were defined as statistically significant.	5522	5608
26270232	Serum levels of M30, TPO, GCSF, FGF basic and VEGF, CXCL5, IL-8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 were similar among patients with virus-, alcohol- or congenital/autoimmune-induced cirrhosis (data not shown).	5609	5810
26270232	Serum levels of HMGB1 (3.2±6.7 pg ml−1 vs 3.7±2.7: P=0.006), TPO (208±237 pg ml−1 vs 505±106: P<0.0001), VEGF (35±49 pg ml−1 vs 87±52: P<0.0001), CCL2 (194±533 pg ml−1 vs 179±71: P=0.0001), CCL3 (33±280 pg ml−1 vs 70±199: P=0.002), CCL5 (2.7±5.2 mg ml−1 vs 11±11: P<0.0001) and CXCL5 (167±238 pg ml−1 vs 766±540: P<0.0001) were lower, whereas serum CRP (20.0±24.7 mg l−1 vs 3.5±6.1: P<0.0001), neopterin (49.2±69.1 nmol l−1 vs 6.4±3.2: P<0.0001), IL-6 (74.0±435 pg ml−1 vs 0.0±0.0: P<0.0001), IL-8 (40.5±87.3 pg ml−1 vs 11.5±26.1: P=0.014), M65 (2349±1127 pg ml−1 vs 358±111: P<0.0001) and M30 (1195±839 pg ml−1 vs 185±133: P<0.0001) were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than in 39 healthy controls (16 females, age: mean±s.d.	5811	6548
26270232	39.6±10.0 years).	6549	6566
26270232	The results suggest a decreased chemokine expression and an increased rate of apoptosis and inflammation in cirrhotic patients.	6567	6694
26270232	Serum levels of GCSF (P=0.08) and FGF basic (P=0.11) were similar in patients and healthy controls.	6695	6794
26270232	HCC patients with cirrhosis were older, had more HCV+ and lower MELD score (11.8±5.0 vs 22.4±8.6: P<0.001), CRP (15.8±21.8 mg l−1 vs 22.9±26.1: P=0.009) and neopterin (22.2±21.0 nmol l−1 vs 58.1±76.8: P<0.001) than cirrhotic patients without HCC− (Table 1).	6795	7052
26270232	AFP test was carried out in 102 cirrhotic patients; 23 of 49 HCC+ and 9 of 53 HCC− patients had positive results (P<0.0001).	7053	7177
26270232	Serum levels of TPO (226±210 pg ml−1 vs 163±247: P<0.001) and chemokines CCL4 (170±378 pg ml−1 vs 101±483: P<0.0001), CCL5 (3.6±5.5 vs 2.0±4.5 ng ml−1: P<0.0001) and CXCL5 (230±301 vs 118±159 pg ml−1: P<0.001) were higher, whereas surprisingly CCL2 (129±192 pg ml−1 (median=80) vs 245±689 (median=111): P=0.008) was lower in HCC+ than in HCC− cirrhotic patients (Table 2 and Figure 1).	7178	7563
26270232	Interestingly, the apoptosis marker M30 (P=0.60), M65 (P=0.92), GCSF (P=0.66), VEGF (P=0.51) and FGF basic (P=0.28) were similar in the two patient groups.	7564	7719
26270232	The results indicate high expression of particular chemokines in HCC patients compared with cirrhotic patients without HCC.	7720	7843
26270232	To calculate sensitivities, specificities and cutoff values, we preformed ROC analysis for significant parameters.	7844	7958
26270232	The best cutoff values were 170 pg, 66 pg, 0.86 ng and 84 pg ml−1 for TPO, CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL5, respectively.	7959	8069
26270232	The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 69, 67, 59 and 70% for TPO, 66, 74, 67 and 73% for CCL4, 71, 68, 62 and 74% for CCL5 and 71, 63, 59 and 72% for CXCL5, respectively (Figure 2).	8070	8260
26270232	AFP had a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 89%, a PPV of 79% and a NPV of 64%.	8261	8343
26270232	Univariate regression analyses showed that AFP⩾20 IU (Odds ratio (OR)=5.10, CI 1.71–15.21: P=0.003), TPO⩾170 pg ml−1 OR=3.74, CI 1.84–7.60: P<0.001), CCL4⩾66 pg ml−1 (OR=4.10, CI 2.00–8.36: P=0.0001), CXCL5⩾84 pg ml−1 (OR=4.00, CI 1.97–8.27: P=0.0001) and CCL5⩾0.86 ng ml−1 (OR=4.42, CI 2.16–9.06: P<0.0001) in cirrhotic patients are diagnostic markers of HCC.	8344	8704
26270232	Multivariate forward stepwise regression analysis of significant parameters showed that, among the studied parameters, serum CCL4⩾66 pg ml−1 (OR=6.24, CI 2.55–15.23: P<0.0001), CCL5⩾0.86 ng ml−1 (OR=3.63, CI 1.48–8.88: P=0.004) and AFP⩾20 IU (OR=5.69, CI 1.58–20.37: P=0.004) have the best association with HCC.	8705	9016
26270232	Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to calculate correlation between significant variables.	9017	9121
26270232	HCC conversely correlated with MELD score (r=−0.382: P<0.0001), serum CRP (r=−0.213: P=0.009), neopterin (r=−0.353: P<0.001) and IL-6 (r=−0.356: P<0.0001) and positively with age (r=0.401: P<0.0001), TPO (r=0.316: P<0.001), CCL4 (r=0.366: P<0.0001), CCL5 (r=0.363: P<0.0001), CXCL5 (r=0.319: P<0.001) and AFP (r=0.421: P<0.0001).	9122	9451
26270232	TACE procedure was performed in 40 HCC patients.	9452	9500
26270232	MELD score, liver function tests, chemokine levels, neopterin, CRP and albumin levels were similar in patients with and without TACE and in patients with and without detectable AFP (P=not significant for all investigations).	9501	9725
26270232	Tumour size was only correlated with TPO (r=0.41: P=0.002).	9726	9785
26270232	In the present study, we investigated the serum levels of biomarkers, including cytokeratin 18 (M65), cytokeratin 18 (CK18; M30) fragment, TPO, CC and CXC motif chemokines and AFP, to find a diagnostic marker for HCC.	9786	10003
26270232	A detailed comparison of serum levels and/or production of CXCL5 and CC chemokines between healthy controls and patients with ESLD has not been performed so far.	10004	10165
26270232	The results of our study indicate that patients with advanced fibrosis and ESLD are unable to produce sufficient chemokines, in accordance with previous studies showing low expression and production of chemokines in cirrhotic patients.	10166	10401
26270232	CK18 is an apoptosis marker and a major intermediate filament protein in liver cells and a popular marker for detecting liver fibrosis in recent years.	10402	10553
26270232	This apoptosis marker increased in sera of patients with cirrhotic liver diseases compared with healthy controls, reflecting the higher rate of apoptosis.	10554	10708
26270232	Chemokines – biomolecules that induce chemotaxis – have a fundamental role not only in inflammation and immune surveillance but also in cancer progression.	10709	10864
26270232	Chemokines are important mediators of host defense functioning in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes and other cells at the sites of injury, infection and neoplasia (Driscoll, 1994).	10865	11057
26270232	C-C receptor 5 is a receptor for CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 and is expressed in effector and effector memory subsets of Th1 CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (Kang and Shin, 2011).	11058	11227
26270232	Previous studies showed high expression of CCL4 and CCL5 chemokines in viral, alcoholic and autoimmune inflammatory diseases in the liver (Bautista, 2001; Bautista and Wang, 2001; Maghazachi, 2010; Kang and Shin, 2011).	11228	11447
26270232	Intrahepatic and peripheral blood levels of chemokines CCL4 and CCL5 are increased during chronic hepatitis C. In patients with HCV infection intrahepatic expression of CCL4 and CCL5, especially in periportal and lobular areas is increased, and their levels of expression were significantly associated with the degree of liver inflammation.	11448	11788
26270232	CCL4 and CCL5 expression have also been associated with liver histological activity index in chronic hepatitis C. CCL4 and CCL5 are potent chemoattractants for memory T lymphocytes, monocytes, NK cells and eosinophils, and they attract cells through an interaction with their receptor CCR5.	11789	12079
26270232	CCL5 was found to be highly expressed in activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, platelets, mesangial cells, epithelial cells, megakaryocytes and some tumours.	12080	12250
26270232	Interaction between host cells and cancer cells happens via a large variety of soluble factors.	12251	12346
26270232	The association of chemokines with cancer is not surprising, as they both promote and restrict tumour onset and/or progression.	12347	12474
26270232	CCL4 and CCL5 are expressed in human breast cancer and CCL5 is associated with the progression of particularly triple-negative (ostrogen, progesterone and tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 negative) breast cancer.	12475	12685
26270232	This chemokine can regulate the function of effector cells and chemotaxis relies on its concentration.	12686	12788
26270232	Therefore, the increased level of CCL5 can enhance its role in chemotaxis.	12789	12863
26270232	CCL5 is minimally expressed by normal breast epithelial duct cells but is highly expressed by breast tumour cells, suggesting that this chemokine has a role in breast cancer development and/or progression (Soria and Ben-Baruch, 2008; Lapteva and Huang, 2010).	12864	13123
26270232	Upregulation of CCL4 in human colon and gastric cancer was reported previously.	13124	13203
26270232	Following prostatectomy, the expression of CCL4 is associated with recurrence of prostate cancer and the absence of CCL4 expression supported recurrence-free survival after prostatectomy.	13204	13391
26270232	HCC is the commonest primary malignant cancer of the liver in the world.	13392	13464
26270232	Some cancer staging systems, grading severity of dysfunction and tumour burden can estimate the survival of HCC patients.	13465	13586
26270232	CCR1 binds a particular set of C-C chemokines, including CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, and is expressed by a variety of cells, including lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, neutrophils and bone marrow progenitor cells.	13587	13795
26270232	CCR5, another specific receptor for CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, was also detected in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes but not in hepatoma cells.	13796	13932
26270232	Lu et al (2003) provided that hepatoma cells express CCR1 in vitro and in vivo.	13933	14012
26270232	The correlation between CCL5 and HCC is a controversial issue, whereas an association between HCC susceptibility and genetic polymorphism of CCL5-28 and CCL5-403 was described.	14013	14189
26270232	A study by Liu et al (1999) provides evidence of CCL5–28G mutation with increased transcription of the RANTES gene.	14190	14305
26270232	To our knowledge, the association of HCC with CCL4 gene expression and/or serum levels was not studied so far.	14306	14416
26270232	Thus our report is the first study that evaluates this association.	14417	14484
26270232	CCL4 and CCL5 can bind to their receptors in the carcinomatous tissues and Kupffer cells in the liver and induce the infiltration of various inflammatory cells.	14485	14645
26270232	We speculate that cirrhotic high producers of CCL4 and CCL5 are at higher risk of HCC.	14646	14732
26270232	It can be postulated that high serum levels of CCL4 and CCL5 indicate the presence of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis and along with other indicators can help in early detection of HCC.	14733	14923
26270232	Algorithmic approach of our results (Figure 3) indicates that AFP is a specific test in patients with suspected HCC (imaging).	14924	15050
26270232	When imaging is positive but AFP is negative, surrogate markers such CCL5 and CCL4 are confirmatory tests.	15051	15157
26270232	We recommend a liver biopsy in patients with positive imaging and negative AFP, when CCL5 and/or CCL4 are positive.	15158	15273
26270232	Furthermore, future large prospective studies may be needed to investigate the association between these chemokines and hepatocellular carcinoma.	15274	15419
26270232	Until now, AFP together with imaging and pathology detection are commonly used in the clinical early diagnosis of liver cancer.	15420	15547
26270232	However, the specificity and sensitivity of AFP used in screening for liver cancer are not satisfactory.	15548	15652
26270232	The results of the present study indicate that CCL4 and CCL5 are more sensitive and AFP more specific markers of HCC and that monitoring the combination of these markers might be an innovative approach in the early diagnosis of HCC.	15653	15885
28604678	The Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III (ESCRT-III) promotes membrane fission from the inner side of membrane necks in various cellular processes1, including the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies2, cytokinetic abscission3–7, nuclear envelope sealing8–11, plasma membrane repair12, HIV budding13,14, and exosome or microvesicle shedding15–17.	0	360
28604678	ESCRT-III forms polymers that are thought to constrict membrane necks until they split18–25, but the mechanism underlying constriction is unknown.	361	507
28604678	ESCRT-III is evolutionary conserved from humans to archaea, and is composed of four structurally related core subunits with distinct functions18–27.	508	656
28604678	Budding yeast Vps20 (human homolog is CHMP6) functions as a nucleation factor, Snf7 (human homolog CHMP4 has three isoforms, A-C) serves as a main polymer subunit, Vps24 (CHMP3 in humans) and Vps2 (CHMP2A and B isoforms in humans) inhibit Snf7 polymerization28–32 and recruit the ATPase Vps4, which is thought to predominantly disassemble ESCRT-III polymers30,31,33–38.	657	1026
28604678	How different ESCRT-III components coordinately assemble and remodel polymer structures has remained unclear.	1027	1136
28604678	Purified ESCRT-III subunits polymerize into filaments that form spirals on flat membranes or helices on membrane tubes36,39–45.	1137	1264
28604678	ESCRT-III also forms filament spirals and helices in intact cells44,46,47, and it is required for the assembly of large filament helices that constrict the intercellular bridge during cytokinetic abscission4.	1265	1473
28604678	Prevailing models propose that ESCRT-III mediates membrane fission by sequential assembly of distinct subunits18–23,25, whereby late-binding Vps2/Vps24 (CHMP2/CHMP3) subunits might form a rigid dome-shaped scaffold to guide attached membranes towards the fission site36 or induce changes in the curvature of pre-assembled Snf7 filament spirals to promote membrane neck constriction41.	1474	1858
28604678	These models rely on the sequential addition of distinct subunits and the persistence of ESCRT-III polymers, yet this has not been directly observed under physiological conditions.	1859	2039
28604678	We hence set out to systematically quantify the assembly kinetics, dynamics, and structure of ESCRT polymers in live human cells and in an in vitro reconstitution system.	2040	2210
28604678	To investigate the dynamics of ESCRT-III polymers at the abscission site, we generated stable HeLa cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged subunits.	2211	2362
28604678	We found that CHMP4B tagged with GFP via a long flexible linker (Localization and Affinity Purification tag, LAP) and expressed close to endogenous levels4 did not perturb abscission (Fig.	2363	2551
28604678	1a).	2552	2556
28604678	To probe the functionality of LAP-tagged CHMP4B, we depleted endogenous CHMP4B in wild-type HeLa cells or in HeLa cells stably expressing siRNA-resistant mouse CHMP4B-LAP (Supplementary Fig.	2557	2747
28604678	1a).	2552	2556
28604678	Cytokinetic abscission was substantially perturbed upon depletion of endogenous CHMP4B in wild-type HeLa cells, but was not affected in mouse-CHMP4B-LAP-expressing HeLa cells (Fig.	2753	2933
28604678	1a), validating the functionality of CHMP4B-LAP.	2934	2982
28604678	We next investigated the dynamics of midbody-localized ESCRT-III by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments.	2983	3113
28604678	Unexpectedly, we found that CHMP4B-LAP rapidly re-accumulated at the midbody following photobleaching (Fig.	3114	3221
28604678	1b, c and Supplementary Video 1).	3222	3255
28604678	A single exponential function constrained to initial fluorescence values did not fit the FRAP kinetics (Fig.	3256	3364
28604678	1c), indicating the presence of two populations of CHMP4B-LAP with distinct residence times at the midbody.	3365	3472
28604678	We determined the residence times for the two midbody-localized fractions by a double-exponential fit (Fig.	3473	3580
28604678	1b, h, i).	3581	3591
28604678	A highly mobile fraction of 64 ± 6% (mean ± SEM, as in the rest of the paper, if not otherwise noted) of CHMP4B-LAP had a residence time of 19.5 ± 2.7 s, whereas a stably-bound fraction of 36 ± 2% had a residence time of 716.0 ± 91.3 s. Modeling the stably-bound fraction as completely immobile also yielded a good approximation (Supplementary Fig.	3592	3940
28604678	1b, c).	3941	3948
28604678	Importantly, both methods of model fitting yielded consistent values for the fraction and residence time of the highly mobile pool (Supplementary Fig.	3949	4099
28604678	1d).	4100	4104
28604678	Thus, the majority of CHMP4B-LAP molecules at the midbody continuously turns over with a cytoplasmic pool – at a rate up to two orders of magnitude faster than the macroscopic accumulation of ESCRT-III at the midbody4,5.	4105	4325
28604678	ESCRT-III initially localizes within two cortical regions adjacent to the midbody, which later constrict to split the plasma membrane4,5.	4326	4463
28604678	Photobleaching of CHMP4B-LAP prior to or during constriction stages revealed similar recovery kinetics (Fig.	4464	4572
28604678	1b, d, e, and Supplementary Video 1), indicating that midbody-localized ESCRT-III dynamically turns over subunits with cytoplasmic pools during its macroscopic accumulation and constriction.	4573	4763
28604678	We next investigated the localization and dynamics of other ESCRT-III subunits.	4764	4843
28604678	We tagged human CHMP2B, CHMP3 and CHMP4B with the same design used for tagging mouse CHMP4B.	4844	4936
28604678	All three LAP-tagged ESCRT-III subunits localized to the midbody (Fig.	4937	5007
28604678	2f, g, and Supplementary Video 2) and did not perturb abscission (Supplementary Fig.	5008	5092
28604678	2a-d).	5093	5099
28604678	CHMP2B, CHMP3, and CHMP4B subunits accumulated at the midbody with indistinguishable kinetics (Fig.	5100	5199
28604678	2f, g, and Supplementary Video 2).	5200	5234
28604678	Hence, ESCRT-III assembles at the midbody with a fairly constant proportion of different core subunits during the progression of abscission.	5235	5375
28604678	We next probed the dynamics of human CHMP2B, CHMP3, and CHMP4B at the midbody.	5376	5454
28604678	FRAP experiments showed that all three subunits had highly mobile fractions with residence times similar to mouse CHMP4B (Fig.	5455	5581
28604678	1h, i, and Supplementary Fig.	5582	5611
28604678	2g-i).	5612	5618
28604678	We noticed somewhat variable kinetics at late stages of FRAP recovery, which resulted in inaccurate fitting of single exponential functions (Supplementary Fig.	5619	5778
28604678	2e-g).	5779	5785
28604678	Given the technical difficulty to accurately measure long residence times, the relevance of the observed variations remains unclear.	5786	5918
28604678	Importantly, however, all FRAP experiments consistently show that highly mobile fractions of CHMP2B, CHMP3, and CHMP4B dynamically turn over with similar residence times.	5919	6089
28604678	Overall, our experiments show that ESCRT-III forms highly dynamic assemblies at the midbody.	6090	6182
28604678	We wondered if VPS4 could be responsible for ESCRT-III turnover, as it is the only known nucleotide hydrolase in the ESCRT-III pathway30,33.	6183	6323
28604678	VPS4 was previously detected at the midbody only during late stages of abscission5, which would be inconsistent with its contribution to the high ESCRT-III turnover observed during early stages.	6324	6518
28604678	However, previous measurements of VPS4 accumulation were based on overexpression from a viral promoter5, which could limit its detection at the midbody owing to high cytoplasmic background.	6519	6708
28604678	We thus re-examined VPS4 accumulation in cells stably expressing LAP-tagged murine VPS4B from its endogenous promoter (Supplementary Fig.	6709	6846
28604678	3a).	6847	6851
28604678	In these cells, VPS4B-LAP indeed accumulated at the midbody simultaneously with CHMP4B-LAP (Fig.	6852	6948
28604678	2a, b, and Supplementary Video 3).	6949	6983
28604678	Thus, VPS4 is present at early stages and could contribute to ESCRT-III dynamics throughout the entire abscission process.	6984	7106
28604678	To investigate the role of VPS4 in ESCRT-III dynamics, we depleted both isoforms VPS4A and VPS4B in CHMP4B-LAP-expressing cells using RNAi.	7107	7246
28604678	Depletion of endogenous VPS4A/B to undetectable levels at 48 h after siRNA transfection (Supplementary Fig.	7247	7354
28604678	3b) substantially reduced the amount of CHMP4B-LAP at the midbody (Fig.	7355	7426
28604678	2c, and Supplementary Fig.	7427	7453
28604678	3c).	7454	7458
28604678	FRAP experiments revealed that under this condition, CHMP4B-LAP turnover at the midbody was almost completely suppressed (Fig.	7459	7585
28604678	2e, f).	7586	7593
28604678	We considered that this phenotype may arise from the strong reduction of the cytoplasmic CHMP4B concentration, owing to the accumulation of ESCRT-III at endosomes upon complete VPS4 depletion47,48 (Fig.	7594	7796
28604678	3c, d).	7797	7804
28604678	However, partial depletion of VPS4A/B at 20 h after siRNA transfection also reduced the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (Fig.	7805	7941
28604678	2e, f) without altering the cytoplasmic CHMP4B-LAP concentration (Fig.	7942	8012
28604678	2c, d).	8013	8020
28604678	The cytoplasmic levels of CHMP2B-LAP or CHMP3-LAP were also not affected upon partial VPS4A/B depletion (Supplementary Fig.	8021	8144
28604678	3d, e).	8145	8152
28604678	Furthermore, microinjection of recombinant human CHMP4B protein into telophase cells resulted in rapid accumulation at the midbody in control cells, but a much slower rate in VPS4A/B-depleted cells (Supplementary Fig.	8153	8370
28604678	4).	8371	8374
28604678	Together, these experiments show that VPS4 is required for dynamic turnover of ESCRT-III at the midbody.	8375	8479
28604678	We next studied how VPS4 contributes to abscission.	8480	8531
28604678	RNAi depletion of VPS4A/B delayed abscission and frequently caused cleavage furrow regression (Fig.	8532	8631
28604678	3a, b).	8632	8639
28604678	These abscission failures did not occur in cells stably expressing murine VPS4B-LAP, which is resistant to siRNA targeting human VPS4A/B (Fig.	8640	8782
28604678	3b, and Supplementary Fig.	8783	8809
28604678	3a), validating that this phenotype is caused by on-target depletion.	8810	8879
28604678	To gain further insight into the underlying defect, we investigated the ultrastructure of intercellular bridges in cryo-immobilized telophase cells.	8880	9028
28604678	Most of the control cells contained constriction zones adjacent to the midbody with regularly spaced 17 nm diameter filaments and compressed bundles of microtubules (Fig.	9029	9199
28604678	3c; 4 out of 7 cells), as previously observed4.	9200	9247
28604678	After partial VPS4A/B depletion at 26 h after siRNA transfection, only a small fraction of cells had 17 nm filaments (Fig.	9248	9370
28604678	3d; 4 out of 27 cells), and narrow constriction zones were never observed.	9371	9445
28604678	Together, these data indicate that VPS4 is required for the formation and constriction of a functional ESCRT-III apparatus at intercellular bridges.	9446	9594
28604678	The high ESCRT-III dynamics in cells prompted us to dissect the specific contribution of each subunit in vitro.	9595	9706
28604678	As purified human ESCRT-III proteins are difficult to spontaneously polymerize on flat membranes under physiological concentrations49, we considered to use the evolutionarily conserved budding yeast proteins.	9707	9915
28604678	We first tested whether budding yeast Snf7 (homolog of human CHMP4) can in principle recapitulate the cellular dynamics observed for human proteins and therefore expressed a LAP-tagged version in HeLa cells.	9916	10123
28604678	Budding yeast Snf7-LAP specifically localized to the midbody during abscission and rapidly recovered after photobleaching similar to human and mouse CHMP4B-LAP (Supplementary Fig.	10124	10303
28604678	5a-d), validating the use of yeast proteins for in vitro analysis of ESCRT-III dynamics.	10304	10392
28604678	Previous work showed that Snf7 spontaneously polymerizes on membrane covered areas of coverslips to form large patches composed of densely packed filament spirals43.	10393	10558
28604678	We studied patch growth kinetics only in central areas of membrane-covered regions, as patches stop growth at the edge of membrane-covered regions (Supplementary Fig.	10559	10725
28604678	5e-g).	10726	10732
28604678	We first investigated how Vps24 (homolog of human CHMP3) and Vps2 (CHMP2) affected the kinetics of Snf7 polymerization.	10733	10852
28604678	We therefore incubated supported lipid bilayers with fluorescently labeled Snf7 until patches formed and then simultaneously added Vps2 and Vps24 (Fig.	10853	11004
28604678	4a, b, and Supplementary Video 4; 22 min).	11005	11047
28604678	Following rapid binding, Vps2 and Vps24 suppressed patch growth and strongly reduced further accumulation of Snf7 in patches (Fig.	11048	11178
28604678	4c, d, and Supplementary Fig.	11179	11208
28604678	6a-c).	11209	11215
28604678	Sequential injection of Vps2 and Vps24 into the fluid chamber further showed that these subunits depend on each other in their Snf7 growth-inhibitory function (Fig.	11216	11380
28604678	4e, Supplementary Fig.	11381	11403
28604678	6d, e, and Supplementary Videos 5 and 6).	11404	11445
28604678	Thus, prolonged phases of ESCRT-III assembly, as observed during cytokinetic abscission4,5, are not recapitulated by mixed solutions of Snf7, Vps2, and Vps24.	11446	11604
28604678	The inhibition of Snf7 patch growth by Vps2/Vps24 could be caused by lower rates of Snf7 subunit accumulation or by an increase of the Snf7 dissociation rate.	11605	11763
28604678	To investigate this, we incubated supported lipid bilayers with fluorescently labeled Snf7 until patches formed and then washed out soluble Snf7.	11764	11909
28604678	We subsequently added fluorescently labeled Vps2 and Vps24, which enriched at the edge of the patch, where newly growing Snf7 filament spirals localize43 (Fig.	11910	12069
28604678	4f, g, and Supplementary Video 7).	12070	12104
28604678	Snf7 remained stably bound to patches throughout the entire imaging period, indicating that Snf7 polymers have extremely low intrinsic subunit dissociation rates irrespective of their association with Vps2 and Vps24.	12105	12321
28604678	The inhibition of Snf7 patch growth imposed by Vps2 and Vps24 is thus independent of Vps4 and caused by a reduced rate of Snf7 subunit incorporation.	12322	12471
28604678	We next investigated if growth inhibition by Vps2 and Vps24 could arise from an ultrastructural change in ESCRT-III polymers.	12472	12597
28604678	Transmission electron microscopy showed that Snf7 alone polymerized on liposomes to form one-start spirals containing a single 4.5 nm wide filament, which occasionally paired between neighboring turns (Fig.	12598	12804
28604678	5a, b), as previously observed43.	12805	12838
28604678	When Vps2 and Vps24 were added after Snf7 polymerization, filaments appeared double-stranded and neighboring spiral turns occasionally bundled to form quadruple strands with an approximate width of 15 nm (Fig.	12839	13048
28604678	5c, d) – close to the width of ESCRT-III-dependent filaments observed at the abscission site in vertebrate cells4 (Fig.	13049	13168
28604678	5c-f; compare Fig.	13169	13187
28604678	3c).	7454	7458
28604678	Given the one-start single-stranded geometry of Snf7 spirals prior to addition of Vps2/Vps24, the paired filaments likely represent lateral copolymers of Vps2/Vps24 along Snf7.	13193	13369
28604678	To further characterize the morphological changes of Snf7 filaments upon addition of Vps2/24, we visualized ESCRT-III assemblies by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) (Fig.	13370	13551
28604678	5g).	13552	13556
28604678	Snf7 alone formed spirals with pronounced filaments, but subsequent addition of Vps2/Vps24 induced a compact disc-like morphology (Fig.	13557	13692
28604678	5g-i).	13693	13699
28604678	This is consistent with a filament thickening and bundling limiting access of the AFM tip in between neighboring spiral turns.	13700	13826
28604678	Together, these data suggest that Vps2/Vps24 might reduce the rate of Snf7 polymerization through the formation of bundled filaments.	13827	13960
28604678	In cells, Vps2 and Vps24 are both present in the cytoplasm, raising the question of how ESCRT-III polymerization is sustained over prolonged periods.	13961	14110
28604678	Our in vivo observations imply the possibility that Vps4 might leverage Vps2/Vps24-mediated growth inhibition by ESCRT-III turnover.	14111	14243
28604678	To explore whether Vps4 promotes ESCRT-III turnover in vitro, we separately measured ESCRT-III subunit association and dissociation kinetics.	14244	14385
28604678	We first determined the rate by which Vps4 disassembles Snf7 patches in the absence of Vps2 and Vps24.	14386	14488
28604678	We polymerized Snf7 on supported lipid membranes, washed out soluble Snf7, and then added Vps4 and ATP.	14489	14592
28604678	This did not cause detectable disassembly of Snf7 patches even at very high Vps4 concentrations (Fig.	14593	14694
28604678	6a, b), indicating that Vps4-mediated Snf7 depolymerization strictly depends on Vps2/Vps24, as shown before37.	14695	14805
28604678	We thus quantified the rate of Vps4-mediated ESCRT-III patch disassembly in presence of Vps2 and Vps24.	14806	14909
28604678	We first polymerized Snf7 patches on supported lipid membranes, then removed the soluble pool of Snf7, and subsequently added a mix of fluorescently labeled Vps2 and unlabeled Vps24, Vps4, and ATP.	14910	15107
28604678	Vps2 first bound to Snf7 patches and subsequently partially disassembled together with Snf7 (Fig.	15108	15205
28604678	6c, d, Supplementary Fig.	15206	15231
28604678	7a, b, and Supplementary Video 8).	15232	15266
28604678	Thus, Vps4-mediated Snf7 depolymerization is fast enough to account for dynamic turnover of its homolog CHMP4B at the midbody in human cells.	15267	15408
28604678	To characterize the Snf7-disassembly process at the molecular level, we visualized morphological changes of individual ESCRT-III spirals by HS-AFM.	15409	15556
28604678	We polymerized Snf7 patches on supported lipid bilayers, then added Vps2 and Vps24, and subsequently washed out the soluble components.	15557	15692
28604678	We then added Vps4 and ATP and acquired HS-AFM movies, which showed that ESCRT-III spirals reduced their diameter (Fig.	15693	15812
28604678	6e, f, and Supplementary Video 9).	15813	15847
28604678	When omitting ATP from the reaction, Vps4 did not disassemble ESCRT-III spirals (Fig.	15848	15933
28604678	6g, and Supplementary Video 10), confirming that ESCRT-III disassembly is an energy-consuming process.	15934	16036
28604678	Given that the ESCRT-III spirals did not depolymerize below a certain diameter, these data suggest that Vps4 mediates Snf7 filament disassembly predominantly from the outer regions of spirals, whereby inner spiral segments are refractory to disassembly.	16037	16290
28604678	We next tested whether Vps4 can mediate Snf7 turnover in vitro.	16291	16354
28604678	For this purpose, we used Snf7 subunits labeled with two distinct fluorophores.	16355	16434
28604678	We first incubated supported lipid bilayers with AlexaFluor-488-labeled Snf7 until patches formed and then added Vps24 and Vps2 to inhibit further patch growth (Fig.	16435	16600
28604678	7a-c, see 0 - 45 min, and Supplementary Video 11).	16601	16651
28604678	We then exchanged the soluble pool of Snf7-AlexaFluor-488 with Snf7-Atto-647N while maintaining Vps2 and Vps24 in the reaction.	16652	16779
28604678	At this point, we also added Vps4.	16780	16814
28604678	Snf7 polymer patches maintained constant size and did not incorporate Atto-647N-Snf7, presumably because ATP was not yet present (Fig.	16815	16949
28604678	7a-c, see 45 - 54 min).	16950	16973
28604678	Indeed, subsequent ATP addition caused dissociation of AlexaFluor-488-Snf7 from patches, but also concomitant binding of Atto-647N-Snf7 (Fig.	16974	17115
28604678	7a-c, see 54 - 88 min).	17116	17139
28604678	Thus, an ATP-dependent activity of Vps4 promotes not only disassembly of ESCRT-III but also the formation of new ESCRT-III polymers on membranes.	17140	17285
28604678	Interestingly, Vps4 and ATP also restored the macroscopic growth of Snf7 patches despite the continued presence of Vps2 and Vps24 (Fig.	17286	17421
28604678	7a, b, see 58 - 88 min, and Supplementary Video 11).	17422	17474
28604678	We thus tested if a solution containing Vps4, ATP, and all three ESCRT-III subunits supports nucleation and growth of ESCRT-III polymers as observed in vivo.	17475	17632
28604678	Strikingly, this combination resulted in efficient nucleation and growth of ESCRT-III patches, in contrast to a mix that lacked Vps4 (Fig.	17633	17771
28604678	7d, e).	17772	17779
28604678	Furthermore, the net ESCRT-III assembly rate increased with higher concentrations of Vps4 (Supplementary Fig.	17780	17889
28604678	7c).	17890	17894
28604678	Thus, Vps4 promotes net growth of ESCRT-III assemblies in presence of growth-inhibiting Vps2 and Vps24 subunits.	17895	18007
28604678	To study Vps4-mediated polymer remodeling at the molecular level, we visualized ESCRT-III spirals by HS-AFM.	18008	18116
28604678	We assembled Snf7 spirals on supported lipid bilayers and then added Vps2, Vps24, Vps4, and ATP.	18117	18213
28604678	This induced a drastic reorganization of ESCRT-III polymers: preexisting spirals reduced their size, while many new spirals nucleated and grew in between the original spirals (Fig.	18214	18394
28604678	8a, b, and Supplementary Video 12).	18395	18430
28604678	The innermost parts of ESCRT-III spirals appeared refractory to disassembly and thus might represent the stably-bound fraction of ESCRT-III observed by fluorescence microscopy.	18431	18607
28604678	In contrast, pre-existing spirals remained unchanged in the absence of ATP (Fig.	18608	18688
28604678	8c, and Fig.	18689	18701
28604678	6g).	18702	18706
28604678	Thus, Vps4 induces a dynamic steady-state with both growing and shrinking ESCRT-III spirals when Snf7, Vps2, Vps24 are present in solution.	18707	18846
28604678	Furthermore, while ESCRT-III spirals formed an immobile array in the absence of ATP, the addition of ATP induced substantial lateral mobility of individual ESCRT-III spirals relative to each other (Fig.	18847	19049
28604678	8d-f, and Fig.	19050	19064
28604678	6g).	18702	18706
28604678	Thus, in the presence of Vps4 and ATP, ESCRT-III forms highly dynamic polymer structures on membranes.	19070	19172
28604678	Our study shows that membrane-bound ESCRT-III polymers rapidly turn over subunits with cytoplasmic pools while they assemble into larger structures.	19173	19321
28604678	The dynamic subunit turnover is driven by Vps4 and is necessary to sustain efficient net growth of ESCRT-III assemblies in presence of inhibitory Vps2 and Vps24 subunits.	19322	19492
28604678	Most previous models for ESCRT-III-mediated membrane fission imply sequential recruitment of different ESCRT-III subunits and Vps4 to establish distinct phases of polymer growth, reorganization/maturation, and disassembly5,14,18–21,23–25,28,30,31.	19493	19740
28604678	However, our study shows that different ESCRT-III subunits and VPS4 accumulate at the midbody with indistinguishable kinetics.	19741	19867
28604678	This does not rule out sequential subunit binding at the single-filament level, but indicates that the distinct stages of ESCRT-III accumulation, constriction, and disassembly during abscission cannot be explained by a sequence of subunit binding.	19868	20115
28604678	Our findings call for re-interpretation of the terminal phenotype resulting from Vps4 depletion –the accumulation of ESCRT-III polymers in endosomes (termed class E compartment in yeast) that has led to the model of Vps4 serving predominantly as a disassembly factor 26,28,33,50.	20116	20395
28604678	We show that Vps4 is important for efficient ESCRT-III assembly, yet we also note that residual slow ESCRT-III polymerization in the absence of Vps4 is sufficient to ultimately capture all cytoplasmic subunits in class E compartments – owing to the extremely low intrinsic subunit dissociation rates.	20396	20696
28604678	At the molecular level, Vps4 might promote the net growth of ESCRT-III assemblies by constant turnover of Vps2 and Vps24 in side-by-side co-polymers along Snf7 filaments – to create growth-competent free Snf7 filament tips (Fig.	20697	20925
28604678	8g).	20926	20930
28604678	Furthermore, Vps4 might induce subunit turnover at the core of ESCRT-III filament bundles, in analogy to interaction of the Vps4 homolog Spastin with the lattice of microtubules51 (Fig.	20931	21116
28604678	8g).	20926	20930
28604678	In contrast to previous models5,52, however, Vps4 does not cut an ESCRT-III helix during a single definite time point to induce tension release, but rather continuously remodels filaments.	21122	21310
28604678	Within bundled filaments, such turnover does not necessarily lead to a complete breakage of larger structures.	21311	21421
28604678	The innermost parts of ESCRT-III spirals appear refractory to disassembly even at high concentrations of Vps4, suggesting that ESCRT-III interaction with Vps4 might depend on mechanical stress owing to low filament curvature or on filament polarity.	21422	21671
28604678	Potential stochastic fluctuations in subunit turnover rates could then lead to dynamic growth and shrinkage of ESCRT-III spirals.	21672	21801
28604678	Vps4-induced subunit turnover in ESCRT-III assemblies might directly contribute to membrane constriction.	21802	21907
28604678	Indeed, macroscopic shape changes of many other cellular polymer structures critically depend on dynamic subunit turnover within the constituent filaments, as for example mitotic spindles53 or actomyosin rings54.	21908	22120
28604678	In ESCRT-III assemblies, Vps4-induced subunit turnover might facilitate sliding of adjacent helix turns, thereby promoting constriction of mechanically pre-stressed, low-curved filaments into more relaxed high-curvature states43.	22121	22350
28604678	The underlying bending forces could be generated by binding of Vps2 and Vps24 to Snf741, or by shortening-induced increase of filament rigidity.	22351	22495
28604678	By revealing dynamic subunit turnover in ESCRT-III assemblies, our study provides a framework for understanding how this highly conserved membrane fission machinery adapts to diverse membrane geometries.	22496	22699
28604678	A Gateway recombination cassette was inserted into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) to generate a Tet-inducible pTO_mCherry_N-DEST.	22700	22825
28604678	Next, mCherry was exchanged with a LAP tag using KpnI and XbaI (ThermoFisher Scientific), resulting in pTO_LAP_N-DEST, a Gateway destination vector for C-terminal LAP tags that allows FRT recombination and Tet-inducible expression.	22826	23057
28604678	Expression vectors were generated by recombining pTO_LAP_N-DEST with Gateway entry clones containing cDNA of human ESCRT-III subunits in pDONR223 (obtained from hORFeome Database) or S. cerevisiae SNF7 (amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pDONR223) using Gateway LR Clonase II (Invitrogen), to generate pTO_CHMP2B_LAP, pTO_CHMP3_LAP, pTO_CHMP4B_LAP and pTO_SNF7_LAP.	23058	23431
28604678	Cell lines for inducible expression of ESCRT-III subunits were generated from HeLa Kyoto FRT_H2B-mRED55.	23432	23536
28604678	To remove H2B-mRED, cells were grown without selection for H2B-mRED in medium containing 0.5 µg/mL puromycin (Merck), 400 µg/mL zeocin (Invitrogen), but no G418.	23537	23698
28604678	Cells were then FACS-sorted for the absence of red fluorescence, and single clones were isolated.	23699	23796
28604678	Inducible ESCRT-III constructs were then integrated into the FRT site by co-transfection with pOG44 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1:10, and selected in medium containing 300 μg/mL hygromycin B (Roche) and 0.5 μg/mL puromycin (Merck).	23797	24027
28604678	To generate a cell line expressing mmVPS4B-LAP, the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) RP24-139J22 was used to GFP-tag mouse VPS4B using BAC-TransGeneOmics56,57.	24028	24192
28604678	Homologous recombination yielded BAC DNA containing VPS4B-LAP, which was isolated and transfected into HeLa cells using Effectene (Qiagen), and selected in medium containing 400 µg/mL G418 (Invitrogen).	24193	24395
28604678	All HeLa BAC-GFP cell lines were cultured in medium supplemented with 300 μg/mL G418 (Invitrogen).	24396	24494
28604678	No cell line used in this study is listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines that is maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample.	24495	24637
28604678	The HeLa Wildtype cell line (‘Kyoto’ strain) was obtained from S. Narumiya (Kyoto University, Japan) and validated by a Multiplex human Cell line Authentication test (MCA), 21.04.16.	24638	24820
28604678	All cell lines have been regularly tested for mycoplasma, and a contamination has never been detected.	24821	24923
28604678	HeLa cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich).	24924	25142
28604678	For live-cell imaging, cells were plated in LabTek II chambered coverslips (ThermoFisher Scientific) or glass bottom dishes (µ-Dish35 mm, high Glass Bottom, Ibidi) in cell culture medium without riboflavin and phenol red to minimize background fluorescence58.	25143	25402
28604678	Microtubules were stained with 100 nM SiR-tubulin59 and 10 µM verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich; to inhibit efflux of SiR-tubulin from cells), at least 1 h before imaging.	25403	25565
28604678	Protein expression in cell lines bearing hsCHMP2B-LAP, hsCHMP3-LAP or hsCHMP4B-LAP was induced with 0.2 ng/mL doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich), titrated to match levels of mmCHMP4B-LAP from the BAC construct.	25566	25769
28604678	For expression of yeast Snf7-LAP, HeLa Kyoto FRT were transfected with pTO_SNF7_LAP using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche) 24 h prior to imaging, and induced with 0.05 ng/mL doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich).	25770	25961
28604678	Cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope controlled by ZEN 2011 and an autofocus macro (AutofocusScreen) kindly provided by Jan Ellenberg (EMBL).	25962	26122
28604678	Imaging was performed in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 37°C in an incubation chamber (EMBL).	26123	26223
28604678	For analysis of accumulation kinetics, cells were imaged with a 63x 1.4 NA oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss).	26224	26341
28604678	ESCRT-III levels at the midbody were quantified in single optical sections using Fiji60.	26342	26430
28604678	For normalization, the fluorescence signal prior to ESCRT-III accumulation was set to zero.	26431	26522
28604678	Due to the variable duration of abscission, we chose the earliest time point for which we had data in all cells, which was at 48 min before abscission.	26523	26674
28604678	Peak signals were normalized to the average midbody fluorescence from 12 min before to 6 min after abscission.	26675	26785
28604678	Accumulation curves in VPS4A/B depletion experiments were normalized to 18-30 min after complete cleavage furrow ingression.	26786	26910
28604678	For quantification of abscission timing, cells were imaged with a 40x 1.4 NA oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss).	26911	27030
28604678	Abscission timing was measured as the duration from complete cleavage furrow ingression until the first disassembly of the midbody microtubules.	27031	27175
28604678	For VPS4B rescue experiments, only cells expressing mmVPS4B-LAP were analyzed.	27176	27254
28604678	Midbodies were imaged using a 63x 1.4 NA oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss).	27255	27338
28604678	Photobleaching was performed in circular regions with 2 iterations of 488 nm at 42-fold higher laser intensity compared to that used for imaging.	27339	27484
28604678	Fluorescence was measured in midbody regions followed by background subtraction.	27485	27565
28604678	For normalization, acquisition photobleaching and ESCRT-III net accumulation during the recording interval was measured separately for early and late-stage midbodies.	27566	27732
28604678	FRAP curves were then normalized to the mean of the pre-bleach fluorescence and to the first frame after photobleaching.	27733	27853
28604678	For all different constructs, cells with expression levels similar to that of mmCHMP4B-LAP cells were used.	27854	27961
28604678	To determine FRAP recovery kinetics, we fitted single exponential functions f(t) = 1 − e−kt, single exponential functions with a variable immobile fraction f(t) = A(1 − e−kt), or double exponential functions f(t) = A1(1 − e−k1t) + (1 − A1)(1 − e−k2t), using the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares algorithm (minpack.lm package for R, version 3.0.2).	27962	28320
28604678	Convergence to minimal residuals was reached in ~76% of the curves.	28321	28388
28604678	Residence times were calculated from the dissociation rates as 1/k1 and 1/k2.	28389	28466
28604678	Because the slow dissociation rate k2 was frequently fitted as 0 due to a completely stable fraction, we derived the slow residence times from the Taylor expansion to calculate the reciprocal mean from E[Y]=E[1X]=μY=1μ+σ2μ3, and standard deviation from σY=σμ2, where µ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.	28467	28780
28604678	Since the long residence time could not be measured accurately due to the relatively short duration of measurements, we constrained k2 to the mean ± SD of mmCHMP4B-LAP in all experiments.	28781	28968
28604678	For comparison of highly mobile fractions, we additionally constrained k1 to the mean k1 of mmCHMP4B-LAP, which corresponds to a residence time of 19.5 s. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) with non-targeting siRNA siControl (ambion, sense strand: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt), or siRNAs targeting CHMP4B (Microsynth, sense strand: AGAAAGAAGAGGAGGACGAtt)4,61, VPS4A (Microsynth, sense strand: CCGAGAAGCUGAAGGAUUAtt)61, or VPS4B (Microsynth, sense strand: CCAAAGAAGCACUGAAAGAtt)61, at a final concentration of 80 nM.	28969	29507
28604678	Samples were analyzed at the indicated times after transfection.	29508	29572
28604678	To generate a CHMP4B bacterial expression plasmid containing an N-terminal 6xHis tag followed by a maltose binding protein (MBP) and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, human CHMP4B was cloned into pMBP-HIS2-Snf7 (Addgene #21492), by replacing Snf7 with PCR-amplified CHMP4B using BamHI and NotI.	29573	29884
28604678	For production of recombinant protein, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli Rosetta cells and expressed for 3 h at 30°C after induction with 0.5 mM IPTG.	29885	30042
28604678	Bacterial were lysed by sonication at 4°C in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Hepes pH8, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche).	30043	30208
28604678	CHMP4B was purified using affinity chromatography (MBPTrap HP 5 mL column, GE Healthcare), washed with 20 mM Hepes pH8, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and eluted in 20 mM Hepes pH8, 10 mM maltose, followed by removal of maltose using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (7K MWCO 5 mL, ThermoFisher Scientific).	30209	30512
28604678	After cleavage with TEV protease, the resulting His-MBP fragment was removed by incubation with Ni-NTA Agarose beads (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1 h, followed by incubation with Dextrin Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h to remove remaining protein that was not cleaved by TEV protease.	30513	30806
28604678	Purified CHMP4B was labeled with Atto-565-NHS ester (Sigma-Aldrich), by incubation with two molar excess of reactive dye in the presence of 100 mM NaHCO3 pH9.	30807	30965
28604678	Excess free dye was removed by dialysis against 20 mM Hepes pH8 at 4°C using a MWCO membrane of 12-14 kDa, and the sample was further purified using Zeba spin desalting columns (ThermoFisher Scientific).	30966	31169
28604678	The resulting labeling density was ~80%.	31170	31210
28604678	Protein aggregates were removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the protein stored at -80°C after flash freezing.	31211	31351
28604678	For microinjection into cells, CHMP4B was ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 80,000 g at 4°C and loaded into Femtotips (Eppendorf).	31352	31479
28604678	Microinjection was performed using InjectMan 4 micromanipulator (Eppendorf) and the FemtoJet 4i (Eppendorf) microinjection system, with an injection pressure of 100 hPa, an injection time of 0.2-0.5 s, and a maintenance pressure of 20 hPa.	31480	31719
28604678	The microinjection system was mounted on the Zeiss LSM780 system described above, and cells were imaged with a 40x 1.4 NA oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss) immediately prior and after injection.	31720	31922
28604678	Fluorescence intensity of injected CHMP4B-Atto-565 was measured in midbody regions containing a CHMP4B-LAP signal.	31923	32037
28604678	The mean intensity of the surrounding region was subtracted for background correction, and the first time point after injection was normalized to 0.	32038	32186
28604678	Cells were seeded and transfected as described above in LabTek II chambered coverslips (ThermoScientific).	32187	32293
28604678	Protein extracts were separated on 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to Nitrocellulose (Protran, GE Healthcare) or PVDF membranes (Amersham Hybond, GE Healthcare).	32294	32495
28604678	Western blotting was performed by standard methods using antibodies against CHMP4B (1:1000, Abcam, ab105767), actin (1:30000, Merck Millipore, MAB1501), VPS4B (1:500, Abcam, ab137027), GFP (1:5000, Abcam, ab290) and GAPDH (1:2500, Abcam, ab9485).	32496	32742
28604678	HeLa cells were seeded in T75 flasks and transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).	32743	32849
28604678	At 23 h post-transfection, a primary shake-off was performed to remove dead cells and debris.	32850	32943
28604678	Mitotic cells were harvested ~2 h later with a second shake-off, and seeded on 3 mm sapphire discs (M. Wohlwend GmbH) coated with 0.01% Poly-L-lysine (Sigma) in PBS.	32944	33109
28604678	97 min later, sapphire discs were transferred to a 3 mm aluminum specimen carrier (type B, flat side up) and covered with a second carrier (type A), which had a 50 µm cavity filled with 10% (w/v) BSA (AppliChem) in cell culture medium, followed by high-pressure freezing in an HPF Compact 01 (M. Wohlwend GmbH).	33110	33421
28604678	Freeze substitution was performed using a Leica EM AFS-2, in a medium of anhydrous acetone (Merck) containing 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 0.1% uranyl acetate (Merck) according to the following protocol: 21 h at -90°C, warm up at a rate of 5°C per hour to -30°C, 6 h at -30°C, warm up at a rate of 5°C per hour to 0°C, 2 h at 0°C.	33422	33778
28604678	Specimen were washed 3 times in anhydrous acetone (Merck) at 4°C and embedded in an Epon/Araldite resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences).	33779	33914
28604678	Serial thin sections of a nominal thickness of 100 nm were collected on Formvar-coated (Electron Microscopy Science) copper slot grids (PLANO).	33915	34058
28604678	Sections were post-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate (Polyscience) and Reynold’s lead citrate (Electron Microscopy Science), and imaged either on a Morgagni 268D transmission electron microscope (FEI) at 80 kV with a Morada CCD camera (Olympus-SIS), or on an EM 906 transmission electron microscope (Zeiss) at 80 kV with a slow-scan CCD camera (Albert-Tröndle Systems).	34059	34433
28604678	ESCRT-III yeast proteins were expressed from plasmids encoding Snf7 (Addgene #21492), Vps2 (Addgene #21494), Vps24 (gift from James Hurley lab), Vps4 (Addgene #21495) and purified as previously described 31.	34434	34641
28604678	Snf7 with a cysteine residue at the N-terminus of the protein was purified as in 62.	34642	34726
28604678	Snf7 was labeled either with maleimide-Atto-647N (Atto-Tec AD 647N-4), or with TFP-AlexaFluor-488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A-30005).	34727	34860
28604678	Vps2 was labeled with Atto-565 (Atto-Tec AD 565-3), and Vps24 with Atto-488 (Atto-Tec AD 488-3).	34861	34957
28604678	The proteins were used at the following concentrations: [Snf7] = 300 nM, [Vps2] = 100 nM, [Vps24] = 100 nM, [Vps4] = 2 µM, except in Fig 6a, b, Supplementary Fig.	34958	35120
28604678	5e-g and Supplementary Fig.	35121	35148
28604678	7, where concentrations are indicated in the figures.	35149	35202
28604678	When added to the reaction, ATP concentration was 2 mM.	35203	35258
28604678	Fluorescent proteins were mixed with unlabeled proteins at the following ratios: Snf7-Atto-647N, Vps2-Atto-565, Vps24-Atto-488: 1/3 labeled with 2/3 unlabeled; Snf7-AlexaFluor-488: 2/3 labeled with 1/3 unlabeled.	35259	35471
28604678	GUVs were prepared by electroformation using 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS) mixtures (Avanti Polar Lipids).	35472	35650
28604678	20 µl of 1 mg/mL lipid mix (DOPC:DOPS, 6:4, mol:mol) were deposited on two indium tin oxide-coated glass slides (70-100 Ω resistivity, Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in a vacuum drying oven for 1 h for complete solvent evaporation.	35651	35877
28604678	An opened tor rubber joint of ~1 mm thickness was used as a non-leaky spacer between the two ITO slides, and the chamber was formed by compressing the two slides with spring metal tweezers.	35878	36067
28604678	The chamber was filled with 400 µl of 500 mM sucrose solution and exposed to 1 V AC-current (10 Hz sinusoidal) at room temperature for 1 h. The resulting suspension was collected in a tube and used within the next days for experiments.	36068	36303
28604678	The assay is described in detail in 43.	36304	36343
28604678	Briefly, to prepare supported membranes, a cleaned coverslip was assembled to a flow chamber (Sticky-Slide VI 0.4, Ibidi), with one entry connected to a syringe pump (Aladdin, World Precision Instruments), and the other left open for sequential introduction of solutions.	36344	36615
28604678	The flow chamber is initially filled with 200 µL of buffer and 5 µl of GUV suspension.	36616	36702
28604678	After ~5 min, bursting of multiple vesicles was observed on the surface of the coverslip.	36703	36792
28604678	Then 100 µl of casein (Sigma-Aldrich) solution at 1 mg/mL was incubated for 30 min in the flow chamber to block the bare glass around membrane patches.	36793	36944
28604678	The chamber was then washed with 200 µl of buffer before starting the experiment.	36945	37026
28604678	The buffer used for all in vitro experiments was composed of 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 6.8), 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl2.	37027	37140
28604678	An anti-bleaching mix composed of 10 mM glucose, 12 KU/mL catalase, 49 U/mL Glucose Oxidase and 0.75 mg/mL Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich) was used.	37141	37280
28604678	When the incubation duration was longer than 20 min, the solution was renewed to avoid loss of the antibleaching mix efficiency (Fig.	37281	37414
28604678	7, and Supplementary Fig.	37415	37440
28604678	7).	12101	12104
28604678	Imaging was performed using a spinning disc confocal inverted microscope assembled by 3i (Intelligent Imaging Innovation) including a Nikon base (Eclipse C1, Nikon), a 100x 1.49 NA oil immersion objective with a CSU-W1 confocal head and a photometrics evolve camera.	37445	37711
28604678	Nikon perfect focus system was used in combination with a multi-positioning system (ASI) to acquire multiple fields of view over time.	37712	37846
28604678	Imaging was performed only in membrane-covered areas of the coverslip, which were distinguishable from the non-membrane-covered glass surface based on an unspecific background fluorescence of the labeled ESCRT-III subunits adsorbing onto glass.	37847	38091
28604678	For all experiments, a 2 µm thick volume stack surrounding the coverslip surface was acquired with one minute time lapse.	38092	38213
28604678	The raw data was processed in 3 steps.	38214	38252
28604678	First, the 3D stacks were projected in 2D by a Fiji plugin63, which determines the right focal surface plane along a z-stack.	38253	38378
28604678	Second, the field illumination inhomogeneity was corrected by dividing all the images by an image of a homogeneously labeled surface.	38379	38512
28604678	Third, the x-y stage drift throughout the image acquisition was corrected using the plugin Turboreg.	38513	38613
28604678	For each experiment, patches that did not fuse completely with neighboring patches were manually selected for quantification.	38614	38739
28604678	For each patch, a slice was manually selected to extract a kymograph.	38740	38809
28604678	The integrated fluorescence intensity of these kymographs was measured and maximum values were normalized to 1 for all experiments, except for Fig.	38810	38957
28604678	7c, where curves were adjusted to match the end point of the experiment.	38958	39030
28604678	To calculate kinetics of patch disassembly, Snf7 mean patch intensity curves were fitted to exponential decay function f(t)=(1−a)∗e−tτ+a.	39031	39168
28604678	For electron microscopy, multilamellar vesicles made of DOPC:DOPS, 6:4 (mol:mol), were prepared at 5 mg/mL.	39169	39276
28604678	For Snf7 only experiments, vesicles at 0.5 mg/mL were incubated for 1 h with Snf7 at 750 nM.	39277	39369
28604678	For Snf7+Vps2+Vps24 experiments, Snf7 was first incubated as before, then Vps2 and Vps24 were added, each at 500 nM final concentration for 1 h. All samples were then centrifuged for 4 min at 4000 g, washed, adsorbed onto Formvar-coated EM grids, then negatively stained for 30 s with 2% uranyl acetate.	39370	39673
28604678	Images were acquired using a Tecnai G2 Sphera (FEI) electron microscope.	39674	39746
28604678	1 µL of adsorption buffer (10 mM Hepes, 220 mM NaCl, 25 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) was added to freshly cleaved mica, followed by addition of 1 µL of the GUVs suspension.	39747	39908
28604678	GUVs were incubated for 10 min, gently rinsed with imaging buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM KCl, pH 7.4), before immersion into the HS-AFM fluid chamber (volume: ~120 µL).	39909	40078
28604678	After SLB assessment and image acquisition area positioning, Snf7 was added to the fluid chamber to a final concentration of 1 µM.	40079	40209
28604678	After ~20 min, Snf7 filaments started to form on the SLB and assembled into spiral structures in the following minutes.	40210	40329
28604678	Vps2 and Vps24 were then added to the AFM fluid chamber to a final concentration of 100 nM.	40330	40421
28604678	Next, Vps4 was injected to a final concentration of 1-2 µM.	40422	40481
28604678	Finally, ATP and MgCl2 were added to the fluid chamber to a final concentration of 200 µM and 1 mM, respectively.	40482	40595
28604678	Imaging was performed at room temperature on an HS-AFM 1.0 (RIBM) using ~8 µm long cantilevers (NanoWorld) with resonance frequency of ~0.7 MHz in liquid and a spring constant of ~0.15 Nm-1.	40596	40786
28604678	Typically, pixel samplings ranged between 300 x 300 pixels and 200 x 200 pixels and frame acquisition rates ranged between 1 s-1 and 2 s-1.	40787	40926
28604678	For HS-AFM movie analysis, we corrected stage drift using the StackReg plugin in Fiji, and performed a moving average of 2 to 4 consecutive time frames.	40927	41079
28604678	ESCRT-III spiral diameters and line profiles were manually measured using Fiji.	41080	41159
28604678	Coefficients of variation were determined for 45 nm-long sections of the line profiles from the ratio of SD to mean.	41160	41276
28604678	TrackMate was used for manual and semi-automated tracking of spiral centers with a ~5 s interval.	41277	41374
28604678	Tracks shorter than 55 s were omitted from the analysis.	41375	41431
28604678	To account for non-normal distributions and unequal variances, statistical analysis was performed using the two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test using R (version 3.0.2) or GraphPad Prism 7.	41432	41618
28604678	Numbers of repeated and experiments are indicated in the respective figure legends, and always refer to independent biological experiments, with all samples showing the same behavior.	41619	41802

26615423	Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies and is the leading cause of gynecological cancer death.	0	121
26615423	There were 204,000 new cases and 125,000 deaths estimated worldwide in 2011.	122	198
26615423	Although advances in surgery and new chemotherapy regimens have resulted in downward trends of the incidence and mortality of ovarian cancer over the last few decades, it is still associated with the highest mortality rate among all gynecological malignancies worldwide.	199	469
26615423	One reason for the lethality of ovarian cancer is that the majority of women are undiagnosed until advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages (III or IV) where the cancer has spread beyond the pelvis, which leads to an unfavorable prognosis.	470	745
26615423	Several traditional clinical variables, including surgical stage, volume of residual tumor after primary surgery, and histologic grade play important roles in the FIGO staging system and patient prognosis.	746	951
26615423	Moreover, biomarkers such as CA125, CA199, and CA153 have been used for predicting metastasis and prognosis in the clinic.	952	1074
26615423	Many novel genes, such as AGR2, Netrin-1 and STIP1, have been reported to be potentially useful metastatic and prognostic markers in ovarian cancer [6–8].	1075	1229
26615423	However, they are not sufficiently reliable for predicting tumor metastasis, clinical outcomes or for optimizing and individualizing the treatment.	1230	1377
26615423	Thus, an urgent need remains for additional research to identify novel biomarkers for developing targeted therapy, detection of metastasis, and predicting the survival and relapse rates for ovarian cancer patients.	1378	1592
26615423	Centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55), also designated as C10orf3, FLJ10540, or URCC6, is a centrosome- and midbody-associated protein of ~55 kDa in size and has been mapped to the 10q23 chromosomal region.	1593	1792
26615423	The CEP55 gene encodes the 464 amino acid protein containing a domain known as AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities).	1793	1935
26615423	CEP55 was found to play a role in centrosome-dependent cellular functions, such as centrosome duplication and/or cell cycle progression, or in the regulation of cytokinesis [10–13].	1936	2117
26615423	Recently, increased expression of CEP55 was reported in several human tumors, and it may be associated with the onset of oncogenesis, invasion, and mitosis.	2118	2274
26615423	A study indicated that CEP55 forms a complex with PI3K, enhancing PI3K activity, and consequently, the AKT survival pathway, suggesting that CEP55 is a novel oncogene that may play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis.	2275	2498
26615423	A higher level of CEP55 has been associated with poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancer patients.	2499	2593
26615423	It is reported that the early upregulation of FOXM1 during head and neck cancer progression, rendering it as an attractive diagnostic biomarker for early cancer detection and its candidate mechanistic targets, CEP55 and HELLS, as indicators of malignant conversion and progression.	2594	2875
26615423	In addition, expression of CEP55 was correlated with aggressiveness of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma by stimulating cell migration and invasion through increased FOXM1 and MMP-2 activity.	2876	3069
26615423	CEP55 was reported to be overexpressed in lung cancer tissues and associated with cell migration and invasion, as well as participate in the VEGF-A/PI3K/AKT pathway [18, 19].	3070	3244
26615423	Furthermore, some studies have identified the overexpression of CEP55 in colorectal carcinoma, prostate cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric cancer [20–26].	3245	3410
26615423	However, characteristics of CEP55 expression and its clinical/prognostic significance in human ovarian cancer remain unknown.	3411	3536
26615423	In the current study, we aimed to explore the expression of CEP55 in ovarian cell lines and human ovarian tissues.	3537	3651
26615423	Moreover, we investigated the association between the expression of CEP55 protein and clinical manifestations and survival outcomes of a cohort of 213 patients with ovarian cancer.	3652	3832
26615423	We further investigated the function of CEP55 by using RNA interference (RNAi), wound healing assay, Transwell assay, immunofluorescence analysis, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and Western blot analysis, .	3833	4046
26615423	This study was approved by the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center Ethic Review Committee, and each patient signed an informed consent prior to the use of the clinical materials for research purposes.	4047	4248
26615423	All specimens were handled according to the ethical and legal standards.	4249	4321
26615423	For qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, fresh ovarian cancer and matched distant noncancerous ovarian tissues were derived from 12 patients who had undergone surgery at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between March 2015 and May 2015.	4322	4563
26615423	For Western blot analysis of different stages of ovarian cancer, we collected normal ovarian tissue, benign ovarian cancer tissue, and borderline ovarian cancer and ovarian cancer tissues from patients at different clinical stages from seven patients who had undergone surgery at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between January 2015 and June 2015.	4564	4920
26615423	In addition, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was conducted on a total of 213 paraffin-embedded ovarian cancer samples, which were histopathologically and clinically diagnosed at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between 2002 and 2010.	4921	5165
26615423	Clinical and clinicopathological classification and staging were determined by two experienced gynecological oncologists according to FIGO (2009).	5166	5312
26615423	The follow-up time for the primary ovarian cancer cohort ranged from 5.1 to 176.1 months with a median of 73.82 months.	5313	5432
26615423	The clinicopathological data of all the patients were summarized in Table 1.	5433	5509
26615423	The ovarian cancer cell lines used in the current study were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).	5510	5639
26615423	TOV-112D, COV434, OV-90, COV644, COV504, COV362, A2780, TOV-21G, SKOV3, OVCAR4, and EFO-27 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and 1 % antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin).	5640	5963
26615423	The normal ovarian cell line HOSEpiC was maintained in DMEM.	5964	6024
26615423	qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of CEP55 in ovarian cell lines, human epithelial ovarian cancer, and matched adjacent normal tissues.	6025	6180
26615423	Total RNA samples from cultured cells and fresh tissues were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	6181	6349
26615423	These RNA samples were then pretreated with RNase-free DNase, and 2 μg of RNA sample was used for cDNA synthesis using random hexamers.	6350	6485
26615423	The primers were designed using Primer Express v2.0 (Applied Biosystems, USA).	6486	6564
26615423	CEP55 primers used were 5′-GCCACTGCTGATTTTTCTCC-3′, and 5′-ACTGTGGCTCCAAACTGCTT-3′.	6565	6648
26615423	For the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, which was used as an internal control, the sense primer 5′-AATGAAGGGGTCATTGATGG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAA-3′ were used.	6649	6857
26615423	For PCR-mediated amplification of CEP55 cDNA, an initial amplification step using CEP55-specific primers was conducted with a denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 30 denaturation cycles at 95 °C for 60 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and a primer extension phase at 72 °C for 30 s. Upon the completion of the cycling steps, a final extension at 95 °C was carried out before the reaction mixture was held at 4 °C.	6858	7291
26615423	qRT-PCR was then performed to evaluate the fold increase of CEP55 mRNA in each of the primary ovarian cancer tissues relative to the matched adjacent normal tissues (ANT) and ovarian cancer cell lines relative to that in the normal ovarian cell line.	7292	7542
26615423	We used a double-stranded DNA-specific SYBR Premix Ex Taq II kit (Takara Biotechnology, USA) on a Bio-Rad sequence evaluation system according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	7543	7721
26615423	The expression data were normalized to the geometric mean of the level for GAPDH to control for variability in expression levels in all experiments.	7722	7870
26615423	All assays were examined in triplicate.	7871	7910
26615423	Total protein was prepared using the cell total protein extraction kits according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Millipore, Billerica, MA).	7911	8054
26615423	Equal concentrations of each protein sample (20 μg) were separated on 6 % SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).	8055	8256
26615423	The membranes were blocked with 5 % nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated a primary monoclonal antibody to CEP55 (1:1000, Abcam, USA, ab170414) overnight at 4 °C.	8257	8493
26615423	After washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA, SC-2004).	8494	8661
26615423	The ECL prime Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) was used to detect CEP55 expression according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	8662	8837
26615423	GADPH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to confirm equal loading of the samples.	8838	8920
26615423	IHC analysis was carried out to investigate alterations in protein expression in the 213 human ovarian cancer tissues.	8921	9039
26615423	The procedures were performed with classical protocols.	9040	9095
26615423	In brief, paraffin-embedded specimens were cut into 4-μm sections and baked at 65 °C for 30 min.	9096	9192
26615423	The sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated.	9193	9253
26615423	Sections were submerged into EDTA antigenic retrieval buffer, microwaved for antigenic retrieval, and then treated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, followed by incubation with 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block any nonspecific binding.	9254	9542
26615423	Sections were then incubated with a rabbit monoclonal antibody against CEP55 (Abcam, ab170414, 1:250) overnight at 4 °C.	9543	9663
26615423	After washing, the tissue sections were then incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Abcam), followed by further incubation with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex (Abcam).	9664	9869
26615423	The tissue sections were immersed in 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole and counterstained with 10 % Mayer’s hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted in Crystal Mount.	9870	10023
26615423	The degree of immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections was blind reviewed and evaluated by two independent pathologists.	10024	10164
26615423	Scores given by the two independent observers were averaged, which were based on both the proportion of positively stained tumor cells and the intensity of staining.	10165	10330
26615423	The proportion of tumor cells was scored as follows: 1 (<10 % positive tumor cells), 2 (10–50 % positive tumor cells), 3 (50–75 % positive tumor cells), and 4 (>75 % positive tumor cells).	10331	10519
26615423	Cells were scored for intensity of staining on a scale of 0 (no staining), 1 (weak staining = light yellow), 2 (moderate staining = yellow brown), and 3 (strong staining = brown).	10520	10699
26615423	The staining index was calculated as the product of the proportion of positive cells × staining intensity score (range from 0 to 12).	10700	10833
26615423	Cutoff values for CEP55 were chosen on the basis of a measure of heterogeneity using the log-rank test with respect to overall survival (OS).	10834	10975
26615423	An optimal cutoff value was identified as follows: staining index score of ≥6 was used to define tumors with high CEP55 expression, and a score of ≤4 indicated low CEP55 expression.	10976	11157
26615423	To further identify the role of CEP55 in tumor invasion, two human small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized and purified by Ribobio Inc (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) for depletion of CEP55.	11158	11355
26615423	The siRNA sequences used were as follows: siRNA#1: 5′-GAAGCCUAGUAACUCCAAAdTdT-3′, siRNA#2: 5′-GGAAGAUGAUAGGCAUAAAdTdT-3′, and siRNA#3: 5′-GGAAACAGCUGCUCAUUCAdTdT-3′.	11356	11521
26615423	Transfection of siRNAs was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.	11522	11657
26615423	In the cell invasion assay, we used Transwell chambers (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with 8-μm pore polycarbonate filters that were coated with Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).	11658	11853
26615423	Cells cultured in the absence or presence of siRNA for 24 h were seeded into the upper chambers in serum-free medium at a density of 2.5 × 104 per well, and 500 μl of NIH3T3-conditioned medium was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant.	11854	12100
26615423	After 48 h at 37 °C in 5 % CO2, the cells that passed through the filter into the lower chamber were fixed with 3.7 % paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1 % crystal violet solution.	12101	12283
26615423	Cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed with cotton buds.	12284	12355
26615423	Invaded cells on the underside of the filter were photographed and counted by phase contrast microscopy (×200 magnification).	12356	12481
26615423	The experiments were performed in triplicate.	12482	12527
26615423	For wound-healing assay, cells were seeded in individual wells of a six-well culture plate.	12528	12619
26615423	Untransfected cells and cells exposed to CEP55 siRNA or negative control siRNA for 5 h were cultured in a quiescent medium for 24 h. Thereafter, a sterile 10-μl pipette tip was used to longitudinally scratch a constant-diameter stripe in the confluent monolayer.	12620	12882
26615423	The medium and cell debris were removed by aspiration and replaced with 2 ml of fresh serum-free medium.	12883	12987
26615423	Microscopic images were taken at 0, 24, and 48 h immediately after wounding (corresponding to 24, 48, and 72 h posttransfection) by phase contrast microscopy.	12988	13146
26615423	For statistical analysis, three randomly selected points along each wound were marked, and the horizontal distance between the migrating cells and the initial wound was measured at 24 and 48 h. Values were means ± standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments.	13147	13429
26615423	Differences between siRNA-treated and blank control data were determined by a Student’s t test, where P < 0.05 was considered significant.	13430	13568
26615423	After a 5-h exposure to CEP55 siRNA, negative control siRNA, or no treatment, SKOV3 and TOV-21G cells were cultured overnight on sterile glass coverslips in a six-well plate for 24 h. The cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 3.7 % paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1 % Triton-X100, and incubated in blocking solution (1 % BSA).	13569	13897
26615423	The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies against E-cadherin, N-cadherin, β-catenin, or fibronectin (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, UK) and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, USA).	13898	14188
26615423	The coverslips were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and imaged with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus FV1000, Japan).	14189	14341
26615423	Data were processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0.	14342	14387
26615423	All statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS 16.0 statistical software packages.	14388	14480
26615423	The associations of clinicopathological characteristics with the expression status of CEP55 were assessed using the chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test.	14481	14637
26615423	Bivariate correlations between studied variables were calculated by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients.	14638	14747
26615423	Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan–Meier method, and differences were analyzed using the log-rank test.	14748	14859
26615423	Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model on all significant characteristics determined using univariate analysis.	14860	15020
26615423	All P values were two-sided.	15021	15049
26615423	A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant in all cases.	15050	15129
26615423	Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses revealed high levels of CEP55 expression in all 11 ovarian cell lines tested compared with the immortalized normal ovarian epithelial cell line HOSEpiC (Fig.	15130	15321
26615423	1a, b).	15322	15329
26615423	In order to determine whether the CEP55 upregulation found in ovarian cancer cell lines was related to clinical biochemical indicators, we did Western blotting analysis on 12 paired epithelial ovarian carcinoma tissues and noncancerous tissues adjacent to ovarian tumors.	15330	15601
26615423	As shown in Fig.	15602	15618
26615423	2a, b, CEP55 protein expression was higher in all 12 epithelial ovarian carcinoma samples, displaying more than a threefold increase compared with that in the adjacent noncancer tissue samples.	15619	15812
26615423	These findings above are consistent with the results obtained in our immunohistochemical analysis (Fig.	15813	15916
26615423	2c).	15917	15921
26615423	Moreover, CEP55 was shown to be predominantly located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells (Figs.	15922	16014
26615423	2c and 3c).	16015	16026
26615423	As shown in Fig.	15602	15618
26615423	3a, Western blotting results indicated that CEP55 protein expression was low in normal ovarian tissue, benign ovarian cancer tissue, and borderline ovarian cancer tissue, while it was high in ovarian carcinoma tissues from patients at different clinical stages.	16044	16305
26615423	Interestingly, Western blot analysis showed that CEP55 protein expression levels were positively correlated with clinical stages of ovarian carcinoma patients.	16306	16465
26615423	To further determine whether CEP55 protein overexpression is associated with clinicopathological characteristics of epithelial ovarian cancer, 213 paraffin-embedded, archived ovarian cancer tissue samples were examined by immunohistochemical analysis.	16466	16717
26615423	The samples included 59 cases at stage I, 36 cases at stage II, 100 cases at stage III, and 18 cases at stage IV.	16718	16831
26615423	In the cohort, CEP55 expression in 213 enrolled patient samples was determined as strong in 99 cases (46.5 %) and weakly positive or negative in 114 cases (53.5 %) (Table 1).	16832	17006
26615423	As shown in Fig.	15602	15618
26615423	4, the immunoreactivity of CEP55 was detected at variable levels, and specific CEP55 staining was mostly found in the cytoplasm of carcinoma cells.	17024	17171
26615423	Additionally, the CEP55 protein expression was generally weak in early stage ovarian cancer (FIGO stages I and II), while it was strong in later stage ovarian cancer (FIGO stages III and IV) tissues (Fig.	17172	17376
26615423	3c).	16022	16026
26615423	Quantitative analysis indicated that the mean optical density (MOD) values of CEP55 staining in clinical stage I–IV primary tumors were statistically significantly higher than those in the normal control ovarian tissues.	17382	17602
26615423	In addition, the MOD values of CEP55 staining significantly increased with progression from stage I to IV (P < 0.001, Fig.	17603	17725
26615423	3b).	17726	17730
26615423	Taken together, these observations suggested that aberrant CEP55 expression was associated with the clinical development of primary ovarian tumors.	17731	17878
26615423	Statistical analyses were employed to detect the correlation between CEP55 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of ovarian cancer patients (Table 1).	17879	18046
26615423	As summarized in Table 2, no significant correlations were detected between the expression level of CEP55 protein and patient age, histological type, and serum CA125, CA199, NSE, CEA, β-HCG, or CA724 expression levels in patients with ovarian cancer.	18047	18297
26615423	However, CEP55 expression was markedly associated with clinical stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), intraperitoneal metastasis (P < 0.001), tumor recurrence (P < 0.001), differentiation grade (P < 0.001), residual tumor size (P < 0.001), ascites see tumor cells (P = 0.020), and serum CA153 level (P < 0.001) in patients with ovarian cancer.	18298	18657
26615423	Moreover, patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed tendencies to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and cytoreductive surgery (P = 0.020).	18658	18820
26615423	These data were further confirmed by association coefficient analyses assessing the correlation between CEP55 expression and clinicopathological features.	18821	18975
26615423	As shown in Table 3, correlations between CEP55 expression and clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, tumor recurrence, differentiation grade, residual tumor size, serum CA153 level, and ascites see tumor cells were 0.550 (P < 0.001), 0.328 (P < 0.001), 0.414 (P < 0.001), 0.607 (P < 0.001), 0.251 (P < 0.001), 0.235 (P < 0.001), 0.289 (P < 0.001), and 0.157 (P = 0.020), respectively.	18976	19389
26615423	To identify factors with potential prognostic significance in ovarian patients, univariate analysis for each variable was performed in relation to the survival time.	19390	19555
26615423	In our univariate analysis, stepwise inclusion of variables in the model indicated that significant prognostic factors included CEP55 protein level, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, FIGO stage, differentiation grade, recurrence, age, CA153 serum level, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	19556	19856
26615423	In addition, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that CEP55 protein level, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, FIGO stage, recurrence, age, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were indeed independent prognostic markers for ovarian cancer (Table 4).	19857	20123
26615423	To further determine the value of CEP55 expression in predicting survival of ovarian cancer patients, Kaplan–Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used in this study.	20124	20294
26615423	The log-rank test showed that the survival time was significantly different between these two groups.	20295	20396
26615423	As shown in Fig.	15602	15618
26615423	5, CEP55 expression in ovarian cancer patients was associated with survival time, with the patients expressing low CEP55 in their ovarian cancer lesions surviving much longer than those with high CEP55 expression (P < 0.001).	20414	20639
26615423	The cumulative OS and disease-free survival (DFS) rates for the patients with high levels of CEP55 expression were 38.9 and 43.6 %, respectively, whereas these rates were 84.5 and 91.6 %, respectively, for patients with low or no CEP55 expression.	20640	20887
26615423	Moreover, we analyzed the prognostic value of CEP55 expression in selected patient subgroups stratified according to characteristics of residual tumor size, serum CA125 level, serum CA153 level, serum CA199 level, differentiation, FIGO stage, intraperitoneal metastasis, and ascites see tumor size, as well as treatments of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), neoadjuvant chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and postoperative chemotherapy.	20888	21343
26615423	Patients with tumors exhibiting high CEP55 expression had a significantly shorter OS compared to those with low CEP55-expressing tumors in the residual tumor size ≤1 cm subgroup (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	21344	21553
26615423	6a), residual tumor size >1 cm subgroup (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	21554	21625
26615423	6b), CA125 >35 U/ml subgroup (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	21626	21686
26615423	6c), CA153 >25 U/ml subgroup (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	21687	21747
26615423	6d), CA199 >35 U/ml subgroup (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	21748	21808
26615423	6e), in those receiving HIPEC (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	21809	21870
26615423	6f), in the differentiation grade 1 and 2 subgroup (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	21871	21953
26615423	6g), in the differentiation grade 3 subgroup (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	21954	22030
26615423	6h), in those with ascites see tumor cells (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	22031	22105
26615423	6i), in the stage 1 and 2 subgroups (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	22106	22173
26615423	6j), in the stage 3 and 4 subgroups (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	22174	22241
26615423	6k), in those with intraperitoneal metastasis (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	22242	22319
26615423	6l), in those receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	22320	22400
26615423	6m), in those receiving cytoreductive surgery (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	22401	22478
26615423	6n), and in those receiving postoperative chemotherapy (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Fig.	22479	22565
26615423	6o).	22566	22570
26615423	To further investigate the role of CEP55 in the invasion of ovarian cancer, we transfected SKOV3 and TOV-21G cells with 200 pmol siRNA for 24 h, which offered the best silencing efficiency in our preliminary experiments.	22571	22791
26615423	Three different siRNA duplexes targeting CEP55 and a negative control siRNA were separately transferred into SKOV3 and TOV-21G cells.	22792	22925
26615423	At 24 h after transfection, we examined the resulting phenotype using Western blot analysis.	22926	23018
26615423	As shown in Fig.	15602	15618
26615423	7, CEP55 siRNA1 and CEP55 siRNA3 duplexes obviously reduced CEP55 protein in both ovarian cancer cell lines, and these more efficient siRNAs were therefore chosen for subsequent studies.	23036	23222
26615423	The data were obtained from densitometric analyses of the ratio of CEP55 to β-actin protein levels (n = 5 independent experiments).	23223	23354
26615423	Cancer cell migration and invasion are directly related to metastasis, and CEP55 has been reported to be related to the processes of cell mobility and cancer metastasis.	23355	23524
26615423	In order to determine whether CEP55 induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), we probed the cancer cell lines with epithelial and mesenchymal markers.	23525	23682
26615423	As shown in Fig.	15602	15618
26615423	7, SKOV3 and TOV21G cells showed high CEP55 levels and the typical EMT phenotype, including downregulation of epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin and upregulation of mesenchymal markers fibronectin and N-cadherin.	23700	23921
26615423	As shown in Fig.	15602	15618
26615423	7a, c, silencing endogenous CEP55 in SKOV3 and TOV21G cells led to enhanced expression of epithelial markers and concomitant decreased expression of mesenchymal markers.	23939	24108
26615423	The EMT phenotype was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining in SKOV3 and TOV-21G cells (Fig.	24109	24203
26615423	7b, d).	24204	24211
26615423	To further determine whether repression of CEP55 expression would inhibit SKOV3 and TOV-21G cell migration and invasion, a wound-healing assay and a cell invasion assay were performed on these two cell lines either untransfected or transfected with CEP55 siRNA1, CEP55 siRNA3, or negative control siRNA for 24 h. Results of the wound-healing assay revealed that the invasiveness of SKOV3 and TOV21G cells was dramatically hampered by the ablation of CEP55 (Fig.	24212	24673
26615423	8b).	24674	24678
26615423	As shown in Fig.	15602	15618
26615423	8a, the number of SKOV3 cells that passed through the filter in the CEP55 siRNA1- and siRNA3-treated groups was remarkably lower than that in the untreated or negative control treated siRNA groups, indicating that inhibition of CEP55 expression suppressed SKOV3 and TOV-21G cell invasion in vitro.	24696	24993
26615423	To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that highly expressed CEP55 in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma was significantly correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, tumor recurrence, differentiation grade, residual tumor size, ascites see tumor cells, and serum CA153 level.	24994	25328
26615423	Moreover, patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed a tendency to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery.	25329	25467
26615423	The loss of CEP55 function mediated by RNAi in ovarian cancer cell models indicated that suppression of CEP55 repressed cellular invasion, demonstrating the involvement of CEP55 in enhancing the migratory and invasive activity in ovarian cancer cells.	25468	25719
26615423	Furthermore, elevated expression levels of CEP55 protein served as independent prognostic factors for short OS and DFS rate in patients with EOC.	25720	25865
26615423	In light of these findings, our results suggest that overexpression of CEP55 protein is associated with tumor aggressiveness and may represent an independent prognostic factor for clinical outcomes in EOC patients.	25866	26080
26615423	Recent studies have indicated overexpression of CEP55 as an important event in patients with certain types of cancer.	26081	26198
26615423	Its elevated expression has been shown to be associated with carcinogenesis in bladder cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, and colon cancer [21–26].	26199	26350
26615423	Moreover, high CEP55 expression was found to promote progrowth signaling pathways resulting in cancer cell metastasis and poor patient prognosis [14, 23].	26351	26505
26615423	Altogether, these findings suggest that CEP55 may play an oncogenic role in cancer development and progression.	26506	26617
26615423	In our cohort, we examined the expression of CEP55 mRNA and protein in ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer samples.	26618	26742
26615423	We found that both CEP55 mRNA and protein showed aberrant expression levels in ovarian cancer tissues compared with noncancerous tissues, indicating that the overexpression of CEP55 occurred not only at the posttranscriptional level but also at the transcriptional level.	26743	27014
26615423	Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between CEP55 expression and the clinicopathological features of ovarian cancer patients.	27015	27145
26615423	We found that CEP55 protein expression was significantly correlated with FIGO stage, tumor recurrence, differentiation grade, residual tumor size, ascites see tumor cells, serum CA153 level, lymph node metastasis, and intraperitoneal metastasis strongly supporting the hypothesis that this protein plays a role in the progression of ovarian cancer.	27146	27494
26615423	Patients with CEP55 protein overexpression showed a tendency to accept neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery.	27495	27617
26615423	In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses showed high CEP55 protein expression as a predictor of poor prognosis in these patients.	27618	27756
26615423	Patients with elevated CEP55 expression showed a 38.9 % cumulative OS rate, which was significantly lower than that in patients with low expression levels of this protein (91.6 %).	27757	27937
26615423	Taken together, these findings provide with essential, reliable evidence for the clinical significance of CEP55 as an independent prognostic marker to identify ovarian cancer patients with poor prognosis.	27938	28142
26615423	Using CEP55 biomarker to identify patients with a higher risk of developing worse clinical outcome may thus help patients choose better treatment and reduce mortality.	28143	28310
26615423	To date, lymph node metastasis and intraperitoneal metastasis play important roles in determining the ovarian carcinoma staging.	28311	28439
26615423	According to FIGO (2013), stage III is divided into three substages: stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.	28440	28548
26615423	Moreover, stage IIIA is divided further into substages IIIA1 and IIIA2.	28549	28620
26615423	Ovarian cancer patients only with a positive retroperitoneal lymph node are classified as stage IIIA1, while patients with microscopic intraperitoneal metastasis are defined as stage IIIA2.	28621	28810
26615423	Furthermore, patients who have macroscopic intraperitoneal metastasis are determined as stage IIIB and IIIC.	28811	28919
26615423	In addition, recent studies reported that lymph node metastasis represents poor clinical prognosis for ovarian cancer patients.	28920	29047
26615423	Early diagnosis of intraperitoneal metastasis is pivotal for the survival of patients with EOC.	29048	29143
26615423	Therefore, having the ability to predict lymph node metastasis and intraperitoneal metastasis is critically important, but no ideal, preoperative marker has been established.	29144	29318
26615423	In our study, we found that aberrant CEP55 protein expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and intraperitoneal metastasis.	29319	29468
26615423	Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between shorter OS and high CEP55 protein expression in the subgroup with intraperitoneal metastasis, which indicates that CEP55 may be a useful prognostic marker for such ovarian cancer patients.	29469	29713
26615423	EMT has been found to contribute to invasion, metastatic dissemination, and acquisition of therapeutic resistance of cancer cells.	29714	29844
26615423	Several reports have shown that CEP55 plays an important role in regulating EMT.	29845	29925
26615423	For example, increased CEP55 expression was reported to promote EMT in nasopharyngeal carcinoma via the osteopontin/CD44 pathway [23, 24].	29926	30064
26615423	Chen et al. showed that CEP55 could regulate EMT through the CEP55/FOXM1/MMP-2 pathway in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.	30065	30191
26615423	Moreover, overexpression of CEP55 was shown to regulate EMT through the VEGF-A/PI3K/AKT pathway in lung cancer.	30192	30303
26615423	Here, we suppressed CEP55 expression by siRNA and demonstrated, for the first time, that downregulation of CEP55 remarkably repressed ovarian cancer cellular invasion and reversed EMT.	30304	30488
26615423	However, further studies are required to obtain a detailed picture of CEP55-related signaling pathways in regulating ovarian cancer EMT.	30489	30625
26615423	Although primary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer for many years, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery has emerged as a new alternative treatment.	30626	30873
26615423	National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines indicate that patients with a clear diagnosis of histopathology, patients with ascites cytology showing malignant tumor cells, as well as those with a physical examination and imaging examination or exploratory laparotomy determining that the tumor would be difficult to remove should accept neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	30874	31247
26615423	Recent studies have shown the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer patients.	31248	31351
26615423	Kang et al. found that neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not only equally effective but also a substantially safer strategy compared with standard treatment.	31352	31504
26615423	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgical cytoreduction, is reportedly a promising treatment strategy for the management of advanced EOC.	31505	31647
26615423	Interestingly, ovarian cancer patients in our study with aberrant CEP55 protein expression had a tendency to accept neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	31648	31789
26615423	Moreover, upregulation of CEP55 protein expression was significantly associated with ascites see tumor cells, which is one of the indications for accepting neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	31790	31971
26615423	In a more detailed analysis of survival, we observed a significant correlation between shorter OS and high CEP55 expression in the subgroup with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	31972	32142
26615423	This finding suggests that CEP55 may be a useful prognostic marker for ovarian cancer patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	32143	32268
26615423	Primary cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy are standard treatments for advanced ovarian cancer.	32269	32377
26615423	In our cohort, patients with high expression of CEP55 protein showed a significant tendency to obtain cytoreductive surgery.	32378	32502
26615423	Furthermore, we found that higher CEP55 protein expression was correlated with a significantly shorter OS in the cytoreductive surgery subgroup.	32503	32647
26615423	However, no correlation was observed in the subgroup without cytoreductive surgery.	32648	32731
26615423	This result indicates that CEP55 protein expression is a more significant predictor of prognosis for ovarian cancer patients who require cytoreductive surgery.	32732	32891
26615423	Currently, postoperative chemotherapy is the main treatment for ovarian cancer patients who have been treated with cytoreductive surgery.	32892	33029
26615423	Our study identified a significant correlation between shorter OS and high CEP55 expression in the postoperative chemotherapy subgroup.	33030	33165
26615423	This finding suggests that CEP55 may be a useful prognostic marker for ovarian cancer patients with postoperative chemotherapy.	33166	33293
26615423	One of the most distinct features of EOC is the tendency to disseminate into the peritoneal cavity and remain confined to the peritoneum and intra-abdominal viscera.	33294	33459
26615423	The peritoneal barrier enables the targeted delivery of chemotherapy directly to the peritoneal tumors, which makes it an ideal target for locoregional therapy.	33460	33620
26615423	In randomized trials, intraperitoneal therapy following frontline surgery has shown a significant impact on survival.	33621	33738
26615423	Improved long-term results can be achieved in highly selected patients using cytoreductive surgery in combination with HIPEC.	33739	33864
26615423	For advanced ovarian cancer, a curative therapeutic approach combining optimal cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC should be considered as it may achieve long-term survival in patients with a poor prognosis, even in those with chemoresistant disease.	33865	34111
26615423	Here, our data showed that patients with high CEP55 protein expression did not have a significant tendency to receive HIPEC.	34112	34236
26615423	However, a significant correlation was found between higher CEP55 expression and shorter OS in the HIPEC subgroup, which indicates that CEP55 expression is an important prognostic factor of ovarian cancer patients who accept HIPEC.	34237	34468
26615423	In this cohort, we demonstrated the upregulated expression of CEP55 in EOC cells and surgical specimens and reported, for the first time, the correlation of CEP55 protein expression with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, tumor recurrence, differentiation grade, residual tumor size, ascites see tumor cells, serum CA153 level, as well as prognosis in patients with EOC.	34469	34871
26615423	Patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed tendencies to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery.	34872	35000
26615423	Moreover, CEP55 may induce ovarian cancer lymph node metastasis through regulating EMT.	35001	35088
26615423	Taken together, our results suggest that CEP55 may be a marker predicting unfavorable outcomes in ovarian carcinoma and plays a significant role in the migration and invasion of human EOC.	35089	35277
25622904	CRL (Cullin-RING ligase) is the multi-complex E3 ubiquitin ligase with SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F box protein), also known as CRL1, as its founding member.	0	148
25622904	CRL consists of four components: an adaptor protein (e.g. SKP1), one of seven cullin family members (e.g., Cul-1), a substrate recognizing receptor (e.g., F-box protein Skp2), and one of two small RING family proteins: RBX1/ROC1 and SAG/RBX2/ROC2.	149	396
25622904	While the receptor protein determines the substrate specificity, the cullin-RING components constitute the core ubiquitin ligase activity.	397	535
25622904	Activity of CRL also requires cullin neddylation.	536	585
25622904	By promoting the ubiquitylation of various regulatory proteins for targeted degradation by 26S proteasome, CRL regulates many biological processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle progression, signal transduction, DNA replication, embryogenesis, and tumorigenesis,.	586	851
25622904	SAG (Sensitive to Apoptosis Gene), also known as RBX2 (RING box protein-2), ROC2 (regulator of cullins-2), or RNF7 (RING finger protein 7), an evolutionarily conserved small RING-containing protein with 113 amino acids, is the second member of the ROC/RBX/RING component of the CRL E3 ubiquitin ligases.	852	1155
25622904	In response to various stimuli (e.g., ROS, mitogen and hypoxia), SAG is induced at the transcriptional level by transcription factors AP-1 and HIF1α, respectively.	1156	1319
25622904	Induced SAG then recruits other components of CRL E3s to promote the ubiquitylation and degradation of various substrates, including c-Jun, HIF-1α, IκBα,, Nf-1, NOXA, p27, and pro-caspase-3 in a cell context, temporal, and spatial dependent manner.	1320	1568
25622904	In human tissues, SAG overexpression was detected in carcinomas of lung, colon, stomach and liver, which is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients,,.	1569	1734
25622904	In whole animals, SAG over-expression via injection of SAG expressing recombinant adenovirus or transduction of a Tat-SAG fusion protein protected mouse brain tissues from ischemia/hypoxia-induced damage,.	1735	1940
25622904	SAG transgenic expression in mouse skin inhibited tumor formation at the early stage by targeting c-Jun/AP1, but enhanced tumor growth at the later stage by targeting IκBα to activate NFκB in a DMBA-TPA carcinogenesis model, and promoted UVB-induced skin hyperplasia by targeting p27.	1941	2225
25622904	Targeted Sag deletion in mouse caused embryonic lethality at E11.5-12.5, which is associated with overall growth retardation, induction of apoptosis, and poor vasculogenesis.	2226	2400
25622904	Conditional Sag deletion in endothelial cells also caused embryonic lethality around E15.5.	2401	2492
25622904	Finally, we recently showed that Sag is required for lung tumorigenesis triggered by KrasG12D.	2493	2587
25622904	However, it is unknown whether Sag is required for proper cell proliferation, or for immortalization, induced by a mutant Kras.	2588	2715
25622904	In this study, we investigated these roles of Sag E3 ligase and report here that Sag is required for proliferation and Kras-induced immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).	2716	2902
25622904	We showed that genetic deletion of Sag remarkably suppresses proliferation and abrogates immortalization by inducing senescence.	2903	3031
25622904	Mechanistically, we found that Jun-B, a transcription factor, that drives p16 expression, is a novel substrate of Sag E3.	3032	3153
25622904	Targeted Sag deletion causes accumulation of Jun-B to transactivate p16, which in turn induces senescence.	3154	3260
25622904	Significantly, simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, a gene encoding p16, completely rescued senescence phenotype, regardless of KrasG12D status.	3261	3401
25622904	We further found that Sag deletion significantly inactivates Mapk signaling pathway by directly inhibiting constitutively active KrasG12D activity.	3402	3549
25622904	Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a growth essential gene required for cell proliferation as well as for Kras-induced immortalization, indicating that Sag plays a role at very early stage of neoplastic transformation.	3550	3786
25622904	Thus, Sag targeting may have a value for chemoprevention, as well as for senescence-based cancer therapy, particularly in human cancers harboring a mutant Kras.	3787	3947
25622904	We recently found that Sag inactivation via the gene trap (gt) approach induced embryonic lethality at E11.5-12.5 stage, which is associated with growth retardation, induction of apoptosis, and poor vasculogenesis, and attributable at least in part to inactivation of Ras-MAPK signals via Nf1 accumulation.	3948	4254
25622904	To further define the role of Sag in cell proliferation, we generated primary MEFs and found that while early passage MEF cells from Sag+/+ or Saggt/+ (not shown) mice proliferated well with a doubling time of ~ 48 hours, Saggt/gt MEF cells underwent a complete growth arrest (Figure 1, A and B).	4255	4551
25622904	To further confirm this finding, we generated MEFs from conditional Sagfl/fl mice., Sagfl/fl MEFs upon infection with Ad-Cre, but not Ad-GFP control, showed a complete elimination of Sag protein (Figure 1C) and complete growth arrest, as measured by ATP-lite proliferation assay (Figure 1D) and BrdU incorporation assay (Figure 1E).	4552	4884
25622904	Thus, Sag is required for proper growth of MEFs.	4885	4933
25622904	Significantly, both Saggt/gt MEFs and Sagfl/fl MEFs after Ad-Cre infection to eliminate Sag demonstrated a flattened and enlarged morphology with a positive p16 staining (Figure 2, A and B), reminiscent of premature senescence,.	4934	5162
25622904	Furthermore, at passage 6, about 55% of Sag-null MEFs was stained positively for senescence-associated β-Gal (SA-β-Gal), as compared to only 2.4% of wild-type MEFs (Figure 2C).	5163	5339
25622904	Finally, we found that Sag deletion caused accumulation of p16, but not of p15, nor p53/p21 (Figure 2D).	5340	5444
25622904	Thus, Sag inactivation induces a premature senescence phenotype via the p16 pathway, rather than the p15 pathway, nor the p53/p21 axis.	5445	5580
25622904	Given the fact that p16 contains no lysine residue, it is unlikely that p16 is a direct ubiquitylation substrate of Sag E3 ligase.	5581	5711
25622904	We then determined if accumulation of p16 protein upon Sag deletion is due to enhanced transcription of p16 mRNA.	5712	5825
25622904	Indeed, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis in two lines of primary MEFs isolated from two independent Sagfl/fl embryos showed that p16 mRNA levels were much higher in Ad-Cre infected MEFs, as compared to MEFs infected with Ad-GFP control (Figure 3A).	5826	6075
25622904	Thus, regulation of p16 occurred at the transcriptional level.	6076	6138
25622904	Given that Sag is the RING component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase required for its ligase activity, Sag disruption would be expected to cause the accumulation of its substrates.	6139	6314
25622904	We next focused on a known substrate of SCFFbxw7 E3 ligase, Jun-B, which is also a transcription factor known to positively regulate p16.	6315	6452
25622904	Indeed, we found that Sag deletion in MEFs increased Jun-B protein (Figure 3B), but not Jun-B mRNA (Figure 3A), indicating that Sag-mediated regulation occurred likely at the posttranslational level.	6453	6652
25622904	It has been previously shown that Fbxw7 is the F-box protein that mediated the ubiquitylation and degradation of Jun-B, and that Fbxw7 is associated with Sag for targeted degradation of NF-1.	6653	6844
25622904	We, therefore, determined whether Sag-Jun-B could form a complex in vivo and found that indeed, endogenous Sag is associated with endogenous Jun-B (Figure 3C).	6845	7004
25622904	Furthermore, we found Sag overexpression shortened the protein half-life of endogenous JUN-B (Figure 3D), whereas Sag silencing extended it (Figure 3E).	7005	7157
25622904	Finally, we found that MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8 activating enzyme, which indirectly inhibits SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase by cullin deneddylation,, effectively extended the protein half-life of JUN-B (Figure 3F).	7158	7385
25622904	Taken together, our results demonstrated that Jun-B is a novel substrate of Sag E3 ubiquitin ligase and Jun-B accumulation, as a result of Sag deletion, transactivates p16 to induce senescence.	7386	7579
25622904	We next investigated whether accumulated Jun-B or p16 plays a causal role in senescence induced by Sag deletion.	7580	7692
25622904	Indeed, we found that lentivirus-based Jun-B silencing rescued the effect of Sag deletion, as evidenced by abrogation of p16 increase and suppression of senescence (Figure 4, A and B).	7693	7877
25622904	We further crossed Sagfl/fl mice with Cdkn2a-/- mice and generated Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a-/- mice.	7878	7969
25622904	MEFs were generated from these mice, along with Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a+/+ control mice, and infected with Ad-Cre to delete Sag or Ad-GFP as the control (Figure 4C).	7970	8127
25622904	Remarkably, simultaneously deletion of Cdkn2a, a gene encoding p16, completed rescued senescence induced by Sag deletion, as measured by SA-β-Gal staining (Figure 4D), as well as by 3T9 protocol which measures cumulative population doubling time by serial passaging (Figure 4E).	8128	8406
25622904	To determine the effect of Sag inactivation on immortalization, triggered by mutant KrasG12D, we generated MEFs from compound mice with genotypes of LSL-KrasG12D and Sagfl/+ or Sagfl/fl, respectively.	8407	8607
25622904	We first confirmed that a) KrasG12D was activated in MEFs after infection of Ad-Cre, but not Ad-GFP control, through the Cre-recombinase mediated removal of Lox-STOP-Lox (LSL) fragment (Figure 5A), and b) Sag was inactivated in MEFs with genotype of Sagfl/fl, but not Sagfl/+ after Ad-Cre infection (Figure 5B).	8608	8919
25622904	We further observed that upon Ad-Cre infection, MEF cells with KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl genotype showed a reduced growth rate (Figure 5C) with a premature senescence phenotype starting at passage 8, as evidenced by a significant increase of SA-β-Gal positive population (Figure 5D) and by failure in cumulative population doubling, measured by 3T9 protocol (Figure 5E).	8920	9282
25622904	In contrast, KrasG12D;Sagfl/+ MEF cells proliferated well and showed no sign of senescence up to passage 18 (Figure 5, C–E), indicating an immortalized phenotype, consistent with what was reported for KrasG12D;Sag+/+ MEFs.	9283	9505
25622904	More specifically, MEFs at passage 8 with Sag inactivation and even in the presence of KrasG12D activation showed a flattened morphology with positive senescence-associated β-Gal (SA-β-Gal) staining (Figure 5D).	9506	9717
25622904	Thus, Sag is required for KrasG12D-mediated immortalization.	9718	9778
25622904	Mechanistically, we found that Sag inactivation again fails to cause accumulation of p15 or p53/p21, but does trigger accumulation of p16 (Figure 5F), which is likely contributing to senescence induction.	9779	9983
25622904	Given that p16 is accumulated in senescent KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl MEFs, we next determined whether p16 again plays a causal role.	9984	10108
25622904	We generated MEFs with the following 4 genotypes: 1) KrasG12D;Sagfl/+;Cdkn2a+/+, 2) KrasG12D;Sagfl/+;Cdkn2a-/-, 3) KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a+/+, and 4) KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a-/- and found Cdkn2a deletion, which caused completely depletion of p16 protein (Figure 6A), rescued decreased growth rate of KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a+/+ MEFs (Figure 6B).	10109	10455
25622904	More importantly, Cdkn2a deletion rescued senescence phenotype seen in KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a+/+ MEFs, completely, as measured by the SA-β-Gal staining (Figure 6C), and partially, as measured by the 3T9 protocol (Figure 6D).	10456	10682
25622904	It is worth noting that the rescue effect appears to be less effective in the presence of KrasG12D, which extended the senescence occurring time from passage 6 to 9 in Sag-null MEFs (compare Figure 4E vs.	10683	10887
25622904	Figure 6D).	10671	10682
25622904	Nevertheless, p16 plays a key role in senescence triggered by Sag deletion, largely independent of KrasG12D, although the senescence process is being delayed if KrasG12D is present.	10900	11081
25622904	Finally, we investigated the potential mechanism by which Sag deletion abrogates the ability of active KrasG12D to immortalize primary MEFs.	11082	11222
25622904	We focused directly on the Kras activity by a classic RBD (Ras-binding domain of Raf-1) pull-down assay and found that Sag deletion significantly reduced Kras activity with no effect on total Ras levels (Figure 7A).	11223	11438
25622904	Consistent with inactivation of Kras, Ras-Mapk signaling pathway was also inactivated, as evidenced by markedly reduction of Erk phosphorylation (Figure 7A).	11439	11596
25622904	Few recent studies have shown that Ras/Erk activation is associated with ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation, which could triggers senescence,,, and we have previously shown that Sag has antioxidant activity,,.	11597	11812
25622904	We, therefore, used DCFHDA staining to measure ROS levels and found that Sag deletion had no significant effect on ROS generation (Figure 7B), excluding the involvement of ROS in the process.	11813	12004
25622904	Finally, we measured the levels of several natural occurring inhibitors of Ras signalling pathway, including Erbin, Nf1, Rkip, Spred2, and Spry2, and found that Sag deletion caused a moderate increase of Nf1, Rkip and Spred2, but not Erbin and Spry2 (Figure 7A), suggesting that Nf1, Rkip and Spred2 may contribute to inactivation of KrasG12D pathway.	12005	12356
25622904	Sag, a stress inducible protein, has been shown to play a significant role in a variety of cellular processes, including embryogenesis, vasculogenesis, and apoptosis (for review see).	12357	12540
25622904	Our recent study has shown that Sag is involved in tumor angiogenesis and required for KrasG12D-induced lung tumorigenesis.	12541	12664
25622904	Here we report a novel finding that Sag genetic inactivation in MEFs induces senescence, as evidenced by flattened cell morphology, enhanced staining of SA-β-Gal and p16.	12665	12835
25622904	Mechanistically, we found that senescence triggered by Sag deletion is caused by p16, not by the p15 pathway, nor the p53/p21 axis.	12836	12967
25622904	We further showed that Jun-B is a novel substrate of Sag E3 ubiquitin ligase, as evidenced by a) the binding between Sag and Jun-B under physiological conditions, likely through Fbxw7, since Sag directly binds to Fbxw7, and Fbxw7 binds to Jun-B, b) Sag overexpression shortens protein half-life of Jun-B, whereas Sag silencing extends it; and c) pharmaceutical inactivation of Sag E3 by MLN4924 extends Jun-B half-life.	12968	13387
25622904	Jun-B, upon accumulated following Sag deletion, transactivates p16 expression to induced senescence.	13388	13488
25622904	Finally we showed by a genetic rescuing experiment that p16 accumulation is the cause, not the consequence, of premature senescence, triggered by Sag deletion.	13489	13648
25622904	Thus, we identified that the Sag-JunB-p16 axis regulates proper proliferation of MEFs by preventing senescence.	13649	13760
25622904	It is well-known that immortalization of primary fibroblasts can be induced by a single oncogene, whereas transformation will require collaboration of two oncogenes or one oncogene in combination with the loss of a tumor suppressor gene,.	13761	13999
25622904	It is also known that overexpression of an active Ras oncogene (Hras or Kras) in primary MEFs induces premature senescence,, whereas expression of KrasG12D at physiological levels immortalizes MEFs and induces proliferation.	14000	14224
25622904	In this study, we showed that Sag deletion blocks KrasG12D-induced immortalization again through inducing senescence, although appearance of senescence induced by Sag deletion was delayed.	14225	14413
25622904	Mechanistically, we showed that Sag is required for the maintenance of KrasG12D activity, since Sag deletion significantly reduces such an activity, leading to inactivation of Ras-Raf-Mapk signaling pathway.	14414	14621
25622904	Among few naturally occurring inhibitors of Ras, we identified that Sag deletion caused moderate increase of Nf1, Rkip and Spred2.	14622	14752
25622904	However, accumulated Nf1 is unlikely to inactivate KrasG12D, since Nf1 with GAP activity is a naturally occurring inhibitor of wild-type Ras, but not mutant constitutively active Ras, which has very low intrinsic GTPase activity and insensitive to RasGAPs,.	14753	15010
25622904	Similarly, other two Ras inhibitors, Rkip and Spred2, are not direct inhibitors of KrasG12D, although they block Ras mediated signaling pathway and contribute to its inactivation.	15011	15190
25622904	Thus, exactly mechanism by which Sag deletion inactivates KrasG12D activity remains elusive.	15191	15283
25622904	Finally, we showed that abrogation of Kras-induced immortalization by inducing senescence as a result of Sag deletion is causally related to p16, but not to ROS generation, and it can be largely rescued by simultaneous depletion of p16 encoding gene Cdkn2a.	15284	15541
25622904	In summary, we showed here that on one hand, Sag promotes cell proliferation by inducing ubiquitylation and degradation of Jun-B to prevent p16 transactivation.	15542	15702
25622904	On the other hand, Sag cooperates with KrasG12D to trigger immortalization by maintaining an active Ras-Raf-Mapk signaling pathway.	15703	15834
25622904	Likewise, Sag inactivation by genetic deletion causes Jun-B accumulation to induce p16 expression and subsequent premature senescence.	15835	15969
25622904	Sag inactivation also blocks the Ras-Raf-Mapk signaling pathway to inhibit proliferation (Figure 8).	15970	16070
25622904	Future study is directed to elucidate the mechanism by which Sag maintains KrasG12D in a constitutively active form.	16071	16187

27643404	Abbreviations ADH alcohol dehydrogenase ALDH aldehyde dehydrogenase CI confidence interval HR hazard ratio LD linkage disequilibrium; OR odds ratio PRACTICAL PRostate cancer AssoCiation group to Investigate Cancer‐associated ALterations in the genome SNP single nucleotide polymorphism Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in developed countries, with 758,700 new cases diagnosed and 142,000 deaths in 2012.1 With increasing uptake of prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) testing and the ageing population, prostate cancer incidence is increasing.2 The factors influencing prostate cancer incidence and survival after diagnosis are poorly understood, therefore more evidence is needed.3 Alcohol is a carcinogen associated with oropharyngeal, liver, breast, colorectal and oesophageal cancers.4 Functional variation in the genes involved in alcohol metabolism result in altered exposure to the carcinogenic metabolites of ethanol, suggesting a mechanism for genetic sensitivity to alcohol to influence the pathogenesis of cancers.5 For example, populations with an increased prevalence of common genetic variation in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene, that results in reduced enzyme activity, have an increased risk of oesophageal cancer compared with populations with the fully active enzyme.4 At present the role of alcohol use on prostate cancer remains uncertain.	0	1370
27643404	The World Cancer Research Fund's extensive report based on systematic reviews described the evidence as limited and inconclusive,6 and the International Association for Research on Cancer did not list this cancer site amongst others more apparently caused by alcohol in their Monograph on alcohol's carcinogenicity.4 There have been conflicting reports of possible associations of alcohol with various stages or histological grades of prostate cancer,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and meta‐analyses have highlighted the inconsistencies, emphasising the need for further research in this area.13, 14 The majority of evidence about the effects of alcohol on prostate cancer is from observational studies.	1371	2063
27643404	One potential limitation of traditional observational research is that the findings can potentially be explained by common causes of both exposure and outcome (confounding factors).	2064	2245
27643404	Other potential sources of bias are reverse causation and recall bias, where having prostate cancer affects drinking behaviour or its reporting, rather than alcohol consumption increasing the risk of prostate cancer.	2246	2462
27643404	A prospective study design could mitigate both of these problems, but could still be affected by bias in the form of the “sick quitter” effect, where former heavy drinkers reduce their alcohol intake in middle‐age because of comorbidities that may be alcohol‐related.	2463	2730
27643404	Mendelian randomisation is an approach that uses genetic variants robustly associated with exposures of interest, or their metabolic effects, as instrumental variables to test the un‐confounded and unbiased causal effects of those exposures and their metabolic effects with cancer.15 Mendelian randomisation analyses rely on two approximate laws of Mendelian genetics,15, 16 that at meiosis alleles segregate without any influence of environmental factors and that the inheritance of one trait is independent of the inheritance of others.	2731	3269
27643404	This allows genetic variation to be used in epidemiological studies as an un‐confounded proxy for an environmental exposure,15, 16, 17 in this case alcohol consumption, to estimate the influence of cumulative life‐time risk of exposure, to reduce recall bias and the “sick‐quitter” effect and to negate reverse causation.	3270	3591
27643404	All these features are limitations of previous conventional observational studies.7, 8, 13 Mendelian randomisation has already been used successfully in both cardiovascular18, 19 and cancer epidemiology20, 21, 22, 23, 24 to clarify the causal effects of alcohol on disease.	3592	3865
27643404	In this study, we undertook Mendelian randomisation analyses in which we used variants in alcohol metabolising genes influencing metabolism and intake, to test the causal effect of alcohol exposure on prostate cancer risk and progression.	3866	4104
27643404	The motivation is that if alcohol intake causally increases prostate cancer risk or progression, then genetic variants associated with metabolic effects of alcohol or increased intake will be differentially represented in cases and controls.	4105	4346
27643404	We stratified the analysis by histological prostate cancer grade, based on Gleason score, as low‐ and high‐grade prostate cancers have differing natural histories which could be influenced by different risk factors.	4347	4562
27643404	We used phenotypic and genotypic data from 46,919 men (23,868 cases) in the international Prostate cancer association group to investigate cancer‐associated alterations in the genome (PRACTICAL) consortium.	4563	4769
27643404	Data were provided by 25 studies within the consortium, based in USA, Australia and European countries.	4770	4873
27643404	This study population was limited to those of European ethnicity.	4874	4939
27643404	The studies used a number of methods of recruitment, including screen and clinically detected cases and participants selected due to a family history of prostate cancer.	4940	5109
27643404	The background characteristics of the participants of each study are shown in Table 1.	5110	5196

27643404	The participants were genotyped using a custom Illumina Infinium genotyping array (iCOGS), which was specifically designed for the Collaborative Oncological Gene‐environmental Study (COGS) and recorded 211,155 SNPs (details available from: http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/cancer/fp7-projects/cogs_en.html).25, 26 The iCOGS array was designed to investigate SNPs in regions thought to be associated with breast, ovarian and prostate cancer; 68,638 of the SNPs on the array were chosen because of their potential role in prostate cancer aetiology.	5514	6080
27643404	The other 125,877 SNPs were selected on the basis of potential importance for other cancers and common SNPs known to be associated with any other traits.	6081	6234
27643404	Individuals with fewer than 95% of genotypes called, or high or low heterozygosity (p < 1 × 10−5) were dropped from our analysis.	6235	6364
27643404	In total 201,598 SNPs passed quality control.	6365	6410
27643404	The genotypic data were used to impute SNPs which were not directly genotyped, but were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with genotyped SNPs.	6411	6550
27643404	We used the HapMap 2 CEU reference panel and IMPUTE2 software.27 In this study, we searched the iCOGS array database for all alcohol‐metabolising genetic variants (within Alcohol Dehydrogenases (ADHs) or Aldehyde Dehydrogenases (ALDHs) genes), and identified 68 common variants in 5 distinct genomic regions: the ADH cluster on chromosome 4, comprising ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C and ADH7; ALDH1A1 and ALDH 1B1 on chromosome 9; ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3 on chromosome 15.	6551	7009
27643404	Of these SNPs, 67 were directly genotyped, and one was imputed.	7010	7073
27643404	An overview of the genes' role in alcohol metabolism and behaviour is shown in Supplementary material Table S1.	7074	7185
27643404	The characteristics of the SNPs included in this study are shown in Supplementary material Table S2.	7186	7286
27643404	We converted the genotypic data for each SNP into a count of the number of minor alleles at each locus.	7287	7390
27643404	We used logistic regression to estimate the associations of the SNPs with prostate cancer risk (cases vs. controls), for all cases and stratified by high‐ vs. low‐grade disease.	7391	7568
27643404	In a case‐only analysis, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate associations of each SNP with prostate cancer‐specific mortality, stratified by grade of prostate cancer.	7569	7755
27643404	All regression analyses were adjusted for the first 8 principal components of population stratification, since these genomic regions show marked variation across different populations and so do prostate cancer incidence and survival.	7756	7989
27643404	When checking the proportional hazards assumption, we found little evidence of violation.	7990	8079
27643404	These regressions were performed for each study and then meta‐analysed using both fixed‐ and random‐effects models.	8080	8195
27643404	Studies were excluded from the survival meta‐analysis if there were <5 deaths during the follow up period or <90% completion of follow up data.	8196	8339
27643404	We investigated between‐study heterogeneity using the Stata metan command to estimate the I 2 statistic assuming a fixed‐effect model; we also report random‐effect models for completeness as such models may be relevant where I 2 values are high (e.g., >75%).28 Using meta‐regression, we investigated whether heterogeneity could be explained by the following a priori defined study‐specific characteristics: mean age at diagnosis, mean PSA at diagnosis, country of study (USA vs. elsewhere), and the percentage of participants with a family history of prostate cancer.	8340	8907
27643404	Manhattan plots of the associations in the five chromosomal regions were constructed to identify SNPs exceeding the Nyholt corrected p values threshold for association —a multiple testing correction which accounts for LD between the SNPs.29 Sensitivity analyses were conducted by reclassifying low‐ and high‐grade disease as <8 and 8–10 Gleason grade, respectively.	8908	9273
27643404	The power of our study was also assessed using reverse power calculations to demonstrate the effect size we would expect to detect given our sample size and α = 0.05 with SNPs of a range of minor allele frequencies.30 The analysis was carried out using Stata v.13.1.	9274	9540
27643404	The statistical code used to produce these results can be accessed here (https://github.com/nmdavies/practical-alcohol/).	9541	9662
27643404	The background characteristics of the participants are summarised in Table 1, by study.	9663	9750
27643404	Variation between studies reflects their individual recruitment methods (e.g., some studies selected for those men with a positive family history of prostate cancer).	9751	9917
27643404	The Manhattan plots with results from both fixed and random effects meta‐analyses testing associations between SNPs in the five genomic regions and prostate cancer risk are presented in Figure 1 (detailed results available in Supplementary material Tables S4–S9, and sensitivity analyses with alternative definitions of low‐ and high‐grade presented in Supplementary material Tables S16–S19).	9918	10310
27643404	The figure and Supplementary material tables show that no SNP exceeded the Nyholt corrected p values threshold for association with prostate cancer risk.	10311	10464
27643404	In case‐only analyses, four SNPs exceeded the Nyholt corrected p values threshold for association with prostate cancer‐specific mortality in the fixed‐effect meta‐analysis (summary Manhattan plots presented in Figure 2, and individual SNP results presented in Supplementary material Tables S10–S15, with results of sensitivity analyses with alternative definitions of low‐ and high‐grade presented in Supplementary material Tables S20–S23).	10465	10905
27643404	Three SNPs within ALDH1A2 were associated with prostate cancer mortality following diagnosis with any prostate cancer: rs1441817 (fixed effects hazard ratio, HRfixed = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (95%CI):0.66,0.91, p values = 0.002, I 2 = 19.4); rs12910509, HRfixed = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91, p values = 0.003, I 2 = 23.0); and rs8041922 (HRfixed = 0.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91, p values = 0.002, I 2 = 25.5).	10906	11308
27643404	To identify the top independent signal amongst these three, we conducted jointly adjusted analyses.	11309	11408
27643404	Levels of pairwise LD were too high to attempt study‐specific analyses (pairwise LD rs1441817 and rs12910509 r 2 = 0.89, rs1441817 and rs8041922 r 2 = 0.88, rs12910509 and rs8041922 r 2 = 0.99).31 Pooled analyses were conducted to estimate the joint effects of rs1441817 and rs12910509/rs8041922 (r 2 = 0.99) on prostate cancer survival, with a random effect correction for standard errors.	11409	11799
27643404	These showed an independent effect of rs1441817, similar in size to that of univariate analyses, but no independent effect of rs12910509/rs8041922 once adjusting for rs1441817.	11800	11976
27643404	Given the high LD between the three SNPs, they should be taken as representing one underlying genetic signal.	11977	12086
27643404	Figure 3 presents the forest plot of individual studies contributing to the meta‐analysis of prostate cancer‐specific survival in association with the top independent signal in ALDH1A2.	12087	12272
27643404	A fourth SNP, rs10973794 in ALDH1B1 (also close to IGFBPL1), was associated with prostate cancer mortality in men with a diagnosis of low‐grade prostate cancer (HRfixed = 1.43; 95%CI:1.14,1.79, p values = 0.002, I 2 = 23.4, Fig.	12273	12501
27643404	4).	12502	12505
27643404	This result was robust to changing the low‐grade definition to <8 (HRfixed = 1.23; 95% CI:1.06,1.41, p values = 0.002, I 2 = 0, Supplementary material Table S22).	12506	12668
27643404	In general, random effects meta‐analyses yielded weaker evidence of association than fixed‐effect models, as one would expect due to variability across studies producing larger confidence intervals for the former.	12669	12882
27643404	However, levels of heterogeneity as quantified by the I 2 statistics were low, with point estimates remarkably similar across the two types of meta‐analysis.	12883	13040
27643404	Meta‐regression analyses found limited evidence that the study‐level characteristics examined had a strong influence on the pooled results (Table 2).	13041	13190
27643404	Using data from the PRACTICAL Consortium, we pooled data from 25 studies including a total of 23,868 prostate cancer cases and 23,091 controls, to investigate the association of 68 SNPs within genes thought to be involved with alcohol metabolism with prostate cancer risk and prostate cancer‐specific mortality (amongst men diagnosed with prostate cancer), overall and by Gleason grade.	13191	13577
27643404	After correcting for multiple testing in the fixed‐effect meta‐analysis, no SNPs exceed the Nyholt threshold for association with a diagnosis of prostate cancer, whereas three SNPs in ALDH1A2 (in strong LD with each other, therefore representing one signal only) exceed the Nyholt threshold for association with prostate cancer‐specific survival.	13578	13924
27643404	One SNP in ALDH1B1 also exceeds the Nyholt threshold for association with prostate cancer‐specific survival in low‐grade prostate cancer.	13925	14062
27643404	There is evidence that genetic variations in ADH and ALDH genes affecting ethanol metabolism32, 33, 34, 35 are associated with altered alcohol intake and risk of alcohol dependence.31, 35, 36, 37 The most extensively studied SNP in the context of alcohol intake is rs1229984 in ADH1B.	14063	14347
27643404	It has been shown to be associated with increased adverse effects from alcohol intake and reduced consumption.35, 36 On average minor allele carriers drink 17.2% fewer units/week (95%CI:15.6%, 18.9%), are less likely to be in the top third of alcohol drinking volume (odds ratio, OR = 0.7; 95%CI:0.68,0.73) and are less likely to binge drink (OR = 0.78; 95%CI:0.73,0.84).23 It has also been reported to affect cancer risk at various sites.5 In our study, the associations of this SNP with prostate cancer diagnosis and survival were ORfixed = 1.00 (95%CI:0.96,1.03, p values = 0.87), and HRfixed = 1.11 (95%CI:0.95,1.30, p values = 0.17), respectively.	14348	15000
27643404	Combining the effects of the ADH1B SNP on alcohol intake with the upper confidence intervals from our results implies that a 17% reduction in alcohol consumption is unlikely to reduce prostate cancer risk by >3% and prostate cancer mortality by >5%.	15001	15250
27643404	Alcohol is metabolised to acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen, and there is evidence to support the theory that genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes, which control the production and breakdown of acetaldehyde, contribute to carcinogenesis.4, 5, 20, 24 There is also evidence of a tissue‐specific interaction in the prostate between ethanol and retinoic acid, through modulations of ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3 levels.38 To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive investigation of the association between ADH and ALDH variants, as genetic proxies for alcohol, and prostate cancer to date.	15251	15853
27643404	Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer has been examined by GWASs, which shows common genetic variants can explain 33% heritability of prostate cancer but no genome‐wide significant hits are in ADHs or ALDHs39, 40 (however, this lack of evidence from GWASs could be a type 2 error).	15854	16139
27643404	Similarly, we did not find any evidence of genetic association between ADH/ALDH variants and prostate cancer incidence in this study.	16140	16273
27643404	Possible reasons for this include type 2 error, especially if the underlying effects of alcohol on prostate cancer incidence are small and limited to the very heavy drinking behaviours and/or to the more aggressive forms of disease, as possibly suggested by the recent literature.7, 12 We have shown that SNPs in ALDH1A2 are associated with altered prostate cancer‐specific mortality in a case‐only analysis.	16274	16682
27643404	None of these SNPs appear to have regulatory features (www.ensemble.org), so they are unlikely to be causal variants themselves but rather they could be in LD with the causal variants.	16683	16867
27643404	Recently, ALDH isoforms have been suggested as possible mechanistic mediators of metastasis in prostate cancer in particular41 and other solid tumours in general.42 One study found lack of compelling evidence linking variation in ALDH1 (including ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3 and ALDH1B1) with prostate cancer progression,41 but another had reported preliminary evidence for a potential role of ALDH1A2 as a tumour suppressor gene in prostate cancer cell lines43 and decreased expression of ALDH1A2 has been associated with shorter recurrence free survival in patients with prostate cancer.43 In our study, three intronic SNPs in ALDH1A2 were associated with longer survival, none of which were directly or indirectly (through LD) associated with alcohol‐related phenotypes (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).	16868	17668
27643404	One potential explanation for our results may be that these SNPs, or others in LD with them, lead to increased activity in ALDH1A2.	17669	17800
27643404	We speculate that the observed prostate cancer survival effect could be the result of a net increase in the synthesis of retinoic acid (by ALDH1A2), which is particularly beneficial when the rate of conversion is affected by slower ADH activity in the presence of alcohol consumption (retinol and ethanol both being ADH substrates,44 and ethanol modulating retinoic acid synthesis in the rat prostate38).	17801	18205
27643404	Another intronic SNP in ALDH1B1 (also close to IGFBPL1) was found to be associated with increased mortality following a diagnosis of low‐grade prostate cancer.	18206	18365
27643404	ALDH1B1 is the second most abundant mitochondrial ALDH, after ALDH2, with documented involvement in alcohol metabolism and dependence.45 However, this specific SNP is not known to be in LD with any of the variants associated with alcohol phenotypes to date, therefore we cannot speculate on its specific role in relation to alcohol.	18366	18698
27643404	Evidence has been previously found linking levels of ALDH1B1 to survival following gastric cancer46 and non‐small‐cell lung cancer,47 but not prostate cancer,41 however the latter was a study in vitro Conversely,ALDH1A1 expression in the prostate has been reported to be a good candidate prognostic biomarker, based on all cause mortality and to a lesser extent prostate cancer‐specific mortality,48 and ALDH1A3 expression is thought to be involved with initiation and progression of several cancers,49 however we did not observe an association with common germ‐line mutations in either of these genes, or did we observe associations with variation in ADH genes.	18699	19361
27643404	This could be due to different functional effects of variants on metabolic levels (e.g., alcohol and acetaldehyde peak levels and cumulative concentrations), affecting prostate cancer proliferation or survival differently both in terms of effect sizes and pathways.	19362	19627
27643404	In this study, we have found that genetic variants in genes involved in alcohol metabolism were associated with disease‐specific mortality in men with prostate cancer, most of whom had been diagnosed with low‐grade disease.	19628	19851
27643404	We found a signal specific to low‐grade prostate cancer survival, but none for high‐grade disease.	19852	19950
27643404	Possible reasons why stronger associations were not seen with high‐grade cancers include: limited power, as there were smaller numbers of high‐ compared with low‐grade cases (this was investigated using a reverse power calculation, to assess the power of this study to detect small associations (Supplementary material Table S3)); patients behaviour may change following a diagnosis, e.g. patients with high‐grade prostate cancer may be too ill to drink and the effect of the SNPs cannot be seen in the absence of drinking; or the findings could reflect a true clinical difference in the way alcohol affects survival for the different grades of prostate cancer.	19951	20612
27643404	The strengths of this study include the large sample size and availability of data on both risk and mortality stratified by grade, which is an important predictor of prognosis.	20613	20789
27643404	Importantly, we used a Mendelian randomisation approach, which minimises the potential for bias due to confounding, information bias (recall bias and sick‐quitter effect) and reverse causation, major limitations of previous studies in this area.7, 8, 13 We were also able to control for confounding by population stratification by adjusting for basic population characteristics.	20790	21168
27643404	A potential limitation of our study is its power to detect small effects of alcohol on high‐grade disease, with fewer of these cases having been diagnosed and followed‐up.	21169	21340
27643404	Data for this study were contributed to the PRACTICAL Consortium from many studies with varying recruitment and inclusion/exclusion criteria, as different screening practices could complicate the interpretation of our results.50 For example, CAPS participants were all diagnosed clinically, whereas ProtecT participants were all screen detected.	21341	21686
27643404	While the consortium provides a large sample size for investigation, there is inevitably some heterogeneity in the contributing studies.	21687	21823
27643404	The effect of this was investigated using random effects meta‐analysis and meta‐regression.	21824	21915
27643404	No one study‐level characteristic had a strong influence on the results, and we were unable to clearly determine the reason for the modest levels of heterogeneity observed, and the consequent variation between the fixed‐effect and random‐effect analyses.	21916	22170
27643404	Potential explanations include: systematic differences in smaller vs. larger studies, and the former being assigned larger weights in random‐effect models; true variation in the effects of alcohol in the different study populations; effects of study designs that we were not able to investigate, e.g. the different ways cases were ascertained/recruited.	22171	22524
27643404	Another possible limitation to consider is the potential influence of pleiotropy.	22525	22606
27643404	There may be other direct pathways through which the SNPs influence prostate cancer mortality independently of alcohol metabolism and intake.	22607	22748
27643404	In particular, SNPs in ALDH1A2 could have a role in retinoic acid synthesis, which could affect cancer survival per se and in conjunction with alcohol,38 and we note that the ALDH1B1 SNP is in close proximity to IGFBPL1, which may encode a putative tumour suppressor protein.51 However, there were no other associations of these SNPs, or others in LD with them, reported by the catalogue of published genome‐wide association studies (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/); therefore the risk of pleiotropy for the genetic variants under study here is likely to be small.	22749	23309
27643404	Finally, the direction of effect of the SNPs on alcohol intake, apart from rs1229984, is unknown so it is not possible to estimate the effect size of the four SNPs we found to be associated with survival.	23310	23514
27643404	There are a number of ways in which this work could be taken forward.	23515	23584
27643404	These include further analysis in larger consortia with longer follow up data availability, or repeating within individual subsets with certain study design characteristics to increase similarity of studies included in analysis (direct replication).	23585	23834
27643404	Analysis of further genetic variants with known effects on alcohol metabolism or behaviour would also allow further development of this work (indirect replication), as would establishing the magnitude and direction of effect of genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes on alcohol intake.	23835	24128
27643404	It would also be interesting to investigate patient behaviour following diagnosis to establish if the varied effect seen between high‐ and low‐grade disease could be due to differences in behaviour.	24129	24327
27643404	If confirmed in independent studies or through direct or indirect replication, these findings suggest a role for alcohol in the progression of prostate cancer, whilst also confirming that alcohol is unlikely to have a large impact on prostate cancer carcinogenesis.	24328	24593
27643404	This has potential public health implications and alcohol intake could be targeted to improve survival from prostate cancer as part of holistic care.	24594	24743
29049388	Recessive mutations in the NPHS2 gene, coding for the podocyte membrane protein podocin, constitute the most common genetic cause of childhood-onset nephrotic syndrome [1, 2].	0	175
29049388	Podocin is part of a multi-protein complex at the podocyte slit diaphragm that serves to recruit nephrin to the plasma membrane and link the slit diaphragm to the podocyte cytoskeleton [3–5].	176	367
29049388	Focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the typical histopathological finding of podocin-related glomerulopathy and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) inevitably occurs, although the age at first disease manifestation and the rate of disease progression are rather variable.	368	658
29049388	The phenotype is to a major degree related to the type and position of the mutations.	659	744
29049388	Among more than 120 pathogenic mutations described to date the p.R138Q (c.413G>A) mutation is the most common, at least among Caucasians, representing 32% and 44% of all mutated alleles in two large European series [8, 9].	745	967
29049388	The resulting substitution of the highly conserved glutamine at this position for arginine leads to protein misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [3, 10].	968	1143
29049388	The R138Q mutation is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to ESRD.	1144	1232
29049388	Several mouse models of podocin-related glomerulopathy have been developed over the past decade to elucidate the function of the protein, study the natural course of the disease and assess potential therapeutic approaches [10–12].	1233	1463
29049388	A constitutive podocin knockout (Nphs2-/-) mouse model revealed the requirement of podocin for the correct assembly of nephrin at the slit diaphragm.	1464	1613
29049388	However, constitutive absence of podocin led to developmental arrest of podocytes and lethal renal failure at neonatal age.	1614	1737
29049388	Subsequently, to mimic the most common human genetic abnormality, a mouse strain carrying the R140Q mutation (knockin), the murine analogue of human R138Q, was generated.	1738	1908
29049388	Unfortunately, similar to the knockout model, the constitutive knock-in mice died from renal failure within the first 1–2 weeks of life.	1909	2045
29049388	More recently, an inducible podocin knockout mouse model was generated using inducible Cre recombinase technology.	2046	2160
29049388	In these mice bearing one Nphs2 allele with a floxed exon 2, one null Nphs2 allele, and a podocyte-expressed, tamoxifen-responsive Cre recombinase transgene, podocin loss was induced by tamoxifen injection.	2161	2367
29049388	When podocin deficiency is induced postnatally in mature kidneys, massive albuminuria develops which is followed by glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure, with death occurring at a median time of 11 weeks after induction of podocin deficiency.	2368	2622
29049388	While this phenotype resembles the course of podocin-related nephropathy in humans, the inducible podocin knockout model does still not allow one to study the fate of R140Q mutant podocin and mutation bearing podocytes in vivo.	2623	2850
29049388	Therefore, the inducible podocin knockout is not a suitable model to explore innovative therapeutic approaches aimed to rescue R140Q mutant podocin function.	2851	3008
29049388	Here, we combined the previous approaches to generate a novel inducible knock-in mouse model of podocin-associated glomerulopathy.	3009	3139
29049388	Cross-breeding of animals carrying one floxed podocin allele, one podocin allele bearing the R140Q mutation, and a tamoxifen-sensitive inducible Cre transgene enabled us to induce hemizygosity for the R140Q mutant, i.e. a genetic condition closely mimicking the human disease.	3140	3416
29049388	We provide a detailed characterization of this potentially useful model of the most common single genetic abnormality causing human hereditary nephrotic syndrome.	3417	3579
29049388	Proteinuria became detectable within few days (day 7: 3.48 ± 0.74 g/g creatinine in Nphs2R140Q/- mice vs. 1.70 ± 0.16 g/g creatinine in healthy controls) and increased to a maximum 4–5 weeks after induction of Nphs2R140Q/- using tamoxifen.	3580	3819
29049388	Thereafter proteinuria decreased gradually but remained much elevated compared to controls until the end of the observation period (Fig 1A).	3820	3960
29049388	Weight gain ceased in the proteinuric animals, leading to significantly lower body weight from week 6 onward (Fig 1B).	3961	4079
29049388	Blood pressure moderately increased in Nphs2R140Q/- animals compared to healthy controls (Fig 1C).	4080	4178
29049388	Four weeks after induction Nphs2R140Q/- animals displayed hypoalbuminemia (20.4 ± 1.9 g/l vs. 30.8 ± 1.7 g/l), hypercholesterolemia (345 ± 34 mg/dl vs. 76 ± 6.9 mg/dl) and diminished creatinine clearance (121 ± 21 μl/min vs. 171 ± 33 μl/min) compared to healthy controls (Fig 1D–1F).	4179	4462
29049388	The median survival time of the Nphs2R140Q/- animals was 12 (95% CI: 11–13) weeks (Fig 1G).	4463	4554
29049388	The expression of wild type (wt) podocin mRNA rapidly decreased after induction of the hemizygous state.	4555	4659
29049388	Notably, R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated in Nphs2R140Q/- animals during the first four weeks of observation compared to healthy controls (Fig 2A).	4660	4817
29049388	By contrast, podocin protein abundance was significantly reduced starting from week one (to 48% of that of healthy controls) and was almost completely abolished eight weeks after induction (to 4% of that of healthy controls) (Fig 2B).	4818	5052
29049388	The loss of podocin in Nphs2R140Q/- animals progressed to subtotal to total podocin loss at the end stage disease.	5053	5167
29049388	These findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence studies (Fig 3).	5168	5236
29049388	The Nphs2R140Q/- animals displayed significant early glomerular sclerosis from the first week after induction (glomerular sclerosis index (GSI) 0.39, p = 0.003).	5237	5398
29049388	Subsequently the GSI progressively increased until week eight, when 100% of glomeruli were partially or globally sclerosed (Fig 4).	5399	5530
29049388	In addition, the mice developed significant tubular atrophy and severe interstitial fibrosis, which were visible from the first week after induction and increased to 12% of the total kidney area in the course of disease until end-stage kidney disease was reached (Fig 5A–5E).	5531	5806
29049388	Tubulointerstitial fibrosis at four weeks was quantitatively correlated with the degree of proteinuria two weeks after disease induction (p = 0.01; Fig 5F).	5807	5963
29049388	The number of podocytes per glomerulus progressively diminished with time starting at the end of the second week after induction (68% of that of healthy controls) to 18% of that of healthy controls at 12–16 weeks (Fig 6A).	5964	6186
29049388	Podocyte loss was also visualized by Wt1 labeling (Fig 6B–6E).	6187	6249
29049388	Electron microscopy showed irregularly shaped or fused foot processes one week after induction (Fig 7A and 7B), progressing to effacement and global fusion at subsequent time points (Fig 7C and 7D).	6250	6448
29049388	At variance to the previously described glomerular basement membrane (GBM) denudation as a mechanism of glomerular sclerosis, our Nphs2R140Q/- mice did not display any area of GBM denudation in ultrastructural studies.	6449	6667
29049388	3D modelling of the glomerular structure revealed GBM thickening in induced animals relative to controls.	6668	6773
29049388	Moreover, four weeks after induction the podocyte foot processes number per μm GBM was significantly decreased in addition to severe loss of foot process organization (Fig 7E–7H).	6774	6953
29049388	To investigate possible post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in our model, we searched for differences in the expression of miRNA-21 and miRNA-193a, previously described to be involved in chronic kidney failure [15–21].	6954	7187
29049388	In kidneys of Nphs2R140Q/- and control animals one, two and four weeks after induction, miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first four weeks of disease whereas miRNA-193a expression was increased by 100% within one week after induction and reached a peak after two weeks (Fig 8).	7188	7484
29049388	The induction of hemizygous R140Q podocin expression in our model resulted in a progressive glomerulopathy with a nephrotic phenotype gradually evolving to renal failure.	7485	7655
29049388	The histopathological sequence of renal lesions includes foot process effacement, podocyte loss, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.	7656	7804
29049388	Previous mouse models of hereditary podocytopathies included deficiency or selective mutation of nephrin, podocin [10, 11], α-actinin 4, CD2AP, laminin β2 [25–27], TRPC6 and α3 (IV) collagen [29–31] (Table 1).	7805	8014
29049388	Most of these models are characterized either by severe renal developmental defects and congenital nephrotic syndrome leading to early demise [10, 11, 22, 25–27] or by incomplete penetrance [23, 28].	8015	8214
29049388	The conditional inactivation of normal protein expression achieved by use of an inducible CreLox system allows inducing and describing comprehensively a uniform renal phenotype established at postnatal age, well after completion of nephrogenesis.	8215	8461
29049388	In our model, proteinuria appeared within days after induction of the hemizygous knockin state and peaked after four weeks.	8462	8585
29049388	Hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia, the other key biochemical features of nephrotic syndrome, manifested within two weeks of disease induction.	8586	8729
29049388	Proteinuria gradually decreased in the second and third month as the animals developed progressive FSGS, hypertension and renal failure.	8730	8866
29049388	Death from uremia occurred mainly between week 6 and 16, with an average survival time of 11 weeks.	8867	8966
29049388	The observed phenotype closely resembles that of the inducible podocin knockout mouse model previously developed by the group of C. Antignac, with similar time courses of proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and death in uremia.	8967	9190
29049388	However, the model presented here provides a better molecular recapitulation of human disease as complete podocin deficiency rarely occurs in humans.	9191	9340
29049388	Furthermore, the production of a podocin protein with defective folding due to a single amino acid exchange and consecutive retention in the ER renders the model suitable for in vivo screening of candidate chaperone compounds that would stimulate protein trafficking to the membrane.	9341	9624
29049388	With regards to the timing and extent of histopathological and ultrastructural changes, it is worth noting that at the earliest stage of disease mild proteinuria was observed in the presence of still almost normal EM findings (showing some unincisive irregular FPs), whereas the progression to higher grade proteinuria was associated with pronounced foot process fusion and effacement (Fig 7).	9625	10018
29049388	These findings are in keeping with previous reports of hereditary podocytopathy models including the inducible podocin kockout model [5, 12, 32].	10019	10164
29049388	No invasion of GBM by podocytes was observed as has been reported for collagen IV nephropathy and other models of glomerular disease.	10165	10298
29049388	FSGS is the typical histopathological lesion found in renal biopsies of patients with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) due to NPHS2 mutations [2, 34, 35].	10299	10464
29049388	The Nphs2R140Q/- mice demonstrated very similar histomorphology starting with segmental glomerular scarring in individual glomeruli that progressed gradually to almost all glomeruli, leading to terminal renal failure.	10465	10682
29049388	Several FSGS subtypes including the collapsing, glomerular tip lesion and crescent variants were observed along with diffuse foot process effacement and podocyte loss.	10683	10850
29049388	These lesions might occur secondary to podocyte detachment [36, 37] or result from altered expression of genes encoding important structural or functional components of the podocytes.	10851	11034
29049388	Toxin-induced podocyte depletion studies in a transgenic rat model revealed a quantitative correlation of glomerulosclerosis with the extent of podocyte loss.	11035	11193
29049388	Also in the model presented here, the development and progression of glomerulosclerosis is likely to result from gradual podocyte depletion.	11194	11334
29049388	In support of this notion, podocyte loss correlated with the significant increase of the glomerular sclerosis index, which was noted four weeks after induction.	11335	11495
29049388	While podocyte loss is believed to be essential for developing glomerulosclerosis, the mechanisms leading to podocyte detachment remains elusive.	11496	11641
29049388	Specifically, it is not even clear whether podocytes detach because they die or due to loss of adhesion.	11642	11746
29049388	Podocyte loss in this model is compatible with either mechanism since intact podocin is essential both for podocyte survival and for the maintenance of foot process structure and function.	11747	11935
29049388	Furthermore, although no GBM denudation could be detected in our model, massive podocyte hypertrophy observed in our animals (e.g.	11936	12066
29049388	Fig 7D) could promote podocyte stress leading to podocyte loss and subsequent development of glomerulosclerosis [40, 41].	12067	12188
29049388	The percentage of sclerotic glomeruli, as well as the area affected by sclerosis in each glomerulus, increased with time in Nphs2R140Q/- animals, a process presumably enhanced by increasing hyperfiltration stress to podocytes in remaining glomeruli once a critical mass of nephrons was obliterated.	12189	12487
29049388	Tubulointerstitial fibrosis was visible from the end of the first week after disease induction and was enhanced after four weeks (Fig 5).	12488	12625
29049388	The degree of tubulointerstitial fibrosis was correlated with the preceding degree of proteinuria after disease induction.	12626	12748
29049388	Ample experimental evidence supports that nephrotic range albuminuria is toxic to tubular epithelial cells and a potent cause of tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis.	12749	12923
29049388	In addition, it has been hypothesized that ‘misdirected filtration’ with diffusion of ultrafiltrate into the peritubular space may occur in segmental glomerulosclerosis following synechial attachment of the GBM to Bowman’s capsule.	12924	13155
29049388	On the molecular level, we observed a gradual loss of podocin protein (both by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining) following induction of the hemizygous knockin state.	13156	13337
29049388	A reduction of podocin abundance by more than 50% was observed within one week following induction.	13338	13437
29049388	Due to the inactivation of the floxed wt podocin allele in Nphs2 R140Q/- animals the expression of wt podocin mRNA decreased, however R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated during the first four weeks after induction.	13438	13659
29049388	Significant upregulation of R140Q podocin mRNA was previously showed in the R140Q podocin knockin mouse model.	13660	13770
29049388	The diminished podocin protein abundance in face of elevated mutated Nphs2 gene expression is in keeping with intracellular retention and increased proteasomal degradation of mutant protein as previously demonstrated in vitro for the R138Q mutation [44, 45].	13771	14029
29049388	When glomerulosclerosis was fully established after four weeks, podocin abundance had dropped to less than 10% of that of controls.	14030	14161
29049388	At that time the number of podocytes per glomerulus had only decreased by one third of that of healthy controls and R140Q podocin mRNA expression was still elevated, indicating that podocin protein loss at this stage of the disease was a specific consequence of the hemizygous mutated state with enhanced intracellular degradation rather than a consequence of early global podocyte depletion.	14162	14554
29049388	In order to elucidate key molecular responses to the podocin mutated state, we chose to study the expression of miR-193a and miR-21 based on a review of the recent literature.	14555	14730
29049388	miR-193a was found highly upregulated in glomeruli isolated from FSGS patients and it has been shown that its overexpression in an inducible mouse model led to focal and later global glomerulosclerosis with broad capsular adhesion [15, 16].	14731	14971
29049388	We observed an early and transient upregulation of miR-193a in our model, supporting the notion that this miRNA is an important player in the sequence of molecular events leading to FSGS in hereditary podocytopathies caused by functional deficiency of a single podocyte protein.	14972	15250
29049388	The major target of miR-193a is WT1, which plays an essential role in the development and maintenance of podocytes [16, 46, 47].	15251	15379
29049388	Repression of WT1 upon upregulation of miR-193a initiates a cascade of events resulting in structural destabilization and disrupted function of podocytes, leading to progressive FSGS.	15380	15563
29049388	Intriguingly, we found that upregulation of miR-193a two weeks after disease induction was followed by a reduction in Wt1 expression in week 4 (Fig 9).	15564	15715
29049388	The function of miR-21 in animal models of kidney injury is controversial.	15716	15790
29049388	In some models of kidney disease upregulation of miR-21 promotes kidney injury [17–19], whereas other studies suggest that increased miR-21 expression might rather activate protective molecular programs that would attenuate tubulointerstitial and glomerular injury [20, 21].	15791	16065
29049388	Our finding that miR-21 is upregulated in Nphs2 R140Q/- animals compared with controls is consistent with a function of miR-21 in promoting glomerular injury.	16066	16224
29049388	In conclusion, we have generated an inducible mouse model of podocin nephropathy with a disease course and histopathological features closely resembling the human disorder.	16225	16397
29049388	The inducible Nphs2 R140Q/-knockin mouse is the ideal model to test the efficacy of antiproteinuric therapies including novel molecular approaches targeting the underlying molecular defect.	16398	16587
29049388	C57BL/6 mouse lines transgenic for Cre+/-, Nphs2+/- and Nphs2lox2/lox2 and Nphs2+/R140Q were previously established in collaboration with the Mouse Clinical Institute (Institut Clinique de la Souris, Illkirch, France) and described in Mollet et al., 2009 and Philippe et al., 2008, respectively.	16588	16883
29049388	The two lines Cre+/-, Nphs2+/- and Nphs2lox2/lox2 were crossed and offspring mice with Nphs2lox2/+, Cre+/- and Nphs2lox2/-, Cre+/- genotypes were subsequently used for further matings.	16884	17068
29049388	Nphs2lox2/lox2, Cre+/+ mice, resulting from mating between Nphs2lox2/+, Cre+/- and Nphs2lox2/-, Cre+/- mice, were then crossed with the Nphs2+/R140Q mice.	17069	17223
29049388	The resulting Nphs2lox2/R140Q, Cre+/- mice were used for the final experiments.	17224	17303
29049388	All animal experiments were performed in compliance with EU regulations for animal experimentation.	17304	17403
29049388	The project was approved by the Government of Baden-Württemberg, Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, Germany under Aktenzeichen 35–9185.81/G-191/09 and 35–9185.81/G-181/15.	17404	17571
29049388	Hemizygosity for the R140Q allele was induced in six weeks old Nphs2lox2/R140Q, Cre+/- mice by intraperitoneal administration of tamoxifen (33 mg/kg/day for 5 days; Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO), dissolved in sunflower oil (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO).	17572	17824
29049388	The resulting mice were named Nphs2 R140Q/- in the manuscript.	17825	17887
29049388	Control mice with the same genotype (Nphs2lox2/R140Q, Cre+/-) received the equivalent volume of sunflower oil without tamoxifen.	17888	18016
29049388	Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment (S1 Table) of Interfaculty Biomedical Facility (IBF) (Clinical experimental area- KEB), Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg, where their health and behaviour were controlled daily by skilled animal takers.	18017	18275
29049388	All experiments were conducted in accordance with the German Law on Animal Welfare (TierSchG), paragraph § 8 –animal experiments—from 7 June 2006 (BGBI.	18276	18428
29049388	I S. 1313).	18429	18440
29049388	All research staff handling with animals was trained in accordance with the recommendations of the GV-SOLAS (Society of laboratory animal science) and the FELASA (Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations) in a class B course.	18441	18687
29049388	The onset and course of proteinuria was monitored by weekly collection of 24-hour urine in metabolic cages (Tecniplast, Hohenpeißenberg, Germany).	18688	18834
29049388	Proteinuria was monitored weekly until the time of sacrificing.	18835	18898
29049388	Starting from the first week after tamoxifen administration, the animals were accustomed to tail-cuff plethysmography according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Coda—Kent Scientific Corporation).	18899	19100
29049388	Thereafter, blood pressure measurements (25 cycles per session per mouse) were obtained once weekly by tail-occlusion plethysmography.	19101	19235
29049388	The median values of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure of accepted cycles were taken as representative for the session.	19236	19365
29049388	At least four control and four induced mice were sacrificed at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 after tamoxifen administration or followed open end for max.	19366	19520
29049388	35 weeks for survival studies.	19521	19551
29049388	In case of anorexia of about 50% or cachexia over 10%, as specific endpoint criteria, the affected animal was euthanized immediately.	19552	19685
29049388	Only 16 animals died spontaneously during the whole observation time.	19686	19755
29049388	At defined experimental time points animals were deeply anesthetized with CO2 and blood was obtained by cardiac puncture.	19756	19877
29049388	The sacrificed mice were then perfused with 10 ml 0.9% NaCl solution.	19878	19947
29049388	Both kidneys were excised and decapsulated and samples were collected for RNA and protein isolation, histopathological analysis, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy.	19948	20120
29049388	Urine protein concentration was measured according to the Bradford method.	20121	20195
29049388	Blood urea, serum albumin, creatinine and cholesterol, and urinary creatinine were measured using standard laboratory methods.	20196	20322
29049388	Approximately 1 μg of total RNA obtained from kidney tissue blocks using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was reverse transcribed with oligo (dT)/random hexamer primers (10:1).	20323	20512
29049388	Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed with the StepOne Plus Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with specific primers for 18 S (forward: 5'-AGTTGGTGGAGCGATTTGTC- 3'; reverse: 5'-CGGACATCTAAGGGCATCAC- 3'), Nphs2 WT (forward: 5'-GTCCTCGCCTCCCTGATCTT-3'; reverse: 5'-AGGAAGCAGATGTCCCAGTC-3'), Nphs2 R140Q (forward: 5'-GTCCTCGCCTCCCTGATCTT-3'; reverse: 5'-AGGAAGCAGATGTCCCAGCT-3'), Nphs2 total (forward: 5'-TTGATCTCCGTCTCCAGACCTT-3'; reverse: 5'-TCCATGCGGTAGTAGCAGACA- 3'), Wt1 (forward: 5'-GAAATGGACAGAAGGGCAGA-3'; reverse: 5'-GACCCCGTGGGTGTGTATT-3'), and Universal Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR green to detect PCR products at the end of each amplification step.	20513	21255
29049388	Serial dilutions of an arbitrary cDNA pool were used to establish a standard curve.	21256	21339
29049388	Relative quantities of RNA levels were determined, accounting for amplification efficacy by the software provided with the PCR system.	21340	21474
29049388	Messenger RNA levels were normalized to corresponding 18S quantities, determined within the same run.	21475	21576
29049388	The analysis of miRNA-21 (5'- UAGCUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUGA-3') and miRNA-193a (5'- AACUGGCCUACAAAGUCCCAGU-3') was performed by qPCR by CBC (Comprehensive Biomarker Center GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).	21577	21769
29049388	Delta CT values were normalized to endogenous snoRNA 202 (NCBI Accession: AF357327) and snoRNA 234 (NCBI Accession: AF357329).	21770	21896
29049388	Snap-frozen kidney tissues were homogenized on ice with CHAPS buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 μl CHAPS buffer per mg tissue).	21897	22032
29049388	Samples were then vortexed and centrifuged (4000 g) for 35 min at 4°C.	22033	22103
29049388	Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured according to Bradford method and 30 μg of total protein were denatured in 4× sample buffer separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%, SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a PVDF Transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).	22104	22393
29049388	The membranes was blocked in 5% milk and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with primary rabbit anti-podocin antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4°C (1:1000), followed by incubation with the second antibody (HRP-anti-rabbit, 1:3000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA).	22394	22694
29049388	The membrane was visualized using chemiluminescent detection.	22695	22756
29049388	Equal protein loading was confirmed by reprobing the membrane for GAPDH (1:20000) (Meridian Life Sciences, Memphis, USA).	22757	22878
29049388	Signal intensity was evaluated densitometrically (Quantity one software, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).	22879	22975
29049388	Kidney tissues fixed in 4% buffered formalin were paraffin-embedded and 3 μm thick sections were stained with Masson-Trichrome for qualitative and Sirius Red for quantitative analysis of tissue fibrosis, and with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) to determine the degree of sclerosis within the glomerular tuft.	22976	23280
29049388	Samples stained with Sirius Red were scanned using Aperio Spectrum software (Aperio Technologies).	23281	23379
29049388	Images were captured using Aperio ImageScope software at total magnification of 300.	23380	23464
29049388	The percentage of sirius red–stained tubulointerstitial area was measured in 30 randomly sampled fields per kidney using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) as described previously.	23465	23673
29049388	The degree of sclerosis within the glomerular tuft as a parameter of renal disease progression was determined in a blinded manner on PAS-stained paraffin sections using the semiquantitative scoring system.	23674	23879
29049388	Images of scanned sections were captured at total magnification of 300.	23880	23951
29049388	For each animal the glomerular sclerosis index (GSI) was derived as the mean of 50 glomeruli.	23952	24045
29049388	The glomerular score for individual glomeruli was: grade 0—normal glomerulus; grade 1—mesangial proliferation/sclerosis involving less than 25% of the glomerular tuft; grade 2—sclerosis involving more than 25%, but less than 50% of the glomerular tuft; grade 3—sclerosis involving more than 50%, but less than 75% of the glomerular tuft; grade 4—diffuse glomerulosclerosis with total tuft obliteration.	24046	24448
29049388	The fractional sclerosed area within the glomerular tuft was determined using Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).	24449	24590
29049388	The number of podocytes per glomerulus was determined according to the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium protocol (www.diacomp.org).	24591	24740
29049388	Samples were treated with Wt1 antibody from LifeSpan Biosciences, Seattle, WA.	24741	24819
29049388	Tissues frozen in Tissue-Tek Gel (Sakura, Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands) were cut in 5 μm sections, fixed in acetone/methanol solution (1:1), washed with PBS and incubated with DCS antibody dilution buffer (Innovative Diagnostik-Systeme, Hamburg, Germany) overnight at 4°C.	24820	25100
29049388	Samples were then incubated with primary rat anti-mouse Nidogen antibody (1:6000) (Millipore) to stain the basal membranes for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by washing and treating with donkey anti-rat antibody (DyLight 549 red, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) diluted 1:2000 for 1 hour at room temperature.	25101	25410
29049388	After washing steps, samples were blocked again in DCS for 1 hour at room temperature.	25411	25497
29049388	After just tipping the blocking solution away the primary rabbit anti mouse podocin antibody diluted (1:1000) (Sigma) or the primary rabbit anti mouse Wt1 antibody diluted (1:400) (LifeSpanBiosciences, Seattle, WA, USA) was added and incubated overnight at 4°C or 1 hour at room temperature, respectively.	25498	25803
29049388	After washing the secondary donkey anti rabbit antibody (DyLight 488 green, Dianova) (1:1000 for Podocin and 1:250 for Wt1) was added (1 hour, room temperature).	25804	25965
29049388	Nuclei were labelled using bisbenzimide (diluted 1:1000 in water) (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany).	25966	26061
29049388	Slides were examined using a Leica DMI 4000 B microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL, USA).	26062	26147
29049388	Renal tissue samples (1 mm3) were stored in EM fixation solution (phosphate buffer containing 1.5% Glutaraldehyde und 1.5% Paraformaldehyde) at 4°C until embedding.	26148	26312
29049388	Following embedding with Epon and subsequent polymerisation, ultra-thin sections were obtained using diamond knives (Diatome®, Hatfield, PA or Drukker®, Drukker International BV, the Netherlands) with a Leica® UltraCut microtome (Leica, Deerfield, IL, USA).	26313	26570
29049388	The samples were then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed under a ZEISS EM 10A transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).	26571	26750
29049388	Kidney samples were prepared for SBF-SEM as described previously.	26751	26816
29049388	In brief, mouse kidneys were cut into 1 mm cubes and fixed in situ by using 2% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde (Agar Scientific, UK) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2); stained in 1% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide, 1.5% (wt/vol) potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, followed by 1% (wt/vol) thiocarbohydrazide.	26817	27128
29049388	After washing, more osmium was added by staining in 1% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide, and soaked in 1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate overnight.	27129	27262
29049388	The final staining step incubation was performed at 60°C with lead aspartate pH 5.5 for one hour.	27263	27360
29049388	Samples were dehydrated in ethanol and infiltrated in TAAB 812 hard resin.	27361	27435
29049388	Tissue was mounted onto an aluminium cryo pin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat.	27436	27517
29049388	no.	27518	27521

27292643	Genomic instability is one of the main enabling features of cancer, setting the path for subsequent events of uncontrolled growth, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011).	0	202
27292643	One of the most studied mechanisms of generating genomic variability is aberrant distribution of chromosomes during cell division, known as chromosomal instability (CIN) (Boveri, 1912).	203	388
27292643	Large-scale analyses of human tumors predict that 86% of solid and 72% of hematopoietic malignancies are aneuploid (Zasadil et al., 2013).	389	527
27292643	CIN gene signatures have become an important prognostic tool to evaluate patient survival and therapeutic outcome (Carter et al., 2006, Habermann et al., 2009).	528	688
27292643	However, deregulation of CIN genes in vitro causes a decrease in cellular fitness through p53-mediated cell death and metabolic stress because of protein imbalance (Li et al., 2010, Thompson and Compton, 2010, Torres et al., 2007).	689	920
27292643	Studies in vivo show that CIN genes can have either no effect or lead to an increase in spontaneous or carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis (Schvartzman et al., 2010).	921	1084
27292643	In combination with loss of known tumor suppressor genes or oncogene activation, even suppressive effects on tumor induction have been reported (Janssen and Medema, 2013, Zasadil et al., 2013).	1085	1278
27292643	To explain these ambiguities, Silk et al. (2013) proposed a model in which the level of CIN might tip the balance between tumor-promoting and -suppressive outcomes.	1279	1443
27292643	Despite this, it is still unclear when during tumor development aneuploidy exerts its modulating effects on tumor growth.	1444	1565
27292643	Most researchers agree that oncogenes are the main drivers of tumorigenesis, whereas CIN contributes to genetic variation and plasticity (Chen et al., 2012, Tamborero et al., 2013).	1566	1747
27292643	To understand how genetic instability can influence classical oncogenesis, we focused on the effect of Mad2-induced CIN during oncogene-driven tumorigenesis.	1748	1905
27292643	Mad2 is a downstream target of two major tumor suppressors: RB and p53 (Schvartzman et al., 2011).	1906	2004
27292643	In addition, Mad2 overexpression in a transgenic model of KrasG12D-driven lung carcinogenesis facilitated both tumor onset and relapse following oncogene silencing (Sotillo et al., 2010).	2005	2192
27292643	Moreover, its elevated level in various cancer types (Rhodes et al., 2004) makes it an attractive target for cancer studies.	2193	2317
27292643	Considering the detrimental effect of aneuploidy on cellular homeostasis (Torres et al., 2007) and the continued controversy with respect to both its tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing function in vivo, it is unclear whether this synergy is a general principle of cancer.	2318	2592
27292643	Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide and can be driven by a wide spectrum of oncogenes (Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2014, Stephens et al., 2012).	2593	2759
27292643	Although Kras mutations are prevalent in 30% of all human cancers, Her2 is deregulated in 15% of human mammary tumors (Cerami et al., 2012, Gao et al., 2013).	2760	2918
27292643	Similar to lung cancer, human breast tumors are highly aneuploid (Zasadil et al., 2013); however, animal models are less prone to CIN-induced mammary tumorigenesis (Duijf and Benezra, 2013).	2919	3109
27292643	We combined KrasG12D or Her2 conditional mouse models with Mad2 overexpression in the adult mammary gland to mirror the timing of tumor onset in breast cancer patients.	3110	3278
27292643	This resulted in a strong delay in tumor formation compared with KrasG12D or Her2 expression alone.	3279	3378
27292643	Pathologic analysis of early events after transgene induction revealed increased cell turnover caused by an initial depletion of Mad2-expressing cells and an accumulation of mitotic errors in the surviving population.	3379	3596
27292643	Three phenotypic subgroups of the Kras/Mad2-expressing cohort were identified, all of which resulted in the generation of Mad2-overexpressing, highly aneuploid tumors.	3597	3764
27292643	The level of aneuploidy seen in Her2 tumors was not exceeded by additional Mad2 expression, indicating that tumors self-regulate the ultimate level of CIN (Montagna et al., 2002).	3765	3944
27292643	In both oncogenic models, Mad2-induced CIN failed to have an effect on tumor progression but led to the generation of abnormal cells that survived the strong selective pressure of oncogene withdrawal.	3945	4145
27292643	To better understand the effect of CIN on tumor initiation we generated a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-driven, doxycycline-inducible model to overexpress hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Mad2 (Sotillo et al., 2007) and KrasG12D (Fisher et al., 2001) in mammary glands of adult virgin mice (Gunther et al., 2002).	4146	4455
27292643	Mice were placed on a doxycycline-enriched diet and followed weekly for tumor development.	4456	4546
27292643	Monitored mice were divided into four cohorts depending on the presence of KrasG12D (K), Mad2 (M), both KrasG12D and Mad2 (KM), and control mice lacking transgene expression (CTRL).	4547	4728
27292643	CTRL and M animals developed no tumors during the aging period of 18 months, suggesting that elevated levels of Mad2 are not sufficient to induce breast cancer in this model (Figure 1A).	4729	4915
27292643	As described previously, expression of KrasG12D in the mammary gland results in the development of breast tumors (Podsypanina et al., 2008; Figure 1A).	4916	5067
27292643	Simultaneous overexpression of KrasG12D and Mad2 led to a significant delay in mammary tumor onset compared with KrasG12D alone.	5068	5196
27292643	Although K mice showed palpable nodules after a median latency of 147 days (n = 107), KM mice survived 221 days (n = 75) without tumors (Figure 1A).	5197	5345
27292643	In addition, KM mice developed a lower number of tumors per animal compared with K mice (Figure 1B).	5346	5446
27292643	These findings show that elevated Mad2 levels are detrimental to oncogene-driven mammary tumor initiation.	5447	5553
27292643	To address the consequences of high Mad2 levels on early events during tumorigenesis, we evaluated the histological changes in mammary glands stained with an HA-specific antibody (to detect exogenous HA-tagged Mad2; Figure 1C) and Kras (Figure S1A) prior to formation of palpable tumors.	5554	5841
27292643	Serial surgeries on different mammary glands of the same animal were performed after 4, 30, and 100 days of transgene induction.	5842	5970
27292643	In this 3-month period, young wild-type animals showed no significant changes in tissue architecture (Figures 1C; Figure S1A) except estrous cycle-dependent fluctuations in proliferation and apoptosis (Fata et al., 2001).	5971	6192
27292643	To control for these hormonal influences on tissue remodeling, all surgeries were performed at the pro-estrous stage.	6193	6310
27292643	Overexpression of KrasG12D in the mammary gland led to gradual neoplastic growth starting with a numerical expansion of acinar density 30 days post-induction.	6311	6469
27292643	The increase in epithelial cells resulted in the formation of micro-nodules that, by 100 days, had already expanded into palpable tumors (Figure S1A).	6470	6620
27292643	Upon Mad2 overexpression, an initial enlargement of ducts and a predominant localization of Mad2-positive mitotic cells inside the acinar lumen were observed.	6621	6779
27292643	The decreased number of Mad2-expressing cells and the return to normal tissue architecture at 100 days suggested epithelial cell clearance during early days of transgene induction (Figures 1C and 1D; Figures S1A–S1C).	6780	6997
27292643	These observations are in line with the lack of carcinogenic growth seen in Mad2-overexpressing animals.	6998	7102
27292643	Morphological examinations of the KM cohort prompted us to partition it into three phenotypic subgroups.	7103	7207
27292643	All animals started with a normal distribution of Mad2-expressing cells per acinus (average of 38.8% of HA-positive cells at 4 days of induction) but differed both in the Kras levels and in the expression pattern of Mad2 after 100 days on doxycycline (Figures 1C and 1D; Figures S1B–S1E).	7208	7496
27292643	Group A continuously expressed very low amounts of Kras compared with Mad2 and, similar to the M cohort, reduced Mad2-expressing cells during the first 100 days on doxycycline.	7497	7673
27292643	After a strong initial luminal filling of mitotic cells at 4 days, the ductal system regressed to a normal mammary architecture.	7674	7802
27292643	Groups B and C displayed higher levels of Kras and were prone to acinar hyperplasia at 4 days.	7803	7897
27292643	After the expansion period, mammary glands underwent a regression phase leading to an almost complete reconstitution of the normal state after 30 days on doxycycline.	7898	8064
27292643	After 3 months, the mammary glands of Group B showed increased budding and branching from the main ducts, an augmented number of Mad2-expressing cells, and a slight increase in Kras levels.	8065	8254
27292643	Group C showed no change in the overall percentage of Mad2-expressing cells, whereas total expression levels were reduced and Kras expression substantially augmented (Figures 1C and 1D; Figures S1B–S1E).	8255	8458
27292643	Phenotypically, group C was reminiscent of the tumorigenic progression observed in the KrasG12D-driven model and had an equally early tumor onset at 165 days after doxycycline administration, whereas group B developed the first palpable tumors at 233 days and group A at 313 days (Figure 1E).	8459	8751
27292643	Together, these data best fit a model in which high levels of Mad2 have a detrimental effect on mitotic progression, leading to cell depletion.	8752	8895
27292643	Only in the presence of sufficient amounts of Kras can this phenotype be overcome.	8896	8978
27292643	During transgene induction, the epithelial cell population can undergo different selective scenarios leading to loss of Mad2-expressing cells in the presence of low Kras levels, tolerance of high Mad2 levels in the presence of high Kras levels, or early selection of cells with lower Mad2 levels.	8979	9275
27292643	To understand the morphogenetic processes caused by Mad2 overexpression during early pre-malignancy, we examined epithelial cell turnover in vivo via quantification of phospho-Histone 3 (pH3) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated d-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL).	9276	9551
27292643	Compared with controls, K mice showed an incremented number of pH3-positive cells with a punctate staining pattern at 4 days, hinting at elevated proliferation (Figures 2A and 2C).	9552	9732
27292643	In M and KM mice, an increase was also observed, but the staining clearly exhibited morphological features of mitosis.	9733	9851
27292643	Notably, the majority of pH3-positive cells in the M and KM cohorts were located inside the acinar lumen, suggesting delamination of mitotic cells (Figure 2A).	9852	10011
27292643	In addition, elevated numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were found in M and KM groups compared with K and CTRL cohorts 4 days after transgene induction (Figures 2B and 2D; Figure S2A) and were clearly associated with Mad2 expression (Figure S2B).	10012	10256
27292643	Together, these results suggest that high Mad2 levels in mammary epithelial cells in vivo may lead to mitotic arrest followed by apical extrusion and cell death.	10257	10418
27292643	However, the presence of Mad2-positive cells in all KM subgroups at 100 days indicated that a substantial number of cells must have escaped mitotic block and apoptosis.	10419	10587
27292643	One mechanism to escape mitotic arrest is to progress through mitosis without cytokinesis, otherwise known as mitotic slippage.	10588	10715
27292643	To evaluate this possibility and its effect on chromosome content, we measured the nuclear size of mammary epithelial cells after 4 and 100 days of transgene expression.	10716	10885
27292643	Numerical aberrations in the karyotype have been reported to correlate directly with nuclear size (Pérez de Castro et al., 2013).	10886	11015
27292643	Mammary cells in KM animals acquired a higher variance of nuclear size compared with K and CTRL mice.	11016	11117
27292643	KM group A showed no significant changes in nuclear volume.	11118	11177
27292643	Group B reached the highest nuclear volume on day 4, together with increased cell death (Figures S2A, S2C, and S2D), returning to a less pronounced phenotype after 100 days of induction (Figure 2E).	11178	11376
27292643	Together with the development of the first tumor-like nodules, KM group C doubled their nuclear volume at 100 days (Figure 2E).	11377	11504
27292643	These results suggest that a fraction of cells escape the block imposed by Mad2 overexpression and accumulate errors during chromosome segregation.	11505	11652
27292643	In vivo analysis of mammary glands following doxycycline administration indicated an increased mitotic index and a possible variance in the genomic content because of Mad2 overexpression.	11653	11840
27292643	To better understand whether the mitotic arrest induced by high Mad2 was responsible for cell depletion, we used a 3D culture system of primary mammary epithelial cells.	11841	12010
27292643	3D culture offers the possibility of recapitulating the growth of mammary acini ex vivo and allows the visualization of epithelial tissues in a microscopically accessible context (Jechlinger et al., 2009).	12011	12216
27292643	Both control samples and KrasG12D-expressing cultures showed no evident morphological changes after 36 hr on doxycycline (Figures 3A and 3B; Figure S3A).	12217	12370
27292643	Mad2 overexpression (in both ColA1-Mad2 and TetO-Mad2 strains; Figures S3B and S3C) led to a dramatic increase in the number of mitotic cells that mostly appeared in the acinar lumen starting 30 hr post-induction.	12371	12584
27292643	This phenotype was exacerbated in the combination of Mad2 overexpression and mutant Kras, where the acinar structures were filled with mitotic cells and cell fragments (Figures 3A and 3B; Figure S3A).	12585	12785
27292643	In line with previous findings, the observed phenotype is likely due to mitotic arrest as a consequence of checkpoint overactivation, given that Mad2 overexpression results in an accumulation of Cyclin B (Figures S3D and S3E) and downregulation of Aurora B (Figures S3F and S3G; Kabeche and Compton, 2012, Sotillo et al., 2007).	12786	13114
27292643	To investigate whether the arrest was followed by apoptosis, 3D cultures were stained for cleaved Caspase 3 after 36 hr on doxycycline.	13115	13250
27292643	K structures did not exceed the cell turnover seen in control cultures.	13251	13322
27292643	However, M and KM spheres contained a significantly elevated number of apoptotic cells per acinus (Figures 3A and 3C).	13323	13441
27292643	Nuclear volume counts after 4 days on doxycycline indicated that a significant number of M and KM cells became polyploid (Figure 3D).	13442	13575
27292643	Taken together, the 3D culture system recapitulated the phenotypes seen in vivo.	13576	13656
27292643	Taking advantage of time-lapse imaging, we monitored the fate of single cells expressing Histone2B-GFP in acinar spheres after administration of doxycycline for 30 hr.	13657	13824
27292643	Mitotic cell division in control cultures as well as in Kras-expressing spheroids is oriented perpendicularly to the apical and basal membrane within the epithelial layer and is completed within 1–2 hr (Figures 4A and 4C; Figure S4A; Movies S1 and S2).	13825	14077
27292643	However, in M and KM cultures, mitosis was initiated inside the epithelial layer, but cells arrested at metaphase for over 8 hr in 100% of the cycling cells in M and 91% in KM (Figures 4A and 4C).	14078	14274
27292643	This prolonged mitotic block led to stepwise delamination until, in some cases, contact with neighboring cells was completely lost.	14275	14406
27292643	Afterward, cells were either degraded into apoptotic blebs (85% in M and 79% in KM; Figures 4A, center, and 4D) or completed cell division inside the epithelial rim (15% in M and 12% in KM; Figures 4A, bottom, and 4D).	14407	14625
27292643	In 43% of Mad2 dividing cells and 33.7% of KM, mitotic abnormalities, including chromosome misalignments, lagging chromosomes, and micronuclei formation, were observed (Figures 4B and 4E; Figures S4B–S4D; Movies S3, S4, and S5).	14626	14854
27292643	These aberrations are likely causes for consequent aneuploidization (Figure 4F) and/or the depletion of Mad2-expressing cells.	14855	14981
27292643	Deregulation of mitotic checkpoint genes in vivo has been shown to increase mitotic errors and is strongly associated with a CIN phenotype in human tumors (Janssen and Medema, 2013).	14982	15164
27292643	Despite Mad2’s initial detrimental effects, analysis of tumor samples from all three KM subgroups verified the presence of both transgenes (Figures S5A and S5B), and immunohistochemistry for HA revealed Mad2-expressing cells in all tumors analyzed (Figure S5C).	15165	15426
27292643	Nuclear size measurements proved a higher variance and a significant gain in nuclear volume in KM tumor cells compared with K (Figures S5D and S5E).	15427	15575
27292643	In line with the finding of Kras inducing centrosome abnormalities (Zeng et al., 2010), K tumors also showed an increase in nuclear variance over control mice (Figure S5E).	15576	15748
27292643	To determine the full extent of Mad2’s effects on karyotype composition and chromosome rearrangements, we performed low-pass, whole-genome sequencing of primary tumors (median coverage 0.11-fold), followed by somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) analysis.	15749	16005
27292643	On average, genomes of KM tumors were more frequently affected by and had significantly more SCNAs than K tumors (mean 2.70 versus 0.85; Figures 5A and 5B).	16006	16162
27292643	The most frequent variant types present in either cohort were whole chromosome gains and losses, followed by large partial chromosome gains and losses (Figure 5A).	16163	16326
27292643	Although chromosomes 2 and 4 were recurrently affected in both cohorts (30% and 25% in K tumors as well as 34.7% and 52% in KM tumors, respectively), additional aneuploidies were present in nearly all other chromosomes of KM tumors (Figure S5F).	16327	16572
27292643	No specific SCNAs were found to occur at a significantly higher frequency in KM versus K tumors, suggesting that, in this model, Mad2 serves to increase the total amount of aneuploidy in the tumor rather than selecting for specific rearrangement patterns.	16573	16828
27292643	To analyze whether Mad2 influences CIN during tumor growth, we performed time-lapse microscopy of primary tumor cells.	16829	16947
27292643	Indeed, 30% of KM cells continued to missegregate chromosomes compared with 10% in Kras tumors (Figures 5C and 5D), suggesting that Mad2 overexpression increases CIN prior to tumorigenesis and during tumor cell expansion.	16948	17169
27292643	To assess the effect of Mad2-induced CIN on tumor phenotype, we analyzed tumor progression and histopathological features of primary tumors.	17170	17310
27292643	Despite the prolonged tumor onset, K and KM cohorts displayed no differences in overall tumor growth (Figure S5G) and developed similar histopathological subtypes (Figure S5C).	17311	17487
27292643	The tumor spectrum included mostly solid or solid-papillary carcinomas (88%) that displayed a high number of HA-Mad2-positive cells.	17488	17620
27292643	A minor fraction of tumors was categorized as tubulo-alveolar carcinomas and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype carcinosarcomas (Rudmann et al., 2012) and contained fewer HA-Mad2-positive cells (Figure S5C).	17621	17846
27292643	Although a low number of mice developed lung metastases, the incidence was not altered by Mad2 overexpression (data not shown).	17847	17974
27292643	The absence of an additional Mad2 effect despite the elevated CIN in the KM tumors suggested that tumorigenesis had so far followed the strong lead of the driving oncogene.	17975	18147
27292643	Over the past years, it has been argued that the full potential of CIN can only be seen under selective conditions (Chen et al., 2012, Chen et al., 2015).	18148	18302
27292643	Here, karyotype diversity can boost the adaptive potential of a cell population and enhance its fitness.	18303	18407
27292643	We therefore set out to investigate whether the increased aneuploidy in Mad2-expressing tumors would reveal its potential when faced with strong selective pressure such as that seen with oncogene inactivation.	18408	18617
27292643	Doxycycline was withdrawn in 48 K and 44 KM animals, each of which harbored multiple mammary tumors.	18618	18718
27292643	In the K cohort, a total of 155 out of 166 tumors completely regressed to a non-palpable state (93.4%), demonstrating that the majority of epithelial cells remained dependent on Kras for maintenance of the transformed state.	18719	18943
27292643	Strikingly, in the KM cohort, 23 of 108 primary tumors (21.3%) showed no signs of shrinkage, and malignant growth continued in the absence of doxycycline (Figures 5E and 5F).	18944	19118
27292643	Activation of the same oncogenic pathway has been described as a possible mechanism of doxycycline independence (Podsypanina et al., 2008).	19119	19258
27292643	To exclude the possibility of transgene re-expression, non-regressing tumors were analyzed for Kras and Mad2 transgene expression.	19259	19389
27292643	Whereas 27.3% of K and 34.8% of KM tumors re-activated the transgenic system (Figure S6A), around 70% of persisting tumors remained unaccounted for.	19390	19538
27292643	In addition, no mutations were found in the endogenous ras genes (data not shown).	19539	19621
27292643	This finding suggests that genetic heterogeneity most likely had led to the establishment of oncogene-independent subclones, facilitating tumor persistence after transgene de-induction.	19622	19807
27292643	Her2 is one of the most common oncogenes overexpressed or amplified in human breast cancer (Moody et al., 2002, Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2014, Stephens et al., 2012).	19808	19972
27292643	To test whether our findings for Kras-driven mammary tumorigenesis also apply to other breast cancer drivers, we crossed Mad2 animals into tetracycline-inducible Her2 mice (Moody et al., 2002).	19973	20166
27292643	Her2 (H)-positive animals developed tumors with a shorter median latency (93 days, n = 60) than the ones observed with Kras (p < 0.0001).	20167	20304
27292643	Similar to the Kras model, overexpression of Mad2 in Her2 animals (HM) led to a significant delay in tumor onset (138 days, n = 73) and a decrease in the overall tumor load per animal (Figures 6A and 6B).	20305	20509
27292643	Histology 4 and 100 days following transgene induction revealed that Her2-driven tumorigenesis largely mimicked the continuous proliferation observed in Kras animals.	20510	20676
27292643	Elevated Mad2 levels in this model resulted in an increase in pH3-positive cells accompanied by a predominant localization of mitotic cells to the acinar lumen (Figures 6C and 6D).	20677	20857
27292643	The delayed tumor onset observed in the Her2/Mad2 animals might therefore also be a consequence of Mad2-induced mitotic arrest.	20858	20985
27292643	Unlike the KM model, in which ultimately all tumors were positive for exogenous Mad2, a minor fraction of tumors (18%) in the Her2/Mad2 cohort completely downregulated Mad2 expression (Figure S6B).	20986	21183
27292643	The Her2 model further differed in the appearance of copy number changes.	21184	21257
27292643	Whereas strong differences were found between K and KM, H and HM tumors showed similar numbers of SCNAs (mean 2.30 versus 2.60), with Mad2-positive tumors tending toward increased numerical aneuploidy compared with Her2 tumors (Figures 6E and 6F; Figure S6C).	21258	21517
27292643	H and HM tumor cells also displayed similar missegregation rates in vitro (Figures 6G and 6H).	21518	21612
27292643	The elevated number of SCNAs seen in Her2 tumors is in line with findings of centrosome abnormalities and increased aneuploidy in MMTV-Her2-induced murine breast cancer (Montagna et al., 2002).	21613	21806
27292643	It is possible that tumorigenesis can only proceed below a certain CIN threshold (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2015, Silk et al., 2013), restricting Mad2’s effect to increase SCNAs on Her2 mammary tumors.	21807	22004
27292643	These results prompted us to investigate whether tumor regression after transgene de-induction was affected in these animals.	22005	22130
27292643	As seen previously with this model (Moody et al., 2002), of 174 Her2-positive tumors, only two tumors failed to fully regress after doxycycline withdrawal (1.15%; Figure 6I).	22131	22305
27292643	In the HM cohort, a higher number of persistent tumors was detected, with 12 of 144 HM tumors not fully regressing upon inactivation of Her2 and Mad2 (8.33%; Figure 6I).	22306	22475
27292643	Strikingly, 50% of HM non-regressing tumors re-expressed the oncogene (Figure S6D), suggesting that elevated Mad2 levels in the other 50% of Her2 primary tumors also offered a selective benefit to enable the escape from oncogene dependence.	22476	22716
27292643	The presence of persistent tumors in the HM model was probably not only a result of the induced aneuploidy, given that similar levels of SCNAs were also present in the H tumors that fully regressed.	22717	22915
27292643	It is possible that tumor cells require a certain time for the acquired CIN to generate and select fitter tumor subclones.	22916	23038
27292643	Whereas Her2 tumors arose very early (93 days), Her2/Mad2 tumors needed a longer time to develop (138 days), allowing sufficient time for the chromosome missegregations to create oncogene-independent subclones.	23039	23249
27292643	We speculate that the biological context established by the initiating oncogenic drivers as well as the mutational processes at work thereafter are additional determinants of the genetic adaptation.	23250	23448
27292643	The consequence of chromosome instability on tumor development continues to stand at the center of a scientific debate.	23449	23568
27292643	Depending on genetic- and tissue-specific contexts, CIN-associated gene de-regulations promote, suppress, or have no effect on spontaneous tumorigenesis (Janssen and Medema, 2013, Zasadil et al., 2013).	23569	23771
27292643	The overexpression of Mad2 is a frequent event in human cancers that has been modeled both in vitro and in vivo.	23772	23884
27292643	The induction of Mad2 in adult mouse tissues leads to CIN, tumor initiation (Sotillo et al., 2007), and acceleration of KrasG12D-driven lung cancer (Sotillo et al., 2010).	23885	24056
27292643	In this study, we extend this analysis and show that elevated levels of Mad2 in the mammary gland cause a delay in both KrasG12D- and Her2-induced breast cancer.	24057	24218
27292643	The different outcomes upon Mad2 overexpression in the lung versus the mammary gland might be due to tissue-specific differences in cell homeostasis and signaling.	24219	24382
27292643	The lung is one of the tissues with the highest incidence of spontaneous tumor formation in mouse models of CIN, suggesting that lung cells are specially sensitive to aneuploidy (Duijf and Benezra, 2013).	24383	24587
27292643	Alternatively, expression levels of the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) driven by the lung-specific promoter (CCSP) could differ from the mammary-specific MMTV promoter, making it difficult to compare both models.	24588	24823
27292643	Murine breast cancer models allow multi-sampling of mammary glands during tumor development from the same animal.	24824	24937
27292643	Taking advantage of this, we follow the transgenic effect in individual animals and demonstrate that early Mad2 overexpression in mammary cells in vivo leads to strong mitotic arrest and increased cell death.	24938	25146
27292643	Moreover, time-lapse imaging of mammary spheroid cultures showed that prolonged mitotic arrest results in apical extrusion and cell degradation inside the lumen.	25147	25308
27292643	Apical cell shedding is a common mechanism in epithelia to eliminate defective cells (Denning et al., 2012, Rosenblatt et al., 2001).	25309	25442
27292643	Both the mitotic arrest and the higher mitotic error rate during the first rounds of division might mark Mad2-expressing cells as aberrant.	25443	25582
27292643	It is also plausible that cells ultimately undergo anoikis because of delamination (Gilmore, 2005).	25583	25682
27292643	The signaling pathway responsible for mitotic cell death is still unclear; however, it is possible that Myc contributes to apoptosis after prolonged checkpoint activation, as suggested recently (Topham et al., 2015).	25683	25899
27292643	Strikingly, not all cells expressing Mad2 die.	25900	25946
27292643	A small percentage of cells is able to overcome the arrest and complete cell division inside the epithelial layer.	25947	26061
27292643	In all KM and the majority of HM animals, Mad2 expression continues throughout tumorigenesis, leading to the formation of Mad2-positive tumors.	26062	26205
27292643	The time and route to steady state, however, vary among individuals.	26206	26274
27292643	When Mad2 expression strongly outweighs Kras (subgroup A), animals show a substantial reduction of Mad2-expressing cells over time.	26275	26406
27292643	In subgroup B, where initial Kras and Mad2 levels are high, mammary glands can maintain or even increase the number of Mad2-expressing cells.	26407	26548
27292643	In subgroup C, a reduction of Mad2 levels occurs, whereas Kras increases its expression.	26549	26637
27292643	The different phenotypes depend on a tight balance between oncogenic and Mad2 signaling.	26638	26726
27292643	Pro-survival signals downstream of Kras (Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011) and Her2 (Moasser, 2007) as well as supporting signals from the microenvironment (Radisky, 2012) might thereby promote cell cycle progression.	26727	26939
27292643	Considering that Mad2 increases karyotype instability, it is possible that CIN-induced genetic changes might also take part in the detrimental effect of early Mad2 expression and contribute to overcoming checkpoint arrest or even subsequently support tumor initiation.	26940	27208
27292643	Models combining chromosome missegregation with the process of negative selection and tolerance, as seen in the presented mouse models, are therefore good approximations to mimic human tumor growth (Valind et al., 2013).	27209	27429
27292643	An increased occurrence of karyotype aberrations because of Mad2 overexpression was primarily seen in KrasG12D-driven mammary tumors.	27430	27563
27292643	Mad2-positive tumors markedly outweigh the solely KrasG12D-expressing counterparts in the genomic variance between cells as well as the number and complexity of chromosomal rearrangements.	27564	27752
27292643	Interestingly, Mad2 did not further increase the high number of structural variants observed in Her2 mammary tumors but caused a slight trend toward whole chromosome gains and losses.	27753	27936
27292643	Her2 has been shown to cause centrosomal defects and, thus, by itself, interferes with chromosome segregation (Montagna et al., 2002).	27937	28071
27292643	The fact that Mad2 did not significantly contribute to additional karyotype complexity in the aneuploid Her2 tumors supports the hypothesis that a certain threshold of CIN is permissive for tumor development (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2015, Laughney et al., 2015, Silk et al., 2013).	28072	28351
27292643	An alternative theory suggests that the genetic setting shapes initial CIN and aneuploidy tolerance, which, after rounds of negative selection, balances into an optimized equilibrium at a specific aneuploidy index (Laughney et al., 2015, Valind et al., 2013).	28352	28611
27292643	Karyotypic heterogeneity can confer genetic flexibility and, in turn, increase the adaptability of a tumor cell population.	28612	28735
27292643	Here we present in vivo evidence that Mad2-induced mitotic aberrations enhance the generation of oncogene-independent tumor subclones in breast cancer.	28736	28887
27292643	Upon silencing of the driving oncogene, previously Mad2-expressing animals showed a higher percentage of non-regressing tumors in the K and H models.	28888	29037
27292643	It is startling, however, that, despite the high number of structural variants in both H and HM tumors, the number of non-regressing tumors is much lower than in KM while having similar CIN levels.	29038	29235
27292643	It may be that, given distinct initiating oncogenes, differing grades of genomic instability are necessary for an oncogene-independent subclonal population to arise.	29236	29401
27292643	Alternatively, the stochastic appearance of fitness-improving chromosomal changes depends on the time a tumor population has to establish and expand itself.	29402	29558
27292643	Multi-region sequencing and genomic profiling studies have verified that, although tumor growth originates from early driver mutations, fitness-contributing private alterations arise continuously during tumor development (Sottoriva et al., 2015).	29559	29805
27292643	Therefore, both genetic instability-driving mechanisms and the time for tumor evolution might contribute to the generation of oncogene-independent cells.	29806	29959
27292643	A previously reported MYC-induced breast cancer model supports this argument.	29960	30037
27292643	Myc-induced mammary tumors appear at a very long latency compared with Kras and Her2 and are associated with a strong CIN phenotype (McCormack et al., 1998).	30038	30195
27292643	Interestingly, incomplete regression following Myc inactivation is observed in 60% of tumors (Leung et al., 2012), whereas simultaneous overexpression of Mad2 in these animals results in a further increase of tumor persistence by 30% (M.M., unpublished data).	30196	30455
27292643	The effect of transient Mad2 expression on the incidence of oncogene-independent tumors is therefore discernable in three different oncogenic settings, even if the overall adaptive capacity might depend on the initiating oncogene.	30456	30686
27292643	Taken together, it is becoming clear why the effect of CIN on tumor progression only becomes evident through strong selective pressures.	30687	30823
27292643	Under such circumstances, the wide distribution of karyotypes promotes gross adaptive leaps (Chen et al., 2012, Chen et al., 2015, Endesfelder et al., 2014).	30824	30981
27292643	Therefore, it is not surprising that CIN is found to be associated with poor prognosis and contributes to multidrug resistance (Lee et al., 2011, Zasadil et al., 2013).	30982	31150
27292643	Their predominant role as evolutionary drivers makes CIN genes important predictive biomarkers in cancer (Carter et al., 2006, Habermann et al., 2009).	31151	31302
27292643	Further studies aiming at understanding the contribution of individual CIN genes to oncogene independence will extend our understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity and tumor evolution.	31303	31489
27292643	Considering the low incidence of oncogene-independent tumors in some oncogenic mouse models, the combination with CIN models might facilitate the identification of escape mechanisms from targeted therapies.	31490	31696
27292643	The link between karyotypic and mutational changes further complicates the understanding of tumor evolution (Sheltzer et al., 2011).	31697	31829
27292643	The role and effect of CIN-induced genetic changes has still to be determined and is likely to be an important component during tumorigenesis and acquisition of therapeutic resistance.	31830	32014
27292643	Animals were of mixed background (mainly Friend virus B [FVB]) with a heterozygous genotype: MMTV-rtTA (Gunther et al., 2002), TetO-KrasG12D (Fisher et al., 2001), TetO-rat-Her2 (Moody et al., 2002), HA-tagged-TetO-Mad2 (Sotillo et al., 2007), and H2B-GFP (Hadjantonakis and Papaioannou, 2004).	32015	32309

27292643	Mammary glands were harvested from 8- to 9-week-old female mice and prepared and stained according to published records (Jechlinger et al., 2009).	32963	33109
27292643	The following primary antibodies were used: HA (1:,1000, Covance, MMS-101R), cleaved Caspase3 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, 9661S), LaminB1 (1:500, Abcam, 16048), α-Tubulin (1:500, Sigma, F2168), and Aurora B (1:150, BD Biosciences, 611082).	33110	33356
27292643	Imaging of fixed samples was performed on a Leica TCS SP5/SP8 confocal microscope and time-lapse imaging during 20 hr on an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Ultraview-Vox): 0.3-μm optical sectioning across a 35-μm stack, 5 frames/hr.	33357	33613

28883039	The retrograde motor cytoplasmic dynein is involved in a host of cellular activities, including the trafficking of diverse cargos such as organelles, vesicles, and mRNA as well as mitotic spindle alignment and chromosome positioning (Allan, 2011).	0	247
28883039	In contrast to yeast dynein, which can achieve long-range transport on its own, mammalian dynein must form a tripartite complex with the 1.2-MD dynactin complex and an adapter protein to move processively along microtubules.A number of different adaptor proteins that join dynein and dynactin into an active motile complex have been identified.	248	592
28883039	For example, bicaudal D2 (BICD2), one of the best-studied dynein adaptors, interacts with the small GTPase Rab6, which is found on early endosomes and ER–Golgi vesicles.	593	762
28883039	BICD2 is thought to be autoinhibited through an interaction between its C-terminal coiled coil domain with the N-terminal domain of the protein, which prevents it from associating with its other partners, including dynein.	763	985
28883039	Autoinhibition is thought to be relieved by binding to an effector, such as Rab6a in its GTP-bound form; however, evidence for this model is lacking.BICD2 recently emerged as a genetic locus associated with dominant spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder characterized by the degeneration of anterior horn cells and leading to eventual muscle atrophy and weakness..	986	1362
28883039	The effects that these point mutations have on BICD2’s ability to function as a dynein adaptor are not known, although overexpression of these mutants has been reported to cause Golgi fragmentation and changes in BICD2 localization in cultured cells.	1363	1613
28883039	Interestingly, point mutations in the tail region of heavy chain 1 of cytoplasmic dynein have been associated with another form of SMA, SMA-LED1.	1614	1759
28883039	These mutations were reported to cause an increase in the affinity between the motor and BICD2 and a decrease in dynein–dynactin processivity.Here, using biochemical and single-molecule motility assays, we demonstrate that BICD2 disease mutations cause a gain of function in the motility of DDB complexes both in vitro and in cells.	1760	2092
28883039	In addition, we show that the expression of BICD2 mutants in neurons leads to impaired neurite outgrowth.	2093	2198
28883039	These results indicate that the SMA BICD2 mutants hyperactivate dynein motility, a gain of function consistent with a dominant genetic trait that could explain the gradual loss of motor neuron function in SMA.BICD2 is composed of five coiled coil domains that can be grouped into three distinct regions (Fig.	2199	2507
28883039	1 A).	2508	2513
28883039	The C-terminal region of the protein is the most well-conserved and contains the binding site to different partners localized to different cargos, including the small GTPase Rab6a.	2514	2694
28883039	An N-terminal construct of the protein, which spans residues 25–400 (BICD225–400), was shown to be more effective in binding dynein–dynactin in cell lysate pull-down assays compared with autoinhibited full-length protein.	2695	2916
28883039	We replicated these findings; the difference in dynactin binding was especially striking, exhibiting about a 10-fold reduction for the BICD2FL pull-down compared with BICD225–400, whereas dynein was two- to threefold lower (Fig.	2917	3145
28883039	S1, A and B).We next tested whether the autoinhibited state of BICD2FL could be activated by Rab6a.	3146	3245
28883039	We added purified recombinant Rab6a–Q72L, which is locked in a GTP-bound state (hereafter referred to as Rab6aGTP), to porcine brain lysate and performed pull-downs using BICD2 as bait.	3246	3431
28883039	With increasing Rab6aGTP, there was a corresponding increase of dynein and dynactin in the BICD2FL pull-down.	3432	3541
28883039	Conversely, the GDP-bound mutant of Rab6a (Rab6a–T27N, hereafter Rab6aGDP) appeared to somewhat reduce the pull-down of dynein and dynactin (Fig.	3542	3687
28883039	1 B).	3688	3693
28883039	Rab6aGTP also was detected in the pellet fraction in these experiments, whereas Rab6aGDP was absent (Fig.	3694	3799
28883039	S1 C).	3800	3806
28883039	A densitometric analysis shows a 2.5-fold increase in dynein enrichment and a 10-fold increase in dynactin at the highest Rab6aGTP concentration used (Fig.	3807	3962
28883039	S1 D).	3963	3969
28883039	The greater pull-down of dynactin relative to dynein might reflect an interaction of the Rab6aGTP–BicD2 complex with dynactin alone.	3970	4102
28883039	Together, these results indicate that Rab6aGTP is able to activate full-length BICD2 and enhance its ability to bind to dynein and dynactin.To further examine whether Rab6aGTP can activate BICD2FL and enable dynein–dynactin motility, we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to visualize DDB motility on microtubules.	4103	4437
28883039	Purified dynein and dynactin from mammalian RPE-1 cell lysates were incubated with similar concentrations of either superfolder-GFP (sfGFP)–fused BICD225–400 or BICD2FL, and the numbers of moving motor complexes were analyzed via kymographs (Fig.	4438	4684
28883039	1 C).	3801	3806
28883039	This single-molecule in vitro assay revealed that the truncated BICD225–400 produced more processive dynein–dynactin complexes when compared with BICD2FL, which is again consistent with the idea that BICD2FL is autoinhibited (Fig.	4691	4921
28883039	1, C and D; and Video 1).	4922	4947
28883039	The addition of Rab6aGTP to BICD2FL and dynein–dynactin resulted in a three- to fourfold increase in the number of moving DDBFL complexes on microtubules compared with Rab6aGDP or the individual DDB components alone (Fig.	4948	5169
28883039	1 E).	5170	5175
28883039	In contrast, Rab6aGTP neither increased the motility of DDB25–400 (Fig.	5176	5247
28883039	S1 E) nor interacted with BICD225–400 (Fig.	5248	5291
28883039	S1 F).	5292	5298
28883039	Collectively, these results suggest that Rab6aGTP is capable of alleviating the autoinhibition of full-length BICD2 and activating its ability to form processive DDB complexes.Next, using our assays, we sought to examine the effects of three BICD2FL mutants identified in patients afflicted with DC-SMA/SMA-LED2 (S107L, N188T, and I189F) and a mutant (F739I) that is equivalent to the Drosophila melanogaster F684I mutant that produces a bicaudal phenotype (Fig.	5299	5761
28883039	1 A; Mohler and Wieschaus, 1986; Wharton and Struhl, 1989).	5762	5821
28883039	The latter mutation has been shown to have higher affinity toward dynein compared with WT and was proposed to be more readily activated upon binding to cargo.	5822	5980
28883039	All four of the mutated residues are highly conserved in the BICD protein family.In a brain lysate pull-down assay with Rab6aGTP, the four BICD2FL mutants recruited more dynein and dynactin compared with WT BICD2FL, with the greatest difference being observed in dynactin binding (Figs.	5981	6267
28883039	2 A and S2 B).	6268	6282
28883039	Weak binding of dynein–dynactin also was observed with Rab6aGDP or without added Rab6a (Fig.	6283	6375
28883039	2, A and B; and Fig.	6376	6396
28883039	S2, A andB).	6397	6409
28883039	It is possible that endogenous Rab6a in the brain lysate might be responsible for this weak BICD2 mutant-specific pull-down or that other factors in the lysate allow for a loss of autoinhibition.	6410	6605
28883039	In the single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence assay in the presence of Rab6aGTP, three of the BICD2FL mutants (N188T, I189F, and S107L) showed a statistically significant 20–30% increase in the number of motile DDB complexes compared with WT BICD2FL (Fig.	6606	6877
28883039	2 C).	6878	6883
28883039	Neither the velocity (Fig.	6884	6910
28883039	2 D) nor run-length (Fig.	6911	6936
28883039	2 E and Fig.	6937	6949
28883039	S2 C) of DDB was different between WT and mutant BICD2FL.	6950	7007
28883039	In the presence of Rab6aGDP, however, motility was much lower, and no statistical difference was observed between mutant and WT BICD2FL (Fig.	7008	7149
28883039	S2 D).	7150	7156
28883039	No significant difference also was observed in the number of motile DDB complexes formed by WT and mutant truncated BICD225–400 (Fig.	7157	7290
28883039	2 F).	7291	7296
28883039	WT and mutant BICD225–400 also pulled down similar amounts of dynein and dynactin (Fig.	7297	7384
28883039	S2 E).	7385	7391
28883039	Collectively, these results indicate the point mutations in BICD2FL enhance Rab6aGTP-dependent activation from the autoinhibited state, producing more motile DDBFL complexes but not altering the measured parameters of DDBFL motility.The retrograde transport of native membranous cargos involves prenylated, membrane-bound Rab6a interacting with BICD2.	7392	7743
28883039	We sought to recapitulate this cargo motility in vitro using recombinant Rab6aGTP or Rab6aGDP covalently linked to large unilamellar vesicles via maleimide lipids (Fig.	7744	7912
28883039	3 A).	7913	7918
28883039	With Rab6aGTP on the liposomes, we observed the frequent binding and movement of liposomes along microtubules in the presence of dynein, dynactin, and BICD2FL (Fig.	7919	8083
28883039	3, B and C).	8084	8096
28883039	In contrast, motility events were only rarely observed with Rab6aGDP-coated liposomes (Fig.	8097	8188
28883039	3, B and C; and Video 2).	8189	8214
28883039	Next, we examined the BICD2FL mutants in the Rab6aGTP liposome motility assay.	8215	8293
28883039	All four mutants produced significantly more moving Rab6aGTP liposomes compared with WT BICD2FL (Fig.	8294	8395
28883039	3 D).	8396	8401
28883039	The velocities of WT and mutant BICD2 were similar (500 nm/s; Fig.	8402	8468
28883039	S2 F) and slightly higher than the single-molecule velocities.	8469	8531
28883039	Thus, consistent with the single-molecule motility assays, the BICD2 mutants hyperactivated dynein–dynactin motility in an in vitro cargo transport assay.To examine the behavior of WT and mutant BICD2 in cells, we turned to a previously established inducible cargo trafficking assay.	8532	8815
28883039	In this assay, FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB) fused to GFP and a peroxisome localization sequence is coexpressed with BICD2 fused to FK506 binding protein (FKBP; Fig.	8816	8989
28883039	4 A).	8990	8995
28883039	As shown previously, an N-terminal construct of BICD2 (BICD21–594-FKBP) in the presence of rapamycin increased retrograde transport of peroxisomes and produced significant clustering of the GFP–peroxisome signal around the perinuclear region.	8996	9238
28883039	This longer construct includes coiled coil 2 but still lacks the C-terminal region needed for autoinhibition.	9239	9348
28883039	In contrast, the autoinhibited BICD2FL-FKBP construct displayed a more dispersed peroxisome signal (Fig.	9349	9453
28883039	4 B).We next tested the mutant BICD2FL constructs in this inducible peroxisome motility assay.	9454	9548
28883039	To quantify the degree of peroxisome clustering due to minus end–directed motility, we used a previously created plugin for the image analysis software Icy that calculates the fraction of the cell area containing 90% of the total peroxisome GFP signal; increased transport to the centrosome results in a more clustered signal, and thus 90% of the signal occupies less area.	9549	9922
28883039	In the absence of rapamycin, the clustering values for the WT and mutants were similar (55%; Fig.	9923	10020
28883039	4 D).	10021	10026
28883039	With the addition of rapamycin to cells expressing BICD21–594, the peroxisomes occupied 20% of the cell area compared with 40% expressing autoinhibited BICD2FL.	10027	10187
28883039	The four mutants tested in the BICD2FL construct, while not achieving the same degree of peroxisome clustering observed for BICD21–594, showed an increase in the compaction of the peroxisome signal compared with WT BICD2FL (Fig.	10188	10416
28883039	4 D).	10021	10026
28883039	Thus, similar to the in vitro data, the mutant BICD2FL proteins hyperactivated dynein–dynactin in a cellular context and more efficiently transported peroxisomes toward the centrosomes.We also tested whether localizing Rab6aGTP containing a peroxisome-targeting sequence (Rab6aGTP–PEX) could increase the activity of FKBP–BICD2FL.	10423	10753
28883039	However, we found that Rab6aGTP–PEX alone (without FKBP–BICD2FL coexpression) was sufficient to cluster peroxisomes, presumably through the recruitment of endogenous BICD2 and then dynein–dynactin (Fig.	10754	10956
28883039	S3, A–C).	10957	10966
28883039	Thus, targeting of Rab6aGTP on peroxisome membranes is sufficient for the recruitment and activation of endogenous BICD2 to produce dynein-mediated transport of peroxisomes.We next examined whether the hyperactivating BICD2FL mutants affected neurite outgrowth and neuronal morphology.	10967	11252
28883039	Rat hippocampal neurons, dissected from embryonic day 18 tissue and grown in culture, were transfected with either WT or mutant mouse mCherry–BICD2FL constructs along with soluble GFP to visualize the cell body and neurites (Fig.	11253	11482
28883039	5 A).	11483	11488
28883039	Three days later, dual mCherry- and GFP-positive neurons were then scored for the length of their longest process as well as the total length of all processes.	11489	11648
28883039	Cells transfected with WT mCherry–BICD2FL and GFP showed similar neurite lengths compared with cells transfected with GFP alone (Fig.	11649	11782
28883039	5, B and C).	11783	11795
28883039	This result is consistent with previous work showing that overexpression of WT BICD2 in either hippocampal or rat dorsal root ganglion neurons does not affect axon length or overall neurite length.	11796	11993
28883039	However, cells transfected with the disease mutant BICD2FL constructs for 3 d showed a 40% decrease in both the length of the longest neurite as well as an overall decrease in total neurite length after 3 d (Fig.	11994	12206
28883039	5, B and C).	11783	11795
28883039	This result is similar to what was reported when the BICD-related protein BICDR-1, which forms a higher velocity DDB complex, is overexpressed in neurons..	12220	12375
28883039	The number of long (>15-µm) processes emanating from the cell body was not affected by the BICD2 mutants (Fig.	12376	12486
28883039	S3 D).	12487	12493
28883039	The Drosophila mutant (F739I) also showed a significant reduction in total neurites, but not in the axon length (Fig.	12494	12611
28883039	S3, E and F).	12612	12625
28883039	These results demonstrate that mutations in BICD2 affect the process of neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons in culture.In conclusion, our vitro and cell-based assays recapitulate Rab6aGTP-dependent activation of DDB motility and reveal that three BICD2 disease-associated mutations and one Drosophila mutant all display a similar phenotype of eliciting more dynein–dynactin motility.	12626	13014
28883039	These effects were not evident with the Rab6a-independent, constitutively active BICD225–400 construct.	13015	13118
28883039	These results suggest a scenario in which the mutants lower the energy barrier for Rab6aGTP to convert the autoinhibited BICD2FL into an active conformation.	13119	13276
28883039	Future work can test this possibility by using assays that probe the conformational states of BICD2FL.Previous cell-based models have suggested that BICD2 disease mutants may have a dominant-negative effect on dynein function, resulting in disrupted Golgi morphology.	13277	13544
28883039	Although we cannot rule out dominant-negative effects that cannot be measured with our assays, our data suggest that the mutants produce a dominant-positive effect leading to enhanced dynein cargo transport.	13545	13752
28883039	Although subtle (25% increase in motile DDB complexes), such effects may perturb transport in an axon (which can be up to 1 m long in a motor neuron) over time.To explain the SMA-LED2 disease phenotype, we propose a model in which mutant BICD2 increases dynein activation and leads to an imbalance between anterograde and retrograde transport (Fig.	13753	14101
28883039	5 D).	14102	14107
28883039	The shift toward dynein transport could produce a decrease in the delivery of cargo to the nerve terminal, which in turn could lead to a gradual decline in function of neurons with long axons.	14108	14300
28883039	This model is congruous with experimental data from transgenic mouse models.	14301	14377
28883039	BICD2-null mice possess a normal spinal cord and their motor neurons exhibit no evidence of abnormal retrograde transport.	14378	14500
28883039	These mice, which die at around p30, do not display a SMA phenotype, suggesting that the absence or inhibition of BICD2 activity cannot explain the disease etiology.	14501	14666
28883039	In contrast, transgenic mice expressing the shorter, more active N-terminal construct of BICD2 were impaired in retrograde axonal transport and Golgi fragmentation, presumably through a dominant-negative effect of activating dynein and dynactin without cargo and causing its accumulation in the cell body.	14667	14972
28883039	Curiously, however, these mice, which live up to 2 yr, also did not develop any motor abnormalities.	14973	15073
28883039	The phenotypic differences in mice expressing the N-terminal construct of BICD2 compared with haploid S107L, N188T, and I189F mutations suggests that the C terminus of the BICD2 protein that interacts with cargo is necessary for contributing to the SMA disease phenotype.Recently, Hoang et al. (2017) showed that disease-related mutants in the human dynein heavy chain, including three mutations associated with SMA, exhibited normal DDB complex formation and velocity, but displayed a 60%–70% reduction in processivity.	15074	15594
28883039	These results differ from those described for the SMA BICD2 mutants, which show no change in processivity and a gain-of-function increase in the amount of retrograde transport.	15595	15771
28883039	Taken together, these studies on dynein and BICD2 mutations reveal multiple ways in which changes in motor activity can affect can affect the homeostasis and function of neurons in SMA.The cDNAs for mouse BICD2 (GenBank accession no.	15772	16005
28883039	AJ250106.1) and mouse Rab6a (GenBank accession no.	16006	16056
28883039	BC019118.1) were obtained from the Thermo Fisher Scientific MGC collection.	16057	16132
28883039	BICD2 N-terminal constructs were cloned into a pet28a vector containing an N-terminal 6xHis-strepII-sfGFP tag.	16133	16243
28883039	Full-length BICD2 WT and mutant constructs were cloned into a pFastbac vector containing either an N-terminal StrepII-sfGFP or StrepII-SNAPf tag followed by a C-terminal 6xHis tag for tandem purification.	16244	16448
28883039	Rab6a was cloned into a pGEX vector containing an N-terminal GST tag followed by a PreScission protease cleavage site.	16449	16567
28883039	The Rab6a constructs span the GTPase domain of Rab6a (aa 8–195), followed by a short linker and either a KCK motif for maleimide labeling purposes (liposome experiment) or a His10 tag.	16568	16752
28883039	Point mutations for both the BICD2 constructs and the Rab6a GDP/GTP (Q72L and T27N, respectively) constructs were created by the protocol of Phusion.For the cell-based peroxisome assay, the sequence spanning aa 1–42 of human PEX3 was synthesized via a gBlock (IDT) and was cloned into the N-terminal of a modified eGFP vector, followed by a C-terminal FRB sequence.	16753	17118
28883039	BICD2 constructs for this assay were cloned into a pHR vector containing an N-terminal mCherry sequence and C-terminal FKBPf36v sequence.	17119	17256
28883039	The Rab6a–PEX construct was constructed by fusing the PEX3 sequence to the C terminus of Rab6a lacking the cysteines for lipidation (1–203 aa).	17257	17400
28883039	An mTagBFP2 was fused to the N terminus of this construct as well.	17401	17467
28883039	For neuron expression, BICD2 was cloned into an N-terminal pmCherry vector.BICD2 N-terminal and Rab6a constructs were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 RIPL from Agilent.	17468	17654
28883039	Cells were grown in LB at 37°C until growth reached 0.6 OD280.	17655	17717
28883039	The temperature was then lowered to 18°C, and cells were induced overnight with 0.5 mM IPTG.	17718	17810
28883039	Bacterial pellets were resuspended in either strep lysis buffer (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF) for BICD2 or PBS containing 5% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF for Rab6a.	17811	18035
28883039	Cells were lysed using an Emulsiflex press (Avestin) and clarified at 40,000 g for 60 min.	18036	18126
28883039	Lysates were bound to either Strep-Tactin Superflow Plus resin (QIAGEN) or GST Sepharose 4B (GE Lifesciences).	18127	18237
28883039	Beads were then washed extensively, and the bound protein was eluted with 3 mM desthiobiotin in lysis buffer (BICD2) or via overnight cleavage with PreScission (Rab6a).BICD2 full-length constructs were purified from SF9 cells and purified using tandem purification.	18238	18503
28883039	Bacmids isolated from DH10Bac cells were transfected into SF9 cells.	18504	18572
28883039	P2 virus was used to infect SF9 cells grown in shaker flasks to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml.	18573	18667
28883039	After 60 h of infection, cells were harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in NiNTA lysis buffer (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM βME) and lysed using an Emulsiflex.	18668	18883
28883039	The lysate was clarified at 40,000 g for 1 h and bound to NiNTA resin from QIAGEN.	18884	18966
28883039	After extensively washing with lysis buffer, cells were eluted with lysis buffer containing 500 mM imidazole.	18967	19076
28883039	The eluted material was then diluted to lower the imidazole concentration to 100 mM, and bound to Strep-Tactin beads.	19077	19194
28883039	The beads were then washed with lysis buffer and eluted with lysis buffer containing 3 mM desthio-biotin.	19195	19300
28883039	After elution, proteins were concentrated and injected onto either a Superose 6 10/300GL column (BICD2 constructs) or a S200 10/300GL column (Rab6a) from GE Healthcare.	19301	19469
28883039	Gel filtration buffer was composed of 30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.	19470	19595
28883039	Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated and then flash frozen.	19596	19662
28883039	For SNAP-fusion constructs, purified proteins were bound to Strep-Tactin beads and incubated at a 2:1 ratio of SNAP-TMR Star:Protein on ice for 1 h. Beads were briefly washed in the gel filtration buffer, and the protein was eluted with 3 mM desthiobiotin in gel filtration buffer.Dynein and dynactin were prepared from RPE-1 cells.	19663	19995
28883039	Fifteen 15-cm dishes of RPE-1 cells were grown to 80%–900% confluency and then washed with PBS.	19996	20091
28883039	The cells were then harvested using a cell scraper and pelleted at 500 g for 5 min.	20092	20175
28883039	They were then resuspended in 2.5 ml buffer A (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol) along with 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 10 min.	20176	20406
28883039	The lysate was clarified at 266,000 g and diluted to a volume of 25 ml using buffer A containing 1 mM PMSF and 5 mM DTT to reach a final Triton X-100 concentration of 0.1%.	20407	20579
28883039	Strep-Tactin Sepharose (GE Healthcare) bound to purified StrepII-SNAP-FIP3 was added to the lysate and incubated for 1 h. The beads were then washed four times with buffer A containing 5 mM DTT and 0.1% NP-40.	20580	20789
28883039	Buffer A containing an additional 300 mM NaCl was then added to the beads to form a 50% slurry and incubated on ice for 10 min to elute the dynein and dynactin bound to FIP3.	20790	20964
28883039	This slurry was then passed through a 0.22-µm filter to remove the beads.	20965	21038
28883039	An equal volume of 50% Strep-Tactin Sepharose was added to this elution and allowed to gently mix for 30 min at 4°C to remove any remaining StrepII-SNAP-FIP3.	21039	21197
28883039	The slurry was then filtered again and then diluted with buffer A to reach a final NaCl concentration of 200 mM.	21198	21310
28883039	Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 6%, and the dynein and dynactin were then flash frozen as aliquots.Pull-downs were performed as previously described.	21311	21474
28883039	500 µl clarified porcine brain lysate in buffer A (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol) was added to 80 µl of a 50% suspension of Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) along with 100 nM of the BICD2 construct to be tested.	21475	21766
28883039	To this, 0.1% of NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM DTT were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 1 h. The beads were then pelleted and washed four times with buffer A containing 0.1% NP-40 and 5 mM DTT.	21767	21973
28883039	The proteins were then eluted using SDS loading buffer and resolved on an acrylamide gel (Invitrogen).	21974	22076
28883039	For experiments in which Rab6a was supplemented, the appropriate amount of recombinant Rab6a protein was added before the 4°C incubation step and processed in the same fashion.The SDS-PAGE gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot system from Invitrogen.	22077	22356
28883039	Western blotting was performed using TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T).	22357	22432
28883039	Membranes were blotted for 1 h at RT with 5% milk in TBS-T, followed by a 1-h primary antibody incubation.	22433	22539
28883039	Antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-p150 (clone 12, 1:250; BD), mouse anti-dynein intermediate chain (clone 74.1, 1:1,000; EMD Millipore), mouse anti-6xHis (1:1,000; Roche), and mouse anti-Rab6a (ab55660, 1:500; Abcam).	22540	22767
28883039	Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and then incubated with a secondary antibody for 1 h at RT.	22768	22872
28883039	Secondary antibodies were anti–mouse-800 or anti–rabbit-680 (1:10,000; Molecular Probes).	22873	22962
28883039	Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and then imaged using an Odyssey Clx Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).	22963	23090
28883039	Quantification of band intensity was performed using ImageJ’s (National Institutes of Health) gel analysis feature.	23091	23206
28883039	P-values were calculated using a one-sample t test with a hypothetical mean of 1.Liposomes were prepared from a mixture of lipids dissolved in chloroform at (82.4% POPC, 15% POPS, 2.5% 18:1 PE MCC, and 0.1% rhodamine PE; Avanti).	23207	23436
28883039	After mixing, they were dried under a constant stream of argon and then desiccated in vacuum overnight.	23437	23540
28883039	The lipid film was then resuspended with buffer A without glycerol and passed 25 times through an extruder containing a 200-nm pore size polycarbonate filter.	23541	23699
28883039	A 3:1 ratio of Rab6a to maleimide lipid was then mixed together and incubated overnight.	23700	23788
28883039	The next day, DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mM to quench the reaction, and the liposomes were pelleted at 160,000 g for 20 min to remove unlabeled Rab6a.	23789	23957
28883039	The pellet was then washed and resuspended with buffer A.Microtubules were prepared as previously described.	23958	24066
28883039	Unlabeled tubulin was mixed with biotinylated tubulin and Alexa-640-labeled tubulin at a ratio of 10:2:2 in BRB80 (80 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM MgCl2).	24067	24230
28883039	5 mM GTP was added and the mixture was incubated in a 37°C water bath for 10 min before adding 20 µM Taxol and incubated for an additional 50 min at 37°C.	24231	24385
28883039	Microtubules were spun over a 25% sucrose cushion at 160,000 g for 10 min in a tabletop centrifuge before use.DDB complexes were formed in a 30-µl reaction volume containing ∼20 nM recombinant BICD2, ∼0.15 mg/ml of dynein/dynactin, and buffer A along with 0.1 mg/ml Biotin-BSA, 0.5% pluronic acid F-127, and 0.2 mg/ml κ-casein (buffer B).	24386	24724
28883039	The proteins were mixed and incubated on ice for 20 min before use.	24725	24792
28883039	In experiments in which Rab6a was also included, the respective construct was added to a final concentration of 1 µM.	24793	24910
28883039	Flow chambers with attached microtubules were performed as described (Schroeder and Vale, 2016).	24911	25007
28883039	A 1:4 or 1:5 dilution of the DDB complex in buffer B was then added in presence of 1 mM ATP and the Trolox/PCA/PCD oxygen scavenging system.	25008	25148
28883039	For processivity experiments, a SNAP-BICD2 construct labeled with the TMR-Star fluorophore from NEB was used.	25149	25258
28883039	Because the run lengths using buffer B tended to span the entire lengths of our microtubules, we added 15 mM of KCl to buffer B (termed buffer C) for measurement of processivity.	25259	25437
28883039	The increased amount of salt in buffer C reduced the run length for DDB (4 µm) so that it could be measured more accurately on microtubules (mean length of 16 µm used in these measurements).For liposome assays, the same components as in the aforementioned DDB mixture were mixed in a tube, along with either Rab6aGTP or Rab6aGDP liposomes.	25438	25777
28883039	The liposomes were diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 µM total lipid.	25778	25852
28883039	After incubation, the solution was flowed in undiluted into an imaging chamber after addition of 1 mM ATP and Trolox/PCA/PCD.	25853	25978
28883039	The amount of BICD2–GFP fluorescence on the liposomes was used to determine the mean number of molecules bound to each liposome by comparing it to that of single GFP molecules captured via biotin-anti-GFP stuck onto a coverslip coated with streptavidin.	25979	26232
28883039	Fluorescence intensities were measured by integrating the average fluorescence intensity over five frames at 200-ms exposure and quantified with the FiJi plugin Spot Intensity Analysis (http://imagej.net/Spot_Intensity_Analysis).	26233	26462
28883039	Liposome GFP fluorescence (bound to glass) was normalized to single GFP fluorescent yielded an average of 6.01 BICD2 molecules per Rab6aGTP liposomes (n = 6,000 intensity measurements of single GFP and n = 728 intensity measurement of BICD2–GFP on liposomes).Total internal reflection fluorescence images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse TE200-E microscope equipped with an Andor iXon electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera, a 100× 1.49 NA objective, and MicroManager software.	26463	26951
28883039	Exposures of 100 or 200 ms with a frame interval of 1 per second for 300 s was typically used for the acquisition.	26952	27066
28883039	All assays were performed at RT.U2OS cells from ATCC were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 1× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine.	27067	27202
28883039	Cells were seeded in glass-bottom 96-well plates and were at 40% confluence on the day of transfection.	27203	27306
28883039	Cells were transfected with TransIT Lt1 as per the manufacturer’s protocol with a combination of the PEX–eGFP–FRB, mCherry–BICD2–FKBP, and PEX–Rab6a plasmids and incubated overnight.	27307	27489
28883039	The next day, 1 µM rapamycin or DMSO was added to cells and allowed to incubate at 37°C for 1 h. 10 min before the end of this incubation, Cell Mask Far Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added (0.5× of the manufacturer’s solution) to stain the plasma membrane.	27490	27751
28883039	Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA at RT, followed by extensive washing with PBS.	27752	27852
28883039	Cells were imaged at RT using an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope using a 0.75 NA 40× air objective, Andor Xyla camera, and Micro-Manager software.Primary hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from tissue from embryonic day 18 (E18) rat brains that were shipped overnight on ice from BrainBits.	27853	28155
28883039	Cells were prepared according to provider’s instructions.	28156	28213
28883039	Briefly, the tissue was incubated with a 2 mg/ml solution of papain in Hibernate E without calcium (BrainBits) for 10 min at 30°C.	28214	28344
28883039	The tissue was then triturated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette for 1 min, and then large tissue pieces were allowed to settle for 1 min.	28345	28487
28883039	The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 200 g for 1 min to collect cells.	28488	28570
28883039	After removal of most of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended with 1 ml NbActiv1 and the cells were counted after staining with Trypan Blue (1:5 dilution).	28571	28733
28883039	50,000 cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine/laminin coated round coverslips (Corning BioCoat) placed into wells of a 24-well plate.One day after plating, neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).	28734	28951
28883039	Each transfection reaction contained 1 µg total plasmid DNA along with 4 µl Lipofectamine reagent incubated together for 20 min at RT.	28952	29086
28883039	Media from the neurons was then removed and saved, and fresh NbActiv was added to the wells along with the transfection mixture.	29087	29215
28883039	After 2.5 h at 37°C in 5% CO2, the neurons were washed with NbActiv, and the original conditioned media was added back.	29216	29335
28883039	Cells were fixed 3 d after transfection using 4% PFA for 20 min at RT.	29336	29406
28883039	After washing, the coverslips were mounted onto slides using VECTASHIELD (Vector Labs).	29407	29494
28883039	Neurons were imaged for both soluble GFP and mCherry–BICD2 signal at RT using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a 0.5 NA 20× air objective, a C4742-98 charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu), and Micro-Manager software.Kymographs were created from the single-molecule or liposome movies using ImageJ.	29495	29800
28883039	The number of runs per micrometer of MT per unit of time was obtained from these kymographs, with each run being scored if it was >1 µm in length.	29801	29947
28883039	P-values were calculated using an unpaired t test.	29948	29998
28883039	The cumulative frequency was used for analysis of run lengths, as previously described.	29999	30086
28883039	The one-cumulative frequency distribution was fitted with a one-phase exponential decay for run lengths of >1 µM, as runs shorter than this were undersampled or difficult to measure given our imaging conditions.The images acquired from fixed U2OS cells were processed and analyzed using the Compaction Profiler plugin previously developed for Icy software.	30087	30443
28883039	In brief, the fluorescent signal from the GFP channel corresponding to peroxisomes was detected after masking the shape of cell via the CellMask channel and quantified using the Spot Detector plugin in Icy.	30444	30650
28883039	The detected fluorescence data were then passed along to the Compaction Profiler plugin, which then calculated the area of a region of interest inside the cell that represents 90% of the total fluorescence signal.	30651	30864
28883039	A higher degree of clustering results in a smaller calculated area, whereas a more diffusive signal yields a larger area.	30865	30986
28883039	P-values were calculated using an unpaired t test.Neurite lengths were measured using the soluble GFP signal from the transfected plasmid.	30987	31125
28883039	Acquired images were processed via ImageJ.	31126	31168
28883039	The background was subtracted using the default setting, followed by a median filter with a value of 2.0.	31169	31274
28883039	The images were adjusted for brightness and contrast and the ImageJ plugin NeuronJ was then used to trace all neurites, including branches from individual neurite.	31275	31438
28883039	The longest neurite from a cell was also identified and measured.	31439	31504
28883039	P-values were calculated using an unpaired t test.Fig.	31505	31559

26900322	Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, one of the most common types of panuveitis in China, is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by bilateral, chronic, diffuse granulomatous panuveitis associated with auditory, neurologic, and cutaneous involvement.	0	258
26900322	VKH syndrome is not associated with mortality; however, the development of VKH syndrome may result in long-term blinding complications, including complicated cataracts, secondary glaucoma, and subretinal neovascularization or proliferation.	259	499
26900322	The vision-threatening complications often occur during the recurrent stage.	500	576
26900322	Iwahashi et al. reported that 25.5% of patients with VKH syndrome in Japan exhibited recurrent inflammation.	577	685
26900322	Sakata and associates reported that 79% of Brazilian patients with VKH syndrome given early high-dose corticosteroids evolved to chronic-recurrent inflammation.	686	846
26900322	Complicated cataract, which has a reported prevalence of 42% in patients with VKH syndrome, is the most common complication of VKH syndrome.	847	987
26900322	Quek et al. identified recurrent inflammation as a critical poor prognostic factor for cataract surgery in VKH syndrome.	988	1108
26900322	In addition, the recurrence of VKH syndrome inflammation gives rise to longer courses of therapy with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, elevating the risk of side effects.	1109	1291
26900322	The specific etiology of VKH syndrome is unclear, although it has been speculated that VKH syndrome pathogenesis involves autoimmune mechanisms, genetic factors, and infection.	1292	1468
26900322	Previous studies suggested that VKH syndrome is mediated by an autoimmune response directed against melanocytes.	1469	1581
26900322	VKH syndrome with an underlying genetic predisposition typically occurs more frequently in pigmented individuals, such as Chinese, Japanese, Hispanics, and Indians, and is rare in Caucasians.	1582	1773
26900322	Furthermore, recent genetic surveys of VKH syndrome have shown numerous immune-associated genes including the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system (HLA-DRB4, Gene ID: 3126; HLA-DRB1, Gene ID: 3123, OMIM 142857), programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, Gene ID:5133, OMIM 600244), interleukins (IL-12B, Gene ID: 3593, OMIM 161561; IL-12RB1, Gene ID: 3594, OMIM 601604; IL-17F, Gene ID: 112744, OMIM 606496), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF, Gene ID: 4282, OMIM 153620), Fc receptor-like 3 (FCRL3, Gene ID: 115352, OMIM 606510), and osteopontin (OPN, Gene ID: 6696, OMIM 166490).	1774	2355
26900322	In addition, Hou et al. revealed a decreased frequency of the C4 gene copy number determined with real-time PCR in patients with VKH syndrome.	2356	2498
26900322	Yang et al. demonstrated higher frequencies of the G allele of the CFH-rs800292 in patients with non-infection intermediate and posterior uveitis using TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assays.	2499	2713
26900322	However, to date, an association between SNPs in CFI and VKH syndrome has not yet been reported.	2714	2810
26900322	The complement system is a critical component of the innate immune system and is involved in regulating various immunological and inflammatory processes.	2811	2964
26900322	Previous genetic studies of the complement system have identified several associated intraocular inflammatory diseases, including uveitis, pathological myopia, and age-related macular degeneration.	2965	3162
26900322	Ocular complement activation via the alternative pathway contributes to the development of experimental autoimmune anterior uveitis (EAAU) in melanin-associate antigen (MAA)-sensitized Lewis rats, whereas complement system depletion in the host can mediate inhibition of EAAU.	3163	3439
26900322	Complement factor H (CFH, Gene ID: 3075, OMIM 134370), complement factor B (CFB, Gene ID: 629, OMIM 138470), complement factor I (CFI, Gene ID: 3426, OMIM 217030), and component 2 (C2, Gene ID: 717, OMIM 613927) have been shown to be associated with acute anterior uveitis (AAU).	3440	3719
26900322	To the best of our knowledge, only one study, by Hou and associates, identified a decreased copy number of C4 in patients with VKH syndrome using TaqMan real-time PCR technology and concluded that C4 might be an important factor in the development of this disease.	3720	3984
26900322	However, the direct role of component system in the pathogenesis mechanisms of VKH syndrome has not yet been established.	3985	4106
26900322	Recently, we described a significant association between CFI-rs7356506 and the development of AAU.	4107	4205
26900322	Our findings revealed an increased frequency of the A allele and AA genotype in Chinese patients with AAU.	4206	4312
26900322	In the genotype–phenotype analysis, we showed that gender and HLA-B27 status influenced the susceptibility to inherit the CFI risk alleles.	4313	4452
26900322	On this basis, we hypothesized that CFI- rs7356506 might be associated with other types of uveitis, such as VKH syndrome.	4453	4574
26900322	In this study, we aimed to investigate an association of CFI-rs7356506 gene variants with VKH syndrome in Chinese patients.	4575	4698
26900322	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report an association between polymorphisms in the CFI gene and VKH syndrome.	4699	4833
26900322	In addition, we identified that CFI-rs7356506 associated with VKH syndrome depended on recurrent and complicated cataract status.	4834	4963
26900322	The study protocol was designed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethic Committee of the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University.	4964	5137
26900322	Informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls who participated in this study.	5138	5230
26900322	The study adhered to the ARVO statement on human subjects.	5231	5289
26900322	Patients were recruited at the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University.	5290	5364
26900322	A total of 100 patients with VKH syndrome and 300 healthy controls, who were recruited from a Chinese Han population, were enrolled in the study.	5365	5510
26900322	All subjects were given a detailed ophthalmic assessment that included slit-lamp examinations, dilated fundoscopy, B ultrasonography, optical coherence tomography (GmBH, Heidelberg, Germany), and fluorescence angiography.	5511	5732
26900322	All patients with VKH syndrome fulfilled the revised diagnostic criteria proposed by the First VKH International Workshop group.	5733	5861
26900322	Patients diagnosed with any other type(s) of uveitis were excluded from the study.	5862	5944
26900322	The treatment protocol for VKH syndrome was started from orally administered prednisolone in the range of 1–1.5 mg/kg/day or intravenously administered hydroprednisone in the range of 0.5–1 g daily, and followed by tapering of the orally steroid guided by ocular inflammation for 12 months or more.	5945	6243
26900322	Additional immunosuppressive therapy was required for those in whom no improved activity of inflammation was observed for 1 week or more, and he (or she) was defined as steroid insensitive.	6244	6433
26900322	Recurrent status was defined as recurrent episodes of intraocular inflammation that occurred after uveitis had been in remission for more than 3 months.	6434	6586
26900322	The healthy controls were unrelated individuals without any ocular disease except senile cataract.	6587	6685
26900322	The subjects with autoimmune disorder were also excluded.	6686	6743
26900322	The clinical characteristics of the subjects are presented in Table 1.	6744	6814
26900322	Peripheral venous blood was obtained from each subject, and genomic DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit (Simgen, Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.	6815	6996
26900322	Genomic DNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE).	6997	7121
26900322	The rs7356506 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CFI gene was genotyped in our study.	7122	7216
26900322	The SNP was genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY technology platform with iPLXGOLD chemistry (Sequenom, San Diego, CA).	7217	7338
26900322	Genotyping reagents recommended by the iPLEX Gold SNP genotyping kit (Sequenom) were used in this study.	7339	7443
26900322	The software and equipment provided by the MassARRAY platform (Sequenom) were also employed.	7444	7536
26900322	Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested using the χ2 test for evaluating the deviation of the selected SNP.	7537	7648
26900322	Either the χ2 test or a Fisher exact test was performed to compare the allele and genotype frequencies between the patients with VKH syndrome and the control subjects.	7649	7816
26900322	Common genetic models (dominant and recessive) in terms of minor alleles were applied to identify associations.	7817	7928
26900322	Stratified analyses were performed based on recurrent status, complicated cataract status and steroid sensitive status.	7929	8048
26900322	We also calculated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).	8049	8128
26900322	A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.	8129	8198
26900322	Of the 100 patients with VKH syndrome, 54 (54.0%) were men, and 46 (46.0%) were women.	8199	8285
26900322	The mean age of patients with VKH syndrome was 42.6 years (range from 14 to 74 years).	8286	8372
26900322	All patients had recorded detailed lens diaphaneity, and 56 (56.0%) were diagnosed with complicated cataract.	8373	8482
26900322	Sixteen (16.0%) patients were insensitive to steroid treatment.	8483	8546
26900322	Seventy-two subjects were followed for at least 3 years; 27 (37.5%) had recurrent VKH syndrome, and 45 (62.5%) had non-recurrent VKH syndrome.	8547	8689
26900322	The control group of subjects (300 individuals) comprised 66% men and 34% women.	8690	8770
26900322	The mean age of the controls was 69.5 years (range from 60 to 88 years).	8771	8843
26900322	Patients’ detailed clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1.	8844	8913
26900322	The CFI genotyped SNP successfully conformed to HWE in the controls.	8914	8982
26900322	No significant associations in either allele or genotype frequencies for the SNP were detected between the patients with VKH syndrome and the controls (Table 2).	8983	9144
26900322	When the analyses were stratified by the recurrent status, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of the G allele and GG homozygosity for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP in recurrent patients with VKH syndrome compared with the control subjects (p=0.016, OR=0.429, 95% CI=0.212–0.871; p=0.014, OR=0.364, 95% CI=0.158–0.837, respectively); however, no significant association was detected in either the allelic or genotypic frequencies for the CFI SNP between the non-recurrent patients with VKH syndrome and the controls (Table 3).	9145	9677
26900322	When the analyses were stratified by complicated cataract status, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of the G allele and GG homozygosity for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP in patients with VKH syndrome with complicated cataract compared to the control subjects (p<0.001, OR=0.357, 95% CI=0.197–0.648; p<0.001, OR=0.273, 95% CI=0.135–0.551, respectively); however, no significant association was detected in either allelic or genotypic frequencies for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP between the patients with VKH syndrome without complicated cataract and the controls (Table 4).	9678	10252
26900322	When the analyses were stratified by steroid-sensitive status, there was no significant association in either the allele or genotype frequencies for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP in the steroid-sensitive patients with VKH syndrome and the control subjects (p=0.239 and 0.491, respectively).	10253	10535
26900322	The same result was detected for steroid-insensitive patients with VKH syndrome and control subjects (Table 5).	10536	10647
26900322	In this study, we demonstrated that CFI gene polymorphisms are not significantly associated with VKH syndrome.	10648	10758
26900322	Interestingly, the stratified analyses revealed that there was a significant decrease in the frequency of G allele and GG homozygosity for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP in the patients with recurrent VKH syndrome or with complicated cataract compared with the control subjects, suggesting that CFI-rs7356506 may decrease the risk for VKH syndrome in the context of recurrent VKH syndrome or complicated cataract.	10759	11163
26900322	Whereas, no significant association with patients with VKH syndrome in the steroid-sensitive status was detected for CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms.	11164	11309
26900322	Complement factor I (CFI) is a serine protease, which inhibits activation of the complement proteins C3b and C4b in the presence of cofactors.	11310	11452
26900322	CFI can inhibit C3b and cleave C3b into inactive iC3b.	11453	11507
26900322	This process prevents the assembly of C3 convertases in the classical and alternative pathways.	11508	11603
26900322	The complement system plays an important role in the primary immune process and is an essential component of various immunological and inflammatory responses.	11604	11762
26900322	As a key regulator in the complement pathway, CFI deficiency is associated with various kinds of immune diseases or inflammatory disease such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).	11763	12037
26900322	Uveitis is usually regarded as intraocular inflammation.	12038	12094
26900322	Our previous study showed that CFI-rs7356506 played a genetic protective role in acute anterior uveitis.	12095	12199
26900322	Meanwhile, our results indicated the G allele and GG genotype play a protect role in recurrent inflammation and complicated cataract of patients with VKH syndrome.	12200	12363
26900322	The single ethnicity of the subjects may only represent a selected population of patients.	12364	12454
26900322	Therefore, the results may be applicable only to Chinese Han populations and must be verified in other ethnic cohorts.	12455	12573
26900322	Although we recruited quite a few cases and controls, the small sample size and the diverse phenotype of VKH syndrome might have affected the stratified analysis.	12574	12736
26900322	Also of note, it is difficult to separate complicated cataract caused by intraocular inflammation and secondary to long-course corticosteroid agents.	12737	12886
26900322	Further studies are needed to expound a more accurate relationship between phenotype and genotype in VKH disease.	12887	13000
26900322	In conclusion, although our results indicate that CFI polymorphisms are not significantly associated with VKH syndrome, we identified a trend for the association of CFI-rs7356506 with VKH syndrome, depending on recurrent status and complicated cataract status.	13001	13261
26900322	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the genotype–phenotype association between a CFI SNP and VKH syndrome.	13262	13401
26900322	Further studies are required to replicate the candidate SNP in other phenotypes of VKH syndrome and in other ethnic groups, and to investigate the biologic roles of these polymorphisms in immune mechanisms involved in uveitis.	13402	13628
28368537	In mammals, implantation, the period during which the blastocyst establishes an intimate connection with the uterus, is essential for embryonic development.	0	156
28368537	In preparation for implantation, the uterus undergoes a series of changes, primarily driven by the ovarian steroid hormones that culminate in the uterus becoming transiently receptive to blastocysts.	157	356
28368537	In mice, receptivity commences on the morning of the fourth day after mating (day of plug = day 1 pregnancy), with implantation, trophoblast invasion, and decidualization occurring some 12 hours later (1).	357	562
28368537	The ovarian steroid hormones estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) are the key factors regulating uterine preparation (2).	563	683
28368537	At ovulation, high levels of E2 stimulate uterine cell proliferation (3).	684	757
28368537	Subsequently, levels of P4 increase, and these suppress cell proliferation and initiate cell differentiation, culminating in the uterus, becoming potentially receptive on the fourth day after mating.	758	957
28368537	On the morning of the fourth day, blastocysts are distributed along the uterine lumen, juxtaposed to the antimesometrial luminal epithelium (LE).	958	1103
28368537	Implantation is then initiated by a brief surge of E2 (nidatory E2) that results in the embryonic trophectoderm invading the LE.	1104	1232
28368537	The LE adjacent to the invading trophectoderm undergoes either apoptosis or entosis (4), and the underlying stroma differentiates to form the decidua (5).	1233	1387
28368537	Decidualization increases vascular permeability and acts to support early postimplantation embryonic growth and placenta formation, as well as restrict trophoblast invasion.	1388	1561
28368537	The hormonal effects on the uterus are mediated either directly or indirectly through locally produced growth factors and cytokines (6).	1562	1698
28368537	One of these factors, essential for implantation, is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (7).	1699	1789
28368537	During ovulation, LIF is expressed in the murine glandular epithelium (GE) (8, 9).	1790	1872
28368537	Over the next 3 days of the reproductive cycle, LIF levels decline but then transiently increase in the GE prior to implantation on D4 of pregnancy.	1873	2021
28368537	The second increase of LIF is induced by nidatory E2, together with the tumor suppressor and transcription factor, p53 (10, 11).	2022	2150
28368537	In a wide variety of mammalian species, including human females, a rise in uterine LIF expression is associated with the onset of implantation, implicating LIF in having an important role in regulating uterine receptivity in humans and many other mammals (12).	2151	2411
28368537	Polymorphisms in the p53 gene, which are associated with reduced LIF levels due to reduced transcriptional activity, are frequently present among young women undergoing in vitro fertilization, potentially correlating a reduction LIF levels with infertility (13).	2412	2674
28368537	Uteri from Lif−/− mice show no evidence of epithelial apoptosis, stromal decidualization, or blastocyst invasion (10).	2675	2793
28368537	However, transfer of the blastocysts from Lif−/− females to wild-type (WT) pseudopregnant recipients results in the embryos undergoing normal implantation and development (7).	2794	2969
28368537	Furthermore, a single injection of recombinant LIF into pregnant Lif−/− mice on day 4 or 5 of pregnancy induces blastocyst implantation with development to term, revealing that during pregnancy LIF is only required to initiate implantation (10).	2970	3215
28368537	The injection of LIF is also sufficient in replacing nidatory E2 at inducing implantation in appropriately primed ovariectomized mice.	3216	3350
28368537	Together these findings demonstrate that E2, together with p53, induces LIF expression, with LIF mediating the effects of nidatory E2 at initiating uterine receptivity and implantation.	3351	3536
28368537	In the absence of LIF, implantation fails and is a maternal defect (14).	3537	3609
28368537	LIF acts by binding to the heterodimeric receptor comprised of the LIF receptor (LIFR)β and GP130.	3610	3708
28368537	In the uterus, both LIFRβ and GP130 are detected in the GE and LE at 3 to 4 days postcoitum (dpc) (15–17).	3709	3815
28368537	LIFR expression is initially restricted to the uterine LE, with levels increasing from day 3 onwards after mating.	3816	3930
28368537	On day 4 following LIF expression, LIFR levels transiently increase in the LE and to a lesser extent in the GE, thereafter expression declines.	3931	4074
28368537	GP130 expression is restricted to the apical surface of the day 4 LE (17).	4075	4149
28368537	Treatment of the LE with LIF induces activation of the Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/Stat)–signaling pathway that phosphorylates the latent transcription factor Stat3 (15).	4150	4363
28368537	Phosphorylated dimers of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) then translocate to the nucleus (18).	4364	4486
28368537	In the LE of Lif−/− mice, Stat3 translocation to the nucleus does not occur (15, 17).	4487	4572
28368537	Mice that are homozygous for a deletion of the Stat3-GP130 docking site show defective implantation, and deregulation of soluble GP130 has been reported in patients with unexplained fertility (19, 20).	4573	4774
28368537	In addition, genetic ablation of the Stat3 gene or the application of Jak/Stat inhibitors (21–23) results in defective implantation.	4775	4907
28368537	A deeper examination into the role of LIF signaling components in implantation is complicated due to the broad expression of these proteins, with the loss of each of the three proteins (LIFR, gp130, and Stat3) resulting in embryonic/perinatal lethality (24–26).	4908	5169
28368537	Lifr-deficient mice die during embryogenesis or shortly after birth making it impossible to determine the LIFR’s role at regulating implantation.	5170	5315
28368537	To define this role, we first derived a mouse line carrying conditional alleles of Lifr (Lifrflx/flx) by the introduction of LoxP sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, flanking the extracellular domain of the Lifr gene.	5316	5526
28368537	In addition, we established a mouse line (LtfCre/Cre) in which the lactotransferrin/lactoferrin gene (Ltf) was used to drive Cre recombinase expression in the uterine epithelia.	5527	5704
28368537	Lactotransferrin is an iron-binding antimicrobial protein that is expressed in many secretory tissues including tear ducts, salivary glands, and mammary glands, as well as the uterine GE and LE, where it functions as part of the innate immune system (27).	5705	5960
28368537	Mice lacking a functional Ltf gene are viable and overtly normal.	5961	6026
28368537	In the murine GE and LE, Ltf expression is induced by E2 and inhibited by P4 and is highly expressed for 3 days after ovulation.	6027	6155
28368537	The Cre recombinase gene was “knocked into” the Ltf locus, so placing Cre under the control of the Ltf promoter, and we show that this knock-in, in the uterus, restricts Cre expression to the LE and GE.	6156	6358
28368537	Here, we show that Lifrflx/Δ mice crossed with LtfCre/Cre (CB4) mice results in viable adult mice.	6359	6457
28368537	In the females, there is a loss of the Lifr expression in the uterine LE and GE.	6458	6538
28368537	This is associated with a failure to activate the Jak-Stat pathway upon treatment, with LIF resulting in the majority of blastocysts not implanting.	6539	6687
28368537	Mice were maintained at the A*STAR Biological Resource Centre facility in accordance with (28), with the protocols reviewed and approved by the A*STAR Biological Resource Centre Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.	6688	6910
28368537	An outline of the three transgenic and recombinant (gene-targeted) lines is presented in Supplemental Fig.	6911	7017
28368537	1.	7018	7020
28368537	A 2.5-kb EcoRI-SmaI fragment from the mL14p9E plasmid containing the Ltf promoter (corresponding to bases –2637 to –18, ATG = 1) was ligated with the Cre-poly (A) cassette, to generate a Ltf-Cre transgenic mouse line by pronuclear injection of the plasmid (Supplemental Figs.	7021	7296
28368537	1A and 2A).	7297	7308
28368537	Ltf-Cre (L4-Cre) transgenic animals were generated by standard pronuclear injection techniques at the National Cancer Institute at Frederick transgenic mouse facility.	7309	7476
28368537	After pronuclear injection of the transgene, 170 mice were derived and genotyped by southern blotting to detect the presence and dosage of the transgene.	7477	7630
28368537	Six males from the 55 genotyped as being positive for the transgene were then subsequently analyzed, by crossing with Rosa26R3 female reporter mice (29).	7631	7784
28368537	From each female, the E13 embryo was collected and stained for β-galactosidase expression.	7785	7875
28368537	To derive the “knock-in” mouse line, CB4, the Cre recombinase, was inserted into the endogenous lactoferrin gene, just downstream of the ATG start site (Supplemental Fig.	7876	8046
28368537	1B and Supplemental Fig.	8047	8071
28368537	3).	754	757
28368537	The lactoferrin (Ltf) gene consists of 17 exons and is transcribed as a single transcript.	8076	8166
28368537	A 9-kb EcoRI fragment in pGEM3Z (mL14p9E) containing 2.6 kb of 5′ flanking sequence and the first eight exons of the Ltf gene, was subcloned from a 14-kb Ltfl phage clone (mL14 from a 129/J mouse genomic DNA library, DASH, Strategene—a gift of C. T. Teng; Supplemental Fig.	8167	8440
28368537	3A and 3B).	8441	8452
28368537	An XbaI fragment containing exon 1 was subcloned into pBluescript.	8453	8519
28368537	Cre recombinase complementary DNA (cDNA) containing the SV40 poly (A) sequence was excised from the pmnCre plasmid (gift from P. Soriano) using StyI-HindIII digestion and cloned by blunt-end ligation into the StyI site at bp72 in exon 1.	8520	8757
28368537	The resulting XbaI sequence containing Cre-pA was then recloned into mL14pE9.	8758	8835
28368537	A neomycin (neo) cassette under the control of the PGK promoter was isolated from pPGKneobpA, using Xho1, was blunt-end ligated into the partially digested XbaI site.	8836	9002
28368537	A thymidine kinase (TK) cassette, under the control of the MC1 promoter from pKS-TK, was cloned into the Xho1-BamH1 (in the vector) site to replace an Xho1-EcoRI fragment in the mL14p9E plasmid, thus generating the targeting vector, pLF-C-N-TK (Supplemental Fig.	9003	9265
28368537	3B).	8448	8452
28368537	A 1.5-kb fragment spanning exons 5 to 8 was excised with Xho1-BamH1 (Supplemental Fig.	9271	9357
28368537	3B) and used as a probe for southern analysis to detect homologous recombinants (Supplemental Fig.	9358	9456
28368537	3D).	9457	9461
28368537	The resulting transcript from the targeted allele (Supplemental Fig.	9462	9530
28368537	3B) would produce the initial 17 amino acids of Ltf followed by the Cre sequence (Supplemental Fig.	9531	9630
28368537	3C and 3E).	9631	9642
28368537	The LifR gene contains 21 exons spanning some 50 kb.	9643	9695
28368537	To generate the conditional LifR allele (LifRflx/flx; Supplemental Fig.	9696	9767
28368537	1C), two targeting vectors were constructed: pTV-LRup (pTV-LifR-fH), which generated (LifRflx/flxHyg), and pTV-LRdown (pTV-LifR-fN), which generated LifRflxlxNeo (Supplemental Fig.	9768	9948
28368537	4A and 4B).	9949	9960
28368537	These vectors targeted introns 1 and 14, respectively (30).	9961	10020
28368537	pTV-LRup was derived from pl5-5.5 Asp, a 5.7-kb KpnI fragment between exons 1 and 2 and cloned into pGEM7 (gift from C. Ware) (25).	10021	10152
28368537	A PGK-hygro-poly (A) cassette flanked by loxP sites was blunt-end ligated into the BstEII site.	10153	10248
28368537	The resulting construct was digested with BamHI and cloned into pBS-TK, containing the TK negative selection cassette.	10249	10367
28368537	The 0.5-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment in p15-5.5, absent from pTV-LRup, was used as a probe for southern analysis.	10368	10475
28368537	The genomic DNA fragment used to make the targeting vector pTV-LRdown (pTV-LifR-fH) was derived by screening a library of 129 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs; RP22-129S6/SvEvTac Research Genetics) using LifR cDNA as a probe.	10476	10707
28368537	From 27 BAC clones, three were confirmed by dot blot analysis as containing the LifR gene (RP22-175O16, RP22-417F23, and RP23-476A13).	10708	10842
28368537	DNA from a mixture of the three BACs was digested with EcoRI; large fragments were gel purified and cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEMTEasy (Promega).	10843	10993
28368537	Clones were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers targeting the fibronectin type III domains of LifR (exons 12 to 14), LR1783 forward (5′-CATTGAACGAGGAGACACAGTCAGTTTTGG-3′) and LR2197 reverse (5′-GAACGTAACAGTTGGTATCCCTGGTTAGTGC-3′), resulting in the identification of a 9kb EcoRI fragment containing exons 11 to 16.	10994	11329
28368537	A PGKneobpA cassette flanked by loxP sites was excised from pHR68 (gift from D. Duboule) by XhoI digestion and inserted into an XhoI site within intron 14 in the same orientation as the PGK-hygro-poly (A) cassette.	11330	11544
28368537	An MC1-TK cassette was cloned into the Sac1-Sal1 site to generate the pTV-LRdown targeting vector.	11545	11643
28368537	The DNA fragment used for southern analysis was generated from the BAC by cloning an EcoR1-BamH1 fragment 3′ to the targeting construct.	11644	11780
28368537	The targeting vectors were linearized by Not1 digestion and electroporated into W9.5 129 embryonic stem (ES) cells.	11781	11896
28368537	ES clones were cultured and selected for as described (31, 32).	11897	11960
28368537	For the LtfCre (CB4) knock-in southern analysis, genomic DNA was digested with EcoR1.	11961	12046
28368537	The blots were probed with a 1.0-kb Xho-Bam1 fragment from mL14p9E corresponding to the sequence immediately 3′ to the targeting vector.	12047	12183
28368537	The probe hybridized to the 9-kb WT allele and a 7.4-kb recombinant allele due to addition of EcoR1 site within the neo cassette (Supplemental Fig.	12184	12331
28368537	2B).	12332	12336
28368537	Four positive clones were identified among 144 G418-resistant clones.	12337	12406
28368537	Clones were karyotyped to ensure diploidy, and two clones were expanded, injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts, and transferred to B6CBAF1 recipient females.	12407	12560
28368537	Germline chimeras were identified and transmission of the LtfCre verified by PCR (31, 32).	12561	12651
28368537	For derivation of the LifRflx/flx conditional mouse line, a double targeting strategy was used.	12652	12747
28368537	Initially, the constructs pTV-LRup and and pTV-LRdown were electroporated individually to test their respective targeting efficiencies.	12748	12883
28368537	Screening of 48 antibiotic-resistant clones using Kpn1 digestion for LRup (LifRflxH), which produced a 5.7-kb WT band, or a 4.1-kb mutant band and BamH1 digestion for LRdown (LifRflxH) that resulted a 3.9-kb WT band or a 5.1-kb recombinant band, was performed.	12884	13144
28368537	The LRup (LifRflxH) electroporation produced 32 (67%) positive clones, whereas the LRdown (LifRflxNeo) electroporation produced 22 (46%) positive clones.	13145	13298
28368537	The high rate of homologous recombination revealed that the LifR locus is easily targetable and that a simultaneous double-targeting strategy could be attempted.	13299	13460
28368537	To this end, the ES cells were electroporated with a mixture containing both the pTV-LRup and pTV-LRdown targeting constructs.	13461	13587
28368537	After 24 hours, ES cells were simultaneously selected with hygromycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and G418 (Invitrogen).	13588	13707
28368537	Of 48 clones, five were confirmed to be positive by southern analysis for homologous recombination at both loci.	13708	13820
28368537	To further ensure that both targeting vectors recombined with the LifR gene in cis and ensure that the loxP sites were functional, Cre recombinase was transiently expressed in the five ES clones by transfection of pMC1-Cre (a Cre cDNA expressed under the MC1 promoter, gift of K. Rajewsky).	13821	14111
28368537	PCR was used to identify the deletion product of the floxed LifR.	14112	14177
28368537	Two of five clones were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeras.	14178	14249
28368537	Clone J8 produced germline offspring inheriting the conditional LifRflx/+ allele.	14250	14331
28368537	Germline transmission of the Ltf-Cre knock-in was confirmed by southern analysis, and mice were subsequently genotyped by PCR amplification of genomic DNA.	14332	14487
28368537	Two pairs of PCR primers were used to genotype LtfCre (CB4) lines: Cre primers (Cre73 forward: 5′-GTGTCCAATTTACTGACCGTACACC-3′; Cre373 reverse: 5′-GACGATGAAGCATGTTTAGCTGG-3′) and Ltf primers (forward 5′-TGAGGTCACCCAGCACAGATAAAG-3′; Ltf intron1-5′-GAGAGGGTGAGATGTTCCTGTGAGTC), corresponding to sequences within the promoter through intron 1.	14488	14828
28368537	The Ltf primers generate a 331-bp WT product or a 1.7-kb LtfCre (CB4; CreKI) product.	14829	14914
28368537	Mice containing the LifR+/flx alleles were identified by PCR using the following primers: LifR-CKO up-forward (U5) 5′-CCTTTTGCAGTCTCACAGGTCTTG-3′; Lifr-CKO up-reverse (U3) 5′-TGGAAAGCAGAGAAGCACAAGC-3′ to generate a 368-nucleotide (nt) WT product, a ∼2-kb hygromycin-containing fragment (Hygro-on; fH) or a 461-nt loxP-containing product (Hygro-off; fDH).	14915	15269
28368537	Lifr-CKO down-forward (D5) 5′-gcccctttgtgacatactcgattc-3′; Lifr-CKO down-reverse (D3) 5′-TGGTAAGTCCAACTCAGCTAAGTGC-3′ to generate a 172-nt WT product, an ∼2-kb neo-containing fragment (fN) or a 272-nt loxP-containing fragment.	15270	15496
28368537	In addition, using primers U5 together with D3, amplifies a 474-nt product in the null LifrΔ/Δ allele.	15497	15599
28368537	To delete the neo and hygromycin selectable markers, the LifrfH-fN/fH-fN mice were crossed with CB4 mice, and the resultant Lifrflx/+:LtfCre/+ mice were screened for loss of neo and hygromycin cassettes by PCR as described above.	15600	15829
28368537	The deletion of the selectable markers leaves two loxP sites at introns 1 and 14 intact.	15830	15918
28368537	To generate the complete Lifr deletion (LifrΔ/Δ), the Lifrflx/flx mice were crossed with the Ltf-Cre transgenic line (L4-Cre), used here as a general deletor to obtain LifrΔ/+:Cre/+.	15919	16101
28368537	The Lifrflx/+:Ltf Cre/+ mice were then crossed with LifrΔ /+:Cre– mice to obtain Lifrflx/Δ::Ltf Cre/+.	16102	16204
28368537	Females with this genotype were then used to determine the consequences of Lifr deletion in the LE.	16205	16304
28368537	To determine the tissue specific expression of Cre activity in vivo LtfCre/Cre mice were crossed to the mouse reporter lines: Z/AP (33), Rosa26R3, and mT/mG (34).	16305	16467
28368537	For whole-mount embryo analysis, embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).	16468	16551
28368537	β-Galactosidase activity in the Rosa26R3 crosses was detected after incubation with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-galactopyranoside; Invitrogen).	16552	16705
28368537	Alkaline phosphatase activity in Z/AP mice was detected using BCIP/NBT (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium; Vector Laboratories) staining according to manufacturer’s protocol.	16706	16906
28368537	Cre expression in the uterus was evaluated using the Gt (ROSA)26R3Sortm1Sor/J, Z/AP, and mT/mG mouse reporter lines.	16907	17023
28368537	Frozen sections were fixed with 4% PFA and then stained with BCIP/NBT or by immunofluorescent analysis for mT or mG. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded samples as previously described (17).	17024	17241
28368537	The effects of Lifr deficiency on glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and osteoclasts in bone were histologically characterized and by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining with images being recorded on a Zeiss Axioimager.	17242	17475
28368537	Paraffin-embedded thin sections of spinal cords (5 μm) were stained with an antibody against GFAP to identify glial cells and counterstained with Nissl stain.	17476	17634
28368537	The osteoclasts in the long bones were identified by their unique morphology and size after H&E staining, performed using standard histological procedures.	17635	17790
28368537	The uteri from day 1 pregnant CB4+/+/TL +/+ or Tl +/+ mice were fixed in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 for 24 hours, followed by fixation in 30% sucrose (Sigma, St Louis, MO) in PBS pH 7.4 for 24 hours at 4°C.	17791	18053
28368537	Fixed uteri were cut into pieces and placed in tissue freezing medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and frozen in cold heptane (Sigma) kept on dry ice.	18054	18220
28368537	Cryosections of 10 μm were cut and stored at –70°C.	18221	18272
28368537	For detecting membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein (mGFP) fluorescence, cryosections were dried completely at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes.	18273	18428
28368537	The sections were treated with chloroform: isoamyl acetate 24:1 (Sigma) for 10 seconds to eliminate background autofluorescence.	18429	18557
28368537	The sections were dried and then rehydrated in PBS, pH 7.4, for 15 minutes.	18558	18633
28368537	Sections were incubated in 1% sodium borohydride (Sigma) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 minutes followed by washing in PBS twice for 5 minutes each.	18634	18774
28368537	The sections were treated with a mouse-on-mouse blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour and then washed in PBS twice for 5 minutes each to quench additional autofluorescence arising from antibody binding to blood vessels.	18775	19022
28368537	The sections were incubated with DAPI (Invitrogen) to stain nuclei for 10 minutes and washed with PBS.	19023	19125
28368537	Subsequently they were treated with 75 mM copper sulfate in ammonium acetate solution, pH 5.0 (Sigma), for 90 minutes to further decrease lipofuscin autofluorescence (35).	19126	19297
28368537	The sections were washed in PBS and mounted in ProLong gold antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen) and viewed and photographed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).	19298	19493
28368537	For the analysis of blastocyst implantation, female mice with the desired genotype (Lifrflx/Δ: LtfCre/+) were derived and were mated with WT males of proven fertility.	19494	19661
28368537	Plug dates were recorded.	19662	19687
28368537	After the mice were plugged at least three times without becoming pregnant, they were killed after the fourth mating at 7 dpc.	19688	19814
28368537	Uteri were collected and flushed to recover unimplanted blastocysts, and these were transferred to pseudopregnant recipients (7, 32).	19815	19948
28368537	From a pool of three to five uteri, 10 µg of total RNA was prepared, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Northern Max, Ambion), separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde denaturing gels, and transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham).	19949	20200
28368537	P-32–labeled cDNAs corresponding to Cre and lactoferrin were used as probes.	20201	20277
28368537	After standard washing, the membranes were analyzed using a phosphorimager for 1 to 3 days.	20278	20369
28368537	Uteri were isolated and frozen in optimum cutting temperature and then sectioned at 10 µm and mounted on Superfrost slides (VWR International).	20370	20513
28368537	In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (9).	20514	20578
28368537	Sections were warmed to room temperature and fixed in 4% PFA.	20579	20640
28368537	Sections were treated with Proteinase K and prehybridized in 50% (volume-to-volume ratio) formamide, 4×SSC, 5% dextran sulfate (weight-to-volume ration), 1× Denhardt’s solution, 0.25 mg/mL transfer RNA and heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA (0.5 mg/mL) for 3 hours at 42°C.	20641	20911
28368537	A full-length Lifr cDNA clone was used to generate sense and antisense probes by in vitro transcription with (α-35S) uridine triphosphate.	20912	21050
28368537	The hybridization was performed overnight with either S35-labeled sense or antisense probes.	21051	21143
28368537	Slides were processed for liquid emulsion autoradiography and visualized using Kodak D-19 developer.	21144	21244
28368537	LE from D3 pregnant mice was isolated from uteri by enzymatic digestion as previously described (15, 36).	21245	21350
28368537	The purified LE was incubated at room temperature in freezing holding buffer (Specialty Media).	21351	21446
28368537	LIF (Esgro, Millipore) was added and incubated for 2 hours.	21447	21506
28368537	Proteins were extracted by lysis buffer containing 0.1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and complete miniprotease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).	21507	21660
28368537	Protein extracts were separated on 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad).	21661	21795
28368537	Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) and incubated O/N with the following primary antibodies: pSTAT3 (Cell Signaling) and STAT3 (Cell Signaling) at 4°C.	21796	22004
28368537	Loading was normalized using an antibody to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.	22005	22090
28368537	After washing in TTBS, membranes were exposed to horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies, incubated in enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Amersham), and processed for autoradiography on film (Kodak).	22091	22307
28368537	In the sexually mature uterine LE, lactoferrin (lactotransferrin, Ltf) is induced by E2, both during estrous and the first 3 days following ovulation.	22308	22458
28368537	Its expression is then inhibited by a rise in P4 (27, 37, 38).	22459	22521
28368537	To determine whether lactoferrin would be a tissue-specific promoter for Cre expression in the uterine LE, we initially generated a transgenic line, Ltf-Cre (Supplemental Fig.	22522	22697
28368537	1A) using an EcoRI-Sma1 fragment from the Ltf promoter (corresponding to sequences –2637 to –18; transcriptional start site = +1) that contains the E2-regulated element.	22698	22867
28368537	Following pronuclear injection, we examined the offspring from six independently derived transgenic males.	22868	22974
28368537	The offspring from all six males, when crossed to mice carrying the β-galactosidase (ROSA26R3Sortm1Sor/J) reporter gene, all showed ubiquitous expression of β-galactosidase in midgestation embryos (Supplemental Fig.	22975	23190
28368537	2A), indicating that the Ltf-Cre transgene was probably expressed very early in development.	23191	23283
28368537	We retained one line, homozygous for the transgene, which subsequently served as a universal constitutive deleter line to generate the LifrΔ/Δ mice.	23284	23432
28368537	Because the transgenic approach failed to produce mice with Cre expression restricted to the LE and GE, we then chose to “knock-in” the Cre recombinase gene into the Ltf gene so that Cre is under control of all Ltf regulatory elements.	23433	23668
28368537	The vector for a knock-in of Cre recombinase was made by inserting a modified Cre recombinase cDNA (mnCre) within exon 1, downstream of the ATG start site of the Ltf gene (Supplemental Fig.	23669	23858
28368537	1 and Supplemental Fig.	23859	23882
28368537	3A–E).	23883	23889
28368537	Four homologous recombinant ES clones (out of 144 clones) were identified and confirmed by southern analysis (Supplemental Fig.	23890	24017
28368537	3D).	9457	9461
28368537	The resulting fusion protein was predicted to contain the initial 14 amino acids of Ltf followed by Cre sequence (Supplemental Fig.	24023	24154
28368537	3E).	9638	9642
28368537	Homozygous Cre knock-in (LtfCre/Cre or CB4) mice were indistinguishable from WT siblings and did not display any overt phenotype, consistent with Ltf-null mice being viable (39).	24160	24338
28368537	There was however some anemia and reduced levels of hemoglobin in pups derived from homozygous mothers (data not shown).	24339	24459
28368537	In contrast to the Ltf-Cre transgene, the Ltf-Cre insertion line (CB4) had a restricted expression profile.	24460	24567
28368537	Northern blot analysis detected Cre recombinase transcripts and no Ltf transcripts in the uteri from homozygous CB4 mice (Supplemental Fig.	24568	24707
28368537	2B).	12332	12336
28368537	To further evaluate the tissue-specific expression and activity, female CB4 mice were crossed with different reporter lines; the double-fluorescent mT/mG reporter Line (34), the β-galactosidase reporter mice Gt (ROSA26Sortm1Sor/J) (29) and the alkaline phosphatase Z/AP (33).	24713	24988
28368537	As shown in Supplemental Fig.	24989	25018
28368537	2C, E13 embryos generated from the Z/AP × CB4 cross, in contrast to the transgenic lines, did not show ubiquitous AP expression, but showed small discreet regions of AP expression that varied between individual embryos.	25019	25238
28368537	CB4 female mice were then crossed with the dual reporter mT/mG male reporter mice to obtain a more precise definition of Cre activity in the different tissues, and specifically in the uterus of CB4 × mT/mG female offspring.	25239	25462
28368537	The mT/mG mice constitutively express Tomato Red (mT) prior to Cre-mediated recombination.	25463	25553
28368537	Following Cre introduction, expression of mT is lost and expression is switched to an mGFP, specifically in cells where Cre is functional.	25554	25692
28368537	Strong mT expression was observed in the uterine stroma without CB4 [Fig.	25693	25766
28368537	1(B) and 1(D)].	25767	25782
28368537	After crossing with CB4 males, mG expression was only induced and localized at the LE membrane and more weakly in the GE membranes, as well as a few cells in the stroma that were probably neutrophils or macrophages expressing Ltf [Fig.	25783	26018
28368537	1(E) and (H)] (37).	26019	26038
28368537	For unknown reasons, mT expression in the stroma was lost, but no mG expression was induced.	26039	26131
28368537	In females prior to their first reproductive cycle (at ∼5 to 6 weeks) or in ovariectomized mice, mG expression was not induced in the LE or GE.	26132	26275
28368537	However, following E2 injection (50 ng), mG was induced in the LE of ovariectomized mice (data not shown).	26276	26382
28368537	Confirmation that Cre activity in the CB4 line was restricted to the uterine LE and GE was established by crossing the Cre mice to the β-galactosidase reporter mice Gt (ROSA26Sortm1Sor/J) where β-galactosidase activity was restricted to the LE and GE [Fig.	26383	26639
28368537	1(I) and 1(J)].	26640	26655
28368537	In other tissues from the mT/mG × CB4 mice, strong Cre activity was noted in the salivary glands, whereas in the liver (where the LIFR is highly expressed), no activity was detected.	26656	26838
28368537	Weak activity was, however, detected in the ovarian stroma and, to a lesser extent, the heart myocardium, with no activity being detected in other adult tissues (Supplemental Fig.	26839	27018
28368537	5).	1384	1387
28368537	To ensure that as much of the Lifr gene could be deleted following recombination, loxP sites were introduced into Lifr gene flanking the exons encoding the extracellular domains the LIFR (Supplemental Fig.	27023	27228
28368537	4A–F).	27229	27235
28368537	Mice homozygous for the floxed Lifr (Lifrflx/flx) allele and mice heterozygous with a deleted allele (LifrΔ/+or LifrΔ/flx) were viable and indistinguishable both in growth rate and fertility from their WT siblings.	27236	27450
28368537	We derived homozygous deleted LifrΔ/Δ mice by crossing the Lifrflx/flx mice with the Ltf-Cre constitutive deleter line and compared their phenotype to the phenotype of the previously described Lifr−/− mice (25).	27451	27662
28368537	The Lifr−/− mice die perinataly, and viable LifrΔ/Δ offspring were identified at birth which then subsequently died within a few hours after birth (n = 38 newborns analyzed; P > 0.001).	27663	27848
28368537	LifrΔ/Δ E16 and E19 embryos were identified (n = 7) at normal Mendelian ratios and showed no overt abnormalities apart from being smaller.	27849	27987
28368537	Compared with WT littermates, LifrΔ/Δ mice were 8% (E14) and 27% (E19) lighter and 5% (E14) and 12% (E19) shorter in body length (data not shown).	27988	28134
28368537	Such growth retardation may have been due defective placental development, as reported for the Lifr−/− mice (25), because the placenta expresses high levels of the LIFR.	28135	28304
28368537	Lifr−/− mice have increased osteoclast numbers in the long bones and defects in glial cell differentiation in the CNS.	28305	28423
28368537	We observed a similar reduction in glial cell numbers, by GFAP staining in both E16 and E19 LifrΔ/Δ embryos (Supplemental Fig.	28424	28550
28368537	6A).	28551	28555
28368537	We also observed increased osteoclast numbers in the long bones, visualized by H&E staining (Supplemental Fig.	28556	28666
28368537	6B).	28667	28671
28368537	Because of the perinatal lethality of the LifrΔ/Δ mice, the mice were maintained with a Lifrflx/flx genotype.	28672	28781
28368537	We derived Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ females to determine if LE/GE expression of the LIFR is required for implantation.	28782	28894
28368537	Mice with either of these genotypes were, in size and overall health, indistinguishable from WT siblings, indicating that any non LE-GE expression of LtfCre/Cre did not significantly delete Lifrflx/flx in other adult tissues, such as the liver, where the LIFR is highly expressed (40) or during development, which would result in potential lethality.	28895	29245
28368537	To analyze the consequences of Lifr loss in the LE on blastocyst implantation, females with the desired genotype (Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+) were mated with WT males of proven fertility.	29246	29425
28368537	Plug dates were recorded from a total of 11 females.	29426	29478
28368537	After each of the females had mated for at least three cycles without becoming pregnant, a fourth mating was initiated.	29479	29598
28368537	The females were then killed at 7 days after the last mating (7 dpc).	29599	29668
28368537	Uteri were collected, examined for the presence of implantation sites and then flushed to isolate unimplanted blastocysts.	29669	29791
28368537	From the 11 females, 27 hatched, unimplanted blastocysts were recovered from six of seven mice that showed no indication of implantation sites [Fig.	29792	29940
28368537	2(A)], indicating their uteri did not support implantation.	29941	30000
28368537	The remaining four females showed evidence of implantation with a total of seven decidual swellings being identified in the four mice.	30001	30135
28368537	The recovered blastocysts [Fig.	30136	30167
28368537	2(B)] were morphologically similar to normal blastocysts undergoing implantational delay, in that they were elongated and were not enclosed in a zona.	30168	30318
28368537	To verify that the embryos were unaffected by loss of Lifr expression, the blastocysts were transferred to WT pseudopregnant recipients.	30319	30455
28368537	Twelve blastocysts were transferred to pseudopregnant WT recipients, and seven pups were subsequently born.	30456	30563
28368537	These data indicate that implantation failure in Lifr flx/Δ:LtfCre+ LE mice is a consequence of a defective uterus rather than defective blastocysts.	30564	30713
28368537	The uteri from which the blastocysts were recovered showed no evidence of a decidual response or any indication that implantation had been initiated (data not shown).	30714	30880
28368537	The fact that seven implantation sites were detected in four of the Lifr flx/Δ:LtfCre+ females, even after four rounds of mating, indicated that Ltf-Cre mediated deletion, may, occasionally not be fully penetrant.	30881	31094
28368537	To analyze this, we preformed in situ hybridization and Immunostaining on uterine sections from the females.	31095	31203
28368537	In situ hybridization, using a full-length Lifr cDNA as a probe, hybridized to Lifr transcripts in the LE of the WT uterus.	31204	31327
28368537	The Lifr hybridization signal in the LE was weak on day 3 dpc, and increased in intensity between days 4 and 5 dpc, in agreement with previous reports (16, 17) [Fig.	31328	31493
28368537	3(A), panel b].	31494	31509
28368537	No signal was detected using the sense probe.	31510	31555
28368537	Screening for the Lifr in Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+mice revealed the complete absence of Lifr transcripts from three Lifr flx/Δ:LtfCre+ individuals [Fig.	31556	31702
28368537	3(A), panels c and d].	31703	31725
28368537	However, a substantial hybridization signal, indicative of Lifr transcripts, was found in the LE of the fourth mouse (not shown).	31726	31855
28368537	These results were supported by western analysis and immunostaining of the LIFR protein [Fig.	31856	31949
28368537	3(B), panels e–h, and 3(C)] where LIFR was detectable in the basal and apical sides of the LE of WT mice 2 hours after an injection of nidatory E2 [Fig.	31950	32102
28368537	3(B), panel e], whereas in the LE from three Lifr−/−, it was either undetectable by immunostaining or western analysis in two individuals [Fig.	32103	32246
28368537	3(B), panels f and h, and 3(C)] and weakly expressed in the LE of another mouse [Fig.	32247	32332
28368537	3(B), panel g].	32333	32348
28368537	There was an apparent correlation between fertility (ability to support implantation) and detectable Lifr mRNA signal in the LE; the pregnant female was still LIFR positive, whereas the infertile ones showed no LIFR signal.	32349	32572
28368537	These results indicate that Cre recombinase, under the control of the Ltf promoter in Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ females, was effective in the tissue-specific ablation of the Lifr in the majority of mice analyzed.	32573	32778
28368537	The binding of LIF to the LIFR/gp130 receptor complex activates the JAK/STAT pathway (41).	32779	32869
28368537	Previously, we demonstrated that STAT3 is constitutively expressed in the LE during the preimplantation period but is only phosphorylated and translocates to the nuclei in the LE, but not the GE, in response to LIF treatment on days 3 and 4 after mating (15, 17).	32870	33133
28368537	To determine whether STAT3 is phosphorylated in the LE of Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ mice, we performed western and immunofluorescence analysis on whole uteri and LE extracts from mice on days 3 and 4 after mating [Fig.	33134	33345
28368537	3(D–F)].	33346	33354
28368537	We isolated and purified LE from WT females at 3 dpc and incubated the LE with LIF as previously described (15).	33355	33467
28368537	Treatment of the WT LE, with LIF, resulted in a robust increase of phosphorylated Stat3 [Fig.	33468	33561
28368537	3(F), lanes 1–4].	33562	33579
28368537	As with previous observations, the overall levels of STAT3 did not change in response to LIF treatment, but pSTAT3 levels were strongly increased [Fig.	33580	33731
28368537	3(F), lane 4] (15).	33732	33751
28368537	Extracts of LE from WT and Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+mice from 4 dpc were analyzed following LIF treatment using an antibody specific for pSTAT3.	33752	33889
28368537	Although treatment of WT LE with LIF resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig.	33890	33966
28368537	3, lanes 9 and 10), in the Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+, LE extracts STAT3 phosphorylation did not change [Fig.	33967	34068
28368537	3(F), lanes 5–8].	34069	34086
28368537	These results were confirmed by Immunostaining uteri from ovariectomized WT and Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ mice 2 hours after the injection of nidatory E2 (n = 3 each genotype).	34087	34256
28368537	STAT3 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of WT and Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ LE at varying levels [Fig.	34257	34356
28368537	3(D), panels j–m]; however, only in the WT LE was pSTAT3 localization to the nuclei detected [Fig.	34357	34455
28368537	3(E), panel n]—not in the LE nuclei from the Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ mice [Fig.	34456	34530
28368537	3(E), panels o–q].	34531	34549
28368537	One of the genes whose expression is inhibited in the LE by LIF is the homeobox gene Msx1 (17, 42, 43, 44).	34550	34657
28368537	In WT mice on day 4 dpc, MSX1 expression is detectable in the uterine LE (42, 44).	34658	34740
28368537	However, within 2 to 3 hours after either E2 or LIF injection, MSX1 expression is completely suppressed [Fig.	34741	34850
28368537	4(A)].	34851	34857
28368537	In the Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ uteri, MSX1 expression was sustained and even appeared to have spread into some stromal cell nuclei [Fig.	34858	34989
28368537	4(B)] by 3 hours after E2 injection.	34990	35026
28368537	This supports previous findings that LIF induction on day 4 suppresses MSX1 expression and that this suppression is necessary to render the uterus receptive to implanting blastocysts.	35027	35210
28368537	Embryo implantation is a highly complex yet coordinated process that is driven by the ovarian steroid hormones E2 and P4.	35211	35332
28368537	These hormones operate by activation of many autocrine and paracrine signaling molecules in different tissue compartments of the uterus.	35333	35469
28368537	Among these signaling molecules, the cytokine LIF is essential.	35470	35533
28368537	LIF’s action on the LE results in the change in the expression of at least 50 transcription factors within 1 hour of LIF treatment.	35534	35665
28368537	These transcription factors, in turn, activate a multitude of physiological pathways (17, 45).	35666	35760
28368537	Analysis of how these different factors act in concert, resulting in successful blastocyst implantation, has been hampered by the lack of an appropriate in vitro system to dissect the molecular and cellular events.	35761	35975
28368537	Consequently, it has been necessary to resort to studying the process in vivo, primarily through genetic routes in which mutations are introduced into genes suspected of being important to implantation.	35976	36178
28368537	However, deletion of many of these genes results in embryonic or developmental abnormalities that prevent female mice from reaching a reproductive maturity.	36179	36335
28368537	This issue can be sidestepped using the Cre-Lox system to conditionally regulate gene expression.	36336	36433
28368537	At least five Cre lines of mice have been derived to specifically delete genes in the uterus, these being PR-Cre (46), Amhr2-Cre (47), Wnt7a-Cre (48), Sprr2f-Cre (49), and recently, another Ltf line, Ltf-iCre (50).	36434	36648
28368537	Each of these lines has advantages and disadvantages at directing gene ablation in different cellular compartments.	36649	36764
28368537	A major issue with many of these lines is that the expression of the genes driving Cre may not be restricted to a specific cell type in the uterus.	36765	36912
28368537	For instance, PR is expressed in all cellular compartments in the uterus, as well the ovary, mammary gland, and pituitary, so making it difficult to define gene function in uterine biology, if the floxed gene is expressed in additional cell types.	36913	37160
28368537	Furthermore, some of these genes are expressed, either during embryogenesis or in the maturing postnatal uterus, and so disrupting uterine development rather than physiological function during adult reproduction.	37161	37373
28368537	Here, we have described the derivation of an Ltf-Cre line (CB4) and showed that it can be used to specifically ablate gene expression in the uterine LE and GE.	37374	37533
28368537	The mouse line, CB4 (LtfCre/Cre), has Cre recombinase that was inserted into the lactoferrin (Ltf) gene, so placing Cre expression under control of the E2/P4 regulated Ltf promoter.	37534	37715
28368537	We used the CB4 line to specifically delete a floxed conditional allele of the LIF receptor in the uterine LE.	37716	37826
28368537	LIF initiates implantation by binding to the heterodimeric receptor comprised of the LIFR and gp130 proteins that are expressed in the LE.	37827	37965
28368537	Binding of LIF to the heterodimeric receptor activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the LE (15, 17, 18, 41), resulting in the LE becoming receptive to the juxtaposed blastocysts.	37966	38149
28368537	Determining the requirement for the LIFR in implantation has been hindered by the fact that Lifr-nulls die at birth, so preventing the analysis of LIFR function in different adult tissues (25).	38150	38343
28368537	In the LE and GE of Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ mice, Lifr transcripts and protein were eliminated, indicating that the Ltf–Cre resulted in deletion the Lifrflx/Δ alleles.	38344	38506
28368537	The majority of the Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ females, despite repeated mating with males of proven fertility, did not become pregnant or produce offspring.	38507	38656
28368537	These females were carrying unimplanted blastocysts, and following transfer to pseudopregnant WT recipients, the majority of these blastocysts implanted and developed to term, a result identical to that seen in the Lif-null mice (7).	38657	38890
28368537	These results demonstrate that LIFR and GP130 expression in the LE, are the signaling receptor components required by LIF to initiate the onset of LE receptivity followed by embryo implantation.	38891	39085
28368537	Lifr transcript loss in the LE was, in a few mice, incomplete, with some residual Lifr signal persisting in about 15% of the LE cells.	39086	39220
28368537	Such mosaic expression may well account for some Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ LE females being subfertile, with a reduced number of implantation sites.	39221	39362
28368537	Several reasons may account for the apparent partial loss, including insufficient levels of expression of Cre from the Ltf promoter, Ltf expression varying between individual LE cells and the distance between the loxP sites in the floxed Lifr allele, reducing the efficiency of recombination.	39363	39655
28368537	However, the patchy expression of Cre activity, both in embryos and in the uterus, as revealed in the reporter mice, suggests that variable expression of Cre is a possibility.	39656	39831
28368537	These observations suggest that LIFR expression in a few LE cells may be sufficient to allow for the implantation of a few blastocysts, probably in the regions of the LE where LIFR was still expressed, suggesting that changes in the LE in response to LIF that allow embryo implantation are highly localized and do not “spread” to neighboring cells.	39832	40180
28368537	Many studies have shown that deletion, mutation, or pharmacological inhibition of either the Stat3 or the Gp130 genes results in female infertility and implantation failure.	40181	40354
28368537	Gp130-null mice die in utero due to defective cardiac and vascular development.	40355	40434
28368537	However, a mouse line homozygous for a truncation of a C-terminal region of gp130, which eliminates the STAT3 binding and activation site, has defective implantation, similar to the LIF-deficient mice (19).	40435	40641
28368537	Pharmacological inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway has also supported the notion that STAT3 and JAK are required for implantation (21, 51).	40642	40781
28368537	Recently, the conditional deletion of either Stat3 or Gp130 in the uterus using the PgrCre/+ was reported (23, 52).	40782	40897
28368537	Loss of either factor resulted in female infertility and implantation failure confirming their requirement for implantation, although because Pgr is expressed in both the uterine epithelium and stroma, this makes it difficult to interpret which tissue is affected by loss of either factor.	40898	41187
28368537	Stimulation of the WT-LE with LIF resulted in efficient phosphorylation of STAT3 and nuclear translocation in the WT LE, but not in LE from the Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ mice, where pSTAT3 levels were reduced and did not show increased phosphorylation following LIF treatment.	41188	41457
28368537	The reduced levels of STAT3 and phosphorylation dynamics may have been partly due to a breakdown in the autoregulation of STAT3 levels due to a failure to increase expression of the negative regulator SOCS3 that inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation and that is transcriptionally induced by pSTAT3.	41458	41749
28368537	The failure to activate the JAK-STAT pathway in the LE probably was responsible for the persistent expression of the homeobox gene MSX1, in which LIF mediated suppression of MSX1 expression is required for the uterus to become receptive (42).	41750	41992
28368537	Together with previous reports, these findings demonstrate the centrality of the LIF-Lifr/gp130-JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in regulating uterine receptivity and implantation.	41993	42168
28368537	Based on our reporter analysis, the CB4 Ltf-Cre line was largely effective in expressing Cre recombinase in the LE and in deleting LifR function in this cellular compartment.	42169	42343
28368537	However, Ltf-Cre is strongly expressed in other tissues, especially the salivary gland and more weakly in the heart.	42344	42460
28368537	Ablation of the Lifr in these tissues would probably not affect reproductive functions in the uterus.	42461	42562
28368537	We also compared the effectiveness of the Wnt7a-Cre line at deleting the LifR in the uterus and we were only able to derive one female (out of 75 offspring tested) that was of the Lifrflx/Δ: Wnt7a Cre/+ genotype, whereas we derived 21 Lifrflx/Δ:LtfCre/+ females from 81 offspring.	42563	42843
28368537	This may have been due (based on our observation) to Wnt7a –Cre expression in the developing CNS, so ablating LifR that is essential to the developing CNS (data not shown).	42844	43016
28368537	Cell-specific ablation of any gene of interest in the uterus may therefore require the judicious choice of a specific line of Cre mice.	43017	43152
28368537	Although all these results have been obtained primarily in mice, they are relevant to human reproductive health.	43153	43265
28368537	In women with unexplained fertility defects, altered expression of soluble gp130 has been reported (20), and reduced fertility is associated with specific polymorphisms in the transcription factor p53 and its regulator Mdm2 affecting the levels of LIF expression in the uterus (23, 53).	43266	43552
28368537	In summary, our results show that defective loss and/or function of the LIFR in the LE adversely results in reduced numbers of implanting blastocysts.	43553	43703
28368537	The levels of LIFR expression and its functional activity in the LE change during the preimplantation phase and suggest that incorrect expression/function of the LIFR during reproductive cycles maybe an additional factor contributing to infertility in human reproduction.	43704	43975
28584052	Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification that is present on many nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins (1, 2).	0	160
28584052	O-GlcNAcylation involves cycling of a single N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) 5 moiety on serine and threonine residues of a spectrum of substrates, affecting their stability, activity, and subcellular localization (3, 4).	161	381
28584052	The transfer of O-GlcNAc is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (5, 6) and is modulated by the availability of the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc (7).	382	532
28584052	UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis is coupled to glucose, glutamine, and nucleotide metabolism.	533	617
28584052	Concomitantly, OGT exerts a nutrient-sensitive regulation over various cellular functions by acting on myriad targets (8).	618	740
28584052	OGT is highly conserved in metazoa and consists of multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) on the N terminus and a C-terminal glycosyltransferase domain (9, 10).	741	904
28584052	Although TPRs are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions, in the context of OGT they facilitate substrate recognition and specificity (11).	905	1058
28584052	In addition to its glycosyltransferase activity, OGT was recently shown to have a role in proteolytic processing of host cell factor 1 (HCF1) (12, 13), a transcriptional co-regulator of the cell cycle (14).	1059	1265
28584052	HCF1 is heavily O-GlcNAcylated (15), but a recent study revealed that O-GlcNAcylation and proteolytic cleavage of HCF1 by OGT are independent processes (16).	1266	1423
28584052	OGT activity is counteracted by O-GlcNAcase (OGA), a hexosaminidase that specifically removes O-GlcNAc modifications (17).	1424	1546
28584052	It has been shown that chemical inhibition of OGA in different human cell lines leads to a decreased expression of OGT and an increased expression of OGA (18), which indicates an as yet unidentified mechanism of regulation to maintain global O-GlcNAc homeostasis.	1547	1810
28584052	OGT has been linked to embryonic development in a number of animal models.	1811	1885
28584052	Caenorhabditis elegans with null mutations in ogt-1 are viable and fertile, but with metabolic defects (19).	1886	1994
28584052	In Drosophila, OGT is encoded by the super sex combs gene, which is essential for Drosophila viability and segmentation (20, 21).	1995	2124
28584052	Knockdown of OGT in zebrafish causes impaired embryonic growth with reduced brain size (22).	2125	2217
28584052	Although OGT is ubiquitously expressed, it is remarkably abundant in brain (9, 10).	2218	2301
28584052	Accordingly, O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to neuronal function and brain development in a number of cell and animal models (22, 23).	2302	2437
28584052	In addition, recent studies have shown that O-GlcNAc signaling can regulate axonal and dendritic growth (24, 25) and AMPA receptor trafficking (26, 27), possibly affecting learning and memory processes.	2438	2640
28584052	Also, alterations in protein O-GlcNAcylation have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases (28).Genetic OGT variants identified in patients with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) have previously been documented: first, in a clinical report, albeit accompanied by mutations in MED12 (a known XLID gene) (29), and second, in a large screen for novel XLID genes (30).	2641	3018
28584052	Here, we describe two patients with intellectual disability, bearing hemizygous mutations in OGT.	3019	3116
28584052	By combining characterization of the O-GlcNAcylation machinery in patient cells and characterization of the effects of OGT XLID mutations on OGT dual activity in vitro, we provide preliminary evidence suggesting that effects on the O-GlcNAc proteome and proteolytic processing of HCF1 may underpin the observed XLID phenotypes.Two male patients showed intellectual disability and a developmental delay with an unknown cause.	3117	3541
28584052	Cognitive testing in patient 1, at the age of 5 years old, showed reduced intelligence (WPPSI-III-NL, score 2;9) and delay in adaptive behavior (VABS, score 2;0).	3542	3704
28584052	Additional neurological symptoms were pyramidal syndrome, mild spastic diplegia, and psychomotor retardation with behavioral conduct disorder.	3705	3847
28584052	In addition, patient 1 had an inguinal hernia.	3848	3894
28584052	Dysmorphic features included hypertelorism, low-set ears, a broad nose, full lips, supernumerary nipple, hypoplastic toe, mild retrognathia, long and thin fingers, clinodactyly, and microcephaly (Fig.	3895	4095
28584052	1A).	4096	4100
28584052	Patient 1 showed involvement of the eyes including amblyopia and possible astigmatism.	4101	4187
28584052	He was born with a mild respiratory insufficiency based upon transient tachypnea of the neonate.	4188	4284
28584052	Cardiac screening revealed a bicuspid aortic valve.	4285	4336
28584052	An MRI at the age of 2 years old showed mild abnormalities pointing toward periventricular leukomalacia (Fig.	4337	4446
28584052	1C), but with a normal EEG.The global developmental level of patient 2, at the age of 5.5 years old, was estimated at 1.5 years.	4447	4575
28584052	He showed mouth hypotonia with drooling and involvement of the eyes including nystagmus, astigmatism, and high hypermetropia.	4576	4701
28584052	Genital abnormalities included a small phallus, and orchiopexy was performed at the age of 3 years.	4702	4801
28584052	His dysmorphic phenotype was less evident, with bitemporal narrowing and metopic ridge as main features (Fig.	4802	4911
28584052	1B).	4912	4916
28584052	Upon birth, a ventricular septal defect was detected, which closed spontaneously at a later age.	4917	5013
28584052	An MRI performed at the age of 3 years old showed no clear brain abnormalities (Fig.	5014	5098
28584052	1D).	5099	5103
28584052	The clinical features of the patients are summarized in Table 1.Whole exome sequencing was performed in the two male patients from unrelated families to uncover the cause of their intellectual disability.	5104	5308
28584052	Mutations in OGT were found in both patients.In patient 1, trio-sequencing and filtering for de novo variants revealed two potential candidate genes.	5309	5458
28584052	A heterozygous de novo mutation was found in bromodomain-containing protein 1 (BRD1): Chr22(GRCh38): g.49,823,630C>G; NM_001304808.1: c.688G>C (p.Val230Leu).	5459	5616
28584052	In addition, a hemizygous de novo missense variant in OGT was discovered: ChrX(GRCh38): g.71,555,312G>C; NM_181672.2: c.851G>C (p.Arg284Pro) (Fig.	5617	5763
28584052	2A).	5764	5768
28584052	Arg-284 is conserved among many vertebrates and some invertebrates such as Drosophila (supplemental Fig.	5769	5873
28584052	S1).	5874	5878
28584052	In silico analysis of p.Arg284Pro in OGT predicted pathogenicity of the mutation (Table 2).	5879	5970
28584052	The heterozygous nature of the mutation in BRD1, in addition to lower pathogenicity predictions for p.Val230Leu (Table 2), made this variant less likely to be pathogenic.For patient 2, a gene panel for known intellectual disability genes and de novo analysis did not reveal a potential causative mutation.	5971	6276
28584052	Further analysis of the exome data by filtering for variants following an autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance showed a hemizygous variant in OGT: ChrX(GRCh38): g.71,544,561T>G; NM_181672.2: c.463–6T>G.	6277	6486
28584052	Segregation analysis revealed that the mutation originates from a de novo mutation in the grandmother of the patient, passed on via the mother, who is the carrier (Fig.	6487	6655
28584052	2A).	5764	5768
28584052	The thymine at position c.463–6 is highly conserved (phyloP score of 6.93), and in silico splicing analysis of c.463–6T>G predicted an effect on the canonical splice site.	6661	6832
28584052	RT-PCR in patient fibroblasts showed an additional splice variant for OGT (Fig.	6833	6912
28584052	2B).	6913	6917
28584052	Sanger sequencing showed a deletion of 69 base pairs, corresponding to skipping of exon 4 caused by partial loss of the canonical splice site in patient 2 (Fig.	6918	7078
28584052	2B).	6913	6917
28584052	Skipping of exon 4 could result in a truncated protein with a loss of 23 amino acids (Δ155–177-OGT).Both mutations in OGT were absent in >60,000 controls (ExAC database) (31).	7084	7259
28584052	Thus, we have identified two XLID patients that possess two novel mutations in OGT.Given that OGT is a glycosyltransferase, we next investigated the effects of the XLID mutations on global O-GlcNAc levels in lysates from patient-derived fibroblasts by immunoblotting.	7260	7527
28584052	As controls, we used fibroblasts from an unrelated male neonate (control 1) and a female adult (control 2).	7528	7635
28584052	Using the RL2 anti-O-GlcNAc antibody, we observed no substantial difference in global O-GlcNAc levels between the controls and patients (Fig.	7636	7777
28584052	3, A and B).	7778	7790
28584052	To verify the specificity of this O-GlcNAc antibody, cell lysates were treated with a bacterial O-GlcNAcase from Clostridium perfringens (CpOGA), leading to a loss of O-GlcNAc signal compared with untreated lysates (Fig.	7791	8011
28584052	3A).	8012	8016
28584052	As an independent control experiment, we applied a recently developed method to detect O-GlcNAcylated proteins, which relies on detection using a tagged inactive bacterial O-GlcNAcase (D298N-CpOGA) (32).	8017	8220
28584052	In this experiment, no substantial differences were observed in global O-GlcNAc levels in fibroblasts derived from patients versus healthy controls (Fig.	8221	8374
28584052	3, C and D).We next investigated the effects of the OGT mutations on levels of OGT and OGA mRNA and protein.	8375	8483
28584052	Gene expression levels of OGT and OGA appeared to be unaffected in patient fibroblasts compared with those of the controls (Fig.	8484	8612
28584052	4A).	8613	8617
28584052	Although OGT protein levels appeared reduced in both patients compared with the healthy controls (Fig.	8618	8720
28584052	4, B and C), there was considerable variability in OGT protein levels of the healthy controls (Fig.	8721	8820
28584052	4, B and C).	8821	8833
28584052	At the mRNA level, two OGT variants (corresponding to WT and mis-spliced products) were present for patient 2 (Fig.	8834	8949
28584052	2B).	6913	6917
28584052	However, at the protein level, comparative analysis with recombinantly expressed Δ155–177-OGT (Fig.	8955	9054
28584052	4F) did not show evidence for presence of a truncated OGT protein, suggesting that Δ155–177-OGT may be unstable/degraded in the context of these patient fibroblasts.	9055	9220
28584052	There was a reduction in OGA protein levels, although again variability was observed in OGA protein levels of the healthy controls (Fig.	9221	9357
28584052	4, D and E).	9358	9370
28584052	Thus, OGT mutations may lead to reduced functional OGT protein levels in patient-derived fibroblasts, which may be compensated for with down-regulation of OGA protein levels, thereby maintaining global O-GlcNAc levels.The absence of the truncated OGT in patient 2 and potential reductions in OGT protein levels in patient-derived fibroblasts suggest that the mutations may compromise OGT stability.	9371	9769
28584052	To further investigate this, stability of recombinant wild-type/mutant OGT TPR domain was analyzed by thermal denaturation experiments.	9770	9905
28584052	We observed reduced stability for Δ155–177-OGT (Tm = 51 ± 1 °C) and R284P-OGT (Tm = 52 ± 1 °C) compared with wild-type OGT TPR domain (Tm = 59 ± 1 °C) (Fig.	9906	10062
28584052	5A).	10063	10067
28584052	Given that Δ155–177-OGT was not detected in patient-derived fibroblasts, further biochemical characterization of this mutant was omitted.	10068	10205
28584052	OGT has over 1000 O-GlcNAcylation substrates; therefore, to explore the effects of the p.Arg284Pro mutation in an environment similar to that of cell physiology, de-O-GlcNAcylated HEK-293 cell lysate was employed as a complex array of substrates.	10206	10452
28584052	R284P-OGT was not able to restore protein O-GlcNAcylation, to the extent achieved by wild-type OGT (Fig.	10453	10557
28584052	5B).OGT is known to possess a second catalytic activity, promoting autocatalytic cleavage and activation of the transcriptional co-regulator HCF1, itself an XLID gene (33, 34), via an intermediate glycosylation step (13, 35).	10558	10783
28584052	Thus, we decided to investigate the effects of the p.Arg284Pro substitution on OGT-mediated HCF1 processing.	10784	10892
28584052	To measure proteolytic activity, we used a GST fusion of a minimal HCF1 fragment (HCF1-rep1) possessing the first of the PRO repeats (which are the target sites of proteolysis; Fig.	10893	11074
28584052	5C).	11075	11079
28584052	Wild-type OGT was able to hyperglycosylate HCF1-rep1, as evidenced by a band shift that was reversible by incubation with CpOGA (Fig.	11080	11213
28584052	5D).	11214	11218
28584052	The HCF1-rep1 band shift observed in the R284P-OGT-catalyzed reaction was smaller, suggesting that the mutant OGT was less effective than the wild type in glycosylating HCF1-rep1 (Fig.	11219	11403
28584052	5D).	11214	11218
28584052	Furthermore, wild-type OGT was able to induce autoproteolysis, whereas the proteolytic activity of R284P-OGT was reduced (Fig.	11409	11535
28584052	5D).	11214	11218
28584052	When the enzyme concentration was reduced relative to substrate levels, proteolytic activity of R284P-OGT was abrogated, whereas wild-type enzyme still displayed detectable activity (Fig.	11541	11728
28584052	5E).	11729	11733
28584052	Thus, recombinant R284P-OGT is defective in HCF1 glycosylation and proteolytic processing.Here, we report two patients with XLID attributable to hemizygous mutations in OGT: one missense mutation (p.Arg284Pro) and one splice-site mutation (c.463–6T>G).	11734	11986
28584052	We identified potential perturbations in protein O-GlcNAc homeostasis in both patients and altered HCF1 maturation in patient 1.XLID is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of disorders, estimated to account for ∼10% of all intellectual disability phenotypes in males (36).	11987	12276
28584052	Mutations causing XLID have been reported in over 100 genes, and new XLID genes are still being identified (37).	12277	12389
28584052	In 2015, Niranjan et al. (30) published a series of 65 potential XLID genes, by sequencing the X-exome of 56 XLID families.	12390	12513
28584052	This was the first publication in which a genetic variant in OGT (p.Leu254Phe) was found associated with XLID.	12514	12624
28584052	During the course of our work, Vaidyanathan et al. (38) reported a study on the functional characterization of this previously published p.Leu254Phe variant of OGT (30).	12625	12794
28584052	In patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells, decreased OGT levels were accompanied by decreased OGA levels, resulting in unaltered O-GlcNAc levels.	12795	12938
28584052	This is in agreement with our findings in both patient-derived fibroblast cell lines, indicating that homeostasis of O-GlcNAc levels through decreasing OGA could be a general principle in cases of OGT deficiency.	12939	13151
28584052	However, in contrast to our results, recombinantly expressed p.Leu254Phe OGT and wild-type OGT showed equal activity toward O-GlcNAc substrate CK2α and HCF-1 (38).	13152	13315
28584052	Another study described a missense mutation in OGT (p.Ala319Thr) in an XLID family, although this mutant also segregated with a previously uncharacterized variant of MED12, another gene that is associated with XLID.	13316	13531
28584052	Evidence for functional loss of OGT for this mutation was not provided (29).To date, including our findings, four hemizygous mutations in OGT have been identified in patients with XLID (Table 1).	13532	13727
28584052	The three missense mutations (p.Arg284Pro, p.Leu254Phe, and p.Ala319Thr) and one splice-site mutation (c.463–6T>G) all affect the N-terminal TPR domain (Fig.	13728	13885
28584052	2C and supplemental Fig.	13886	13910
28584052	S1).	5874	5878
28584052	The TPR motif is characterized by a repeat of 34 amino acids that fold into two antiparallel helices.	13916	14017
28584052	The TPR domain consists of 13.5 repeats, and the antiparallel helices align to form an elongated superhelix, where the first helix of each TPR repeat (helix A) faces toward the inner surface of the elongated superhelix and their antiparallel pairs (helix B) form the outer surface (11).	14018	14304
28584052	The missense mutations p.Arg284Pro, p.Leu254Phe, and p.Ala319Thr are located in helix B of the OGT TPR7, TPR8, and TPR9, respectively (Fig.	14305	14444
28584052	2D and supplemental Fig.	14445	14469
28584052	S1).	5874	5878
28584052	In addition, Ala-319 is one of the conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues of the canonical TPR repeat (39) (supplemental Fig.	14475	14603
28584052	S1).	5874	5878
28584052	Each of these missense mutations could disrupt the α-helical secondary structure of the TPR domain, thereby affecting the overall stability of the elongated superhelix (Fig.	14609	14782
28584052	2D).	14783	14787
28584052	Arg-284 is located in the middle of TPR helix 7B, and mutation of this residue to a Pro likely disrupts this secondary structure element, destabilizing this region.The splice-site mutation c.463–6T>G is predicted to result in an OGT protein missing 23 amino acids (p.Δ155–177) (Fig.	14788	15070
28584052	2B), although we could not confirm the presence of a truncated OGT in patient fibroblasts (Fig.	15071	15166
28584052	4F).	15167	15171
28584052	We propose that this mutation might exert its effect by producing an unstable splice variant and reducing the amount of functional OGT within the cell (Figs.	15172	15329
28584052	4B and 5A).	15330	15341
28584052	Global O-GlcNAc levels in patient-derived fibroblasts were not substantially reduced compared with healthy controls (Fig.	15342	15463
28584052	3).	2434	2437
28584052	Protein levels of OGT and OGA appeared to be reduced in both patients; however, both healthy controls displayed variation in their OGT and OGA levels, complicating the interpretation of these findings.	15468	15669
28584052	We hypothesize that the decrease in OGT protein levels in these cells might be counteracted by the concomitant reduction of OGA protein levels (Fig.	15670	15818
28584052	4, D and E), thereby sustaining basal O-GlcNAc homeostasis.	15819	15878
28584052	This hypothesis is supported by the finding that chemical inhibition of OGA in different human cell lines leads to a decreased expression of OGT and an increased expression of OGA (18), which indicates an as-yet-unidentified mechanism of regulation to maintain global O-GlcNAc homeostasis.	15879	16168
28584052	We propose a similar mechanism in our patient-derived fibroblasts.It is as yet not fully understood how OGT recognizes serines/threonines on specific proteins for O-GlcNAcylation, although there is evidence to suggest that the TPRs play a key role for at least a subset of substrates (40).	16169	16458
28584052	To assess the in vitro activity of OGT with mutations affecting the TPR domain and the impact on substrate O-GlcNAcylation, we produced recombinant R284P-OGT.	16459	16617
28584052	Given that Δ155–177-OGT was not detected in patient-derived fibroblasts, further biochemical characterization of this mutant was not undertaken.	16618	16762
28584052	Activity assays against de-O-GlcNAcylated HEK-293 lysate demonstrated that the p.Arg284Pro mutation led to a global reduction in protein O-GlcNAcylation, as opposed to reducing recognition and O-GlcNAcylation of specific substrates.	16763	16995
28584052	In a physiological context, this nonspecific reduction in OGT activity may be rescued by down-regulation of OGA levels, which was observed to some extent in the fibroblasts from both patients.	16996	17188
28584052	However, the p.Arg284Pro mutation is located on the surface of the TPRs (11), a region that has been shown to play a role in the recognition of specific substrates (40).	17189	17358
28584052	It is therefore possible that this mutation could affect modification of specific substrates, in addition to causing the observed global reduction in substrate O-GlcNAcylation, and this possibility is neither excluded nor confirmed by our current data.	17359	17611
28584052	O-GlcNAcylation activity of R284P-OGT against HCF1-rep1 was reduced, as judged by the poly-O-GlcNAcylation-induced shift in HCF1-rep1 molecular weight versus wild-type OGT (Fig.	17612	17789
28584052	5D).In addition to being abundantly O-GlcNAcylated (15), HCF1 is also proteolytically processed by OGT (12, 35).	17790	17902
28584052	The p.Arg284Pro mutation appears to alter HCF1-rep1 proteolysis in vitro (Fig.	17903	17981
28584052	5, D and E).	17982	17994
28584052	The TPR domain is critical for proteolytic maturation of HCF1 (13), and this could explain why R284P-OGT shows decreased proteolytic activity toward HCF1 in vitro.	17995	18158
28584052	Interestingly, HCFC1, the gene that codes for HCF1, is located on the X-chromosome, and it is reported as an XLID gene (41).	18159	18283
28584052	This hints at possible overlap in downstream disease mechanisms causing intellectual disability in patients bearing OGT or HCFC1 mutations.Precisely how alterations in protein O-GlcNAcylation and HCF1 cleavage lead to intellectual disability is not yet clear.	18284	18543
28584052	OGT is expressed in a broad range of tissues, with a remarkably high expression in brain (9, 10).	18544	18641
28584052	O-GlcNAc-modified proteins were detected in nerve terminals, and abundant OGT activity was detected in nerve synaptosomes (42), indicating that O-GlcNAc could play a role in neuronal function and neurodegenerative disease.	18642	18864
28584052	It has been suggested that regulation of the proteasome complex by O-GlcNAcylation in the brain could contribute to apoptosis of hippocampal cells and thus neurodegeneration (43).	18865	19044
28584052	In addition, aberrant O-GlcNAcylation levels have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (28).	19045	19167
28584052	Future work analyzing the effect of XLID mutations on OGT function in a more phenotype-relevant model, such as a neuronal cell line or an animal model where the effect of the mutations on different tissues, including the brain, can be investigated, would be important.	19168	19436
28584052	The present study utilized fibroblasts from two unrelated individuals as controls, and we noted substantial variability in OGA and OGT protein levels in these cells, complicating the interpretation of our data.	19437	19647
28584052	To minimize the effect of variability introduced by the differing genetic background between individual patients and controls, it would be of use to introduce these mutations into cell lines with an identical genetic background.	19648	19876
28584052	Our study provides the first detailed clinical characterization of patients with XLID attributable to mutations in OGT and furthermore proposes a potential molecular explanation for how these mutations may impact on OGT dual function of O-GlcNAcylation and HCF1 proteolysis.The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Radboud University Medical Centre and Utrecht University Medical Centre.	19877	20283

20105310	Classification of obese populations based on their level of insulin sensitivity identifies distinct subsets variously referred to as insulin-sensitive obese, metabolically-healthy but obese, and metabolically-normal obese.	656	878
20105310	In each of these cases, specific parameters, such as glucose or insulin, are within the normal healthy range found in non-obese subjects.	879	1016
20105310	Most studies classify "healthier obese subjects" according to insulin sensitivity, but also according to other parameters such as HDL cholesterol, plasma triglycerides, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, LDL cholesterol, and visceral fat.	1017	1255
20105310	We have recently shown that intracellular insulin signalling pathways in adipose tissue are different between insulin sensitive versus insulin resistant obese subjects.	1256	1424
20105310	However, in addition to altered glucose metabolism, dyslipidemias, such as elevated plasma triglyceride (TG), are common in obesity and are an independent risk factor for many diseases including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.	1425	1677
20105310	When coupled with other risk factors such as high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or insulin resistance, the risk for these diseases increases.	1678	1827
20105310	Accordingly, in the present study, obese subjects were evaluated based on characterization according to fasting triglyceridemia and acylation stimulating protein (ASP) to examine potential differences in adipose tissue gene expression.	1828	2063
20105310	Cellular studies have demonstrated that acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is a main anabolic stimulator of TG storage in adipose tissue and is produced by adipocytes.	2064	2232
20105310	ASP stimulates TG synthesis via the ASP receptor, C5L2, a seven transmembrane G protein coupled receptor.	2233	2338
20105310	Downstream several key signalling proteins have been identified, including phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Akt and protein kinase C culminating in increased glucose transport and diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity.	2339	2574
20105310	ASP is identical to C3adesArg and is produced through the interaction of the precursor protein C3, Factor B, and adipsin (a.k.a.	2575	2703
20105310	Factor D), components of the alternative complement immune pathway which are secreted by adipose tissue.	2704	2808
20105310	In the adipose tissue milieu ASP levels increase postprandially, although general circulating levels change little.	2809	2924
20105310	Overall, fasting ASP is strongly predictive of postprandial TG (evaluated as area-under-the-curve: AUC) in both men and women.	2925	3051
20105310	ASP is increased in obesity, as well as insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome, all disorders associated with obesity.	3052	3231
20105310	However obesity is not an essential feature of elevated ASP levels, as ASP is increased in subjects with diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome, even in the absence of obesity.	3232	3407
20105310	A direct association between plasma ASP on one hand and the metabolic function of the subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue on the other hand are unknown, and this is the first study to examine this.	3408	3609
20105310	Further there are no studies on C5L2 adipose expression in humans.	3610	3676
20105310	Our hypothesis was that morbidly obese subjects separated based on the fasting plasma levels of ASP and TG into HAT (High ASP and Triglyceride) and LAT (Low ASP and Triglyceride) groups would demonstrate differential expression of genes in lipid metabolic and inflammatory biologic pathways.	3677	3968
20105310	Characterization of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue using a microarray approach was used.	3969	4066
20105310	To target lipid metabolic and inflammatory biologic pathways, all known genes in these pathways were identified and all those available in the microarray were pooled a priori, and then expression in LAT vs HAT for both subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue was evaluated.	4067	4340
20105310	A total of 11 subjects participated in the microarray study.	4341	4401
20105310	A fasting blood sample and subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue samples were taken from each subject.	4402	4506
20105310	Of the 21 adipose samples, 20 were paired omental (OM) and subcutaneous (SC) samples from 10 subjects, and the remaining SC sample was unpaired.	4507	4651
20105310	As shown in Table 1, the subjects were divided into 2 groups based on an ASP-TG lipemic index (as described in methods).	4652	4772
20105310	Using this functional ASP calculation two groups were defined, one with low ASP, low TG, and thus a lower lipemic index which we have termed the Low ASP and TG group (LAT, n = 4) and a second group with high ASP (60.5 ± 11.7 vs. 36.1 ± 7.4 nmol/L), TG (2.01 ± 0.2 vs. 1.3 ± 0.1 mmol/L), and lipemic index (119.5 ± 22.2 vs. 44.8 ± 5.7, p < 0.05), which we have termed the High ASP and TG group (HAT, n = 7).	4773	5179
20105310	Both groups were morbidly obese based on body mass index (BMI) where a BMI > 30 kg/m2 is considered obese and BMI > 40.0 kg/m2 is morbidly obese.	5180	5325
20105310	The two groups did not differ significantly in average BMI (52.0 ± 5.8 vs. 56.4 ± 4.7, p=ns), nor in average age.	5326	5439
20105310	Average insulin and glucose values were the same between the two groups (Table 1, p ns for all).	5440	5536
20105310	While none of the patients had been previously diagnosed as diabetic, at the time of pre-operative sampling one subject in the LAT group and two subjects in the HAT group had glucose values > 7.0.	5537	5733
20105310	For all tables and figures, the data are presented as averages ± SEM for the groups as indicated.	5734	5831
20105310	In order to avoid sample bias, no samples were pooled prior to microarray analysis, and all 21 tissue samples were analysed individually.	5832	5969
20105310	Two different analysis paradigms were used for the evaluation of the microarray results: (i) overall evaluation using SAM analysis and (ii) evaluation targeting the specific biological pathways of interest, lipid metabolism and inflammation.	5970	6211
20105310	As the primary hypothesis was to evaluate LAT (Low ASP-TG index) vs HAT (High ASP-TG index) we first compared these two groups using overall analysis.	6212	6362
20105310	The cDNA microarrays contained a total of ~20,000 probes (~10,000 human genes, plus ESTs, housekeeping genes, and positive and negative controls) which were analysed for all 21 samples.	6363	6548
20105310	Information on Codelink Uniset 20K I Gene List #30019 can be obtained directly from http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/microarrays/codelink_genelists.html.	6549	6702
20105310	The complete data set is reported in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ as Accession # GSE 15524.	6703	6842
20105310	SAM (Significant Analysis of Microarrays) analysis was performed on SC and OM samples separately, but using the same analysis parameters.	6843	6980
20105310	The SAM procedure using version 3.09 is available at http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM using suggested guidelines.	6981	7100
20105310	This program is a validated statistical technique for identifying differentially expressed genes across high density microarrays.	7101	7230
20105310	With an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of 2.0%, and a minimum of a 2-fold change considered significant, 464 genes were identified as significantly different between HAT and LAT in SC tissue (which represents 2.3% of all genes on the microarray).	7231	7483
20105310	Using the same analysis parameters, no genes were identified as significantly different between HAT and LAT in OM tissue.	7484	7605
20105310	Using less stringent criteria (FDR = 5% and minimum 2-fold change), 1236 genes were identified in SC, but again, none in OM tissue.	7606	7737
20105310	Even when criteria were relaxed to an FDR of 15%, only 6 genes were identified in OM.	7738	7823
20105310	Thus, the major changes between HAT and LAT were restricted to SC adipose tissue.	7824	7905
20105310	When gene expression in OM tissue was compared to SC tissue using paired analysis and stringent parameters (FDR = 2.0% and minimum 2 fold difference), only 108 genes were identified.	7906	8088
20105310	Using less stringent criteria (FDR = 5%, minimum 2 fold change), only 178 significant genes were identified.	8089	8197
20105310	By far, the major differences in gene expression in relation to the classification of subjects as HAT or LAT using the lipemic index (plasma ASP and TG) in this sample set are in SC adipose tissue.	8198	8395
20105310	Therefore further analysis was focused on SC tissue, although supplementary information is provided for omental tissue as well.	8396	8523
20105310	The genes identified in SC adipose tissue were further examined.	8524	8588
20105310	Of those genes identified as different using FDR = 2.0% and a minimum twofold change, 453 were up-regulated (positive genes) and 11 were down-regulated (negative genes) in HAT subjects as compared to LAT with q values for the genes identified ranging from 0.00000 to 0.02103.	8589	8864
20105310	Gene description and access to Codelink Uniset 20K I Gene List #30019 http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/microarrays/codelink_genelists.html were used to assign the genes manually into functional categories.	8865	9070
20105310	Many of the genes identified (~50%) were tagged as EST, "hypothetical proteins" or clones labelled based on putative protein sequence as "similar to" or "hypothetical" with no known function.	9071	9262
20105310	Of the genes with assigned function, the positively regulated genes coded for proteins involved in extracellular signalling (including cell-cell signalling and endocrine functions), intracellular signalling, intermediary metabolism and energy metabolism, structural proteins, transcription and translation (including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and proteolysis) based on manual group assignment.	9263	9670
20105310	A supplementary table listing the positive and negative genes is available upon request.	9671	9759
20105310	As the specific aim of the study was to evaluate the biological pathways of storage lipid metabolism and inflammation, areas of current interest in adipose tissue biology, a specific analysis was then undertaken of pathways of interest in SC adipose tissue.	9760	10017
20105310	First, housekeeping genes (as controls) were identified, then genes potentially involved in ASP and C5L2 function were identified.	10018	10148
20105310	As ASP represents a crossroad of immune and lipid metabolism, targeted pathways included all genes for proteins that could be identified in ASP generation, complement related factors, storage lipid metabolism including TG synthesis, lipolysis and oxidation, adipocyte differentiation, and inflammatory genes.	10149	10457
20105310	The method of analysis was the following: (i) all functional genes within the identified biologic pathways were listed; (ii) accession numbers were identified using Entrez Gene http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; (iii) the Codelink gene list was screened to tag all of the accession numbers present in the array; (iv) all genes identified, and the associated SC and OM datasets were then pooled before initiating statistical analysis and (v) the data was then analyzed for HAT vs LAT.	10458	10936
20105310	Using this approach where biologic pathways were identified a priori followed by subsequent statistical analysis, of the 88 functional genes identified (excluding housekeeping genes), 51 were differentially expressed in relation to HAT vs LAT (Additional File 1, Table S1), either increased or decreased, which represents 58%.	10937	11263
20105310	A number of these genes had also been identified using the SAM analysis (such as genes involved in lipid synthesis); this is a substantial pathway enrichment.	11264	11422
20105310	The expression of 4 housekeeping genes suggested for studies in adipose was evaluated across all 11 SC samples was evaluated (Additional File 2, Table S2).	11423	11578
20105310	The expression of B2M, GUSB, PPIA, and TFRC were constant across all 11 samples with no significant differences when LAT and HAT were compared.	11579	11722
20105310	There were no significant correlations between any of the housekeeping genes and age, BMI, or fasting plasma levels of ASP, TG, insulin, or glucose.	11723	11871
20105310	The expression of insulin receptor (InsR), insulin receptor substrates 1 and 4 (IRS1 and IRS4), insulin like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF1 and IGF2) were also evaluated (Additional File 2, Table).	11872	12067
20105310	The expression of these genes was also constant across all 11 samples and not significantly different between the two groups, which is consistent with the plasma data for insulin and glucose.	12068	12259
20105310	There were no significant correlations between these genes and age or BMI.	12260	12334
20105310	As the two groups have similar insulin related gene profiles, differences between the 2 groups are not likely explained by differences in insulin signalling or sensitivity.	12335	12507
20105310	We next looked at genes related to plasma ASP generation by adipose tissue.	12508	12583
20105310	As previously published, the key genes in the conversion of complement C3 to its ASP form (aka C3adesArg) are all produced by adipocytes: C3, factor B (FB), adipsin (or factor D), and carboxypeptidase N (CPN1).	12584	12794
20105310	Additionally, factors that enhance or inhibit the process are also produced by adipocytes: factors H, I, and properdin.	12795	12914
20105310	As shown in Figure 1A, C3, factor B and factor H are all moderately increased in HAT vs LAT (where LAT is set as 100%).	12915	13034
20105310	We also analyzed the expression pattern of CR1, aka CD35, an inhibitor to both the classical and alternative complement pathways.	13035	13164
20105310	CR1 inhibits both C3 and C5 convertases, thus decreasing production of C5a, C3a and desArg forms including ASP, and has a high affinity for C3b.	13165	13309
20105310	As CR1 was decreased in HAT SC tissue (Figure 1A) this reduction may be permissive for increased ASP production via C3 convertase.	13310	13440
20105310	Properdin, which stabilizes C3 convertase, also tended to be increased (Additional File 1, Table S1).	13441	13542
20105310	Additionally, C3, adipsin and factor B were all closely correlated to one another in SC tissue (Figure 1B to 1D).	13543	13656
20105310	These 3 genes also correlated closely with other genes and have been termed the "ASP triad" in the present study.	13657	13770
20105310	In omental (OM) tissue, although expression of C3 and factor B were higher than in SC, overall there was no difference between LAT and HAT for any of the factors other than a decrease in factor B in HAT subjects (Additional File 1, Table S1).	13771	14013
20105310	As C5L2, a newly identified receptor, was not present on the microarray used for analysis, quantitative expression of C5L2 in the LAT and HAT groups was measured using TAQMAN real time RT-PCR via the delta-delta Ct method relative to expression of B2M, a housekeeping gene.	14014	14287
20105310	For the real time RT-PCR, a non-obese control group was added and results are provided for both SC and OM tissue, as this is the first quantitative measurement of C5L2 in human adipose tissue.	14288	14480
20105310	This additional non-obese group had the following characteristics: BMI 25.1 ± 1.4 kg/m2, age 54.8 ± 7.6 years, plasma ASP 30.4 ± 1.5 nmol/L, plasma TG 1.12 ± 0.18 mmol/L, glucose 3.75 ± 0.21 mmol/L, insulin 137.2 ± 16.1 pmol/L and lipemic index 34.8 ± 6.7.	14481	14737
20105310	As shown in Figure 2A, using 2-way ANOVA, there is a significant difference in groups (p < 0.0001), but no significant difference between tissues (SC vs OM).	14738	14895
20105310	With post-hoc analysis, HAT is significantly increased vs LAT in SC and OM (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively), and HAT is also significantly different from NO in SC and OM (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), while there was no significant difference between LAT and NO.	14896	15173
20105310	There was also a positive correlation between expression in SC adipose tissue and OM adipose tissue, such that subjects with high expression in SC tissue also had high expression in OM (R = 0.676, p = 0.023).	15174	15382
20105310	The majority of the genes involved in ASP production were initially identified as being alternative complement factors and thus part of the immune system.	15383	15537
20105310	Therefore we looked at the regulation of other complement factors, including C5 and two receptors of complement activation, C3aR and C5aR.	15538	15676
20105310	The sequence of C5L2 closely resembles these two receptors.	15677	15736
20105310	It has been demonstrated that C3a, C5a, and ASP all bind to C5L2, only C3a binds to C3aR, and only C5a binds to C5aR.	15737	15854
20105310	Both C3aR and C5aR are expressed at similar levels in the LAT and HAT groups for both SC and OM tissues (Figure 2B and Additional File 1, Table S1) and there is no significant correlation with C3, factor B or adipsin, although C5 had a negative correlation.	15855	16112
20105310	A wide variety of genes are involved in dietary lipid storage and de novo lipid synthesis.	16113	16203
20105310	We have focused here on all of the key genes that could be identified from each pathway including fatty acid and glucose transporters (CD36, GLUT4), and TG synthesis enzymes such as diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 and DGAT2), and fatty acid elongating enzymes (ELOV) potentially related to ASP function.	16204	16514
20105310	Microarray analysis revealed increased expression of fatty acid transporter (CD36) but decreased glucose transporter (GLUT4, Figure 3).	16515	16650
20105310	Genes involved in TG synthesis were up-regulated in the HAT group, including stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD1), DGAT1 and DGAT 2, fatty acid synthase (FASN), phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP2A2) and malic enzyme (ME1) (Figure 3, Additional File 1, Table S1).	16651	16908
20105310	On the other hand, other genes related to de novo fatty acid synthesis were down-regulated (Figure 3B).	16909	17012
20105310	The fatty acid elongation enzyme genes (ELOVL2 and ELOVL4) were both down-regulated (Figure 3B).	17013	17109
20105310	By contrast there were no significant differences in OM tissue, other than an increase in ME1 in HAT subjects (Additional File 1, Table S1).	17110	17250
20105310	It is interesting to note that there is a significant correlation with the ASP triad (C3/B/adipsin) and specific lipid metabolic genes, where DB1, DGAT1, ME1 and Glut4 are examples (Figure 3 and Additional File 1, Table S1) Several other genes correlated well within the group of metabolic genes such as DGAT1, DGAT2, SCD1, FASN, GLUT4 and ELOV2 (Figure 3 and Additional File 1, Table S1).	17251	17640
20105310	A number of intracellular and extracellular adipocyte lipases hydrolyze TG.	17641	17716
20105310	The main extracellular lipase, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hydrolyzes dietary fats, releasing fatty acids for cellular transport and intracellular esterification to TG.	17717	17883
20105310	LPL and hepatic lipase (LIPC), both of which localize to the cell surface membrane, tended to be up-regulated in the HAT group vs LAT and correlated significantly with the ASP triad in SC tissue (Figure 4A, 4C, 4D).	17884	18099
20105310	On the other hand, two additional extracellular lipases, pancreatic lipase (PNLIP) and endothelial lipase (EL), were down-regulated (Figure 4B and Additional File 1, Table S1).	18100	18276
20105310	Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) was considered the primary intracellular adipocyte lipase responsible for releasing fatty acids from the cell; however, additional lipases have subsequently been identified.	18277	18481
20105310	Both HSL, and perilipin, which interacts directly with HSL to regulate lipolysis, were up-regulated in the HAT group (Figure 4E) as were carboxylesterase 1 (CES1, aka triacylglycerol lipase) and monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) (Figure 4E).	18482	18717
20105310	These lipases correlated closely with the metabolic genes GLUT4, DGAT2 and HSL (Figure 4G, 4H, Additional File 1, Table S1).	18718	18842
20105310	Adiponutrin, on the other hand, was down-regulated in the HAT group (Figure 4F).	18843	18923
20105310	Again, there were no differences for any of the genes in OM tissue, other than a decrease in LIPC in HAT subjects (Additional File 1, Table S1).	18924	19068
20105310	A number of genes related to oxidation in adipose tissue were down-regulated in HAT vs LAT (Additional File 1, Table S1), including carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-1C), carnitine acetyltransferase (CRAT), uncoupling protein (UCP1), AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) as well as some AMPK regulatory genes (PRKAB2, PRKAG3, Additional File 1, Table S1).	19069	19417
20105310	Other AMPK regulatory genes (PRKAA1, PRKAG1, and PRKAG2) were up-regulated in the HAT group (Additional File 1, Table S1).	19418	19540
20105310	Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) was increased in SC HAT tissue, and had some weak correlations with the ASP triad (Additional File 1, Table S1).	19541	19682
20105310	The contrasting regulation of ACC and AMPK is reflected in their opposing physiological roles: ACC catalyzes the rate limiting step in fatty acid synthesis and AMPK senses energy availability and inactivates ACC.	19683	19895
20105310	CPT-1C and UCP1 (Additional File 3, Figure S1) were both correlated with GLUT4 and DGAT2 but, consistent with the trends described above, only partially with any of the genes from the ASP triad (Additional File 1, Table S1).	19896	20120
20105310	There were no differences in OM tissue between LAT and HAT for any genes except for PRKAG1 which increased in HAT subjects (Additional File 1, Table S1).	20121	20274
20105310	As shown in Additional File 4, Figure S2, some of the FABP group of genes were up-regulated in the HAT SC tissue, but not all (Additional File 4, Figure S2).	20275	20432
20105310	Several correlated strongly with the ASP triad (Additional File 4, Figures S2C to S2E).	20433	20520
20105310	Although FABP4 was first identified in adipose tissue, all of these binding proteins are ubiquitously expressed.	20521	20633
20105310	Further, FABP2 and FABP7 are decreased (Additional File 4, Figure S2B).	20634	20705
20105310	The roles of FABP are varied, including differential binding of various fatty acids, with functional links that include signalling and association with transcription factors, channelling to lipid synthesis vs oxidation, cell growth, proliferation and differentiation.	20706	20973
20105310	These differential roles of FABP may explain the opposite changes.	20974	21040
20105310	However no differences were detected in OM tissue (Additional File 1, Table S1).	21041	21121
20105310	Both the C/EBP and the PPAR nuclear receptor families are important factors in adipocyte differentiation.	21122	21227
20105310	The C/EBP genes α and β were increased (Figure 5), while C/EBPε was decreased (Figure 5B).	21228	21318
20105310	C/EBPβ is a checkpoint for differentiation and is induced by C/EBPα, which is increased early in the differentiation process.	21319	21444
20105310	Interestingly, C/EBPγ correlates with the ASP triad (Figure 5C).	21445	21509
20105310	PPARγ is best recognized as a late marker of differentiation.	21510	21571
20105310	PPARγ was increased in the HAT group, along with many of the other differentiation genes (Figure 5A).	21572	21673
20105310	However, PPARδ was an exception, being significantly down-regulated (Figure 5B).	21674	21754
20105310	While the role of PPARδ is not fully understood, it is believed that activation of PPARδ leads to increased fatty acid metabolism.	21755	21885
20105310	In accordance with decreased expression of genes in fatty acid oxidation, and increased expression of fatty acid storage genes, the decrease in PPARδ is consistent with that interpretation.	21886	22075
20105310	The majority of differentiation genes correlate with the metabolic genes (Figure 5).	22076	22160
20105310	There was no change in OM tissue for any of the genes examined (Additional File 1, Table S1).	22161	22254
20105310	Recently, there has been intense interest in the potential interactions between adipocytes and macrophages within the adipose tissue milieu.	22255	22395
20105310	The potential role of ASP in both the immune system and storage lipid metabolism makes it all the more pertinent to examine pro-and anti-inflammatory genes in association with ASP and the lipemic index.	22396	22598
20105310	The anti-inflammatory genes transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP1, 3 and 4) were increased in the HAT group (Additional File 5, Figure S3A), with decreases in some interleukin genes such as IL4.	22599	22846
20105310	Of the pro-inflammatory interleukin and receptor genes, there was little difference between the LAT and HAT groups other than for PIG7 (Additional File 5, Figure S3B) with no difference in OM tissue (Additional File 1, Table S1).	22847	23076
20105310	Hand in hand with inflammation of adipose tissue, is remodelling of adipose tissue.	23077	23160
20105310	Key genes in this process are macrophage recruitment genes and matrix metalloproteinases.	23161	23250
20105310	A number of genes for macrophage recruitment tended to be increased in the HAT group in subcutaneous tissue, especially macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) genes which were also closely correlated with the ASP triad of genes (Additional File 6, Figures S4A-S4C).	23251	23566
20105310	Of the matrix metalloproteinases, MMP20 and MMP10 were significantly down-regulated in the HAT group (Additional File 6, Figures S4D) while MMP 2 was increased.	23567	23727
20105310	OM tissue had no significant changes between HAT and LAT (Additional File 1, Table S1).	23728	23815
20105310	Confirmatory analysis by real time PCR using the delta-delta Ct method relative to expression of B2M, a housekeeping gene, was also conducted for 7 additional genes.	23816	23981
20105310	The genes chosen included two genes with markedly increased expression in HAT vs LAT (CD36 and DGAT2), two genes with moderately increased expression in HAT vs LAT (C3 and CEBPγ) and two genes with little change in expression in HAT vs LAT (C5aR and FABP4).	23982	24239
20105310	In addition, results for insulin receptor (INSR) were also presented.	24240	24309
20105310	Further, all genes were analyzed in both SC and OM tissue, for all samples available, in duplicate or triplicate.	24310	24423
20105310	As can be seen in Table 2, overall results from the real-time PCR correlated well with the results from the microarray analysis in both SC and OM tissues from LAT and HAT subjects.	24424	24604
20105310	Adipose tissue has been well documented as an endocrine organ in the last two decades.	24605	24691
20105310	The recognition that ASP (aka C3adesArg) is produced by adipose tissue, and that the three precursor proteins C3, factor B and adipsin, all increase with differentiation of adipocytes was one of the first demonstrations that hormones with both paracrine and endocrine functions were produced within the adipose milieu.	24692	25010
20105310	The primary function of ASP in adipocytes appears to be promotion of lipid storage, and this is achieved through increases in fatty acid esterification and glucose uptake.	25011	25182
20105310	A number of human studies have demonstrated positive associations between ASP and various metabolic disturbances (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, nephrotic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome) with or without the presence of obesity.	25183	25438
20105310	Previous studies have demonstrated that circulating plasma ASP is associated with TG and fatty acid levels, with a strong correlation between fasting ASP and postprandial TG clearance even in non-obese individuals.	25439	25653
20105310	The demonstration of direct adipose tissue production of ASP postprandially in human studies, coupled to evidence that dietary TG in the form of chylomicrons directly stimulate C3 and ASP production in cultured human adipocytes provides a strong link between plasma ASP and TG.	25654	25931
20105310	Consequently, the aim of the present study was to evaluate microarray expression in subcutaneous vs. omental adipose tissue in relation to plasma ASP and TG (lipemic index), and genes directly related to ASP production, storage lipid metabolism and inflammation.	25932	26194
20105310	However, there are several limitations to this study.	26195	26248
20105310	The samples were derived from morbidly obese subjects, limiting interpretations to that population.	26249	26348
20105310	Further, although there were often large relative differences between the two groups (LAT vs HAT), the limited number of samples restricted the statistical power.	26349	26511
20105310	There was also no functional analysis of the adipose tissue.	26512	26572
20105310	On the other hand, the strengths of the study are that no samples were pooled and microarray analysis was conducted individually on all 21 samples.	26573	26720
20105310	It should be noted that intact adipose tissue was specifically chosen for the analysis.	26721	26808
20105310	This tissue represents a pool of adipocytes as well as preadipocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells.	26809	26914
20105310	Direct analysis of the tissue prevented the introduction of artefactual changes resulting from processing and separating the various cell populations.	26915	27065
20105310	Hence, this can be viewed as both a strength and a weakness.	27066	27126
20105310	Interestingly, while the design of the study allowed for a comprehensive comparison of gene expression between SC and OM adipose tissue, we discovered that the significant differences were found primarily in the SC tissue.	27127	27349
20105310	SAM analysis determined that OM tissue did not have significant differences between the LAT and HAT groups.	27350	27457
20105310	Targeted analysis of specific biological pathways allowed us to compare genes from many different gene families simultaneously.	27458	27585
20105310	Differential results between LAT and HAT in the SC tissue included genes involved in the alternative complement system, lipid synthesis, lipolysis, oxidation, fatty acid binding proteins, markers of differentiation, pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, macrophage recruitment, and matrix remodelling genes.	27586	27892
20105310	This contrasts markedly with a previous study comparing insulin resistant obese with insulin sensitive obese where differences were primarily noted in OM tissue, with no differences in SC tissue.	27893	28088
20105310	This is a particularly interesting point.	28089	28130
20105310	While differences in omental adipose tissue in relationship to insulin resistance have been noted (in microarray studies and others), our present study specifically identified differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue with respect to ASP related metabolism.	28131	28389
20105310	While differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue have been identified using other biochemical parameters (such as differences in triglyceride synthesis in subcutaneous adipose tissue in non-obese vs obese subjects) this is the first to identify this based on ASP metabolism.	28390	28664
20105310	We speculate (as a hypothesis to be tested) that this may indicate a compensatory mechanism, whereby genes related to ASP are concomitantly increased with genes related to lipid storage, however this remains to be tested in future studies.	28665	28904
20105310	In contrast to the demonstrated changes in the gene families described above, there were no significant differences in housekeeping genes, insulin signalling genes and non-related complement genes between these two groups (LAT vs HAT).	28905	29140
20105310	We demonstrated that four genes commonly reported as housekeeping genes, B2M, GUSB, PPIA, and TFRC, were not significantly different between the LAT and HAT groups nor did they correlate with age or BMI.	29141	29344
20105310	Further, not only were plasma glucose and insulin comparable between the 2 groups, the expression of genes related to insulin resistance and insulin signalling such as insulin receptor InsR, IRS-1, IRS-4, IGF1, and IGF2 were comparably expressed between LAT and HAT groups, and did not correlate with age or BMI.	29345	29657
20105310	Further, the expression of other complement genes (C5) and receptors (C3aR, C5aR) that are not involved in ASP production or signalling were not different between groups (LAT and HAT).	29658	29842
20105310	This suggests that there is selective regulation of metabolic genes directly related to the role of ASP, independent of insulin or other immune related genes.	29843	30001
20105310	On the other hand, there was a strong association between increased plasma ASP and TG (lipemic index) and expression of the genes related directly to ASP production and function.	30002	30180
20105310	Thus complement C3, factor B and adipsin were generally increased in the microarray in HAT vs LAT groups.	30181	30286
20105310	Further, C5L2, the receptor for ASP, was assessed by real-time PCR, and expression was also increased in HAT vs LAT.	30287	30403
20105310	C5L2, a G protein coupled receptor, has been shown to be present on human adipocytes and preadipocytes, but this is the first quantitative evaluation of C5L2 reported in human adipose tissue.	30404	30595
20105310	While C5L2 is increased in the HAT group, the expression of C5L2 in the LAT group is very similar to the non-obese control group in both SC and OM tissue.	30596	30750
20105310	Further, in the present study there was a significant correlation between C5L2 expression in SC and OM adipose tissue.	30751	30869
20105310	These results are consistent with increased binding of ASP to adipose plasma membranes in obese subjects vs non-obese subjects, although the C5L2 receptor was as yet unrecognized at that time, and no plasma data was available.	30870	31096
20105310	We have also previously demonstrated an association between SC and OM adipose tissue for radiolabelled ASP binding to plasma membranes, across a range of BMI from obese and non-obese subjects.	31097	31289
20105310	On the other hand, in our previous study, ASP binding and affinity was greater in SC vs OM adipose tissue, while in the present study, C5L2 mRNA expression was not different in SC vs OM, which could reflect a further level of regulation at the plasma membrane.	31290	31550
20105310	This is the first study evaluating expression of ASP related genes, including the receptor C5L2, in the context of plasma ASP.	31551	31677
20105310	The few studies that have examined complement C3 gene expression in adipose tissue have demonstrated associations with BMI, adipose tissue site, insulin sensitivity, age and postprandial lipemia.	31678	31873
20105310	Only one study examined the levels of plasma ASP in relationship to adipose tissue gene expression and demonstrated significant associations between C3 mRNA, plasma ASP and both insulin sensitivity and postprandial TG.	31874	32092
20105310	This raises the question whether chronically increased plasma ASP represents an ASP resistant state (analogous to increased plasma insulin reflecting insulin resistance), or whether the increased ASP is compensatory.	32093	32309
20105310	Hypothetically, the presence of increased plasma ASP, increased expression of C3, factor B and adipsin in the microarray and increased C5L2 based on real-time PCR would suggest a compensatory mechanism, indicative of a more effective response, and interpretation of the results are evaluated in that context below.	32310	32624
20105310	There was a striking correlation between the three genes most relevant to ASP production: C3, Factor B, and adipsin (aka Factor D), constituting an ASP triad.	32625	32783
20105310	Other complement genes (C3aR and C5aR) that are neither related to ASP production nor signalling do not correlate with the "ASP triad."	32784	32919
20105310	This selectivity within the alternative complement pathway and the correlation with many metabolic genes points to the physiological relevance.	32920	33063
20105310	A general trend observed was that the HAT group has up-regulated genes for lipid TG storage.	33064	33156
20105310	Along with the high plasma ASP and high C5L2 receptor, there are multiple genes including intracellular lipid storage, lipoprotein lipase, and fatty acid trafficking genes that are increased in the HAT group.	33157	33365
20105310	The simultaneous increase in both lipid storage and lipolytic genes suggests an overall increase in substrate cycling and fatty acid flux.	33366	33504
20105310	Concurrently, de novo TG synthesis and oxidative genes were down-regulated.	33505	33580
20105310	Taken together, the cells appear to be responding to an increased plasma TG level in the HAT group and are increasing their uptake and storage of TG.	33581	33730
20105310	Many of the increased storage genes correlated with the "ASP triad" of genes including DB1 and LPL.	33731	33830
20105310	Among the oxidative genes, ACC correlates negatively with the ASP triad.	33831	33903
20105310	Changes in adipose tissue function implicate alterations in differentiation genes, remodelling genes, and inflammatory complications.	33904	34037
20105310	The HAT group is characterized by increased in differentiation factors CEBPα, β, and CEBPδ as well as PPAR γ, consistent with the increased TG storage genes.	34038	34195
20105310	Interestingly, we have previously demonstrated that ASP stimulates adipogenesis in cultured 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells, reflected by early increases in CEBP, followed later by increases in PPARγ, DGAT-1, adipsin and TG accumulation.	34196	34428
20105310	The HAT group is also characterized by increased anti-inflammatory gene TGFβ1 and inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMP1, TIMP3 and TIMP4 and decreased metalloproteinase MMP20 and MMP10.	34429	34615
20105310	On the other hand, there were few increases in pro-inflammatory genes, although pro-inflammatory and cell remodelling factors such as PIG7, CCR2 and MMP2 were increased.	34616	34785
20105310	An interesting link between the role of the alternative complement pathway factors ASP and C5L2 and immune and adipose have been supported by active demonstration of adipose tissue macrophage infiltration, apoptosis and tissue remodelling in obesity, and the differences demonstrated between HAT and LAT.	34786	35090
20105310	Overall, the profile of C5L2 receptor, ASP gene expression and metabolic factors in adipose tissue from the HAT group of morbidly obese subjects suggests a compensatory response associated with the increased plasma ASP and TG.	35091	35317
20105310	A shift in the various pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, macrophage recruitment and matrix remodelling proteins demonstrates a differential expression in the HAT group, although the specific benefits or deleterious effects of this regulation remain to be elucidated.	35318	35587
20105310	Men and women living in Montreal, Canada were recruited for this study.	35588	35659
20105310	Altogether, for the microarray there were two men and nine women, all morbidly obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2).	35660	35762
20105310	Chi2 analysis indicated no significant difference in gender distribution.	35763	35836
20105310	A sample of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue along with a fasting blood sample were collected during gastric bypass surgery (n = 11).	35837	35977
20105310	Ethics approval for this project was obtained from the McGill University Health Centre (Royal Victoria Hospital) ethics review committee (Montreal, QC) and subjects signed an informed consent form prior to participation.	35978	36198
20105310	Of the 11 subjects, none had previously been identified as having diabetes or any other known disease (other than the presence of morbid obesity).	36199	36345
20105310	All women were pre-menopausal.	36346	36376
20105310	None were taking hypoglycaemic or lipid lowering medication.	36377	36437
20105310	Body weight was stable at the time of study.	36438	36482
20105310	For the real time RT-PCR analysis, a lean control group was included to compare C5L2 gene expression (a gene not on the microarray) to the morbidly obese subjects.	36483	36646
20105310	This group consisted of four non-obese subjects, two women and two men.	36647	36718
20105310	Adipose tissue samples were collected during elective hysterectomy surgery (n = 2), valve replacement (n = 1), and hernia (n = 1) surgeries.	36719	36859
20105310	All other inclusion/exclusion parameters were the same as for the morbidly obese group.	36860	36947
20105310	Although we cannot rule out the presence of an inflammatory component in these subjects, all were elective and not emergency surgeries.	36948	37083
20105310	Venous blood samples were collected in the fasting state into non-heparinized EDTA tubes.	37084	37173
20105310	Samples were collected at 7:00 am, on the ward following a 12 hour fast, prior to transfer of patients to surgery.	37174	37288
20105310	Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes and plasma was stored at -80°C for later analysis.	37289	37404
20105310	Insulin levels were measured by RIA (Medicorp, Montreal, Canada).	37405	37470
20105310	Glucose was measured by colorimetric enzyme assay (GOD-PAP, Roche Diagnostics.	37471	37549
20105310	Plasma triglycerides were measured by GPO-PAP (glycerol phosphate oxidase coupled to phenol and 4-aminophenazone) method.	37550	37671
20105310	ASP levels were measured by colorimetric enzymatic ELISA.	37672	37729
20105310	A lipemic index utilizing the fasting values of ASP and TG was calculated.	37730	37804
20105310	ASP strongly correlates with postprandial TG, therefore a lipemic index of [ASP × TG] may be indicative of ASP effects on clearance of postprandial TG.	37805	37956
20105310	Adipose tissue was collected at the beginning of the operation (within 30 minutes) into sterile 50 mL conical tubes and immediately flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen.	37957	38122
20105310	Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected from the subcutaneous abdominal wall and omental adipose tissue was collected from the greater omentum which is representative of intra-abdominal adipose depots drained by the portal vein.	38123	38353
20105310	RNA was extracted from tissues using Qiagen spin columns (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) following manufacturer's protocol for fatty tissue with the addition of two RNase free DNase treatments (Qiagen) between RW1 washes.	38354	38573
20105310	RNA quality was assessed by spectrometry (260/280 ratio) with ratios of 1.9 - 2.0.	38574	38656
20105310	As well, RNA quality was assessed by chromatography.	38657	38709
20105310	Synthesis of cRNA by in vitro transcription and hybridisation was performed as previously described.	38710	38810
20105310	Briefly, 10 ug of high quality total RNA was converted to cDNA and then to biotin-labelled cRNA (10 mM Biotin-11-UTP, Perkin-Elmer) by linear amplification (iExpress Assay reagent kit, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Montreal, Quebec).	38811	39042
20105310	10 ug of labelled cRNA was hybridised to CodeLink UniSet Human 20 K I (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences).	39043	39142
20105310	The microarray slides were processed according to manufacturer's instructions and analysed using Codelink System Software (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences).	39143	39294
20105310	The spot intensities were median normalized (signal intensity of probe/median intensity of all discovery probes).	39295	39408
20105310	The results have been deposited to GEO database under accession number GSE 15524.	39409	39490
20105310	Real time RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression pattern of C5L2, the ASP receptor, because no probes for C5L2 were present on the microarray.	39491	39637
20105310	The specific primer/probe sets used were human C5L2 (Hs_00218495).	39638	39704
20105310	Confirmatory RT-PCR was also analyzed for 7 additional genes (complement C3 (C3), C5a receptor (C5aR), CD36, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), CEBPγ and insulin receptor (INSR), as well as a housekeeping gene beta-2-microglobulin (B2M, 4326319E).	39705	39997
20105310	All primeréprobe sets were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Toronto, Canada).	39998	40076
20105310	RNA was collected as described above for the real time RT-PCR and run separately from the microarray.	40077	40178
20105310	RNA (2 ug) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's protocols.	40179	40317
20105310	All primer/probe sets were validated over an exponential range of 1:2 to 1:7500 dilutions of cDNA concentrations.	40318	40431
20105310	A positive control consisting of pooled adipose tissue RNA isolated from human adipose tissue was used to establish the dynamic range of the assay for each primer/probe specifically in adipose tissue.	40432	40632
20105310	Detection of the fluorescent signal was quantified by Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research).	40633	40722
20105310	The control sample was assayed in each real-time PCR run to ensure consistency.	40723	40802
20105310	For all samples, a dilution of 1:50 of the cDNA was used, which was linear within the tested exponential range, and all samples (n = 15) were analysed simultaneously, in duplicate or triplicate (no samples were pooled).	40803	41022
20105310	Expression patterns for all genes, including C5L2 were analysed by real-time PCR using delta delta CT method expressed relative to the housekeeping gene B2M, according to manufacturer's protocol.	41023	41218
20105310	Further, B2M was shown to be consistent across all samples (no significant changes) in both the microarray analysis (Additional File 2, Table S2) and in real time RT-PCR.	41219	41389
20105310	Plasma data is presented as means ± SEM, and the two groups (HAT vs LAT) were compared by 2-sided t-test.	41390	41495
20105310	The results were considered significant with p-values ≤ 0.05.	41496	41557
20105310	For real-time PCR, data is presented as means ± SEM data.	41558	41615
20105310	For C5L2 data, the groups were compared by two-way ANOVA for tissue (SC and OM) and groups (HAT, LAT, and NO) with all-pairwise post-hoc test used to compare significant differences between groups.	41616	41813
20105310	For all other genes analyzed by real-time PCR, the two groups (HAT vs LAT) were compared by 2-sided t-test.	41814	41921
20105310	The results were considered significant with p-values ≤ 0.05.	41496	41557
20105310	Two types of analysis were conducted for the microarray analysis: (i) SAM analysis and (ii) targeted analysis of biologic pathways involved in lipid storage and inflammation.	41984	42158
20105310	For the former, analysis was conducted using SAM (Significant Analysis of Microarrays) program version 3.09 and available at http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM using suggested guidelines (see on-site manual).	42159	42371
20105310	This program is a validated statistical technique for identifying differentially expressed genes across high density microarrays.	7101	7230
20105310	This analysis technique provides a list of significant differentially expressed genes and their q values, and an estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR) which represents the percentage of genes that could be identified by chance.	42502	42734
20105310	Following SAM analysis of subcutaneous and omental tissues, we further analyzed the data targeting specific metabolic biologic pathways (according to the a priori hypothesis).	42735	42910
20105310	For the targeted microarray analysis, the following procedure was used: (i) using known biochemical pathways, a list of proteins/genes involved in ASP generation, complement related factors, lipid storage metabolism including TG synthesis, lipolysis and oxidation, adipocyte differentiation, and inflammatory genes were collated; (ii) accession numbers were identified using Entrez Gene http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; (iii) the Codelink gene list was screened to tag all of the accession numbers present in the array; (iv) all genes identified with the associated SC and OM datasets were then pooled and (v) the data was then statistically analyzed for HAT vs LAT.	42911	43574
20105310	All data was assembled prior to initiating analysis on HAT vs LAT.	43575	43641
20105310	All genes identified in these pathways are presented for SC and OM tissues (Additional File 1, Table S1), whether significantly different or not (according to a 2-sided t-test).	43642	43819
20105310	Microarray data were expressed using mean ± SEM.	43820	43868
20105310	The cross-nested design was to analyze two experimental factors: (i) the comparison between two groups (LAT versus HAT), and (ii) between the different tissues (SC vs OM).	43869	44040
20105310	A mixed model analysis was performed with interaction between the fixed factors.	44041	44121
20105310	To proceed with the analysis, we used a model with a compound symmetry structure.	44122	44203
20105310	For most variables, values were log transformed to stabilize variances.	44204	44275
20105310	Reported p values are based on these transformations.	44276	44329
20105310	Relationships between variables were expressed using Spearman correlation coefficients.	44330	44417
20105310	For all microarray data, the results were considered significant with p-values ≤ 0.025, where ns indicates not significant.	44418	44541
20105310	Graphical and statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA), SAS, version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific, CA).	44542	44717
28416580	Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating condition that afflicts 10–15% of all stroke victims, but no effective treatment exists (1–5).	0	142
28416580	Emerging evidence suggests that inflammation plays a key role in the progression of ICH-induced brain injury (4, 6, 7).	143	262
28416580	Upon the onset of ICH, blood components, including leukocytes, enter the brain and activate resident immune cells, such as microglia.	263	396
28416580	Subsequently, the infiltrating leukocytes and activated microglia then augment the local production of proinflammatory cytokines.	397	526
28416580	Together with cell death products, these factors amplify blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and destroy surrounding tissues, contributing to the development of perihematomal edema and the aggravated mass effect (4, 6, 7).	527	750
28416580	Therefore, brain inflammation has emerged as a major modifiable determinant as a target for the development of new ICH treatment (7).The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is a 5-transmembrane unit localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane with the major function of transporting cholesterol across that membrane for neurosteroid synthesis (8).	751	1099
28416580	As leukocytes infiltrate and microglia become activated after ICH, TSPO is rapidly up-regulated in microglia and other brain-resident immune cells (9).	1100	1251
28416580	Substantial evidence has verified the augmentation of TSPO in several neuroinflammatory conditions, including ischemic stroke (10, 11) and multiple sclerosis (12, 13).	1252	1419
28416580	The prevalence and up-regulation of TSPO in the neuroinflammatory environment suggest that targeting TSPO may be a viable approach to limiting neuroinflammation and brain injury after ICH.	1420	1608
28416580	In a recent study of experimental ICH, the up-regulation of TSPO was documented in brain microglia (9), but still unclear is what immune cell types may express TSPO after ICH.Etifoxine is a clinically available, high-affinity TSPO ligand (8).	1609	1851
28416580	Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of etifoxine and other TSPO ligands in down-regulating microglial activation and promoting neural survival after several types of CNS injury (12, 14–16).	1852	2052
28416580	However, no studies have been performed to determine the potential impact of etifoxine on brain injury and inflammation in the context of ICH.	2053	2195
28416580	In this study, in 2 mouse models of ICH, etifoxine treatment attenuated neurodeficits, lesion size, perihematomal edema, cell death, and neuroinflammation.Human brain tissues were obtained at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital.	2196	2432
28416580	The protocols were approved by the institutional review boards in Tianjin Medical University General Hospital.	2433	2543
28416580	Among the 9 patients studied, the perihematomal tissues were from 5 patients who underwent surgical evacuation of hematomas within 24 h of ICH onset.	2544	2693
28416580	The specimens were collected with informed consent.	2694	2745
28416580	The patients with ICH were between 40 and 60 yr of age with a computed tomography-confirmed hematoma located in the basal ganglia (30–70 ml).	2746	2887
28416580	The other 4 samples were obtained from individuals who died of nonneurologic diseases, and those tissues were collected within 4 h after death for use as controls.	2888	3051
28416580	The 4 control subjects had no history of neurologic or neuropsychiatric diseases, which was confirmed by histopathological examination.All animal experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Tianjin Neurologic Institute and Barrow Neurologic Institute.	3052	3341
28416580	All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in China and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA].	3342	3569
28416580	Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA), 8 to 10 wk old, were used.	3570	3665
28416580	The mice were randomly assigned into each experimental group.	3666	3727
28416580	All mice were housed in pathogen-free conditions of the vivarium facilities.	3728	3804
28416580	All surgeries were performed with animals under anesthesia.	3805	3864
28416580	Reporting of this study complies with the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines).ICH was induced as we have described (17–20).	3865	4064
28416580	Mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.	4065	4181
28416580	Thereafter, they were fixed on a stereotactic frame.	4182	4234
28416580	A hole was drilled on the right side of the skull (2.3 mm lateral to midline, 0.5 mm anterior to bregma).	4235	4340
28416580	For the ICH model induced by collagenase injection, 0.0375 U bacterial collagenase (type IV-S; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 0.5 μl saline was infused at a rate of 1 μl/min at the caudate nucleus (3.7-mm depth below the surface of the skull) through an infusion pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA).	4341	4652
28416580	For the ICH model induced by injection of autologous blood, a double-injection method was used.	4653	4748
28416580	Whole blood (30 μl) withdrawn from the angular vein was transferred into a 50 μl syringe with a 26-gauge needle (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA).	4749	4895
28416580	The needle was inserted into the right caudate nucleus (2.3 mm lateral to the midline; 0.5 mm anterior to the bregma; 3 mm below the surface of the skull).	4896	5051
28416580	During the infusion process, the first 5 μl of blood was injected at the rate of 1 μl/min through the infusion pump beneath the hole, to generate a clot; the needle was then moved to a depth of 3.7 mm from the 3-mm position.	5052	5276
28416580	After a 5-min pause, the remaining 25 μl blood was infused at the same rate of 1 μl/min.	5277	5365
28416580	The needle was held in position for an additional 20 min and then gently withdrawn.	5366	5449
28416580	Sham-treated controls were injected with an equal volume of saline.	5450	5517
28416580	The burr hole was sealed with bone wax (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA).	5518	5601
28416580	During surgery, body temperatures were maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C.	5602	5666
28416580	Afterward, animals were placed in cages and given free access to food and water.Etifoxine was dissolved in saline supplement with 1% Tween-80 as previously described (12).	5667	5838
28416580	Etifoxine or the saline vehicle was administrated at 50 mg/kg in 200 μl by intraperitoneal injection immediately after ICH and was given daily until the experiment ended.Neurologic deficits were assessed at d 1 and 3 after ICH by at least 2 investigators blinded to the treatments of all ICH mice in each group.	5839	6150
28416580	The modified Neurologic Severity Score (mNSS) and corner-turning test were performed as described (21, 22).	6151	6258
28416580	The mNSS rates neurologic functioning and includes a composite of motor, sensory, reflex, and balance tests.	6259	6367
28416580	The corner-turning test was used to assess sensorimotor and postural asymmetries.	6368	6449
28416580	The mouse being tested was allowed to enter a corner with an angle of 30° and was required to turn either to the left or the right to exit the corner.	6450	6600
28416580	The clinical scoring and corner test procedures were performed as published elsewhere (23, 24).Three days after ICH, a 7-T small-animal MRI scan was performed to evaluate lesion volume and hematoma volume (17).	6601	6811
28416580	T2-weighted images (repetition time, 4500 ms; echo time, 65.5 ms; field of view, 28 × 28; image matrix, 256 × 256; slice thickness, 0.5 mm) and susceptibility weighted images (SWIs; repetition time, 30 ms; echo time, 10 ms; field of view, 32 × 32; image matrix, 256 × 256; slice thickness, 0.3 mm) were acquired to assess lesion volume and hematoma volume, respectively.	6812	7182
28416580	The lesion and hematoma areas were manually outlined on each slice, then the areas in all slices were summed and multiplied by section thickness using Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization software (MIPAV; NIH).	7183	7410
28416580	The lesion and hematoma volumes were measured by 2 investigators blinded to the tissues source.The T1 postcontrast images were used to assess BBB integrity (25).	7411	7572
28416580	After administration of the contrast agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine; Gd-DTPA), (Magnevist, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) with a dosage of 0.2 mmol/kg body weight, T1 postcontrast images were acquired with the following parameters: repetition time, 322 ms; echo time, 10.5 ms; field of view, 28 mm; image matrix, 256 × 256; slice thickness, 0.5 mm).	7573	7923
28416580	MRI data were analyzed with MED×3.4.3 software (Medical Numerics, Germantown, MA, USA) on a Linux workstation.Brain water content was measured 3 d after ICH (26).	7924	8086
28416580	In brief, after anesthesia and decapitation, brains of mice were obtained and divided into 3 parts: ipsilateral hemisphere, contralateral hemisphere, and cerebellum.	8087	8252
28416580	The tissues were then weighed to obtain the wet weight, followed by drying for 24 h at 100°C to obtain the dry weight.	8253	8371
28416580	The calculation formula of brain water contents was: (wet weight – dry weight)/wet weight × 100%.To analyze immune cell infiltration and microglia cytokine expression in brains, we isolated cellular components from brain tissue to perform flow cytometry analysis.	8372	8635
28416580	Three days after ICH, brains were harvested and homogenized with 40 μm nylon cell strainers (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in PBS.	8636	8777
28416580	Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and cell pellets were collected.	8778	8867
28416580	Thereafter, 5 ml of 70% Percoll solution (GE Healthcare Bio Science AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to resuspend the cell pellet, and 30% Percoll solution was overlaid on it.	8868	9040
28416580	The gradient was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature.	9041	9113
28416580	Single cells in the interface between 30 and 70% Percoll were collected for antibody staining.	9114	9208
28416580	Cells were diluted to 1×106 cells in 100 μl PBS solution with 1% bovine serum albumin and stained for antibodies and isotype control.	9209	9342
28416580	All antibodies were purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA), unless otherwise indicated, and the staining protocol followed the manual’s instructions.	9343	9499
28416580	The following antibodies were used: CD45 (30-F11), CD11b (M1/70), CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (GK1.4), CD8 (53-6.72), anti-NK1.1 (PK136), anti-CD19 (1D3), F4/80 (6F12), Ly6G (1A8).	9500	9672
28416580	For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with a commercial solution (BioLegend) and then stained for the antibodies: IL-6 (MP5-20F3), IL-10 (JES5-16E3), TNF-α (MP6-XT22), TGF-β (TW7-20B9), and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for TSPO.	9673	10086
28416580	Fluorescence minus one controls were stained, respectively.To analyze cell death after ICH, we harvested single-cell suspensions as previously described and removed the myelin with 30% Percoll solution.	10087	10289
28416580	The pellets were collected and stained for annexin V, as detailed in the manual’s protocol.	10290	10381
28416580	Flow cytometry data were obtained on FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by Flow Jo, v.7.6.1 (Informer Technologies, Walnut Creek, CA, USA).Brain tissues of patients with ICH and ICH mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin.	10382	10637
28416580	Brain sections (5 µm thick) were made and rehydrated in a series of ethanol dilutions.	10638	10724
28416580	Brain sections were permeabilized and incubated in blocking solution (5% goat or donkey serum in PBS solution), followed by incubation with primary antibodies: goat anti-Iba1 (Wako, Richmond, VA, USA) and rabbit anti-PBR (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight.	10725	10991
28416580	After triple washings with PBS, the slices were incubated with secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and donkey anti-goat 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).	10992	11179
28416580	After triple washings with PBS, the brain sections were stained with DAPI (Abcam).	11180	11262
28416580	For TUNEL staining, the Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Biotin-dUTP Nick End Labeling kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.	11263	11440
28416580	Images were captured with a microscope (Model BX-61; Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA), and data were analyzed with Image J (NIH).	11441	11570
28416580	For cell counting, positively stained cells were counted in 3 comparable, randomly selected microscopic fields.	11571	11682
28416580	The numbers of cells from 9 locations per mouse (3 fields per section × 3 sections per mouse) were averaged and expressed as positive cells per field.Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of tight junction proteins as has been described (17).	11683	11948
28416580	In brief, 3 d after ICH, ipsilateral hemispheres of brains were harvested.	11949	12023
28416580	Proteins were extracted, electrophoresed, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).	12024	12136
28416580	After being blocked, the PVDF membranes were incubated with primary antibodies: anti-zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1, 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific); anti-claudin-5 (1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) antibodies or anti-β-actin (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000; Zymed, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (27).	12137	12561
28416580	The intensity of blots was detected with a Bio-Rad 721BR08844 Gel Doc Imager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).Sample size was determined by power analysis using a significance level of α = 0.05 with 80% power to detect significant differences.	12562	12801
28416580	Power analysis and sample size calculations were performed using SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).	12802	12920
28416580	The experimental design was based on previous publications with similar mechanistic studies (20, 28–30).	12921	13025
28416580	All results were analyzed by investigators blinded to the treatment.	13026	13094
28416580	All data are shown as means ± sem.	13095	13129
28416580	Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).	13130	13220
28416580	Two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test was used to determine significance of differences between 2 groups.	13221	13326
28416580	One-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey post hoc test were used for comparison of multigroup data.	13327	13421
28416580	Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.In the determination of which immune cells might express TSPO after ICH, we prepared single-cell suspensions of brain tissues from mice injected with collagenase to induce ICH and measured the expression profile of TSPO using flow cytometry.	13422	13710
28416580	We found a marked increase in cells expressing TSPO after ICH (Fig.	13711	13778
28416580	1A, B).	13779	13786
28416580	Of note, CD11b+CD45int microglia were the most prominent immune cell type that expressed TSPO 24 h after ICH.	13787	13896
28416580	In contrast, the expression of TSPO was less abundant in CD11b+CD45hi myeloid cells or barely seen in infiltrating CD11b−CD45hi leukocytes.	13897	14036
28416580	In addition, immunostaining analysis revealed that TSPO expression was significantly up-regulated in Iba-1+ cells, including microglia in the brain sections from patients with ICH, as compared to the controls (i.e., tissues from patients with nonneurologic diseases) (Fig.	14037	14309
28416580	1C, D).	14310	14317
28416580	Together, these data suggest a marked up-regulation of TSPO in brain microglia after ICH onset.To assess whether the TSPO ligand, etifoxine, affects brain injury after ICH, we examined neurodeficits, lesion volume, and perihematomal edema in ICH mice receiving etifoxine or a vehicle control.	14318	14610
28416580	Etifoxine (50 mg/kg) or vehicle (1% Tween-80) was injected intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days starting immediately after the injection of autologous blood or collagenase (Fig.	14611	14792
28416580	2A).	14793	14797
28416580	Neurodeficits were measured using the mNSS and the corner turning test at d 1 and 3 after ICH induction in both models.	14798	14917
28416580	Lesion volume and hematoma volume were evaluated with T2 and SWI MRI images 3 d after ICH induction.	14918	15018
28416580	As a result, etifoxine treatment significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema after the onset of ICH (Fig.	15019	15146
28416580	2B–D).	15147	15153
28416580	In addition, etifoxine reduced water content in the brain after ICH (Supplemental Fig.	15154	15240
28416580	1A, B).	13779	13786
28416580	Etifoxine was protective in a dose-dependent manner among the doses examined (25–100 mg/kg).	15249	15341
28416580	We elected to use the dose of 50 mg/kg in this study, because etifoxine at this dose can provide efficacy similar to that of 100 mg/kg.We then sought to determine the impact of etifoxine on brain inflammation after ICH.	15342	15561
28416580	For that purpose, we used flow cytometry to measure cellular components in the ICH-afflicted brain including brain-infiltrating leukocytes and microglia (Fig.	15562	15720
28416580	3A).	15721	15725
28416580	We found that etifoxine treatment significantly reduced the counts of brain-infiltrating macrophages (CD45hiCD11b+F4/80+), neutrophils (CD45hiCD11b+Ly6G+), CD4+ T cells (CD45hiCD3+CD4+), CD8+T cells (CD45hiCD3+CD8+), B cells (CD45hiCD3-CD19+), NK cells (CD45hiCD3-NK1.1+) and microglia (CD11b+CD45int) (Fig.	15726	16033
28416580	3B, C).	16034	16041
28416580	In addition, decreased expression of IL-6 and TNF-α and increased expression of TGF-β were seen in microglia after etifoxine treatment (Fig.	16042	16182
28416580	3D).	16183	16187
28416580	These results suggest that etifoxine can reduce brain inflammation after ICH.The dysregulated BBB function after ICH contributes to vasogenic edema and perihematomal edema development (4, 31).	16188	16380
28416580	To determine whether etifoxine impacts BBB integrity after ICH, we measured BBB permeability and expression of tight junction proteins.	16381	16516
28416580	The presence of brain parenchymal enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1 is generally accepted as an indicator of contrast medium leakage across the disrupted BBB.	16517	16677
28416580	The quantification of parenchymal enhancement showed a significant decrease in ICH mice receiving etifoxine vs. vehicle controls (Fig.	16678	16812
28416580	4A, B).	16813	16820
28416580	Similarly, etifoxine-treated ICH mice had far less Evans Blue extravasation than recipients of the vehicle control (Supplemental Fig.	16821	16954
28416580	2A, B).	16955	16962
28416580	Western blot measurement showed that etifoxine preserved the expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and ZO-1 after ICH (Fig.	16963	17100
28416580	4C, D).	17101	17108
28416580	In addition, immunostaining and flow cytometry analyses were performed to determine cell death.	17109	17204
28416580	Quantitation of TUNEL+ cells in the perihematomal area or annexin V+ cells in the brain portrayed the reduction of cell apoptosis after etifoxine treatment (Fig.	17205	17366
28416580	5).	139	142
28416580	Together, these results suggest that etifoxine can preserve BBB integrity after ICH.Our previous study showed that microglia have a detrimental effect on the brain during the injury phase of ICH (20).	17371	17571
28416580	Because the expression of TSPO occurs primarily in microglia after ICH, we sought to determine whether etifoxine provides protection by targeting microglia.	17572	17728
28416580	The survival of microglia depends on signaling through colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) (20, 32).	17729	17838
28416580	Using the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397, we effectively depleted microglia preceding ICH induction.	17839	17932
28416580	PLX3397 treatment continued in this group of mice until the end of the experiments (Fig.	17933	18021
28416580	6A).	18022	18026
28416580	Flow cytometry measurement of microglia (CD11b+CD45int) showed that depletion efficacy was ∼90% before or after ICH (20).	18027	18148
28416580	We found that the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice receiving PLX3397 (Fig.	18149	18243
28416580	6B–D).	18244	18250
28416580	These results demonstrated that the protection conferred by etifoxine treatment against brain injury after ICH requires microglia.This study provides, for the first time to our knowledge, evidence that etifoxine attenuates hemorrhagic brain injury.	18251	18499
28416580	Etifoxine significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema in 2 models of experimental ICH.	18500	18608
28416580	Etifoxine treatment was sufficient to reduce leukocyte infiltration, decrease microglial production of proinflammatory factors, improve BBB integrity, and alleviate cell death after ICH.	18609	18795
28416580	In addition, the protection provided by etifoxine was lost in mice subjected to highly efficient depletion of microglia.	18796	18916
28416580	These results suggest that etifoxine may be a viable drug candidate for ICH treatment.Microglial activation occurs within minutes after the onset of ICH, and activated microglia were found in the perihematomal area.	18917	19132
28416580	Microglia possess multiple capabilities that would have an impact on hemorrhagic brain injury, including production of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines and antigen presentation (33, 34).	19133	19330
28416580	Indeed, we and others have demonstrated that microglial activation correlates with observations of perihematomal edema, and the inhibition or depletion of microglia activation can provide neuroprotection after ICH (35, 36), suggesting a detrimental role of microglia in ICH.	19331	19605
28416580	A recent study showed that TSPO expression appeared mostly in microglia, but not in astrocytes or neurons (9).	19606	19716
28416580	Consistent with this report, we found low expression of TSPO in uninjured brains in contrast with ICH-induced up-regulation of TSPO in CD11b+CD45int microglia.	19717	19876
28416580	Combined with our data showing the expression of TSPO in IBa1+ cells in brain sections from patients with ICH, these results suggest that TSPO may be a suitable target for modulating the microglial response after ICH.To understand the possible mechanisms by which etifoxine might confer protection after ICH, we examined the immune responses in the brain.	19877	20232
28416580	Evidence has shown that activated microglia and infiltrating leukocytes are key contributors of neuroinflammation after ICH, because of their rapid release of proinflammatory and immunoactive factors, including cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, proteases, and ferrous iron (37–39).	20233	20519
28416580	In the current study, the administration of etifoxine significantly reduced the infiltration of leukocytes and the production by microglia of proinflammatory factors, together with the preservation of BBB integrity and decreased cell death after ICH.	20520	20770
28416580	Our results are consistent with those in previous reports showing that TSPO ligands provide neuroprotective effects and limit brain inflammation (12, 14–16).	20771	20928
28416580	In those studies, reduced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and improved neural function were seen in multiple models of neural injury (12, 14–16).Because brain inflammation and BBB dysfunction are key contributors to vasogenic perihematoma formation after ICH, we postulate that etifoxine may mitigate the brain’s inflammatory milieu to confer protection in ICH.	20929	21325
28416580	In support of this notion, we found that the benefit of etifoxine was abolished in mice depleted of microglia by using a CSF1R inhibitor.	21326	21463
28416580	Together with the finding that the expression of TSPO primarily occurs in microglia after ICH, this result suggests that the protective effect of etifoxine involves its action on microglia to offset the damage from ICH.	21464	21683
28416580	Possibly, then, the reduced infiltration of leukocytes results from the etifoxine-induced restriction of microglial responses, which have been reported to enhance neuroinflammation by recruiting and activating lymphocytes (40, 41).	21684	21915
28416580	However, also noteworthy is the finding that CD11b+CD45hi leukocytes, which may include monocytes and macrophages, also express TSPO after ICH onset, albeit less abundantly than microglia.	21916	22104
28416580	In addition, etifoxine may exert an effect on these CD11b+CD45hi leukocytes that restricts brain inflammation.	22105	22215
28416580	Nevertheless, the precise operating mechanisms by which etifoxine restrict brain inflammation after ICH require further investigation.Reportedly, etifoxine is a potent enhancer of neurosteroid synthesis (8).	22216	22423
28416580	Etifoxine-induced production of pregnenolone, progesterone, and allopregnanolone can confer neuroprotection (42–45).	22424	22540
28416580	Progesterone treatment after ICH in rodents has, indeed, reduced brain edema, inflammatory response and cell death after ICH.	22541	22666
28416580	Together with those results, our findings suggest that protection by the TSPO ligand etifoxine in ICH may involve the local production of neurosteroids that limit brain inflammation.	22667	22849
28416580	Of interest, etifoxine is also reported to be a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (46).	22850	22952
28416580	As previously documented, a significant decrease in the production of GABA and GABAergic system-related genes was observed in rodent models of ICH (47, 48).	22953	23109
28416580	Because the GABAA receptor is expressed by microglia/lymphocytes and activation of the GABAA receptor can reduce their proinflammatory activities (49–52), further investigation is needed to better understand whether and to what extent the action of etifoxine on GABAA receptors may contribute to its benefit in ICH.In summary, our data reveal that etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH, suggesting that it may serve as a promising candidate for investigation in advanced preclinical ICH studies.	23110	23628
20828385	Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), representing about 6% of NHL cases.	0	116
20828385	T(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosomal translocation, one of the most important cytogenetic abnormalities of MCL, juxtaposes genes of cyclin D1 and of immunoglobulin heavy chain, inducing cyclin D1 over-expression and cell cycle deregulation.	117	350
20828385	Thus, cyclin D1 over-expression and/or the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation are hallmarks of MCL, included in current WHO guidelines for MCL diagnosis.	351	501
20828385	MCL patients are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage (III or IV).	502	570
20828385	They become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and have a poor overall survival.	571	671
20828385	Therefore, alternative therapeutic strategies are actively studied.	672	739
20828385	The mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase.	740	818
20828385	It plays an important role in cell growth, protein synthesis, and cell-cycle progression.	819	908
20828385	Since mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in MCL, it could be a potent therapeutic target for this disease.	909	1021
20828385	Recent clinical trials showed that temsirolimus (Wyeth Pharmaceutical, Philadelphia, PA), a mTOR inhibitor, induced a 38% response rate and a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) of 3.4-6.9 months in refractory MCL patients.	1022	1251
20828385	We studied here a refractory MCL patient, who had tumor regression under temsirolimus treatment.	1252	1348
20828385	A 53-year-old male with generalized lymphadenopathy and fatigue, was diagnosed as MCL on inguinal lymph node biopsy.	1349	1465
20828385	After 10 cycles of CHOP and 2 cycles of E-CHOP, lymph nodes bulged.	1466	1533
20828385	Disease was still progressing after 2 cycles of R-ICE.	1534	1588
20828385	Therefore, R-ICE was stopped.	1589	1618
20828385	The patient was recruited in phase III study of temsirolimus (number: 3066K1-305-WW) on August 2006 but was randomized in investigator's choice group.	1619	1769
20828385	According to the protocol, fludarabine 25 mg/m2 was infused daily for 5 days, and it was repeated every 28 days.	1770	1882
20828385	After 8 cycles, fludarabine had to be stopped because of severe bone marrow inhibition on March 2007.	1883	1984
20828385	One year later, enlarged iliac lymph-node compressed ureter, causing renal dysfunction with elevated blood creatinine.	1985	2103
20828385	To confirm the diagnosis of recurrence, a biopsy of enlarged right cervical lymph node was performed and the place was noted on CT scan.	2104	2240
20828385	After confirmation of the MCL recurrence, the patient was permitted to enter the temsirolimus treatment group on March 2008.	2241	2365
20828385	He received temsirolimus 175 mg/week for 3 weeks, followed by weekly doses of 75 mg.	2366	2450
20828385	Circulation blood count was monitored weekly, CT scan and serum chemistry every other month.	2451	2543
20828385	Temsirolimus was suspended, when absolute neutrophil count <1000/μl, or hemoglobin <8 g/dl, or platelet <50000/μl.	2544	2658
20828385	According to the response criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma we use in our hospital, six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses were measured.	2659	2809
20828385	The sum of dimensions of these six nodal masses was recorded before temsirolimus as well as every other month under temsirolimus treatment.	2810	2949
20828385	Other lesions were recorded but not measured.	2950	2995
20828385	After 2 months of temsirolimus treatment, a 33% regression of the sum of dimensions was observed by CT scan (Figure 1).	2996	3115
20828385	Meanwhile, renal function recovered and blood creatinine returned to normal level.	3116	3198
20828385	However, lymph nodes enlargement was still present on CT scan after 6 months of temsirolimus.	3199	3292
20828385	To assess the extent of the therapeutic effect, and to detect a possible early recurrence, a second biopsy of the same right cervical lymph node was performed but in a different direction.	3293	3481
20828385	Informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki.	3482	3553
20828385	Disease remained stable until January 2009 when CT scan showed a cervical lymph node behind the right jugular vein bulged.	3554	3676
20828385	Temsirolimus was then stopped.	3677	3707
20828385	No further biopsy was taken.	3708	3736
20828385	Patient then received arsenic combined with thalidomide and chlorambucil treatment.	3737	3820
20828385	On March 2009, all lymph nodes enlarged, and disease still progressed after 3 cycles of bortezomib.	3821	3920
20828385	The patient finally died of severe bone marrow inhibition and pulmonary infection after hyperCVAD treatment on October 2009.	3921	4045
20828385	During temsirolimus treatment, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occasionally occurred, and disappeared after one week of treatment suspension.	4046	4187
20828385	No sign of thrombosis was observed.	4188	4223
20828385	Cyclin D1, the hallmark of MCL, is the down stream target of mTOR.	4224	4290
20828385	Its expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining (Dako; Glostrup, Denmark; dilution 1:100) on the two successive biopsies.	4291	4424
20828385	Tumor cell proliferation was assessed by Ki67 (Dako; dilution 1:100), apoptosis by cleaved caspase-3 (Cell signaling; MA, USA; dilution 1:50), microvessel density (MVD) by CD31 (Dako; dilution 1:50), and angiogenesis cytokine expression by VEGF-A (R&D system; MN, USA; dilution 1:200).	4425	4710
20828385	Irrelevant isotypic antibodies and absence of primary antibodies were used as controls.	4711	4798
20828385	Immunostained cells were counted on 5 different microscopic fields at ×400 magnification, out of fibrotic and necrotic areas, the count including a minimum of 1000 cells.	4799	4969
20828385	Fibrotic areas were randomized photographed at ×200 magnification for five fields and analysed with Cell Software (Olympus, Tokyo).	4970	5101
20828385	The ratio between fibrotic areas and tumor areas gave the relative fibrotic area.	5102	5183
20828385	Differences between analyses before and after temsirolimus were assessed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test.	5184	5288
20828385	Two-sided P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.	5289	5341
20828385	Comparison between the 2 biopsies, before and after temsirolimus, showed a significant decrease of cyclin D1 (P < 0.01), and Ki67 (P < 0.01).	5342	5483
20828385	But there was no change in apoptotic cell counts (P = 0.15).	5484	5544
20828385	VEGF-A expression (P <0.05) and microvessel density (P < 0.05) were also significantly decreased after temsirolimus therapy.	5545	5669
20828385	Numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas were observed within the tumor.	5670	5746
20828385	Relative fibrotic area significantly increased after temsirolimus (P < 0.05) (Figure 2).	5747	5835
20828385	The use of m-TOR inhibitor in MCL is an emerging therapy, but its in vivo anti-tumor mechanism is not yet fully explained.	5836	5958
20828385	In this refractory MCL case, temsirolimus was able to induce tumor regression as well as a progression-free survival of 10 months.	5959	6089
20828385	Tissue analyses before and after temsirolimus showed the direct cytostatic effect of this mTOR inhibitor through cell cycle arrest, as demonstrated by down-regulation of cyclin D1 and Ki67 in lymphoma cells, and the absence of apoptotic change.	6090	6334
20828385	This cytostatic effect observed on human biopsies is in agreement with experimental results reported in temsirolimus-treated breast and acute leukemia cell lines.	6335	6497
20828385	However, temsirolimus significantly reduced tumor burden in our refractory MCL case, an effect difficult to link only to its cytostatic properties.	6498	6645
20828385	Further assessment of its efficiency on lymphoma tissue showed that the tumor microvessel density and the VEGF-A expression were both significantly reduced after treatment.	6646	6818
20828385	On the same biopsies, we also found patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post-necrotic tissue repair.	6819	6936
20828385	Along this line, tumor infarct and necrosis linked to tumor microvessel thrombi have been reported in xenografted pancreas and colon cancer treated by mTOR inhibitor.	6937	7103
20828385	Reduction of microvessel density and of VEGF-A expression were also found in another series of xenografted breast cancers.	7104	7226
20828385	Temsirolimus could thus reduce tumor burden through a direct cytostatic effect on the tumor cells, but also through an associated effect on tumor angiogenesis.	7227	7386
20828385	This dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory MCL resistant to conventional cytotoxic drugs.	7387	7549
20828385	On the long term, this supports the evaluation of anti-angiogenic drugs in refractory MCL.	7550	7640
20828385	Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.	7641	7760
20828385	A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.	7761	7854
28398555	Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms and contractions.	0	75
28398555	It is characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements and painful postures than can be accompanied by dystonic tremor (1).	76	258
28398555	Dystonia may be classified according to its distribution (2) or as primary or secondary (3).	259	351
28398555	In contrast to secondary dystonia that can be caused by brain damage (head injury, stroke) or exposure to particular drugs, the pathophysiological mechanisms of most forms of primary dystonia are unknown (4).	352	560
28398555	Recently, using a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome next-generation sequencing in a consanguineous kindred affected by autosomal-recessive isolated dystonia, homozygous mutations were observed in the genes LAPTM5, coding for a lysosomal transmembrane protein and HPCA, encoding the calcium-binding protein hippocalcin.	561	897
28398555	After in silico analysis, hippocalcin was identified as the most plausible cause for DYT2 primary isolated dystonia (5).	898	1018
28398555	HPCA or hippocalcin, is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family (6) and is highly expressed in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, in particular in their dendrites (7–9).	1019	1209
28398555	It contains four EF-hands out of which only three are capable of binding calcium.	1210	1291
28398555	In response to increased intracellular calcium, hippocalcin undergoes a conformational change and translocates from the cytosol to cellular membranes through a Ca2+/myristoyl switch mechanism (10).	1292	1489
28398555	The extrusion of the myristoyl-containing hydrophobic N-terminus region from the hydrophobic pocket (11) allows hippocalcin to localize to membranes where it can interact with downstream targets (10,12,13).	1490	1696
28398555	In addition to its role in the control of apoptosis (14), hippocalcin has been shown to be involved in neuronal excitability (15–17), regulation of neurite outgrowth (18) and gene transcription (19,20), long-term depression (21–23) and the modulation of cyclic nucleotide signalling (24).	1697	1985
28398555	Mutations at positions T71N and A190T were shown to be critical in development of DYT2 dystonia (5).	1986	2086
28398555	It was speculated that T71N mutation could impair or prevent calcium binding to EF-hand domain 2, possibly leading to a loss of function, whereas A190T could be involved in target specificity.	2087	2279
28398555	However, no direct evidence was provided to support these hypotheses.	2280	2349
28398555	In this study, we investigate the effect of the dystonia-causing mutations on the biophysical and physiological properties of hippocalcin.	2350	2488
28398555	We demonstrate that hippocalcin oligomerises upon calcium binding and interacts with voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs).	2489	2613
28398555	We observed that the structure, stability and calcium-binding properties of the mutants remain unchanged.	2614	2719
28398555	Both mutants, however, show strong oligomerisation defects and increased intracellular calcium influx.	2720	2822
28398555	These results suggest that the cause of the disease is not due to loss of hippocalcin expression or stability but to subtle changes in its ability to participate in calcium signalling.	2823	3007
28398555	To determine if the calcium-binding properties of hippocalcin were altered by the mutations, equilibrium calcium-binding titrations were performed using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig.	3008	3200
28398555	1).	255	258
28398555	Free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]) were calculated using the Maxchelator program (25) and were verified using OGB-1 (Supplementary Material, Fig.	3205	3352
28398555	S1).	3353	3357
28398555	In order to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) and the Hill coefficient (n), calcium titrations were normalised and fitted to the Hill equation (correlation coefficient values between 0.96 and 0.98).	3358	3563
28398555	Hippocalcin wild-type had a Kd of 65 ± 4 nM and a Hill coefficient (n) of 1.4 ± 0.1.	3564	3648
28398555	As expected, hippocalcin(A190T) presented similar calcium-binding properties to the wild-type protein with Kd = 77 ± 5 nM and n = 1.3 ± 0.1 (Table 1).	3649	3799
28398555	Affinities for calcium for hippocalcin(T71N) (Kd = 93 ± 12 nM) was not significantly different from the wild-type, even though the mutation was located within the second EF-hand of hippocalcin.	3800	3993
28398555	However, the cooperativity of calcium binding, shown by the Hill coefficient, significantly decreased from n = 1.4 ± 0.1 for the wild-type, to n = 0.7 ± 0.1 for hippocalcin(T71N).	3994	4173
28398555	Stability of hippocalcin proteins was determined by trypsin limited proteolysis and temperature/chemical denaturation (Supplementary Material, Fig.	4174	4321
28398555	S2).	4322	4326
28398555	Incubation of wild-type hippocalcin with trypsin showed 32 ± 14% degradation over 30 min (Supplementary Material, Fig.	4327	4445
28398555	S2A).	4446	4451
28398555	Similar susceptibility to protease degradation was observed for both mutants.	4452	4529
28398555	In addition, α-helices temperature unfolding followed by circular dichroism revealed that hippocalcin is a very thermostable protein with only 37% of α-helices denaturation at 90 °C, and that the mutations did not alter the temperature stability of the protein (Supplementary Material, Fig.	4530	4820
28398555	S2B).	4821	4826
28398555	Guanidine denaturation monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence showed complete protein denaturation at [Gnd-HCl] of 3 M (Supplementary Material, Fig.	4827	4983
28398555	S2C).	4984	4989
28398555	When comparing the susceptibility to guanidine of hippocalcin wild-type with the mutants, no significant difference was observed.	4990	5119
28398555	Altogether, these data suggest that the disease-causing mutations T71N and A190T are not affecting the stability of the proteins.	5120	5249
28398555	Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to examine whether the mutations in hippocalcin were causing secondary structure modifications.	5250	5391
28398555	CD spectra were collected for hippocalcin and the mutants in either apo- or calcium-bound form (Supplementary Material, Fig.	5392	5516
28398555	S3A).	5517	5522
28398555	After protein secondary structure prediction using the CDSSTR method, the helical content of hippocalcin was estimated to ∼75% of α-helices and only 9% of β-sheets (Supplementary Material, Fig.	5523	5716
28398555	S3B).	5717	5722
28398555	The conformational change that occurs upon calcium binding did not affect the secondary structure content, neither did the mutations.	5723	5856
28398555	Crystal structures were obtained for wild-type human hippocalcin (PDB 5G4P), hippocalcin(T71N) (PDB 5M6C) and hippocalcin(A190T) (PDB 5G58) at a resolution of the 2.42, 3.00 and 2.54 Å, respectively.	5857	6056
28398555	Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Supplementary Material, Table S1.	6057	6149
28398555	The structure of hippocalcin is similar to all NCS proteins and contains 4 EF-hands (helix-loop-helix motifs) and 10 α-helices (Supplementary Material, Fig.	6150	6306
28398555	S4A).	6307	6312
28398555	Electron density revealed three calcium ions in EF-2, EF-3 and EF-4 binding sites (Fig.	6313	6400
28398555	2A) in all structures.	6401	6423
28398555	Cryptic EF-hand 1 did not bind any calcium ions, as expected.	6424	6485
28398555	The regions involved in calcium binding showed complete preservation and high order.	6486	6570
28398555	As many NCS proteins, hippocalcin has two lobes, N-lobe is formed by EF-1 and EF-2, while C-lobe is formed by EF-3 and EF-4.	6571	6695
28398555	The crystal structure contained two copies of hippocalcin in the asymmetric unit connected by insertion of C-terminal helix of chain E (residues 181–190) into the hydrophobic groove of chain A.	6696	6889
28398555	This packing is facilitated by salt bridge between guanidinium group of Arg181 and carboxyl group of Asp37, and hydrogen bond between OE1 Gln184 and NE1 Trp30 (Supplementary Material, Fig.	6890	7078
28398555	S4B).	7079	7084
28398555	Interestingly, the same fragment is expected to be involved in target binding.	7085	7163
28398555	PISA analysis of the oligomeric states for all three proteins has confirmed that they are monomeric in solution.	7164	7276
28398555	Alignment of Cα atoms of hippocalcin with other calcium-binding proteins such as rat NCS-1 (PDB 5AEQ) and bovine neurocalcin delta (PDB 1BJF) showed significant variability in the orientation of the C-terminal part of the molecule, region expected to be involved in specificity of target binding (Fig.	7277	7578
28398555	2B).	4822	4826
28398555	In addition, significant variability was observed in the loop regions, with exception of the EF-hand loops (Fig.	7584	7696
28398555	2C).	4985	4989
28398555	Comparison of hippocalcin with the dimeric crystal structure of bovine neurocalcin delta (PDB 1BJF), suggest a key role of the calcium EF-hands for oligomerisation as they seem to be located at the dimerization interface and are structurally identical in 3 proteins (Fig.	7702	7973
28398555	2C).	4985	4989
28398555	The crystal structure of hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) did not show any significant conformation difference when compared to the wild-type protein and they have identical crystal packing (Supplementary Material, Fig.	7979	8206
28398555	S4C).	8207	8212
28398555	Mutation site in hippocalcin T71N is located on the interface between N-lobe and C-lobe close to the area of interaction with peptides in NCS-1 (26), change from Thr to Asn strengthens inter-lobe interface by creating additional hydrogen bond between ND2 Asn71 and OG Ser106 (Supplementary Material, Fig.	8213	8517
28398555	S4D).	8518	8523
28398555	Mutation A190T is located at the end of the flexible C-terminal helix (Supplementary Material, Fig.	8524	8623
28398555	S4E), which is predicted to interact with hippocalcin target protein.	8624	8693
28398555	Change from Ala to Thr does not decrease C-terminus flexibility.This part has no electron density in chain A.	8694	8803
28398555	Absolute molar masses of hippocalcin wild-type and mutants were accurately determined by SEC-MALS, overcoming the limitation of column calibration.	8804	8951
28398555	MALS data indicated that in the absence of calcium, hippocalcin was 99% monomeric (23.1 ± 0.2 kDa) (Fig.	8952	9056
28398555	3, Supplementary Material, Table S2).	9057	9094
28398555	However, in the presence of 1 mM calcium, hippocalcin formed a mixture of monomers (25.1 ± 0.9 kDa) and oligomers with a molar mass consistent with dimer (46.7 ± 1.1 kDa), trimer (68.2 ± 1.9 kDa) and tetramer (91.6 ± 2.9 kDa) molecules.	9095	9331
28398555	The oligomeric fraction represented more than 57% of the total proteins.	9332	9404
28398555	As with the parent protein hippocalcin, the hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) proteins were monodisperse in the absence of calcium with a size consistent with a monomer (23.2 ± 0.2 kDa on average) and formed oligomers in a calcium-dependent manner (Fig.	9405	9665
28398555	3B).	5718	5722
28398555	The calcium-dependent oligomerisation was also observed in in vitro crosslink (BS3 or DSP) experiments (Supplementary Material, Fig.	9671	9803
28398555	S5A–C).	9804	9811
28398555	Indeed, densitometry quantification after DSP crosslinking on hippocalcin purified protein showed that calcium significantly increased the polydispersity of the sample (from 24 ± 3% oligomers in the absence of calcium, to 52 ± 1% oligomers in the presence of calcium).	9812	10080
28398555	Treatment with DTT after DSP crosslinking cleaved the oligomers back into monomers, as expected (Supplementary Material, Fig.	10081	10206
28398555	S5B).	10207	10212
28398555	Oligomerisation also occurred at low calcium concentrations (50 μM) (Supplementary Material, Fig.	10213	10310
28398555	S5C).	10311	10316
28398555	Intracellular crosslink in N2A cells using DSP reproduced the calcium-dependent oligomerisation of hippocalcin, in a physiological context (Supplementary Material, Fig.	10317	10485
28398555	S5D).	10486	10491
28398555	Oligomerisation upon calcium binding was also observed for the disease-causing mutants hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) (Fig.	10492	10625
28398555	3B, Supplementary Material, Fig.	10626	10658
28398555	S5A,B,D).	10659	10668
28398555	However, the mutations significantly decreased the oligomer formation when compared to the wild-type protein (Supplementary Material, Fig.	10669	10807
28398555	S5B).	10207	10212
28398555	Indeed, the fraction of oligomers measured by MALS was reduced from 57% for the wild-type protein to 19–28% for the mutants (Fig.	10814	10943
28398555	3B).	5718	5722
28398555	Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques, we demonstrated the calcium-dependent oligomerisation of hippocalcin and a strong defect in oligomer formation for the dystonia-causing mutants.	10949	11156
28398555	Hippocalcin wild-type has been shown to affect cellular response to membrane depolarisation and it has been suggested that hippocalcin might play a role in regulating voltage-dependent calcium channels (5).	11157	11363
28398555	However, there is yet no direct evidence of hippocalcin interacting with VGCCs.	11364	11443
28398555	In this study, we investigate the interaction of hippocalcin with P/Q- and N-type channels as other NCS family members have been shown to bind to these channel subtypes (27–29), thought to be drivers of synaptic transmission (30).	11444	11674
28398555	We demonstrate, using purified proteins and western blots, that hippocalcin wild-type and mutants bound to both P/Q- (residues 1898-2035) and N-type (residues 1836-1983) VGCC fragment proteins whereas no significant binding to the SUMO protein control was detected (Fig.	11675	11945
28398555	4A).	6308	6312
28398555	In addition, after densitometry quantification using biotinylated BSA as loading control, we observed that both mutants also bound to the channel fragments and that hippocalcin(A190T) interaction with VGCCs was altered (Fig.	11951	12175
28398555	4B).	7080	7084
28398555	Indeed in the absence of calcium, hippocalcin(A190T) presented increased interaction with N-type channels when compared to the wild-type.	12181	12318
28398555	In the presence of low μM calcium hippocalcin(A190T) showed significantly enhanced binding to both P/Q- and N-type calcium channels, compared to the parent protein.	12319	12483
28398555	We have been unable to confirm this interaction for native channel subunits using immunoprecipation techniques as an effective anti-hippocalcin antiserum is currently not available.	12484	12665
28398555	Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with mCherry-tagged hippocalcin constructs and loaded with Fluo-4 calcium dye.	12666	12790
28398555	Expression levels were verified by Western blot using actin, calnexin and tubulin as loading controls and did not show any difference between the wild-type and the mutants (Supplementary Material, Fig.	12791	12992
28398555	S6).	12993	12997
28398555	After 50 mM KCl stimulation to depolarise the cells, calcium signals were monitored on a spinning-disk confocal microscope (Fig.	12998	13126
28398555	5).	1015	1018
28398555	Cells transfected with hippocalcin wild-type showed 27% increase in intracellular fluorescence after KCl depolarisation.	13131	13251
28398555	For the dystonia-causing mutants hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T), calcium influx upon stimulation significantly increased to 51% and 62%, respectively, compared to hippocalcin wild-type (Fig.	13252	13452
28398555	5B).	10208	10212
28398555	We set out to determine which type of calcium channel mediated the increased calcium influx by testing the effect of calcium channel blockers on cells expressing wild type hippocalcin or hippocalcin(A190T).	13458	13664
28398555	For both hippocalcin- and hippocalcin(A190T)-transfected cells, incubation with ω-agatoxin IVA (P/Q-type channel blocker) did not significantly affect calcium influx upon KCl-induced depolarisation (Fig.	13665	13868
28398555	5C).	10312	10316
28398555	However, we observed a large decrease of the calcium response in the presence of ω-conotoxin MVIIC (P/Q- and N-type channel blocker) and ω-conotoxin GVIA (N-type channel blocker).	13874	14053
28398555	For both hippocalcin and hippocalcin(A190T), fluorescence calcium signal decreased by ∼60% in the presence of ω-conotoxin MVIIC and ∼50% in the presence of ω-conotoxin GVIA.	14054	14227
28398555	These results suggest that the increased calcium response due to hippocalcin(A190T) expression was predominantly due to calcium entry through N-type calcium channels.	14228	14394
28398555	After rapid calcium photorelease, hippocalcin translocation to the preinuclear region of the cells was observed (Supplementary Material, Fig.	14395	14536
28398555	S7A).	14537	14542
28398555	This was, as previously demonstrated by O’Callaghan and coworkers, to be due to translocation to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (10,31).	14543	14678
28398555	Time-courses of Fluo-4 (calcium indicator) and hippocalcin fluorescence revealed that translocation is calcium-dependent and that it occurred rapidly after calcium rise (Supplementary Material, Fig.	14679	14877
28398555	S7B).	14878	14883
28398555	Photocleavage of NP-EGTA to rapidly release intracellular calcium also induced translocation of hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) mutants to the TGN.	14884	15040
28398555	Dysregulation in calcium homeostasis and signalling have been implicated in many aspects of neuropathology, neurodegeneration and psychiatric disorders (32–36).	15041	15201
28398555	In this paper, we investigated the role of mutations in hippocalcin, a neuronal calcium sensor involved in DYT2 dystonia disease.	15202	15331
28398555	Using a combination of biophysical, structural biology and cell biology techniques, we demonstrated that the disease-causing mutations T71N and A190T have an effect on key functional properties of hippocalcin.	15332	15541
28398555	In many cases disease-causing mutations can affect protein folding and/or reduce protein stability leading to a loss of expression levels.	15542	15680
28398555	This was not the case for the DYT2 hippocalcin mutations.	15681	15738
28398555	Biophysical experiments showed that all hippocalcin mutants had similar CD spectrum with no altered protein stability when compared to the wild-type protein.	15739	15896
28398555	Heat-denaturation studies revealed that hippocalcin is a very thermostable protein, as observed for other calcium-binding protein such as VILIP-1 with unfolding temperature Tm > 110 °C (37), Calmodulin and Troponin C (Tm > 90 °C) (38).	15897	16132
28398555	The Ca2+-binding data were performed using unmyristoylated hippocalcin.	16133	16204
28398555	There is no evidence available on whether myristoylation affects the Ca2+ binding to hippocalcin.	16205	16302
28398555	While we cannot exclude minor effects, analysis of the unmyristoylated hippocalcin proteins should allow us to detect any differences in the intrinsic Ca2+ affinity of the wild-type compared to the mutants.	16303	16509
28398555	Equilibrium calcium-binding titrations showed that hippocalcin has a high affinity for calcium binding (Kd = 65 nM) with positive cooperativity (n = 1.4) as observed for other NCS proteins such as VILIP-1 (37), recoverin (39,40) and neurocalcin delta (39,41).	16510	16769
28398555	Surprisingly, mutation hippocalcin(T71N), located within the second EF-hand, did not alter the overall calcium- binding affinity but significantly reduced the calcium-binding cooperativity.	16770	16959
28398555	Previous studies on VILIP-1 and recoverin revealed that two calcium ions bind sequentially, first at EF-3 (high affinity) to facilitate cooperative calcium binding at EF-2 (low affinity) (37,40).	16960	17155
28398555	Because EF-2 has low affinity for calcium (μM), mutations in this domain in hippocalcin may not have any significant effect on the overall dissociation constant.	17156	17317
28398555	The equilibrium calcium-binding titrations for hippocalcin and hippocalcin(A190T) show that a calcium concentration of ∼1 μM is sufficient to get the protein fully Ca2+-bound.	17318	17493
28398555	However, the decrease in cooperativity observed for hippocalcin(T71N) suggests that at low μM [Ca2+], hippocalcin(T71N) will only be partially Ca2+-bound which then could affect regulation of downstream calcium signalling cascades in stimulated cells.	17494	17745
28398555	Hippocalcin shares common structural features of NCS proteins of ∼200 residue chain containing 4 EF-hand motifs and an N-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence.	17746	17910
28398555	The three dimensional structures are known for NCS-1 (42,43), recoverin (11,44) and neurocalcin delta (45).	17911	18018
28398555	Here we provide the first crystal structure for calcium-bound hippocalcin, hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) with a resolution of 2.4–3.0 Å.	18019	18166
28398555	There is no significant difference between the three structures.	18167	18231
28398555	However, comparison of hippocalcin crystal structure with neurocalcin delta and NCS-1 revealed a different orientation of the C-terminus part of the protein.	18232	18389
28398555	In NCS-1 the C-terminal tail appears to be able to sit in the hydrophobic groove in the absence of ligand and there is evidence to show that this tail acts as an auto-regulatory mechanism to control target binding (46–48); it is not clear at this stage if the C-terminal tail of hippocalcin serves the same function but it also sits in the hydrophobic groove in observed crystal packing (Supplementary Material, Fig.	18390	18806
28398555	S4C).	8207	8212
28398555	We demonstrated that hippocalcin oligomerises upon calcium binding with molar masses consistent with dimers, trimers and tetramers.	18813	18944
28398555	We showed by in vitro crosslinking experiments that 50 μM Ca2+ were sufficient to trigger oligomer formation.	18945	19054
28398555	In addition, we demonstrated that hippocalcin oligomerises in cells stimulated with ionomycin, which raises the intracellular calcium to ∼1 μM (49,50).	19055	19206
28398555	Calcium concentration at a mouth of an open calcium channel is predicted to be tens to hundreds of micromolar (51,52), suggesting that hippocalcin may bind to the channel as an oligomer.	19207	19393
28398555	VILIP-1 and neurocalcin delta, neuronal calcium sensors from the same family, also forms an equilibrium mixture of monomeric and dimeric protein species (37,53,54), in contrast to NCS-1 which is a monomeric protein (26).	19394	19614
28398555	Disease-causing mutants of hippocalcin showed a marked oligomerisation defect suggesting that EF-2 and the C-terminus domain are important for dimerization.	19615	19771
28398555	In addition, crystal structure of dimeric neurocalcin delta (PDB 1BJF) suggest an important role of the EF-hands in the oligomerisation of the protein, which we cannot confirm from our crystal structures.	19772	19976
28398555	Upon intracellular calcium elevation, calcium sensor proteins undergo a conformational change enabling interactions with partners and regulation of various calcium signalling pathways (28).	19977	20166
28398555	Hippocalcin exhibits a dynamic calcium association in response to calcium increase and neuronal activity through a Ca2+/myristoyl switch mechanism (11).	20167	20319
28398555	The change in conformation induces its binding to cellular membranes where it can interact with target proteins (10–12,55).	20320	20443
28398555	Even though the bulk of hippocalcin becomes translocated to the TGN, a proportion also translocates to the plasma membrane (10,31), where it can interact with VGGCs.	20444	20609
28398555	The dystonia-causing mutation T71N and A190T did not alter the translocation process.	20610	20695
28398555	Entry of extracellular calcium into synaptic terminals through VGCCs is the driving force for exocytosis of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles.	20696	20841
28398555	Hippocalcin has been implicated as a calcium sensor in long-term depression and the gating of channels underlying a slow after-hyperpolarisation current (16,21,56).	20842	21006
28398555	However, no direct interaction with VGCCs channels has been shown.	21007	21073
28398555	In this paper, we demonstrated that hippocalcin directly binds to the α-subunit of VGCCs of P/Q- and N-type, which suggest a role of hippocalcin in neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity.	21074	21271
28398555	Hippocalcin(A190T) showed increased binding to both channels compared to the wild-type protein, suggesting that the mutation in the C-terminus region is important for target interaction, as previously shown for other NCS proteins (46,57).	21272	21510
28398555	We demonstrated that hippocalcin can bind to the VGCCs in the absence of calcium, suggesting a pre-association to the pore-forming α-subunit of VGCCs as observed for apo-CaM (58–60).	21511	21693
28398555	In cells transfected with hippocalcin mutants, we observed a significant increase in the calcium response to KCl depolarisation, compared to wild-type hippocalcin.	21694	21857
28398555	Application of N-type calcium channel blockers (ω-conotoxins MVIIC and GVIA) dramatically reduced calcium influx and the increased calcium signal due to hippocalcin(A190T), whereas the P/Q channel blocker ω-agatoxin IVA had no effect.	21858	22092
28398555	These findings suggest that the effect of hippocalcin mutants on calcium signalling is driven by interaction and regulation of N-type calcium channels.	22093	22244
28398555	Similarly, other calcium-binding proteins such as CaM, CaBP1 and the NCS family members NCS-1 and VILIP-2 have been reported to associate with the α-subunit cytoplasmic regulatory domain of VGCCs of P/Q-, N- and L-type to modulate channel opening and therefore synaptic plasticity (27–29,61).	22245	22537
28398555	The binding to VGCCs of the mutants and the increased intracellular calcium influx in stimulated cells could contribute to a dysregulation of subsequent signalling pathways and result in dramatic physiological alterations.	22538	22760
28398555	In summary, we demonstrated that hippocalcin forms oligomers upon calcium binding and directly interacts with VGCCs.	22761	22877
28398555	The dystonia-causing mutations did not affect protein stability or folding.	22878	22953
28398555	In common for both T71N and A190T mutants was an impaired calcium-dependent oligomerisation and increased intracellular calcium influx after KCl depolarisation.	22954	23114
28398555	These functional alterations suggest that the observed defect in hippocalcin-dependent calcium signalling would have important physiological consequences that contribute to the onset of the disease.	23115	23313
28398555	A series of site-directed mutations were performed on pHippo-EYFP expressing human hippocalcin following the QuikChange protocol (Agilent Technologies) to generate pHPCA-EYFP constructs using the following primers: T71N, 5’-CGAGCATGTCTTCCGCAATTTTGACACCAACAGCG-3’; A190T, 5’-GCGATCCCAGCAGCACTTCCCAGTTCTCG-3’; and confirmed by DNA sequencing (DNA sequencing and Services, University of Dundee).	23314	23706
28398555	For multi-color imaging, hippocalcin genes were subcloned from pHPCA-EYFP into pEGFP-N1 or pmCherry-N1 vectors by restriction-ligation (NheI/XmaI), generating pHPCA-EGFP and pHPCA-mCherry constructs.	23707	23906
28398555	For protein expression and purification, hippocalcin genes were amplified by PCR from pHPCA-EYFP vectors using the following primers: sense, 5’-CTATGAATTCATGGGCAAGCAGAATAGC-3’; antisense: 5’-CTATCTCGAGTCAGAACTGGGAAGCGCTGCTG-3’, and cloned by restriction-ligation into pGEX-6P1 (EcoRI/XhoI).	23907	24197
28398555	Residues 1898-2035 from rat P/Q-type calcium channel α−subunit (NM_012918) were amplified by PCR from GST-PQ (62) using the following primers: sense, 5’-GGTCTCTAGGTAAGTCCACGGCCTGACAG-3’; antisense, 5’-ATATCTCGAGCTAGGGGAGGTAGTGTTCGCT-3’; and subcloned into pE-SUMO by restriction-ligation (BsaI/XhoI).	24198	24498
28398555	DNA fragment encoding residues 1836-1983 from mouse N-type calcium channel α−subunit (NM_001042528) were obtained from GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the following primers: sense, 5’-GGTCTCTAGGTAAACCTGACGAGATGACAG-3’; antisense, 5’-ATATCTCGAGCTACCCAGGCTGGGGCTCCCC-3’; and cloned into pE-SUMO by restriction-ligation (BsaI/XhoI).	24499	24837
28398555	The P/Q- fragment was chosen according to previous work (62) and the N-type fragment was designed as the region with greatest sequence homology to the P/Q- fragment.	24838	25003
28398555	Cells were cultured in DMEM containing non-essential amino-acids (Life Technologies), penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml, 100 μg/ml, respectively), at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in.	25004	25190
28398555	Mouse N2A neuroblastoma culture medium was supplemented with 5% Heat inactivated FBS (Life Technologies) whereas SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% Heat inactivated FBS (Life Technologies).	25191	25422
28398555	SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were differentiated in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 1% Heat inactivated FBS (Life Technologies) and 10 μM retinoic acid for 3–5 days.	25423	25583
28398555	Cells were plated on 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek) and allowed 24 h to adhere before transfection with FuGENE HD (Promega) following the manufacturer’s recommendations.	25584	25765
28398555	Cells were maintained for 12–24 h before being used in experiments.	25766	25833
28398555	Hippocalcin.	25834	25846
28398555	Hippocalcin wild-type and mutant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) STAR cells overnight at 20 °C after addition of 0.5 mM IPTG.	25847	25989
28398555	Cells were resuspended in 50 mM Na+-HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 containing EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and lysed by 1-h incubation with 1 mg/ml of lysosyme and sonication on ice (VibraCell, Jencons PLS).	25990	26219
28398555	Lysates were incubated with benzonase 1 h on ice and clarified by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000g.	26220	26319
28398555	Clarified lysates were purified using 5 ml of GST resin (GST agarose, ThermoFisher Scientific) equilibrated with 50 mM Na+-HEPES, 200 mM NaCl and GST-tag was cleaved using the PreScission protease.	26320	26517
28398555	The purified cleaved protein was further purified on an AKTA Purifier using a Superdex 200 (26/60) gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris pH 7.5.	26518	26675

28398555	VGCCs.	11437	11443
28398555	SUMO, SUMO-P/Q- and SUMO-N-type fragment proteins were expressed as described above.	26775	26859
28398555	Clarified lysates were purified using 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) equilibrated with 50 mM Na+-HEPES, 200 mM NaCl and eluted with 500 mM imidazole.	26860	27008
28398555	Fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.	27009	27055
28398555	Purity of the eluted fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris, NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer, Life Technologies) and concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at 280 nm (ε0 (hippocalcin) = 20 065 M−1 cm−1), (ε0 (P/Q) = 27 515 M−1 cm−1), (ε0 (N) = 28 028 M−1 cm−1), (ε0 (SUMO) = 12 010 M−1 cm−1) (Nanodrop Lite, Thermo Scientific).	27056	27412
28398555	Molar extinction coefficient was calculated from the amino acid composition using ExPASy/ProtParam program (10,63).	27413	27528
28398555	Hippocalcin proteins or BSA (200 μg/ml = 10 μM) were incubated with 100-fold molar excess of 6-(biotinamidocaproyamindo) N-hydroxysuccimide ester (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature.	27529	27711
28398555	Excess biotin reagent was removed by extensive dialysis against 20 mM Na+-HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5.	27712	27813
28398555	Biotinylated proteins were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.	27814	27872

28398555	Intrinsic fluorescence was measured at 280 nm excitation and 340 nm emission wavelengths in a 1 ml quartz cuvette using a JASCO FP-6300 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco) at 20 °C.	28014	28186
28398555	All titrations were performed at least in triplicates and expressed as mean ± SEM.	28187	28269
28398555	Data were corrected for dilution, normalised and Ca2+ dissociation constant (Kd) and cooperativity (n) were obtained by fitting to the Hill equation (Prism GraphPad 6).	28270	28438
28398555	[Ca2+] were calculated using the two-chelators Maxchelator program (25) and verified by OGB-1 titration.	28439	28543
28398555	Data were fitted to a one-site specific binding equation using Prism GraphPad 6 software, giving a Kd for OGB-1 for Ca2+ of 132 ± 11 nM, similar to the value reported by Molecular Probes (Kd = 170 nM, in the absence of Mg2+).	28544	28769
28398555	Crystals for hippocalcin, hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin (A190T) proteins were grown at 20 °C using the sitting drop vapour diffusion method at a concentration of 50 mg/ml.	28770	28945

28398555	Structure for wild-type protein was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (66), using NCS-1 (PDB 5AEQ) as a search model, structures of mutants were refined starting from wild-type structure using REFMAC5 (67) in the CCP4 (68) programme suite with isotropic B-factors, NCS restrains.	29347	29636
28398555	TLS refinement was used during the last stages.	29637	29684
28398555	Rebuilding of the model between refinement cycles and adding water molecules was performed in COOT (69).	29685	29789
28398555	The quality of the models was assessed on MolProbity (70) server.	29790	29855
28398555	For wild-type protein, residues from 6-188/7-189 for A190T mutant from 6-189/7-190; for T71N mutant from 6-188/7-190, were clearly visible for both chains A and E, respectively, in spite of high Wilson B-factor for all three data sets.	29856	30091

19624920	Prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), i.e., TB resistant to at least rifampin and isoniazid, is increasing, particularly in some areas of Europe (1).	0	168
19624920	From 1999 through 2002, the median prevalence of MDR TB in new case-patients was at critical levels (>6.5%) in specific regions of the world, including the Baltic states and other eastern European countries (2).	169	380
19624920	In 2004, the Russian Federation, China, and India accounted for 62% of the estimated global MDR TB cases (3).	381	490
19624920	The increases in prevalence and incidence of MDR TB are most likely caused by inadequate treatment regimens (4).	491	603
19624920	Recently, public health awareness about MDR TB has been reenforced by the occurrence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB outbreaks associated with HIV, particularly in South Africa (5,6).	604	794
19624920	Surveillance of drug resistance, based on annual case reporting of drug susceptibility tests, has been ongoing in Europe since 1998 and includes annual reporting of MDR TB cases after the start of treatment (7).	795	1006
19624920	In the 1990s, molecular methods became available and have allowed researchers to study issues in the epidemiology of TB (8).	1007	1131
19624920	Strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing genotype, which constitute a group of genetically closely related strains (9), have been associated with high levels of drug resistance in countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU), including Latvia (10) and Estonia (11); these strains have been of low prevalence (6%–7%) in Western Europe (12).	1132	1478
19624920	Public health officials are concerned about possible emergence and transmission of MDR TB strains across Europe (cross-border migration), but no system is in place to identify whether MDR TB strains are shared (clustered) among European countries.	1479	1726
19624920	Risk factors for possible clustering have yet to be determined.	1727	1790
19624920	When the drug resistance surveillance project began, data on MDR TB cases were reported in aggregated format at the European level and could not be linked to molecular data identified from individual MDR TB cases.	1791	2004
19624920	Also, a need existed to further identify the association between Beijing genotype strains or M. tuberculosis strains of other genotypes and MDR TB in Europe.	2005	2162
19624920	Molecular surveillance of MDR TB was developed in Europe in recent years, first, in a pilot phase as part of the European Concerted Action on Tuberculosis project and, prospectively, since 2005, with the MDR TB project presented in this paper (13).	2163	2411
19624920	The objectives of this project were to identify molecular clusters of MDR TB cases reported in >1 European country, to describe epidemiologic risk factors associated with MDR TB cases, and to initiate cluster investigations at the national level to prevent cross-border transmission.	2412	2695
19624920	In this article, based on surveillance data, we describe the main epidemiologic and demographic characteristics of MDR TB cases reported from January 2003 through June 2007 in 24 European countries.	2696	2894
19624920	We also describe characteristics of the main European clusters and identify risk factors for clustering and association with the Beijing strain of M. tuberculosis.	2895	3058
19624920	In 2005, all 53 countries of the World Health Organization’s European region were invited to participate in the MDR TB surveillance project by Euro TB and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).	3059	3282
19624920	Countries were encouraged to provide both epidemiologic and genotyping data on MDR TB cases reported since January 1, 2003.	3283	3406
19624920	However, countries that could provide only epidemiologic data were also included in the surveillance project.	3407	3516
19624920	National surveillance institutions sent quarterly updates of individual and anonymous data on MDR TB cases reported since 2003 to EuroTB, according to a standardized data file specification (www.eurotb.org/mdr_tb_surveillance/pdf/DFS_NSI_short.pdf).	3517	3766
19624920	Each patient had a unique record identifier by country.	3767	3822
19624920	Common definitions of variables were used by participating countries, including demographic, clinical, and genotyping information.	3823	3953
19624920	In 18 countries, the country of origin was defined as the country of birth.	3954	4029
19624920	Because of confidentiality constraints, country of birth was not reported for some countries.	4030	4123
19624920	Country of citizenship was used to qualify the origin of patients for 2 countries.	4124	4206
19624920	Either country of birth or country of citizenship was used in 3 countries, and information on geographic origin was unavailable in 1 country.	4207	4348
19624920	A patient had to be reported again (with a new identifier) when a new MDR M. tuberculosis isolate was obtained >24 months after the previously reported MDR TB isolate.	4349	4516
19624920	However, the possibility of a case being reported twice in the same country or in 2 countries was low.	4517	4619
19624920	National laboratories sent insertion sequence (IS) 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns from available MDR TB strains collected since 2003 to the RIVM every 3 months, either as a Bionumerics bundle (Applied Maths, Sint-Maartens-Latem, Belgium) or as a scanned image (14).	4620	4916
19624920	To be included in the project, laboratories had to perform drug susceptibility testing and participate in an international quality assurance program.	4917	5066
19624920	For quality assurance, either participating laboratories represented supranational reference laboratories of the World Health Organization and the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and participated in the yearly proficiency testing for isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol (15,16), or laboratories had their external quality assurance conducted by such a reference laboratory.	5067	5480
19624920	For 1 country, drug susceptibility testing was performed in a laboratory abroad.	5481	5561
19624920	More details (e.g., on drug susceptibility test methods) can be found in the 2006 EuroTB report (17).	5562	5663
19624920	European cluster information was communicated by the RIVM (Bilthoven, the Netherlands) to EuroTB on a quarterly basis.	5664	5782
19624920	The final database was maintained by EuroTB and included 3 sections: A) demographic and clinical variables, B) cluster information on the basis of molecular patterns at the country level, and C) European cluster information.	5783	6007
19624920	Data from sections A and B were matched according to a patient code; data from sections B and C were matched using the strain code attributed at the national level.	6008	6172
19624920	IS6110 RFLP was the recommended genotyping method (18) to report IS6110 RFLP patterns to RIVM.	6173	6267
19624920	For most countries, genotyping was performed locally; for 2 countries, genotyping was performed at RIVM.	6268	6372
19624920	A European cluster was defined as >2 MDR TB cases with M. tuberculosis isolates that shared identical IS6110 RFLP patterns in >2 countries (18).	6373	6517
19624920	A national cluster included cases diagnosed in a single country.	6518	6582
19624920	Determination of a national cluster (a cluster including MDR TB cases diagnosed in 1 participating country) could be based on 3 typing methods: IS6110 RFLP typing (18), spoligotyping (19), and/or typing that used mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units with variable numbers of tandem repeats (20).	6583	6885
19624920	In each laboratory, quality control of the molecular typing practices and computer-assisted analysis was included as described in the standardized methods (14).	6886	7046
19624920	The DNA fingerprint patterns of MDR TB strains received at the RIVM were submitted to the molecular database managed by the RIVM (MDRTBase) by using the Bionumerics software (Applied Maths), and the database manager performed a quality check.	7047	7289
19624920	The IS6110 RFLP patterns newly added to the MDRTBase were then compared with all other patterns stored in this database.	7290	7410
19624920	The MDR TB strains were classified as clustered (included in a European cluster) or “unique” (not included in a European cluster).	7411	7541
19624920	In addition to specifying European cluster reports, the database manager also specified strains belonging to the Beijing genotype family of M. tuberculosis by compariing them with the 19 reference RFLP patterns of Beijing strains described by Kremer et al. (21).	7542	7804
19624920	Factors associated with clustering or infection with a Beijing genotype strain were determined by the unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression model using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).	7805	8007
19624920	The explanatory variables were demographic (sex, age, origin) and clinical (pulmonary vs. extrapulmonary TB, TB history) characteristics of MDR TB cases.	8008	8161
19624920	XDR TB was studied as an explanatory variable for patients with drug susceptibility results meeting the definition of XDR TB (22) in both cluster and strain analyses.	8162	8328
19624920	The proportion of clustering among Beijing strains was compared with the proportion of clustering among strains of other genotypes.	8329	8460
19624920	Because of the limited numbers per category, “unknown” categories were removed from all variables included in the model, as was the age category “<15 years” and the category “other” for the variable country of origin.	8461	8678
19624920	Analyses, including clustering and the XDR variable, were performed in the univariate model only because of the variables’ strong association with origin in the Baltic states (χ2 97.1, p<0.001) and other countries of the FSU (χ2 20.5, p<0.001).	8679	8923
19624920	Twenty-four countries from the European Union and western Europe plus Croatia and Macedonia participated in the MDR TB project (Table 1).	8924	9061
19624920	Epidemiologic data on 2,494 MDR TB cases reported from January 2003 through July 2007 were sent to EuroTB.	9062	9168
19624920	The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) reported 1,616 cases, representing 65% of total cases.	9169	9274
19624920	In some countries, epidemiologic data were reported for <3 years (Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Spain).	9275	9389
19624920	Laboratories from 19 countries sent 672 IS6110 RFLP patterns to the RIVM, 593 of which also had epidemiologic information and were linked to the epidemiologic database maintained by EuroTB (Table 1; Figure 1).	9390	9599
19624920	Linkage of molecular and epidemiologic data was not possible for data from the United Kingdom and for data on a few cases from 6 other countries.	9600	9745
19624920	The average proportion of MDR TB cases documented with both epidemiologic and genotyping data in 18 countries was 593/1,523 (39%), varying from 9% to 100%.	9746	9901
19624920	After we removed data from 2 countries with low data completeness for genotypes (Germany and Lithuania), we found that the average proportion of MDR TB cases with both epidemiologic and genotyping data was 68%.	9902	10112
19624920	Individual data on second-line drug tests for 2 to 5 second-line drugs included in the XDR TB definition (22) were reported for 1,302 cases by 16 countries from January 2003 through July 2007 (Figure 1).	10113	10316
19624920	Of the 672 MDR TB strains with IS6110 RFLP patterns reported, 288 (43%) were identified as belonging to European clusters (Table 2; Figure 1).	10317	10459
19624920	The proportion of MDR TB strains included in European clusters was <20% in 7 countries (Croatia, France, Italy, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).	10460	10626
19624920	A large proportion (38%) of the RFLP patterns submitted to the molecular database originated from Estonia, where 80% (183/228) of the strains clustered.	10627	10779
19624920	The number of MDR TB strains identified in national clusters was 170 among 330 strains (51%) reported in 13 of the 19 countries with genotyping data.	10780	10929
19624920	In these 13 countries, the proportion of intercountry clustering was 28%.	10930	11003
19624920	Eighteen distinct European clusters (range 2–175 cases) were identified in 16 countries (Table 3).	11004	11102
19624920	Clusters E0051, E0054, E0055, E0057, E0063, E0066, and E0069 were characterized by Beijing genotype strains, comprising 242/288 (84%) clustered MDR TB cases.	11103	11260
19624920	The characteristics of the 4 largest clusters are described below.	11261	11327
19624920	The largest cluster, E0051, consisted of 175 MDR TB cases reported in 12 countries.	11328	11411
19624920	Of these 175 cases, 148 (85%) were reported in Estonia.	11412	11467
19624920	No significant differences were found between case-patients included in cluster E0051 and those included in other clusters for sex, age category, TB history, and XDR TB (χ2 test, p>0.05).	11468	11655
19624920	A large proportion (119/148, 81%) of the case-patients reported in Estonia also originated from this country (Figure 2).	11656	11776
19624920	The proportion of case-patients who had never had TB (either no diagnosis or no treatment) was high (90/148, 61%).	11777	11891
19624920	Thirty-three cases (22%) were identified as XDR TB.	11892	11943
19624920	Eight of the 175 case-patients in cluster E0051 were reported in Israel, and all 8 originated from FSU countries (6 from the Russian Federation, 1 from Georgia, and 1 from Kazakhstan); all were pulmonary patients and alive at the time of diagnosis.	11944	12192
19624920	No information was available on previous TB diagnosis or treatment.	12193	12260
19624920	None of the 8 MDR TB cases reported in Israel were XDR.	12261	12316
19624920	The 6 case-patients reported in Lithuania also originated from that country.	12317	12393
19624920	Five of these case-patients were known to have had a previous diagnosis of TB; XDR TB was not diagnosed in these case-patients.	12394	12521
19624920	The 3 case-patients reported in Belgium originated from the Russian Federation (n = 2) and from Georgia.	12522	12626
19624920	Their TB history was unknown.	12627	12656
19624920	For the 2 case-patients reported in Finland, origin was unknown.	12657	12721
19624920	One of the 2 case-patients reported in Switzerland was from Armenia; the origin of the other case-patient was unknown.	12722	12840
19624920	The 2 case-patients reported in the Netherlands and Sweden originated from the Russian Federation.	12841	12939
19624920	Twenty-eight of the 33 case-patients included in the second largest cluster, E0054, had a known origin.	12940	13043
19624920	All but 1 (from Israel) originated from FSU countries (17 originating and reported in Estonia).	13044	13139
19624920	Eighteen of the 22 case-patients included in cluster E0055 had a known origin; 13 were reported in Estonia, 2 in Israel, 1 in Lithuania, 1 in the Netherlands, and 1 in Sweden.	13140	13315
19624920	All originated from FSU countries, except the case-patient in the Netherlands, who originated from Sri Lanka.	13316	13425
19624920	Cluster E0053 (non-Beijing) included 10 cases with known origin.	13426	13490
19624920	Five case-patients originated from the country of report, and 5 others originated from Africa (2 from Côte d’Ivoire, 2 from Nigeria, and 1 from Mali).	13491	13641
19624920	Because this cluster was characterized by an M. tuberculosis strain containing 4 copies of IS6110, it could possibly be subdivided if additional DNA typing methods are used.	13642	13815
19624920	As indicated in Table 3, two other clusters were also caused by low–copy-number strains: clusters E0070 (4 cases) and E0067 (3 cases).	13816	13950
19624920	Risk factors for clustering were analyzed for 521 cases documented with both molecular and epidemiologic data reported by 16 countries.	13951	14086
19624920	Lithuania and Germany were excluded from this analysis due to incomplete genotyping data.	14087	14176
19624920	Among these 521 cases, 250 (48%) belonged to European clusters and 271 (52%) had isolates with unique DNA fingerprint patterns (Figure 1).	14177	14315
19624920	The results of univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with clustering are presented in Table 4.	14316	14457
19624920	Univariate analysis showed that origin from the Baltic states or other FSU countries, age category 45–64 years, and pulmonary tuberculosis were significantly associated with clustering.	14458	14643
19624920	Among these variables, only origin from the Baltic states (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 25.1, confidence interval [CI] 9.9–64.0) or other FSU countries (adjusted OR 8.7, 95% CI 3.2–23.2) remained strongly associated with clustering in the multivariate model.	14644	14898
19624920	The proportion of XDR TB cases was significantly higher among clustered strains than among unique strains (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.9–8.7).	14899	15030
19624920	Analysis to identify Beijing genotype strains was possible for 500 of the 521 MDR TB strains with both epidemiologic and genotyping data (data from Germany and Lithuania were excluded).	15031	15216
19624920	Of these 500 strains, 284 (57%) were identified as the Beijing genotype and 216 (43%) were non-Beijing genotypes (Figure 1).	15217	15341
19624920	Univariate analysis demonstrated that origin from the Baltic states or other FSU countries, age categories 45–64 years and >65 years, and pulmonary TB were significantly associated with strains of the Beijing genotype (Table 5).	15342	15570
19624920	Among these variables, origin from Baltic states and other FSU countries remained strongly associated with Beijing genotype strains in the multivariate analysis.	15571	15732
19624920	Proportions of clustering and XDR TB were significantly higher among Beijing strains than among other genotype strains, (OR 19.6, 95% CI 12.3–31.2, and OR 5.5, 95% CI 2.1–14.3, respectively).	15733	15924
19624920	After exclusion of the largest cluster, E0051 (n = 166 cases with epidemiologic data), characterized by a Beijing strain, the association between clustering and the Beijing genotype was 5× less but still quite strong for 334 MDR TB cases with genotyping data (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.7–7.6).	15925	16209
19624920	Molecular surveillance of MDR TB cases in Europe showed several large molecular clusters (also including XDR TB cases).	16210	16329
19624920	The largest cluster (175 cases) was mainly localized in Estonia (information to be completed for Lithuania and Latvia).	16330	16449
19624920	Origin from the Baltic states and other FSU countries was strongly associated with clustering.	16450	16544
19624920	The proportion of XDR TB was high among clustered strains.	16545	16603
19624920	The high proportion of MDR TB case-patients without reported TB history suggests circulation of primary MDR strains in these countries.	16604	16739
19624920	Three of the 18 European clusters were caused by low-copy strains and may represent false clustering.	16740	16841
19624920	However, because these clusters consisted of only a few cases, the proportion of European clustering found in this project (43%) is probably only slightly (<3%) overestimated.	16842	17017
19624920	A high proportion (55%) of genotyped MDR TB strains belonged to the Beijing genotype family.	17018	17110
19624920	Strains of the Beijing genotype family were mainly reported for case-patients originating from the Baltic states and other FSU countries, where the prevalence of this genotype is also high in the general population (12).	17111	17331
19624920	The 3 largest clusters were characterized by strains of the Beijing genotype family (84% of the clustered MDR TB cases).	17332	17452
19624920	Two hypotheses may explain the occurrence of the large clusters in Europe that were detected in this project.	17453	17562
19624920	The first hypothesis is direct person-to-person transmission.	17563	17624
19624920	This hypothesis can be verified by cluster investigation of the cases (by using contact-tracing data if available) in countries with cases reported in clusters.	17625	17785
19624920	Verifying that the isolates, especially of the largest clusters, represent a single strain is important and can be done by contact investigations and application of an additional typing method such as the newly standardized 24-loci variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing (23).	17786	18067
19624920	The second hypothesis is that genetically highly related strains are responsible for most MDR TB cases in Europe and that only a part of the cases in these clusters is associated with direct person-to-person transmission.	18068	18289
19624920	In both scenarios, conditions could be improved by reinforcing case management (including healthcare access), following up on treatment (especially drug compliance), and increasing social support.	18290	18486
19624920	Adequate infection control measures should also be ensured in healthcare facilities.	18487	18571
19624920	The second scenario underlines that more fundamental research (including detailed research on DNA repair, fitness, and transmissibility) is needed to better understand changes in the bacterial population structure of TB, including the drug-susceptible bacterial population and the ongoing evolutionary development of M. tuberculosis.	18572	18905
19624920	This study was limited by a lack of completeness of the genotyping information and, to a lesser extent, of epidemiologic information.	18906	19039
19624920	Data completeness varied by country.	19040	19076
19624920	For some countries (Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany), the molecular data reported represent only a fraction of the molecular data available because these countries also used alternative DNA typing methods, which were not included in this project.	19077	19348
19624920	Other countries have not yet implemented genotyping.	19349	19401
19624920	Low data completeness in some countries could have affected the proportion of clustered versus unique strains, possibly introducing a bias in the interpretation of the risk factor analysis.	19402	19591
19624920	However, the proportion of MDR TB cases submitted with both epidemiologic and genotyping information from 16 (68%) countries is promising, considering that IS6110 RFLP typing is technically demanding.	19592	19792
19624920	This proportion could probably be improved in the future with the implementation of the recently standardized VNTR typing (23).	19793	19920
19624920	Another limitation of this study was that the identification of MDR TB clusters was based on genotype clustering.	19921	20034
19624920	Therefore, person-to-person transmission could not be proven.	20035	20096
19624920	Ideally, transmission dynamics should be confirmed by conventional contact investigations to link patients to contact persons (24).	20097	20228
19624920	For the main clusters, EuroTB correspondents (from the countries where these clusters have been identified) have received the identification numbers of the clustered MDR TB cases and were able to communicate with colleagues from other countries concerned by the same cluster and exchange information on case histories.	20229	20547
19624920	However, for the largest MDR TB cluster (E0051), a special field investigation of cases would be necessary and would require international support and coordination.	20548	20712
19624920	With the limitations of this study, the findings represented here may not be representative of all MDR TB cases in Europe.	20713	20835
19624920	MDR TB cases included in clusters should be investigated (including contact-tracing data) in countries where they have been identified to increase knowledge about cross-border transmission of MDR TB and XDR TB and to identify routes of transmission and additional risk factors for these transmission pathways.	20836	21145
19624920	The outputs of the investigations will enable interventions that prevent further transmission of MDR TB and XDR TB caused by increasing migration between European countries.	21146	21319
19624920	Standards should be developed to conduct these investigations, including mechanisms to inform concerned national authorities when a molecular cluster is detected and a method for linking epidemiologic and genotyping data at the European level.	21320	21563
19624920	Delays between diagnosis of MDR TB cases and cluster detection should be reduced to facilitate appropriate actions in the concerned countries and to avoid international transmission of these strains.	21564	21763
19624920	International collaboration in cluster investigations should be encouraged Results of this project are preliminary because data are not complete for all countries.	21764	21927
19624920	Since March 2008, European surveillance of MDR TB has been undertaken by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.	21928	22056
19624920	A molecular component has been added in this surveillance program.	22057	22123
19624920	Ideally, this project should be extended to other European Union countries and neighboring countries that could provide genotyping data.	22124	22260
30836660	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a leading public health issue, being the third highest cause of premature mortality (82%), behind AIDS and diabetes mellitus.	0	162
30836660	It has been predicted that about 160 million individuals will be affected by CKD by 2020.	163	252
30836660	Despite the seriousness of this problem, there are not enough therapeutic options for CKD in the clinical setting.	253	367
30836660	Therefore, there is a need for people to find more effective therapeutics to treat CKD and reduce healthcare expenditure.	368	489
30836660	Meanwhile, understanding the mechanisms behind renal interstitial fibrosis is essential for developing therapies to prevent or reverse the progression of CKD.	490	648
30836660	Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) is the final common outcome of CKD and ultimately end-stage renal failure.	649	757
30836660	The histopathology of renal interstitial fibrosis features deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components, loss of tubular cells, accumulation of fibroblasts, and rarefaction of the peritubular microvasculature.	758	978
30836660	The ECM components include collagen I and collagen Ш. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the most important cause of renal interstitial fibrosis and is characterized by renal tubular epithelial cells that acquire mesenchymal phenotypes and myofibroblast functions.	979	1251
30836660	The transition of EMT induces kidney epithelial cells to decrease the expression of adherens junction proteins such as E-cadherin, and strongly induces the expression of fibroblast markers, including vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).	1252	1495
30836660	TGF-β1, snail, and slug are important profibrotic mediators for EMT.	1496	1564
30836660	Renal fibrosis is almost always evolved by the infiltration of inflammatory cells, including increased inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β).	1565	1716
30836660	Although inflammation is an integral part of the host defense mechanism response to injury, nonresolving inflammation is a major driving force in the development of fibrotic disease.	1717	1899
30836660	Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important mediator of inflammation in the kidney.	1900	1983
30836660	It has been reported that TLR4 mediates both pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways in renal fibrosis.	1984	2090
30836660	Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a primary ligand for the TLR4 receptor and studies have shown that LPS induces the aggregation of TLR4 on HK-2 cells, promoting an inflammatory response.	2091	2272
30836660	Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is also known to be important in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) shows attenuated renal injury and inflammation in animal models of CKD.	2273	2524
30836660	These findings reveal that NF-κB plays a pivotal role in the progression of chronic renal inflammation.	2525	2628
30836660	The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, including JNK, Erk, and Ρ38, is involved in the production of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators.	2629	2799
30836660	The MAPK pathway is activated by multiple stimulations, including IL-1β and TNF-α, which cause the translocation of cytoplasmic nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) from nucleus to active NF-κB.	2800	2983
30836660	In addition, MAPK activation has been reported to be involved in the secretion of TGF-β1 and ECM proteins.	2984	3090
30836660	Salidroside (Sal, p-hydroxyphenethyl-bD-glucoside, C14H20O7, structure shown in Figure 1A), one of the bioactive compounds extracted from Rhodiola rosea L., has many pharmacological effects, such as anti-cancer, anti-depressive, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-ulcer and cardioprotective.	3091	3385
30836660	However, there have been no reports on Sal in the context of renal interstitial fibrosis.	3386	3475
30836660	Therefore, this study aims to provide insight into the therapeutic effects of Sal in the context of renal interstitial fibrosis and attempts to explore the molecular mechanisms.	3476	3653
30836660	The serum levels of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and uric acid (UA) are the classical indicators of renal function.	3654	3791
30836660	The serum concentrations of UA, Scr, and BUN were significantly increased in the folic acid (FA) mice.	3792	3894
30836660	Sal reduced the serum levels of UA, Scr, and BUN in renal fibrotic mice (Figure 1B).	3895	3979
30836660	Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed renal structural damage, inflammatory cell infiltration and extracellular matrix deposition in the unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) and FA mice, which was significantly restored by Sal (Figure 1C,D).	3980	4230
30836660	Additionally, Masson’s staining showed a large number of collagen fiber streaks, staining blue with prominent collagen fiber hypertrophy in the UUO and FA mice.	4231	4391
30836660	However, fewer collagen fiber streaks (blue stained area) were observed when the mice were treated with Sal (Figure 1C,D).	4392	4514
30836660	These results indicated that Sal ameliorated renal damage and fibrosis in the fibrotic mice.	4515	4607
30836660	In order to investigate the inflammatory alterations in RIF, we detected the levels of inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the UUO and FA mice.	4608	4761
30836660	As expected, all factors notably increased in the serum of UUO and FA mice, indicating that inflammation plays an important role in the development of renal fibrosis.	4762	4928
30836660	Consistently, Sal remarkably decreased the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the serum of the UUO and FA mice (Figure 1E,F), indicating that Sal could inhibit the inflammatory response in RIF.	4929	5123
30836660	To evaluate whether Sal could affect the levels of ECM and fibrosis markers, we performed western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis on the kidney tissue.	5124	5286
30836660	The primary feature of renal interstitial fibrosis is the accumulation of ECM components.	5287	5376
30836660	Collagen I and collagen Ш are the main components of ECM.	5377	5434
30836660	The levels of collagen I and collagen Ш were notably enhanced in the UUO mice, whereas these alternations were significantly inhibited by Sal (Figure 2A).	5435	5589
30836660	Myofibroblasts are considered to be a primary renal interstitial cell, responsible for production of ECM during fibrosis.	5590	5711
30836660	Furthermore, EMT activation has been associated with myofibroblast production.	5712	5790
30836660	In the present study, Sal was found to downregulate α-SMA and vimentin protein levels, and upregulate E-cadherin protein levels in UUO mice (Figure 2A).	5791	5943
30836660	TGF-β1, snail, and slug are key regulators of the EMT program and RIF, whereas Sal attenuates the UUO-induced upregulation of TGF-β1, snail, and slug in UUO mice.	5944	6106
30836660	In the immunohistochemistry analysis, the effect of Sal on the expressions of collagen I, vimentin, and E-cadherin in the kidney tissue was further examined (Figure 2B).	6107	6276
30836660	Sal downregulated the collagen I and vimentin protein levels and upregulated the E-cadherin protein level in UUO mice.	6277	6395
30836660	The same effect of Sal was observed in the FA mice (Figure 3A,B).	6396	6461
30836660	The results indicated that Sal could prevent the expression of ECM components and EMT markers.	6462	6556
30836660	Inflammation contributes to the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis, as TLR4 induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines.	6557	6690
30836660	As the promoter of a signaling pathway, TLR4 activates NF-кB and MAPK and also stimulates pro-inflammatory reactions.	6691	6808
30836660	In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Sal on renal interstitial fibrosis, western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments were conducted.	6809	6969
30836660	In the western blotting, Sal significantly suppressed the expression of TLR4, p-IкBα, p-NF-κB, p-Ρ38, p-ERK, and p-JNK in UUO mice (Figure 4A).	6970	7113
30836660	The immunohistochemistry experiment also was used in our study.	7114	7177
30836660	The results of the experiment showed that Sal treatment significantly suppressed the expression of TLR4 in UUO mice (Figure 4B).	7178	7306
30836660	The same effect of Sal was observed in the FA mice (Figure 5A,B).	7307	7372
30836660	In conclusion, the TLR4/NF-кB and MAPK signaling pathways might play a role in RIF, and Sal ameliorates RIF by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-кB and MAPK signaling pathways.	7373	7538
30836660	First, we assessed the cytotoxicity effect of salidroside on HK-2 cells.	7539	7611
30836660	The results showed that Sal (2, 10, and 50 uM) treatment did not affect the viability of HK-2 cells (Figure 6A).	7612	7724
30836660	We used a TGF-β1-induced HK-2 cell to detect the effect of Sal in vitro.	7725	7797
30836660	TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL) obviously increased the protein expression level of collagen I, collagen Ш, α-SMA, vimentin, TGF-β1, snail, and slug in the model group, while E-cadherin was downregulated when compared with the control group.	7798	8024
30836660	In agreement with the in vivo results, Sal (2, 10, 50 μM) significantly restored these alterations (Figure 6B).	8025	8136
30836660	The results showed that Sal could prevent the expression of fibrosis markers and the ECM in TGF-β1-activated HK-2 cells.	8137	8257
30836660	In order to investigate the anti-EMT mechanism of Sal in TGF-β1-induced HK-2 cells, western blotting was conducted.	8258	8373
30836660	The results demonstrated the upregulation of TLR4, p-IкBα, p-NF-κB, p-Ρ38, p-ERK, and p-JNK when compared with the control group, while the Sal treatment group effectively restored these alterations (Figure 6C).	8374	8585
30836660	These results revealed that Sal suppresses the inflammatory response of TGF-β1-induced HK-2 cells by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.	8586	8741
30836660	In order to verify that salidroside works by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a TLR4 receptor agonist) to stimulate the HK-2 cells.	8742	8928
30836660	We detected the levels of inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in an LPS-induced HK-2 cell (Figure 7A).	8929	9039
30836660	The results showed that inflammatory cytokines were notably increased in the model group and that Sal remarkably decreased the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the culture supernatant of the HK-2 cells.	9040	9245
30836660	In immunofluorescence, the effect of Sal (50 μM) on the nuclear transport process of NF-κBp65 in LPS-induced HK-2 cells was examined further (Figure 7B).	9246	9399
30836660	As expected, Sal significantly suppressed the nuclear transport process of NF-κBp65 in LPS-induced HK-2 cells.	9400	9510
30836660	The results of the western blot experiment showed that the expression of TLR4, p-IкBα, p-NF-κB, p-Ρ38, p-ERK, and p-JNK were significantly increased in the LPS group, while the salidroside (50 uM) treatment group effectively suppressed the expression of these proteins (Figure 7C).	9511	9792
30836660	These results revealed that Sal suppresses TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.	9793	9930
30836660	In summary, Sal could protect against RIF both in vivo and in vitro.	9931	9999
30836660	These results confirm that Sal could inhibit the accumulation of the ECM and reduce the inflammatory response via the TLR4/NF-κB and MAPK pathways.	10000	10147
30836660	Accumulating evidence suggests that Sal has many pharmacological activities.	10148	10224
30836660	Specifically, Sal exhibits anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, both in vitro and in vivo. Our research reveals the anti-fibrosis effect of Sal and its potential mechanisms.	10225	10408
30836660	The new findings are as follows: (1) Sal effectively inhibits the accumulation of the ECM and the EMT process in RIF.	10409	10526
30836660	(2) Sal ameliorates renal fibrosis, both in vitro and in vivo. (3) Sal inhibits the inflammatory response and EMT process by suppressing the TLR4/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, as illustrated in Figure 8.	10527	10735
30836660	Animal models of RIF provide an opportunity to explore underlying mechanisms and novel therapies.	10736	10833
30836660	The UUO-induced RIF model has been widely used to mimic the pathological alterations of chronic obstructive nephropathy which are commonly observed in patients with CKD.	10834	11003
30836660	Complete ureteral obstruction is not a common cause of human renal disease.	11004	11079
30836660	However, the UUO model is useful to examine the mechanisms of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in vivo.	11080	11178
30836660	This model can be induced in either rats or mice and shows no specific strain dependence.	11179	11268
30836660	Complete UUO rapidly reduces renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate in the obstructed kidney within 24 h. The subsequent responses arise during the 7 days thereafter, which include interstitial inflammation (peak at 2 to 3 days), tubular dilation, tubular atrophy and fibrosis.	11269	11559
30836660	The obstructed kidney reaches the end stage by around 2 weeks.	11560	11622
30836660	Folic acid induces RIF, and high dosages of folic acid (250 mg/kg) are given to mice to rapidly induce folic acid crystals, leading to tubular necrosis in the acute phase (1–14 days) and patchy interstitial fibrosis in the chronic phase (28–42 days).	11623	11873
30836660	RIF is induced both by the crystal obstruction and the direct toxic effect to the tubular epithelial cells.	11874	11981
30836660	Most renal disorders result in renal fibrosis, so there is great interest in identifying the underlying factors behind this issue to prevent or reverse renal fibrosis.	11982	12149
30836660	The proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts with myofibroblast transformation leads to excess deposition of the extracellular matrix and renal fibrosis.	12150	12304
30836660	The majority of CKDs are characterized by excessive ECM accumulation, including collagen I, collagen Ш and fibronectin.	12305	12424
30836660	In the tubulointerstitium of the kidneys, many cells are capable of producing the ECM, but fibroblasts are the principal matrix-producing cells that generate a large amount of interstitial matrix components.	12425	12632
30836660	Fibroblasts in the kidneys are different, with SMA-positive myofibroblasts and express vimentin.	12633	12729
30836660	Snail is a key transcription factor that induces EMT, fibroblast migration and renal fibrosis.	12730	12824
30836660	It is required for the development of fibrosis in renal epithelial cells.	12825	12898
30836660	The reactivation of snail induces a partial EMT in tubular epithelial cells and promotes fibrogenesis, myofibroblast differentiation, and inflammation.	12899	13050
30836660	A large number of studies have shown that TGF-β1 is a key mediator and is highly upregulated in renal fibrosis in both experimental models and human kidneys.	13051	13208
30836660	TGF-β1 can promote extracellular matrix (ECM) production and inhibit its degradation to mediate progressive RIF.	13209	13321
30836660	Furthermore, TGF-β1 has been identified to be the most potent inducer of EMT, which can induce tubular epithelial cells (TECs) to transform into myofibroblasts.	13322	13482
30836660	In our study, TGF-β1 was used to induce the transformation of HK-2 cells into myoblasts.	13483	13571
30836660	Our results show that TGF-β1 can successfully induce EMT via activation of the TLR4/MAPK/NF-кB signaling pathways.	13572	13686
30836660	Our results indicated that salidroside treatment significantly decreased the deposition of ECM and EMT markers, both in vivo and in vitro.	13687	13825
30836660	The correlation between fibrosis and inflammation has been established and supported by morphological evidence.	13826	13937
30836660	A large number of studies have shown that the inflammatory response is necessary in the process of RIF.	13938	14041
30836660	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate immune receptors that respond to endogenous danger factors and promote the activation of immune and inflammatory responses in RIF.	14042	14210
30836660	TLR4 is involved in systemic chronic diseases associated with inflammation, such as chronic kidney diseases, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.	14211	14352
30836660	TLR4, as the promoter of a signaling pathway, activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and stimulates pro-inflammatory responses.	14353	14477
30836660	Some studies have revealed that the knockdown of the TLR4 significantly reduces the risk of fibrosis.	14478	14579
30836660	Renal fibrosis could be effectively ameliorated through inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.	14580	14678
30836660	In addition, findings have also indicated that direct contact between tubular and monocytes cells might be required to induce tubular EMT via a NF-κB-dependent pathway.	14679	14847
30836660	Activating the NF-κB pathway could directly contribute to fibroblast activation and renal fibrosis.	14848	14947
30836660	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are intracellular signaling molecules that elicit diverse pro-inflammatory and profibrotic effects, both in vitro and in vivo.	14948	15115
30836660	The anti-fibrosis effect has been reported recently in experimental models of RIF, showing that the blockade of the MAPK pathway ameliorated renal fibrosis.	15116	15272
30836660	Several MAPK inhibitors have been developed and even applied in various stages of clinical trials.	15273	15371
30836660	The JNK and Ρ38 pathways play important roles in the production of pro-inflammatory and profibrotic mediators, which are activated by various cellular stresses.	15372	15532
30836660	The administration of JNK and Ρ38 pharmacological inhibitors has been shown to suppress the development of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in various animal models.	15533	15716
30836660	Activated JNK and p38 also increase TGF-β1 gene transcription and induce enzyme expression that activates the latent form of TGF-β1.	15717	15849
30836660	Many inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) can induce JNK, Ρ38, and NF-κB activation.	15850	15941
30836660	Tubular apoptosis is a typical feature of renal fibrosis.	15942	15999
30836660	The ERK pathway can ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis through the suppression of tubular EMT.	16000	16098
30836660	The present study shows that Sal obviously suppresses the expression of TLR4, p-IкBα, p-NF-κB, p-Ρ38, p-ERK, and p-JNK, relieving the inflammatory response and ameliorating renal fibrosis.	16099	16287
30836660	In our study, we confirmed that Sal ameliorates renal interstitial fibrosis by inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration and reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines.	16288	16463
30836660	Moreover, Sal ameliorates renal fibrosis by reducing ECM accumulation and blocking the TLR4/NF-кB and MAPK signaling pathways.	16464	16590
30836660	The results of this study provide new insights into reversing renal fibrosis through the anti-inflammatory effects of Sal.	16591	16713

30836660	Kidney samples were excised immediately, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), then paraffin-embedded.	20114	20214
30836660	The paraffin sections were dewaxed in xylene and dehydrated with ethanol, then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess renal injury and Masson’s trichrome stains to assess collagen deposition.	20215	20418
30836660	The observations were made under light microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at a 200× magnification.	20419	20515
30836660	The levels of creatinine (Scr), uric acid (UA) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the serum were measured by commercial kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).	20516	20737
30836660	The concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the serum were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Elabscience, Wuhan, China).	20738	20937
30836660	The expressions of collagen I, E-cadherin, vimentin and TLR4 in the kidney were evaluated by immunohistochemistry.	20938	21052
30836660	Briefly, the kidneys were fixed with 4% PFA, embedded in paraffin and sliced into 5 µm thick sections.	21053	21155
30836660	The sections were dewaxed and hydrated in graded ethanol, then microwaved in a sodium citrate buffer.	21156	21257
30836660	The endogenous peroxidase activity was reduced using 3% H2O2 for 10 min.	21258	21330
30836660	Each sample was blocked with 5% goat serum for 10 min and then treated with primary antibodies collagen I (1:100), E-cadherin (1:200), vimentin (1:200) and TLR4 (1:50) at 4 °C overnight.	21331	21517
30836660	The next day, the sections were incubated with the goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 10 min.	21518	21620
30836660	Then, the sections were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin.	21621	21721
30836660	After dehydrating and drying, the sections were mounted with neutral gum and observed under a microscope.	21722	21827
30836660	The HK-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 nutrient mixture (DMEM/F12, NanJing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Grand Island, NE, USA), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 IU/mL streptomycin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C.	21828	22206
30836660	The HK-2 cells were seeded on 6-well-plate at a density of 2 × 105 cell/well for 24 h. Afterwards, 5 ng/mL TGF-β1, with or without Sal (2, 10, 50 μM), stimulated the cells for 48 h. For further verification, LPS (1 μg/mL) and LPS plus Sal (50 μM) also stimulated the cells for 24 h. All the cells were then collected for the various analyses.	22207	22549
30836660	The kidney tissues and HK-2 cells were homogenated in an ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 2 mM PMSF.	22550	22649
30836660	The samples were centrifuged at 12,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C and the total protein was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Nanjing, China).	22650	22818
30836660	The protein was separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and then transferred to PVDF membranes.	22819	22912
30836660	The membranes were blocked with 5% skim dried milk for 2 h and incubated with primary antibodies collagen I (1:1000), collagen Ш (1:1000), E-cadherin (1:1000), α-SMA (1:1000), vimentin (1:1000), TGF-β1 (1:200), snail (1:1000), slug (1:1000), TLR4 (1:200), IκBα (1:1000), p-IκBα (1:1000), p-NF-κB (1:1000), NF-κB (1:1000), Erk (1:1000), p-Erk (1:2000), JNK (1:1000), p-JNK (1:1000), Ρ38 (1:1000), p-Ρ38 (1:1000), and GAPDH (1:1000) at 4 °C overnight.	22913	23362
30836660	After that, the membranes were incubated with the second antibodies (1:1000) for 2 h. The membranes were visualized using an ECL advanced kit and detected with a gel imaging system (Tanon Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).	23363	23600
30836660	The HK-2 cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h, then treated with salidroside (0, 2, 10, 50 uM) for 24 h. Viability was assessed by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Beyotime Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) assay.	23601	23853
30836660	The data were evaluated as the percentage of the average absorbance to control group.	23854	23939
30836660	Cell viability (%) = (A Treated / A Control) × 100%.	23940	23992
30836660	The expressions of NF-κBp65 in the HK-2 cells were evaluated by immunofluorescence.	23993	24076
30836660	Briefly, the cell was washed three times with PBS, then fixed with an immunol staining fix solution (Beyotime Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) for 30 min and then blocked for 2 h with a blocking reagent.	24077	24278
30836660	The cell was incubated with the primary antibody NF-κBp65 (1:200) overnight at 4 ℃, then washed three times with PBS and incubated with the goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody, the Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate (1:500), for 2 h. After washing three times with PBS and then with DAPI for 5 min, fluorescence images were captured with fluorescence microscopy.	24279	24643
30836660	The experimental results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).	24644	24721
30836660	The statistical significance of differences between the means of each groups was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test.	24722	24875
30836660	Differences in p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.	24876	24957
27993978	Fully grown mammalian oocytes remain arrested at prophase I within antral follicles before gonadotropin signals induce the resumption of meiosis I (MI) and progression to meiosis II (MII).	0	188
27993978	Prophase I arrest, also termed the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, is the result of low maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity.	189	317
27993978	The resumption of meiosis, referred to as germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), is similar to the G2/M transition of mitosis in being associated with the activation of MPF.	318	487
27993978	MPF is a complex of the catalytic subunit cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1; also known as Cdc2) and the regulatory subunit cyclin B1 (Doree and Hunt, 2002).	488	643
27993978	Activation of Cdk1 requires the association with cyclins as well as the dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 residues by Myt1 and Wee1 protein kinases (Morgan, 1995; Nurse, 1990).	644	823
27993978	Depletion of Myt1 causes partial meiotic resumption in mouse oocytes.	824	893
27993978	Wee1B (Wee2), a key Cdk1 inhibitory kinase, is located in the GV-stage oocytes and depletion of its expression enhances meiotic resumption.	894	1033
27993978	Wee1B inhibits Cdk1 phosphatase activity, whereas the cell division cycle 25B (Cdc25B) phosphatase releases Cdk1 activity by dephosphorylating Wee1B-phosphorylated Cdk1.	1034	1203
27993978	Knockdown of Cdc25B in GV stage oocytes inhibits meiotic resumption and causes low activity of MPF.	1204	1303
27993978	Cyclin B1 is continuously degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) during prophase I arrest.	1304	1416
27993978	In GV stage mouse oocytes, Cdh1 (also called Fzr1) is required for APC/C-mediated cyclin B1 destruction to arrest at prophase I.	1417	1545
27993978	Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1; also known as Fbxo5), an inhibitor of APC/CCdh1, is responsible for cyclin B1 destruction and inactivation of MPF.	1546	1693
27993978	Reduction of Emi1 can delay resumption of meiosis by preventing the accumulation of cyclin B1, whereas Emi1 overexpression leads to GVBD.	1694	1831
27993978	Interestingly, BubR1 (a spindle assembly checkpoint protein; also known as Bub1b) has been shown to affect prophase I arrest in mouse oocytes.	1832	1974
27993978	BubR1-depleted oocytes spontaneously undergo GVBD in the presence of the chemical inhibitor IBMX.	1975	2072
27993978	BubR1 knockdown can decrease the expression level of Cdh1.	2073	2131
27993978	However, the GVBD rate in BubR1-depleted oocytes is reduced by injecting Cdh1 cRNA into the oocyte.	2132	2231
27993978	Significantly, a subunit of the NDC80 complex, Hec1 (which itself is also known as Ndc80), has also been shown to regulate meiosis resumption in mouse oocytes.	2232	2391
27993978	Depletion of Hec1 in mouse oocytes severely affects the G2/M transition because of impaired activation of Cdk1.	2392	2503
27993978	Unexpectedly, impaired meiosis resumption is due to instability of cyclin B2, because Hec1 can protect cyclin B2 from APC/CCdh1-mediated destruction (Gui and Homer, 2013).	2504	2675
27993978	It is widely known that CenpH localizes to kinetochores in mammals.	2676	2743
27993978	The kinetochore plays a fundamental role in accurate chromosome segregation in eukaryotes.	2744	2834
27993978	It is a multi-protein structure that associates with centromeric DNA and binds spindle microtubules to the chromosomes, which is required for chromosome movement.	2835	2997
27993978	In particular, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CenpA forms the platform for kinetochore assembly.	2998	3106
27993978	Several additional components of the constitutive centromere-associated network, including CenpC, CenpH, CenpI, and CenpK through to CenpU, have been identified to associate with CenpA.	3107	3292
27993978	In vertebrates, a subgroup of proteins, including CenpH, CenpI and CenpK, play essential roles in kinetochore structure and function.	3293	3426
27993978	The CenpH and CenpI complex is a direct regulator of kinetochore-microtubule dynamics and is required for faithful chromosome segregation, and as a marker directing CenpA deposition to centromeres.	3427	3624
27993978	Absence of CenpH causes severe mitotic phenotypes, including misaligned chromosomes and multipolar spindles in human cells.	3625	3748
27993978	Indeed, CenpH also has at least one other function involving modulation of the cell cycle through an interaction with CenpC.	3749	3873
27993978	Interestingly, however, it is not yet known whether CenpH has other relevant roles beyond the binding of spindle microtubules to chromosomes or the chromosome segregation machinery.	3874	4055
27993978	Here, we investigated the role of CenpH protein in regulating the meiotic cell cycle in mouse oocytes.	4056	4158
27993978	Unexpectedly, we show that depletion of CenpH inhibits G2/M transition by continuous degradation of cyclin B1, while the prophase I arrest induced by CenpH knockdown can be rescued by injecting exogenous cyclin B1 mRNA.	4159	4378
27993978	Finally, we show that CenpH-dependent effects on meiotic resumption require the presence of Cdh1, thereby demonstrating that CenpH-dependent regulation of APC/CCdh1 is essential for regulating prophase I arrest.	4379	4590
27993978	To investigate the role of CenpH during meiosis, its expression and subcellular localization were examined.	4591	4698
27993978	Oocytes were collected after having been cultured for 0, 4, 8 or 12 h, corresponding to GV, GVBD, MI and MII stages, respectively.	4699	4829
27993978	Immunoblotting analysis showed that CenpH protein was expressed from GV to MII stages (Fig.	4830	4921
27993978	1A).	4922	4926
27993978	CenpH was more concentrated in the germinal vesicle at the GV stage (Fig.	4927	5000
27993978	1B).	5001	5005
27993978	Shortly after GVBD, clear staining was observed at the kinetochores.	5006	5074
27993978	When oocytes reached the MI and MII stages, CenpH signal was still obvious at the kinetochores of chromosomes.	5075	5185
27993978	Subcellular CenpH localization during oocyte meiosis was similar to that in mitosis, suggesting that it might contribute to kinetochore-microtubule attachment in meiosis.	5186	5356
27993978	For depleting CenpH in mouse oocytes, we used a morpholino (MO) antisense microinjection approach.	5357	5455
27993978	CenpH MO was microinjected into GV stage oocytes followed by a 24 h incubation in IBMX to deplete the protein.	5456	5566
27993978	We found that CenpH protein was knocked down by 60-70% by MO injection compared with the control group (Fig.	5567	5675
27993978	2A).	5676	5680
27993978	Unexpectedly, only ∼37% of CenpH-depleted oocytes underwent GVBD by 3 h following release from IBMX.	5681	5781
27993978	The percentage of oocytes at GVBD stage was significantly lower in the CenpH knockdown group than in control or wild-type oocytes (36.96±13.32% versus 86.15±11.09% or 89.82±4.75%; P<0.05; Fig.	5782	5974
27993978	2B).	5975	5979
27993978	This indicated that CenpH-depleted oocytes had a reduced capacity for meiotic resumption.	5980	6069
27993978	Furthermore, we examined Cdk1 activity by determining its Tyr15 phosphorylation state.	6070	6156
27993978	We found that Cdk1 activity in CenpH-depleted oocytes was less than that of control oocytes by 1 h following release from IBMX (Fig.	6157	6289
27993978	2C,D).	6290	6296
27993978	In mouse oocytes, cyclin B1 is indispensable for Cdk1 activation during the G2/M transition.	6297	6389
27993978	We therefore examined the cyclin B1 level in CenpH-depleted oocytes and found that it was reduced (Fig.	6390	6493
27993978	2A).	5676	5680
27993978	This suggested that the prophase I arrest following CenpH depletion was due to reduced cyclin B1 levels and the activity of MPF.	6499	6627
27993978	We next examined whether exogenous cyclin B1 expression could rescue the G2/M transition defect.	6628	6724
27993978	Overexpression of cyclin B1-GFP in CenpH-depleted oocytes increased GVBD dramatically after injecting exogenous cyclin B1 mRNA (Fig.	6725	6857
27993978	2B, Fig.	6858	6866
27993978	S1E).	6867	6872
27993978	These data suggested that CenpH is required to stabilize cyclin B1, which in turn plays an indispensable role in the G2/M transition.	6873	7006
27993978	To further confirm that CenpH depletion causes decreased levels of cyclin B1, we monitored the dynamics of cyclin B1-GFP accumulation after microinjection of exogenous cyclin B1-GFP mRNA in GV stage oocytes injected with control or CenpH MO.	7007	7248
27993978	Loss of CenpH caused a 50% decrease in cyclin B1-GFP accumulation compared with controls (Fig.	7249	7343
27993978	3A,B).	7344	7350
27993978	Decreased cyclin B1-GFP accumulation in CenpH-depleted oocytes indicates that the effects of CenpH depletion are caused by cyclin B1 destabilization rather than defects in translation.	7351	7535
27993978	Cyclin B1 translocation into the nucleus is a prerequisite for MPF activation and the occurrence of GVBD.	7536	7641
27993978	Live cell imaging following injection of exogenous cyclin B1-GFP mRNA demonstrated the ability of the cyclin B1-GFP to accumulate in the nucleus.	7642	7787
27993978	By contrast, in CenpH-depleted oocytes, cyclin B1-GFP failed to accumulate in the nucleus (Fig.	7788	7883
27993978	3A,C).	7884	7890
27993978	In mouse oocytes, APC/CCdh1-mediated destruction of cyclin B1 is indispensable for prophase I arrest.	7891	7992
27993978	Consequently, alterations in Cdh1 levels characterize the conditions that perturb cyclin B1 accumulation and meiotic resumption.	7993	8121
27993978	When we examined Cdh1 in CenpH-depleted oocytes using an antibody we found that levels were increased (Fig.	8122	8229
27993978	3D).	8230	8234
27993978	This suggested that the prophase I arrest following CenpH depletion was due to increased APC/CCdh1 activity.	8235	8343
27993978	CenpH, as a component of the kinetochore inner plate, contributes to kinetochore-microtubule attachment in mitosis.	8344	8459
27993978	As mentioned above, ∼37% of CenpH MO-injected oocytes underwent GVBD by 3 h following release from IBMX.	8460	8564
27993978	These oocytes were used for subsequent observations.	8565	8617
27993978	These MO-injected CenpH-depleted oocytes showed normal spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and polar body extrusion (Fig.	8618	8742
27993978	S1A,B).	8743	8750
27993978	As this might be caused by insufficient knockdown of CenpH protein, we further examined the effect of blocking CenpH on MI spindle formation and meiotic cell progression after GVBD.	8751	8932
27993978	First, CenpH antibody was microinjected into GV stage oocytes.	8933	8995
27993978	Blocking of CenpH protein function by antibody injection caused prophase I arrest similar to that in the CenpH MO-injected oocytes (Fig.	8996	9132
27993978	S1C).	9133	9138
27993978	This result suggested that this antibody could be used to disrupt protein function to determine the role of CenpH in mouse oocytes.	9139	9270
27993978	The CenpH antibody was microinjected into GVBD stage oocytes.	9271	9332
27993978	Interestingly, oocytes injected with CenpH antibody extruded the first polar body at a rate similar to those of control oocytes (Fig.	9333	9466
27993978	S1D).	9467	9472
27993978	In mouse oocytes, shortly after GVBD, the earliest stage of spindle assembly is characterized by a spherical spindle with clumped chromosomes.	9473	9615
27993978	Subsequently, at 4-8 h, the spindle becomes molded into a barrel-shaped bipolar structure with the chromosomes aligned on the metaphase plate (Fig.	9616	9763
27993978	4A).	9764	9768
27993978	Strikingly, after blocking CenpH, we found that indexes of spindles were not significantly affected after oocyte GVBD (Fig.	9769	9892
27993978	4B).	9893	9897
27993978	In addition, there was no significant difference in interkinetochore distance, as revealed by anti-centromere antigen (ACA) immunostaining, between control and CenpH antibody-injected oocytes (Fig.	9898	10095
27993978	4C).	10096	10100
27993978	We also examined MII spindle morphology and found that indexes of MII spindles were not significantly affected in CenpH antibody-injected compared with control oocytes (Fig.	10101	10274
27993978	5A,B).	10275	10281
27993978	Overall, these data show that, unlike in mitosis, CenpH does not play key roles in spindle formation and the MI/MII transition during mouse oocyte meiosis.	10282	10437
27993978	CenpH is an important member of the family of kinetochore proteins that play a crucial role in regulating the mitotic cell cycle.	10438	10567
27993978	Here, we provide the first definitive evidence that CenpH has a role in regulating the meiotic G2/M transition via APC/CCdh1-cyclin B1 in oocytes, differing distinctly from the effects observed in mitosis.	10568	10773
27993978	In mouse oocytes, CenpH was expressed throughout meiotic maturation (Fig.	10774	10847
27993978	1A).	4922	4926
27993978	Inherently, the subcellular localization of CenpH is not very different from that of mitosis: the signal was still obvious at the kinetochores at meiotic metaphase (Fig.	10853	11022
27993978	1B).	5001	5005
27993978	Furthermore, at the GV stage, it is more concentrated in the germinal vesicle, suggesting that CenpH might play an important role at this stage.	11028	11172
27993978	We knocked down CenpH in GV stage oocytes by MO microinjection.	11173	11236
27993978	Unexpectedly, ∼63% of CenpH-depleted oocytes still maintain prophase I arrest by 3 h following release from IBMX (Fig.	11237	11355
27993978	2B).	5975	5979
27993978	This indicates that the expression of CenpH at the GV stage is essential for oocyte meiotic resumption.	11361	11464
27993978	The mouse oocyte provides an ideal model for studying G2/M transition, since the oocyte is arrested at the prophase of MI for an extensive period before being released from the inhibitory microenvironment.	11465	11670
27993978	It is well known that MPF is a key regulator of G2/M transition in mouse oocytes (Jones, 2004).	11671	11766
27993978	The Cdk1-activating cyclin at the boundary of G2/M in mouse oocytes is cyclin B1, the APC/CCdh1-mediated destruction of which is indispensable for preventing MPF activation during G2 arrest.	11767	11957
27993978	Consequently, alterations in cyclin B1 and/or Cdh1 levels characterize many conditions that perturb Cdk1 activity and meiotic resumption.	11958	12095
27993978	Our results show that reduction in cyclin B1 levels following CenpH depletion is due to increased APC/CCdh1activity (Fig.	12096	12217
27993978	2A, Fig.	12218	12226
27993978	3D), indicating that the CenpH-dependent inhibition of APC/CCdh1 in mouse oocytes is important for the control of G2/M transition.	12227	12357
27993978	Thus, G2/M transition is critically poised by the competing actions of APC/CCdh1 and CenpH.	12358	12449
27993978	Analogously, prophase I arrest in mouse oocytes is controlled by Emi1-dependent regulation of APC/CCdh1.	12450	12554
27993978	By contrast, in mouse oocytes, BubR1 sustains Cdh1 levels in prophase I arrest.	12555	12634
27993978	The physiological regulation of APC/CCdh1 by kinetochore proteins that allows for a timely meiotic resumption is a topic for future investigation.	12635	12781
27993978	The importance of CenpH in balancing the G2/M transition is shown by the effects of CenpH depletion on the timing of meiotic resumption.	12782	12918
27993978	APC/CCdh1 is apparently the target of CenpH in mediating meiotic resumption because CenpH depletion leads to a reduction in the APC/CCdh1 substrate cyclin B1 (Fig.	12919	13082
27993978	2A).	5676	5680
27993978	Live cell imaging following injection of exogenous cyclin B1-GFP showed that loss of CenpH causes a 50% decrease in the rate of cyclin B1-GFP accumulation (Fig.	13088	13248
27993978	3A,B), indicating that the effects of CenpH depletion are caused by cyclin B1 destabilization rather than any defect in translation.	13249	13381
27993978	This increase in cyclin B1 instability is likely to explain the much-attenuated increase in MPF activity during the meiotic resumption progression of CenpH-depleted oocytes.	13382	13555
27993978	Cyclin B1 accumulation in the nucleus is a prerequisite for MPF activation and meiotic resumption.	13556	13654
27993978	Furthermore, APC/CCdh1 protects the oocyte from precocious GVBD by preventing nuclear accumulation of cyclin B1.	13655	13767
27993978	In CenpH-depleted oocytes, cyclin B1-GFP failed to accumulate in the nucleus and thus inhibited MPF activity, which explains the severely compromised meiotic resumption, together with an increased level of Cdh1 (Fig.	13768	13984
27993978	3C,D).	13985	13991
27993978	Significantly, impaired GVBD could be restored in CenpH-depleted oocytes by co-expressing exogenous cyclin B1 mRNA (Fig.	13992	14112
27993978	2B).	5975	5979
27993978	A recent observation has shown that APC/CCdh1 is necessary for maintaining cyclin B1 stabilization in mouse oocytes.	14118	14234
27993978	Our results show that meiotic resumption is critically poised by the competing actions of APC/CCdh1 and CenpH.	14235	14345
27993978	Thus, CenpH is required to stabilize cyclin B1, which in turn plays an indispensable role in the MPF activation required for meiotic resumption.	14346	14490
27993978	Our observations might have wider implications for the role of CenpH in mammalian somatic cells.	14491	14587
27993978	CenpH has been shown to contribute to kinetochore-microtubule attachment and accurate chromosome segregation in the mitotic cell cycle.	14588	14723
27993978	We found that meiotic resumption is impaired by CenpH antibody injection in GV stage oocytes (Fig.	14724	14822
27993978	S1C), indicating the availability of an antibody that inhibits CenpH protein function.	14823	14909
27993978	However, in contrast to mitosis, we found that blocking CenpH protein function in GVBD stage oocytes by antibody injection did not influence cell cycle progression (Fig.	14910	15079
27993978	S1D).	9467	9472
27993978	Interestingly, early-stage spindle assembly and MII spindle morphology were not affected by inhibiting CenpH at GVBD stage (Figs 4 and 5).	15086	15224
27993978	Similarly, upon MO injection, 37% of CenpH-depleted oocytes underwent GVBD by 3 h following release from IBMX, and these oocytes could still extrude the first polar body (Fig.	15225	15400
27993978	S1A).	15401	15406
27993978	Yet, it is not clear whether the CenpH level is actually reduced in these GVBD oocytes.	15407	15494
27993978	Subsequently, CenpH MO was injected into GV stage oocytes followed by 24 h incubation in IBMX to deplete the protein.	15495	15612
27993978	When the CenpH protein level in control and CenpH MO-injected oocytes (GV or GVBD) was assessed by western blot 2 h following release from IBMX, it was found to be significantly decreased in the GV or GVBD oocytes compared with the control (Fig.	15613	15858
27993978	S1F).	15859	15864
27993978	This indicates that, unlike mitosis, CenpH is not required for spindle assembly and meiotic cell cycle progression after GVBD.	15865	15991
27993978	An alternative interpretation of these results is that pre-existing trace amounts of CenpH in GVBD oocytes are sufficient for meiotic spindle assembly and further cell cycle progression.	15992	16178
27993978	Our data uncover a major feature of CenpH in mouse oocytes that is not shared with mitosis.	16179	16270
27993978	It is involved in APC/CCdh1-mediated cyclin B1 proteolysis during prophase (Fig.	16271	16351
27993978	6).	16352	16355
27993978	CenpH is necessary for cyclin B1 stabilization, which in turn plays an indispensable role in MPF activation.	16356	16464
27993978	Moreover, APC/CCdh1 is apparently the target of CenpH in mediating meiotic resumption.	16465	16551
27993978	Thus, CenpH deficiency could have significant consequences for fertility by increasing the propensity for prophase I-arrested oocytes.	16552	16686
27993978	Mouse polyclonal anti-CenpH antibody used for western blot and immunofluorescence was purchased from Abcam (ab88593); mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin-FITC antibody and mouse monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin antibody were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (F2168 and T6557); human polyclonal anti-ACA antibody was purchased from Antibodies Incorporated (15-234); mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin B1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (sc-245); rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc2 (Cdk1) p34 (Tyr15) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (sc-12340-R); mouse polyclonal anti-β-actin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (sc-8432); FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology (ZF-0312 and ZF-0313).	16687	17454
27993978	Care and handing of 6- to 8-week-old ICR mice was conducted in accordance with the policies of the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.	17455	17628
27993978	Oocytes were cultured in M16 medium (M7292, Sigma) supplemented with 200 μM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to maintain them at GV stage.	17629	17769
27993978	After specific treatments, oocytes were washed thoroughly and cultured in M2 medium (M7167, Sigma) to specific stages.	17770	17888
27993978	Microinjections were performed using a Narishige microinjector and completed within 30 min.	17889	17980
27993978	For CenpH knockdown in mouse oocytes, CenpH MO (5′-ACGCCACAGAAAATAACCCAGCAGT-3′) (Gene Tools) was diluted with nuclease-free water (Sigma) to obtain a 2 mM stock.	17981	18143
27993978	The same amount of negative control MO was used for the control.	18144	18208
27993978	Each oocyte was microinjected with 5-10 pl of MO.	18209	18258
27993978	After microinjection, GV oocytes were cultured for 24 h in M2 medium supplemented with 200 μM IBMX for the depletion of CenpH.	18259	18385
27993978	For cyclin B1-GFP overexpression, 1 μg/μl cyclin B1 mRNA solution was injected into the cytoplasm of GV oocytes.	18386	18498
27993978	For cyclin B1-GFP dynamic analysis, 20 ng/μl cyclin B1 mRNA solution was injected into the cytoplasm of the GV oocytes.	18499	18618
27993978	For protein expression, oocytes were arrested at GV stage in M2 medium supplemented with 200 μM IBMX for 1 h. The same amount of GFP mRNA was injected as control.	18619	18781
27993978	For blocking of CenpH protein function, GV or GVBD stage oocytes were microinjected with 5-10 pl CenpH antibody (0.5 mg/ml).	18782	18906
27993978	After antibody microinjection, oocytes were cultured in M2 medium to specific stages.	18907	18992
27993978	Immunofluorescence was performed as described.	18993	19039
27993978	For immunofluorescent staining, oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.	19040	19152
27993978	After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, they were blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.	19153	19274
27993978	For staining of CenpH, ACA and γ-tubulin, oocytes were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-CenpH (1:100), anti-ACA (1:40) or anti-γ-tubulin (1:200) antibodies.	19275	19435
27993978	After three washes in washing buffer, oocytes were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:100) or cy5-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:500) or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) for 2 h at room temperature.	19436	19668
27993978	For α-tubulin staining, oocytes were incubated with anti-α-tubulin-FITC antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, oocytes were then washed three times in wash buffer and co-stained with Hoechst 33342 (10 mg/ml in PBS) for 15 min.	19669	19896
27993978	These oocytes were mounted on glass slides and examined with an LSM 780 META confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss).	19897	20017
27993978	Immunoblotting was performed as described.	20018	20060
27993978	Briefly, a total of 100 mouse oocytes were collected in 7 μl 2×SDS buffer and heated for 5 min at 100°C.	20061	20165
27993978	The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes.	20166	20245
27993978	Following transfer, the membranes were blocked in TBST containing 5% BSA for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight at 4°C with mouse polyclonal anti-CenpH (1:500), mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin B1 (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc2 (Cdk1) p34 (Tyr15) (1:1000) or mouse polyclonal anti-β-actin (1:1000) antibody.	20246	20579
27993978	After three washes in TBST for 10 min each, the membranes were incubated with 1:1000 HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG for 1 h at 37°C.	20580	20742
27993978	Finally, the membranes were processed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Bio-Rad).	20743	20845
27993978	The CenpH antibody recognized two bands on the western blot: a 28 kDa band close to the expected molecular weight for CenpH; and a higher molecular weight band that might represent some form of post-translational modification.	20846	21072
27993978	Cyclin B1-GFP dynamics were filmed on a Perkin-Elmer Ultra VIEW VOX confocal imaging system.	21073	21165
27993978	A narrow band pass EGFP filter set and a 30% cut neutral density filter from Chroma were used.	21166	21260
27993978	Exposure time ranged between 300 and 800 ms depending on cyclin B1-GFP fluorescence levels.	21261	21352

27993978	P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.	22048	22096
20046642	It is increasingly apparent that neurological disorders including disruption of brain functions associated with the systemic delivery of chemotherapeutic agents used for treatment of central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS tumors.1,2 There is a growing evidence that standard-dose chemotherapy can impact cognitive function.3 Previous studies suggested that 18% of all breast cancer patients receiving standard-dose chemotherapy show cognitive defects on post-treatment evaluation,4 and such problems were reported in more than 30% of patients examined two years after treatment with high-dose chemotherapy.5,6 In addition, Vardy and Tannock7 have reported impaired cognitive functions during treatment of solid brain tumors in animal models and in humans.	0	757
20046642	It has been concluded that administration of methotrexate and 5-FU in combination induced impairments in tests of spatial memory and other cognitive tasks in mice.8 Also, a single dose of cyclophosphamide produced a transient acute memory impairment in mice.9 Moreover, adriamycin has been demonstrated to increase oxidative stress in the brain, which may lead to cell dysfunction or cell death and thus contribute to cognitive dysfunction.10 Furthermore, it has been reported that long-term exposure to 13-cis-retinoic acid, which is often used in chemotherapy regimens, was associated with decreased neurogenesis and cell proliferation in the hippocampus and subventricular zone and impaired spatial learning and memory in young and adult mice.11 Vardy et al.12 reported that the etiology of cognitive impairment after chemotherapy remains unknown although a number of mechanisms have been postulated.13 Candidate mechanisms include: direct neurotoxic effects (e.g., injury to neurons or surrounding cells, altered neurotransmitter levels),14 oxidative stress and DNA damage,15 immune dysregulation and/or release of cytokines13,16 and blood clotting in small CNSvessels.12 Carmustine (BCNU) is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of brain tumors, myeloma, and both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.17 The ability of BCNU to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB) may explain its neurotoxicity.18 Studies on the incidence and the mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction after BCNU administration are rare.	758	2260
20046642	Among these studies, Dietrich et al.17 explained that the cognitive dysfunction induced by the three widely used chemotherapy agents (carmustine, cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside) is due to their toxic effects on CNS progenitor cells and non-dividing oligodendrocytes in vitro.19 They also found that these agents caused increased cell death and decreased cell division in the subventricular zone, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the corpus callosum in mice.	2261	2730
20046642	Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of low molecular weight cysteine-rich, proteinsthat are associated with transition metal cations including Zn, Cd, Cu and Hg.20 Previous studies have indicated the role of MT in protecting cells, tissues and organisms from environmental toxicant-induced damage.21,22 Three isoforms of metallothioneins (MT-I, MT-II and MT-III) are expressed in the central nervous system.23 Previous studies reported that brain MT-I/II are upregulated by different stressful stimuli including psychogenic stress,24 administration of bacterial endotoxin,25 glutamate analogues,26 metal toxicity27 and stroke/ischemia.28 In particular MT I and II could protect neuroglial cells from oxidative damage.29 The authors conclude that lack of this protection has been found to potentiate excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus.	2731	3586
20046642	A common feature seen in a number of studies is that MT-I, II reduces delayed cerebral damage and cell death, as well as promotes brain repair, angiogenesis and functional recovery.30 Interestingly, MT-I, II were shown to act directly as neurotrophic agents after treatment of neurons with exogenous MT-I, II proteins, which enhance neuronal survival and axonal outgrowth in both cortical, hippocampal and dopaminergic cultures.31,32 Regulation of metallothionein gene expression by zinc has been documented.33 Free zinc induces the accumulation of large amount of zinc-containing metallothioneins.34 A number of studies have suggested that zinc status affects metallothionein concentration and its mRNA synthesis in the various tissues of growing and adult rats and mice.35 It has been reported that metallothionein induced by zinc exhibits protective effects on the cardiac apoptosis of doxorubicin,36 anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity37 and adriamycin-induced myocardial injury.38 Increased MT expression in some tissues after in vivo treatment with DNA alkylating agents has been reported.39 It was found that rat hepatocytes with elevated MT levels are resistant to N-methyl-N'-nitro-nitrosoguanidine cytotoxicity.40 Also, overexpressed human MT-IIA gene protects Chinese hamster ovary cells from killing by alkylating agents.34 Moreover, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with ZnSO4 increased hepatic, renal and tumor MT and protected them from cytotoxic actions of cisplatin.35 However few studies have been carried out to explore the role of MT in neurocognitive functions,41,42 the relationship between MT induction and cognition deficits by chemotherapeutic agents is still not clear.	3587	5284
20046642	The current study aimed to address the effect and mechanism of centrally-induced MT on the impact of BCNU on learning and memory in rats.	5285	5422
20046642	Data in Figure 1 explains that injection of ZnSO4 markedly increased hippocampal MT content (53%) when compared to the corresponding control group.	5423	5570
20046642	Also, administration of BCNU significantly increased MT level in the hippocampus of control rats by an extent of 29% but still at a lower significant level in comparison with ZnSO4-treated group.	5571	5766
20046642	The group of rats pretreated with ZnSO4 then 24 hours later with BCNU show marked increases in the level of hippocampal MT content up to110%, 36.5% and 61% if compared to the control, ZnSO4-treated or BCNU-treated groups respectively (Fig.	5767	6006
20046642	1).	6007	6010
20046642	Immunohistochemical staining of MT in brain sections by using specific antibodies revealed that the level of brain MT was obviously increased in the tested groups of rats in the order of ZnSO4-pretreated-BCNU-treated (D) >ZnSO4-treated (B) >BCNU-treated (C) >control (A) groups (Fig.	6011	6294
20046642	2).	6295	6298
20046642	Behavioral tests in the present study show that there is direct correlation between the good learning and short-term memory (STM) of rats on one hand and the number of learning trials on the other hand where the number of errors were decreased as the number of trials increased in all tested groups (Fig.	6299	6603
20046642	3).	6604	6607
20046642	BCNU administration deteriorated both learning and memory when compared to the corresponding control groups.	6608	6716
20046642	However, ZnSO4 administration before BCNU obviously improved both learning and memory (Fig.	6717	6808
20046642	3).	6604	6607
20046642	Statistical analysis of data (Fig.	6813	6847
20046642	4) explain that the group of rats injected with BCNU showed a markedly impaired learning behavior by the extents of 32% from the control group and 39% from ZnSO4-treated group.	6848	7024
20046642	Administration of ZnSO4 before BCNU normalized the decreased learning behavior (Fig.	7025	7109
20046642	4).	7110	7113
20046642	Also, BCNU administration significantly reduced STM in rats to be 31% and 35% of control and ZnSO4-treated rats respectively (Fig.	7114	7244
20046642	5).	7245	7248
20046642	Rats pretreated with ZnSO4 then BCNU showed significant improvement in STM if compared to rats treated with BCNU without ZnSO4 preadministration as it was increased to reach 81% of the control group and 85% of ZnSO4-treated rats (Fig.	7249	7483
20046642	5).	7245	7248
20046642	The present data explain that the activity of GR (Fig.	7488	7542
20046642	6) and the level of GSH (Fig.	7543	7572
20046642	7) in rat hippocampus was aggressively reduced by administration of BCNU to the extents of 49% and 53% of the control group; and 47% and 51% of ZnSO4-treated rats respectively.	7573	7749
20046642	Treatment of rats with ZnSO4 before BCNU resulted in marked increases in the activity of GR (to the extents 76% and 72% of the control and ZnSO4-treated groups respectively) and GSH content (to the extents of 73% and 71% of the control and ZnSO4-treated groups respectively).	7750	8025
20046642	In Figure 8 MDA showed 2.5 fold increase in the hippocampus BCNU-treated animals when compared to either control or ZnSO4-treated groups.	8026	8163
20046642	In the group of rats preinjected with ZnSO4 then BCNU there was up to 60% reduction in the level of MDA compared to BCNU-treated rats but still at a higher level of significance in comparison with either control or ZnSO4-trated animals.	8164	8400
20046642	Evaluation of serum TNFα revealed that BCNU produced significant increases in the level of TNFα up to 44% and 39% when compared with control or ZnSO4-trated animals respectively.	8401	8579
20046642	On the other hand, this level showed a marked reduction (15%) in ZnSO4-pretrated-BCNU-treated rats in comparison with only BCNU-treated animals although it was still at a significant higher level if compared to control or ZnSO4-trated groups (Fig.	8580	8827
20046642	9).	8828	8831
20046642	Figure 10 explains that the activity of caspase-3 enzyme was markedly increased in the hippocampus of rats treated with BCNU compared to either control (by 31%) or ZnSO4-treated (by 34%) animals.	8832	9027
20046642	In ZnSO4-pretreated-BCNU-trated rats, the activity of caspase-3 was significantly decreased to the extents of 12% and 15% from of the control and ZnSO4-treated groups respectively.	9028	9208
20046642	Figure 11 explains that administration of BCNU resulted in massive neuronal damage manifested as an apparent decrease (45%) in the number of normal-appearing neurons in the middle hippocampus CA1 in which most pyramidal cells died (Fig.	9209	9445
20046642	11C) compared with either control (Fig.	9446	9485
20046642	11A) or ZnSO4-treated animals (Fig.	9486	9521
20046642	11B).	9522	9527
20046642	Animals pretreated with ZnSO4 and 24 hours later with BCNU (Fig.	9528	9592
20046642	11D) showed an obvious increase (30%) in the number of intact neurons as compared to BCNU-treated animals.	9593	9699
20046642	A photomicrograph of rat brain sections stained with Hx & E (X 40) shows CA1 region of the hippocampus from control (A), ZnSO4-treated (B), BCNU-treated rats (C) and ZnSO4-pretreated-BCNU-treated rats (D).	9700	9905
20046642	Impaired cognitive functions after administration of chemotherapeutic agents have been reported in animal models and in humans.7 The present data revealed that injection of BCNU into rats resulted in impairment of learning and STM.	9906	10137
20046642	This effect is in consistence with the previous study of Reiriz et al.9 who reported that a single dose of cyclophosphamide produced a transient acute memory impairment in mice.	10138	10315
20046642	Also, it was found that adriamycin produced cognitive dysfunction in experimental animals.10 In addition, exposure to13-cis-retinoic acid, impaired spatial learning and memory in mice.11 Moreover, the present data are in close agreement with the study of Dietrich et al.17 who reported cognitive dysfunction after administration of carmustine, cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside in mice.	10316	10703
20046642	The relationship between the integrity of hippocampus and normal learning and memory pattern has been documented.17 The present study showed that BCNU induced oxidative stress in the hippocampus of rats as indicted by aggressive inhibition of GR enzyme activity, reduction of GSH content and increased hippocampal content of MDA in comparison with the control groups.	10704	11071
20046642	In addition, serum TNFα and the activity of caspase-3 showed significant higher hippocampal levels in BCNU-treated animals compared to corresponding control values.	11072	11236
20046642	Moreover, microscopic examination of hippocampal sections showed deteriorated histological features in rats treated with BCNU if compared to control groups.	11237	11393
20046642	These data are in harmony with the previous investigations that reported BCNU as a potent GR inhibitor and GSH depletor in several tissues.43,44 It has been explained that depletion of GSH, as a consequence of GR inhibition will increase cellular oxidative damage.45 The increased extent of lipid peroxidation and apoptosis (as indicated by increased caspase-3 activity) in the hippocampus as well as the level of serum TNFα after BCNU administration in the present study is supported by previous studies on various tissues.	11394	11918
20046642	In this respect, it was found that incubation of BCNU with rat brain slices for two hours produced marked depletion of GSH (up to 70%) accompanied with increased extent of lipid peroxides.46 Also, BCNU was found to inhibit the activity of GR and promoted the oxidative damage in the nigrostriatal system.47 In addition, BCNU could inhibit GR, depleted GSH and induced apoptosis in PC12 cells.48 It has been reported that BCNU administration, as one of common breast cancer regimen, resulted in apparent inhibition of lung GR activity and GSH content with increased levels of TNFα and lipid peroxidation with marked histological alterations.49 Moreover, the interrelation between oxidative stress and release of inflammatory cytokines including TNFα and subsequent tissue damage has been proved.50 GSH depletion was reported to be associated with augmentation of an oxidative stress-mediated proinflammatory state in alveolar epithelial cells by an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism.51 Recently, it has been concluded that BCNU induced lung fibrosis in rats, an effect mediated by increased oxidative stress and induction of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα.52 On the other hand, Ali-Osman et al.53 explained that, BCNU metabolites are very reactive electrophiles capable of depleting GSH and inducing apoptosis.	11919	13234
20046642	It was also stated that the cognitive dysfunction induced by the three widely used chemotherapy agents (carmustine, cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside) is due to their toxic effects on CNS progenitor cells and nondividing oligodendrocytes of in vitro.19 In addition, BCNU was found to increased cell death and decreased cell division in the hippocampus of mice.17 Since neurotoxicity, DNA damage, Oxidative stress and release of cytokines were reported as mechanisms of impairment of cognitive functions after chemotherapy,12 it could be suggested that BCNU administration resulted in hippocampal toxicity in the form of apoptosis, increased level of lipid peroxidation and histological alterations with subsequent impairment of learning and memory.	13235	13984
20046642	The involvement of MT in protection against various stress insults has been reported.33,39,54 Imuunohistochemical and biochemical techniques in the present study showed that BCNU administration markedly increased the level of MT in the hippocampus of rats.	13985	14241
20046642	Also, i.c.v injection of ZnSO4 into either control animals or 24 hours before administration of BCNU resulted in significant increase in the level of MT in the hippocampus of both groups in the order of BCNU-ZnSO4-pretreated >control.	14242	14476
20046642	It is generally accepted that the expression of MT-I/II proteins is highly inducible in response to a range of stimuli, including metals, hormones, cytokines, oxidative agents, inflammation and stress.22 The induced MT in response to BCNU administration is in harmony with the reported role of MT in resistance to alkylating agents during treatment of cancers such as bladder cancer55 and esophageal cancer.56 Also, recent studies strongly suggested a significant role of MT during neurodegenerative diseases and in response to brain injury.57 In addition, Schroder et al.39 have considered that tissue induction of MT as a mechanism of resistance to oxidative stress produced by alkylating agents.	14477	15175
20046642	Therefore, the increased level of MT in BCNU-treated animals may represents an acute phase response to act against increased oxidative stress produced by BCNU.	15176	15335
20046642	It has been stated that, metal-induced synthesis of MT is mediated by activation of metal response element-binding transcription factor (MTF-1), a zinc-sensitive trans-acting factor.57,58 The increased level of MT after ZnSO4 injection in the present work is in close agreement with the early study of Ebadi and Swanson59 who found that i.c.v injection of zinc induced brain MT.	15336	15714
20046642	In addition, several studies have suggested that zinc status affects metallothionein concentration and its mRNA synthesis in the various tissues of growing and adult rats and mice.60 Recently, it has concluded that administration of Zn2+ (i.v) during reperfusion phase of cerebral ischemia could pass BBB and induced hippocampal MT.28 Although MT has been documented to protect against neuronal injury,61 its role in neurobehavioral function have not been well characterized.57 Behavioral tests in the present study showed marked potentiation of learning and memory in rats pretreated with ZnSO4 (i.c.v), 24 hours before BCNU, compared to those without ZnSO4 preadministration.	15715	16392
20046642	These data may explain the decisive role of MT induction in the improvement of cognition during BCNU administration.	16393	16509
20046642	In this respect, West et al.57 believed that alterations in MT function could alter neural function in ways that would impair behavioral function.	16510	16656
20046642	The authors explained that MTs play a significant role in zinc homeostasis in the hippocampus which is essential in maintenance of normal cognitive functions.	16657	16815
20046642	Also, it was concluded that the hippocampus, which plays a central role in cognitive functions such as memory depends on correct physiological actions of zinc, which is heavily concentrated in the hippocampal mossy fiber system.41 In addition, MT-I/II were found to protect against the adverse effects of both zinc under and overload.62 Moreover, metallothionein-null mice showed learning deficits in passive avoidance and water maze escape learning.63 The obtained data revealed that pretreatment of rats with ZnSO4 (i.c.v) before BCNU conferred protection of the hippocampus against BCNU-induced damage as the levels of caspase-3 and MDA were markedly reduced but the contents of MT and GSH as well as the activity of GR in the hippocampus were significantly higher if compared to only BCNU-treated rats.	16816	17622
20046642	Also, serum TNFα showed apparent reduction in rats preinjected with ZnSO4.	17623	17697
20046642	This protection was further confirmed by histological examination.	17698	17764
20046642	These data are in line with the previous studies in which neuronal injury was reported to be implicated in cognitive dysfunction.17 On the other hand, MT-I, II were shown to enhance neuronal survival and axonal outgrowth in both cortical, hippocampal and dopaminergic cultures.30,32 In addition, MT was found to protect against neuronal damage via its powerful antioxidant and antiapoptic properties.9,64 Moreover, MT counteracted oxidative stress and apoptosis in animals treated with DNA alkylating agents.39 Furthermore, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with ZnSO4 increased hepatic, renal and tumor MT and protected them from cytotoxic actions of cisplatin.35 It is important to note that MT-I, II are powerful scavengers of free radicals, likely as a function of their cysteine residues.30 In addition, it was concluded that MT induction creates a new pool of thiol groups in the cell cytosol that can attenuate damaging effects of GSH depletors in rat hepatocytes.65 Further studies indicated that the released Zn+2 from MT might suppress free radical-mediated damage by its ability to induce the metalloenzyme superoxide dismutase or to stabilize the cell membrane function.66 In addition, it has been shown MT induced by zinc exhibited protective effects from doxorubicin-induced myocardial apoptosis36 and adriamycin-induced myocardial injury by inhibition of oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3.38 On the other hand, the oxidative stress-dependent pathway for increased levels of TNFα and other cytokines and their implication in neuronal injury has been reported.30,51 MT-I, II were reported to inhibit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and TNFα with subsequent suppression of the inflammatory responses of leukocytes.30 It was found that exogenous administration of metallothionein reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα and apoptotic cell death during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.67 Herein, it could be proposed that among the key mechanisms for improvement of BCNU-induced learning and memory deficits after induction of brain MT by administration of ZnSO4 is the buffering effect of MT against BCNU-induced hippocampal damage through rebalancing of oxidant/antioxidant equilibrium (as the levels of GR activity and GSH content were preserved), anti-inflammatory effect (as the level of TNFα was markedly reduced) and antiapoptotic effect (as it produced marked reduction in caspase-3 activity).	17765	20286
20046642	In conclusion, the obtained data may suggest that MT induction can act against BCNU-induced hippocampal cognitive deficits.	20287	20410
20046642	This effect is mediated at least in part by antioxidant, antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms as well as maintenance of zinc homeostasis.	20411	20558
20046642	This may help to understand the role of metallothionein in chemotherapy-induced neurocognitive dysfunction which may be considered for the improvement of behavioral pattern during administration of anticancer agents.	20559	20775
20046642	Adult male Wistar albino rats weighing 150–180 g were obtained from the Animal Care Center, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.	20776	20932

20046642	A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (15/group): The first group served as a control group in which the animals received a single intracerbrovenricular (i.c.v) dose of normal saline (10 µl) followed 24 h later with an i.v injection of BCNU solvent (normal saline containing 10% ethanol).	21120	21447
20046642	The second group administered a single dose of ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/10 µl normal saline, i.c.v) followed 24 h later with an injection of BCNU solvent (i.v).	21448	21599
20046642	Rats in the third group received a single dose of BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v) 24 h after an injection (i.c.v) of normal saline (10 µl).	21600	21728
20046642	Fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/ 10 µl normal saline, i.c.v) followed 24 h later with an injection of BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v).	21729	21875
20046642	After three weeks, animals in all groups were subjected to behavioral tests for learning and short-term (STM) memory using radial arm water maze then anaesthetized with ether and sacrificed where five rats from each group were used for histological analysis.	21876	22134
20046642	The remaining ten rats were used for biochemical analysis where BCNU toxicity was evaluated by measuring MDA (as a marker for lipid peroxidation), caspase-3 activity (as a marker for apoptosis) as well as the possible mechanisms for this toxicity by measuring GR activity and GSH content in the hippocampus as well as serum TNFα level.	22135	22470
20046642	The ability of MT to counteract BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity was evaluated by measuring the previous parameters after MT induction by ZnSO4.	22471	22616
20046642	In each group, blood samples from each animal were collected separately, centrifuged and used for determination of TNFα.	22617	22737
20046642	The two lobes of hippocampus in each animal were rapidly dissected out on ice, washed with saline and cut into small pieces and used for biochemical analysis.	22738	22896
20046642	Hippocampal pieces from each animal in each group were homogenized and used for determination of the activity of hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) and the contents of MT, reduced glutathione (GSH), malodialdehyde (MDA) as well as total protein.	22897	23146

20046642	The radial arm water maze consisted of a black circular water tub with six V-shaped stainless steel structures arranged to form a swimming field of an open central area and six arms.69 The water temperatures was maintained at 25°C.	23810	24041
20046642	A goal arm is one that has a black platform submerged 1cm below the water level.	24042	24122
20046642	Starting from a start arm (any arm other than the goal arm), the rat must find the submerged platform by swimming to the end of the goal arm.	24123	24264
20046642	Each rat was allowed 12 consecutive training trials (learning phase) followed by a short-term memory (STM) test trial (30 min delay periods).	24265	24406
20046642	Rats were allowed to take rest for 5 min to avoid exhaustion at the end of the 6th trial.	24407	24496
20046642	Rats were allowed 1 min per trial to find the submerged platform.	24497	24562
20046642	A trial ended when the rat located the submerged platform, where it was allowed to stay trial 15 sec on the platform before removal to begin the next trial in a different start arm.	24563	24744
20046642	If the rat did not find the submerged platform in the goal arm after one min, it was guided the goal arm and allowed to stay on the platform for 15 sec before removal to begin the next trial.	24745	24936
20046642	A correct selection occurred when the rat swam directly to the goal arm, while error was registered when the rat entered into an arm other than the goal arm.	24937	25094
20046642	All experiments were done in dimly lit room and the rat had to use cues in the room to spatially memorize the location of the platform.	25095	25230

20046642	5 µl of the 4 mM DEVD-pNA substrate (200 µM final conc.)	31639	31695
20046642	was added and to each sample and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Samples were read at 405-nm in a microtiter plate ELISA reader.	31696	31819
20046642	The absorbance of the produced color (pNA) from treated animals was compared with control animals to determinate the percentage of caspase-3 activity changes.	31820	31978
20046642	Hippocampal lipid peroxides were determined colorimetrically using thiobarbituric acid (TBA), as described by Uchiyama and Mihara,73 where lipid peroxides expressed in terms of MDA concentration (nmol/mg protein).	31979	32192
20046642	In brief, hippocampus lobes were homogenized separately in 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mmol/L EDTA to obtain a 5% homogenate.	32193	32341
20046642	In a Teflon-stoppered test tube, 2.5 ml of 20% acetic acid and 1 ml TBA solution were added to the tissue homogenate and allowed to boil at 100°C for 30 min in a water bath.	32342	32515
20046642	After cooling to room temperature under tap water, 4 ml n-butanol was added and samples were shaken vigorously and centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min.	32516	32662
20046642	The absorbance of the upper colored layer was measured at 532 nm and the concentration of MDA was calculated from a standard calibration curve and expressed as nmol/g protein.	32663	32838
20046642	Total protein was determined according to the method of Lowery et al.74 In brief, 1.0 ml of alkaline copper solution (prepared by mixing 50 ml of 2% Na2CO3 in 0.10 N NaOH with 1.0 ml of 0.50% CuSO4.	32839	33037
20046642	5 H2O in 1% sodium tartrate) was added to a test tube containing 0.20 ml of 10% hippocampus homogenate (w/v), mixed well and allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature.	33038	33211
20046642	Then, 0.10 ml of Folin's reagent (phospho-molybdic-phosphotungstic reagent diluted 1:1 in H2O before use) was added and thoroughly mixed.	33212	33349
20046642	After 30 min the optical density was measured against blank at 500 nm.	33350	33420
20046642	Protein concentration was calculated from a standard calibration curve in which bovine albumin was used in different concentrations.	33421	33553
20046642	Data were presented as mean ± SEM and analyzed using Graph Pad Instat software by one way ANOVA followed by Tukey Kramer post-test at p < 0.05.	33554	33697
28650467	The 2013 SEER Stat Fact Sheets from the National Cancer Institute1 indicate that there were ~78 000 people with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the United States alone, roughly 66% of those affected are youths, making ALL the most widespread pediatric cancer.	0	265
28650467	L-asparaginase is one of the central components of current combination chemotherapy against ALL.	266	362
28650467	Normally, L-asparagine is synthesized from L-aspartic acid and NH3 by L-asparagine synthetase whose level is critically downregulated in leukemic cells.2, 3 Thus, leukemic cells heavily depend on the availability of plasma asparagine for their protein synthesis and survival.	363	638
28650467	L-asparaginase in the ALL treatment regimen depletes plasma asparagine by hydrolyzing the latter into aspartic acid and NH3, thereby causing cellular asparagine deficit, inhibition of protein synthesis and eventually, leukemic cell death.	639	877
28650467	Although the outcome in childhood leukemia has improved significantly in the recent past, challenges arise as ALL patients treated with L-asparaginase relapse due to development of resistance, resulting in refractory disease.	878	1103
28650467	It would stand to reason that L-asparaginase-resistant cells have generated a mechanism that provides access to asparagine.	1104	1227
28650467	One proposed mechanism involves the upregulation of L-asparagine synthetase activity, as elevated L-asparagine synthetase level was detected in resistant primary samples and cell lines.4 Indeed, cellular L-asparagine synthetase level correlates with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) obtained following asparaginase treatment.5 However, there have also been reports where no correlation between L-asparagine synthetase level and L-asparaginase resistance was observed,6, 7 suggesting that other unknown factors may contribute to L-asparaginase resistance.	1228	1798
28650467	To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ALL cells acquire resistance to L-asparaginase, we sought to identify genes that are involved in L-asparaginase resistance.	1799	1968
28650467	In this study, we employed an unbiased genome-wide loss-of-function screening against L-asparaginase-sensitive pediatric ALL cells.	1969	2100
28650467	We found that among randomly selected resistant clones, a significant majority has shown loss of the opioid receptor mu 1 (OPRM1).	2101	2231
28650467	We present further analyses of this finding and demonstrate that, indeed, L-asparaginase refractory ALL coincides with downregulation of OPRM1.	2232	2375
28650467	To identify genes that are involved in L-asparaginase resistance, we utilized an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screening8 that targets 24 000 unique shRNAs covering 8 000 vital genes in continuously growing leukemia cells (POETIC2) established from a pediatric leukemia patient.	2376	2650
28650467	These cells were prepared by high-density culture of blast cells of a 14-year-old patient diagnosed with pre-B ALL with p16 deletion that maintained growth and survival in vitro.	2651	2829
28650467	Initially, cells were infected with retrovirus carrying pRS-shRNA library and infected cells were selected by treatment with puromycin (2 μg/ml) for 3 weeks.	2830	2987
28650467	Cells infected with pRS-shRNA were then cultured in the presence of L-asparaginase (10 mIU/ml) for an additional 2 weeks.	2988	3109
28650467	To isolate individual resistant colonies in soft agar, an additional 1-week culture in the presence of puromycin and L-asparaginase was performed and a total of 10 single colonies were formed and isolated.	3110	3315
28650467	Isolated clones were amplified individually and as a pool of the 10 clones.	3316	3391
28650467	Cell were fed with fresh media containing L-asparaginase (10 mIU/ml) every 3 days.	3392	3474
28650467	As shown in Figure 1a, parental (designated as *) and control retroviral vector-infected cells are sensitive (IC50=50.7 mIU/ml) to L-asparaginase treatment.	3475	3631
28650467	In contrast, the pooled shRNA library-infected cells are resistant to L-asparaginase treatment.	3632	3727
28650467	To test whether cell survival after puromycin and L-asparaginase treatments is due to infection of retrovirus carrying shRNAs, genomic DNA isolated from the pooled resistant cells was isolated and used to perform PCR using primers that flank the shRNA inserts.	3728	3988
28650467	The presence of the 642 bp PCR product after the first (puromycin) and the second (L-asparaginase) screening of pRS-shRNA library-infected cells indicate that these cells, indeed, harbor the retroviral shRNA insert (Figure 1b).	3989	4216
28650467	Sequencing of bar codes for each individual clone was then performed to identify the target genes that account for L-asparaginase resistance.	4217	4358
28650467	Our data show that among the 10 resistant clones, six hits were for opioid receptor mu 1 gene (oprm1) and two hits each for carbonic anhydrase 1 (ca1)9 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (ube2c)10 genes (Figure 1c).	4359	4576
28650467	Next, we tested whether OPRM1 is expressed in our model cell system and other leukemic cells.	4577	4670
28650467	As shown in Figure 2, OPRM1 is expressed in our model cell system (*) and all four other leukemic cells tested.	4671	4782
28650467	To validate our data from the genome-wide retroviral shRNA library screening, we infected the leukemic cells with retrovirus carrying shOPRM1 and tested whether specific knockdown of OPRM1 confers L-asparaginase resistance.	4783	5006
28650467	Indeed, shOPRM1-infected cells that show reduced levels of OPRM1 mRNA (Figure 3a, left panels) and protein (Figure 3a, right panels) are resistant to L-asparaginase treatment (Figure 3b).	5007	5194
28650467	Interestingly, a previous study11 showed that stimulation of the opioid receptor leads to activation of inhibitory Gi-proteins which block adenylyl cyclase activity, which in turn, reduces cellular cAMP level and subsequently induces apoptosis by caspase activation in leukemic cells.	5195	5479
28650467	A separate study12 also showed that activation of opioid receptor reduces cAMP level and increases sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to doxorubicin.	5480	5628
28650467	Together, these findings suggest that leukemic cells utilize the OPRM1-cAMP-caspase pathway to acquire L-asparaginase resistance.	5629	5758
28650467	Since methadone, an μ-opioid receptor agonist, was found to sensitize leukemic cells to doxorubicin treatment,13 and the OPRM1-cAMP-caspase pathway may be utilized by leukemic cells for both methadone sensitization and L-asparaginase resistance, we investigated L-asparaginase sensitivity in both parental and OPRM1-depleted cells with and without methadone treatment.	5759	6127
28650467	If the OPRM1-cAMP-caspase pathway is utilized by leukemic cells for both methadone sensitization and L-asparaginase resistance, parental cells will show synergistic sensitivity when the cells are treated with L-asparaginase+methadone compared to cells treated with L-asparaginase or methadone alone.	6128	6427
28650467	However, leukemic cells resistant to L-asparaginase due to OPRM1 loss will be insensitive to L-asparaginase+methadone treatment.	6428	6556
28650467	As shown in Figure 4a, methadone enhances the sensitivity of parental cells, but not OPRM1-depleted cells, to L-asparaginase treatment, indicating that OPRM1 is required for the synergistic action of L-asparaginase and methadone.	6557	6786
28650467	Our findings also suggest that depletion of OPRM1 promotes leukemic cell survival through downregulation of the OPRM1-mediated apoptotic pathway.	6787	6932
28650467	Thus, our data demonstrate that the OPRM1-mediated pathway may have a critical role in L-asparaginase sensitivity and development of resistance.	6933	7077
28650467	Consistent with this finding, all leukemic cells with relatively high level of OPRM1 are significantly (P<0.05) sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment compared to our model leukemic cells depleted of OPRM1 (Figure 4b).	7078	7295
28650467	To investigate the clinical relevance of our findings, a panel of additional leukemic cells isolated from ALL patients were assessed to determine whether reduced level of OPRM1 is linked to L-asparaginase resistance.	7296	7512
28650467	To do so, primary leukemic cells from five ALL patients were analyzed for OPRM1 levels and L-asparaginase sensitivity.	7513	7631
28650467	As shown in Figure 4c, leukemic cells with higher levels of OPRM1 are more sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment compared to those with lower levels of OPRM1.	7632	7790
28650467	This finding further demonstrates the link between loss of OPRM1 and the development of L-asparaginase resistance.	7791	7905
28650467	In accord with our observations, further examination of the data at the cBioportal for Cancer Genomics,14 that offers large-scale cancer genomics data set analysis, revealed the connection of oprm1 deletions and mutations to hematopoietic and other cancers.	7906	8163
28650467	OPRM1 is deleted in 10% of adenoid cystic carcinoma and 6.3% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.	8164	8258
28650467	OPRM1 is mutated in 15% of desmoplastic melanoma, 2.1% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1.7% of adenoid cystic carcinoma and 0.6% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	8259	8422
28650467	Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time a novel molecular apparatus for L-asparaginase resistance in ALL, and identifies OPRM1 as a functional biomarker for defining high-risk subpopulations and for the detection of evolving resistant clones.	8423	8673
28650467	Absence of sufficient data sets in publicly available databases (for example, cBioportal and Oncomine) prevented us from further acquiring a significant relationship between OPRM1 and ALL.	8674	8862
28650467	Nonetheless, we propose that oprm1 can be targeted for effective treatment of L-asparaginase-resistant ALL.	8863	8970
28650467	Characterization of L-asparaginase resistance due to loss of carbonic anhydrase 1 or ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C in ALL is underway.	8971	9108
26102294	The relationship between cancer cells, normal stem cells, and cancer stem cells represents a question of substantial current interest.1 It has been proposed that transcription networks that confer stem cell properties such as self-renewal, plasticity, or an increased resistance to genotoxic stimuli in normal stem cells may perform a similar function in cancer cells.2 This hypothesis is supported by the growing clinical evidence that expression of key embryonal stem cell (ESC) transcription factors POU1F5 (OCT4A), NANOG and SOX2, are associated with poorer prognosis through tumor resistance, recurrence and progression in a wide variety of cancers.3-9 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated by several groups that ESC transcription factors can be upregulated in response to DNA damage where they likely play a role in regulating survival.10-12 Conversely, accelerated cellular senescence is a phenomenon that has also been shown to be induced by genotoxic treatments of cancer cells.13 Cellular senescence has traditionally been considered a terminal cell fate.13,14 However, more recently it has been shown to be reversible at early stages, at least in tumor cells.15-18 Furthermore, a direct link between senescence and “stemness,” essential cytological characteristics of a stem cell that distinguishes it from ordinary somatic cells, emerged in experiments where pluripotency is induced in normal cells.19,20 The molecular regulators of these processes in normal embryonal development, such as p21Cip1, are slowly becoming discerned.21 One intriguing observation is that embryonal cellular senescence is associated with upregulation of the same pathways which govern the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).22 This, apparently paradoxical, link between opposites in cell fate provides a challenge for scientific reasoning.	0	1835
26102294	We have previously observed in IMR90 fibroblasts that a pre-senescent phenotype is associated with the appearance of self-renewal and senescence markers coupled to DNA damage.23 We also demonstrated co-incident p53-dependent upregulation of 2 opposing cell fate regulators, p21Cip1 and OCT4A in embryonal carcinoma PA-1 cells treated with Etoposide (ETO).24 We hypothesized that this bi-potential state favors DNA damage repair (DDR) while preventing full commitment to either senescence or self-renewal.	1836	2340
26102294	In this system, p53 silencing promoted terminal senescence and premature mitosis.	2341	2422
26102294	Together these data support the presence of a pre-senescent cell state which can arise in response to both senescence and stemness programmes being coactivated in response to genotoxic damage.	2423	2615
26102294	In the present study, we asked how key regulators of stemness (OCT4A, SOX2 and NANOG) and senescence (p16inka4a) behave in individual PA-1 cells during the response of ETO-induced DNA damage.	2616	2807
26102294	Using siRNA silencing approaches we addressed the effect of OCT4A and p21Cip1 expression on each other and subsequent cell fates, determining the role of autophagy and how OCT4A activation impacts on the energy and genomic stress sensor and master metabolic regulator and activator of autophagy AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).	2808	3139
26102294	Following ETO treatment many PA-1 cells undergo gradual cell apoptosis and anoikis, while the remainder arrest in G2M and upregulate p53 and p21Cip.24 G2M arrest and nuclear swelling were evident on day 3 after ETO treatment, with restoration of normal cell cycle and nuclear size 4 d later (Fig.	3140	3436
26102294	1A and B).	3437	3447
26102294	Concurrent nuclear area assessments and DNA content measurements demonstrate that the nuclei of ETO treated cells increased in size irrespective of the stage of the cell cycle, but was most evident in G2M and polyploid cells (Fig.	3448	3678
26102294	1C and D).	3679	3689
26102294	Increased nuclear area and DNA content were also accompanied by an increase in cellular granularity, as determined by an increase in side scatter detected by flow cytometry analysis (Fig.	3690	3877
26102294	1E), and autophagy (see below).	3878	3909
26102294	The majority of cells displayed flattened morphology (Fig.	3910	3968
26102294	1F), but only a proportion displayed p16Ink4a nuclear positivity (Fig.	3969	4039
26102294	1 G, H).	4040	4048
26102294	Furthermore, p16Ink4a expression was largely confined to the cytoplasm (Fig.	4049	4125
26102294	1 G).	4126	4131
26102294	All of these features are indicative of senescence.	4132	4183
26102294	We previously showed that the senescence marker p21Cip1 and the stemness marker OCT4A simultaneously increase and co-exist in the same cells following ETO treatment.24 After confirming the pre-senescent phenotype of these cells, we next wished to explore how these critical factors for cell fate were dynamically regulated, integrated and diversified.	4184	4535
26102294	As judged by flow cytometry ˜60% of the cells become positive for both markers at the peak of the response (day 5), thereafter the expression of both markers and the proportion of double positive cells gradually decreases (Fig.	4536	4763
26102294	2A) as clonogenic, mitotic division ensues.	4764	4807
26102294	To exclude the possible impact of the senescence-associated cytoplasmic and nuclear area changes on the flow cytometry measurements, semi-automatic image cytometry was undertaken, measuring the expression of both factors in the cell nucleus (apoptotic cells possessing very high p21Cip1 positivity lacking OCT4A were deliberately excluded from this analysis as distorting stoichiometry of measurements).	4808	5211
26102294	Both the expression and variation of expression of OCT4A and p21Cip1 increased on day 3 after ETO treatment; and increased further on day 5 (Fig2B and C, Fig.	5212	5370
26102294	S1) and a high number of double-positive cells confirmed (Fig.	5371	5433
26102294	2B).	5434	5438
26102294	In its function as a master regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal, OCT4A cooperates with SOX2 and NANOG whose expression are therefore required for maintaining the embryonic stem cell phenotype.25 We thus explored the expression of these transcription factors in the DNA damage response of PA-1 cells.	5439	5745
26102294	Immunoblotting confirmed that p53 increased in response to ETO from day 1, resulting in the induction of p21Cip1, which reached its maximum on day 5 (Fig 3A).	5746	5904
26102294	As documented previously, OCT4A expression was present in control cells and increased following ETO treatment, coincident with p53 upregulation.24 Weak expression of SOX2 was found in untreated cells but did not alter following ETO-treatment (Fig.	5905	6152
26102294	3A); a result confirmed by image cytometry measurements in individual cells (Fig3B, Fig.	6153	6241
26102294	S1).	6242	6246
26102294	NANOG was not detected in PA-1 cells by immunoblotting (Fig 3A) although rare NANOG positive cells (less than 5%) were found in control and ETO-treated samples by 3 different antibodies (Supplementary Fig.	6247	6452
26102294	1).	6243	6246
26102294	Intriguingly, SOX2 failed to show unambiguous antagonism with p21Cip1, which has previously been reported as directly inhibiting SOX2 in neurodifferentiation.26 Furthermore, SOX2 expression did not show significant correlation with its self-renewal partner OCT4A (data not shown).	6457	6737
26102294	Together, these data suggest a dissociation of OCT4A from its self-renewal capacity when it is induced by p53 (in the presence of p21Cip1) in response to DNA damage.	6738	6903
26102294	Given its potential lack of self-renewal capacity, we next investigated the role of OCT4A in PA-1 cells following ETO treatment using siRNA.	6904	7044
26102294	Prior to this analysis, we first established which OCT4 isoforms were expressed in PA-1 cells.	7045	7139
26102294	Using a panel of specific mAb, immunoblotting revealed that OCT4B was undetectable in these cells both before and after ETO treatment (Fig.	7140	7279
26102294	S2), consistent with published previously RT-PCR data.24 Having established that OCT4B was not expressed in PA-1 cells, siRNA silencing was used to assess the role of OCT4A in their response to ETO treatment.	7280	7488
26102294	Efficient (80–95%) knock-down of OCT4A was confirmed with 3 different siRNA, in addition to a 3 siRNA pool (Fig.	7489	7601
26102294	S3) and the molecular response to ETO was then examined by immunoblotting (Fig 4A) for key regulators of DNA damage, (pCHK2, p53, p21Cip1, and RAD51).	7602	7752
26102294	These experiments revealed p53, RAD51 and pCHK2 were all upregulated from day 1 independently of OCT4A expression.	7753	7867
26102294	p21Cip1 expression rose gradually from day 1 throughout the course of experiment as seen in previous experiments.	7868	7981
26102294	Silencing of OCT4A resulted in a marked increase in p21Cip1 expression from day 1.	7982	8064
26102294	These results imply that the presence of OCT4A induced by DNA damage suppresses p21Cip1 expression despite comparable levels of p53 expression and equivalent DNA damage as judged by RAD51 and pCHK2 expression.	8065	8274
26102294	When investigating the cell cycle response, loss of OCT4A caused an almost identical phenotype to that previously reported with p53 silencing24 i.e. OCT4A-silenced cells underwent a profound G2M arrest with apoptosis being greatly reduced (Fig.	8275	8519
26102294	4B and C).	8520	8530
26102294	The cells displayed the large, flattened morphology and Sa-β-gal staining associated with senescence on day 5 (Fig.	8531	8646
26102294	4D), identical to that previously reported when silencing p53.	8647	8709
26102294	Thus, the increase in G2M arrest and increased accelerated senescence previously observed with p53 silencing appears to be entirely due to the loss of the induction of OCT4A.	8710	8884
26102294	Prolonged loss of OCT4A lead to the polyploidisation of these senescent cells and a reduction in clonal recovery (Fig.	8885	9003
26102294	5).	9004	9007
26102294	The absence of off target effects was confirmed by repeating silencing and cell cycle analysis experiments with 3 separate siRNA molecules targeting different sequences of OCT4A mRNA (Supplementary Fig.	9008	9210
26102294	4).	9211	9214
26102294	Having established that OCT4A suppresses p21Cip1 and a senescent phenotype we sought to investigate the possibility of a reciprocal suppression of OCT4A by p21Cip1.	9215	9379
26102294	To do this p21Cip1 was silenced using siRNA.	9380	9424
26102294	Silencing of p21Cip1 was efficient as judged by immunoblotting but was not found to affect the expression of OCT4A in the presence or absence of ETO treatment (Fig.	9425	9589
26102294	6).	9590	9593
26102294	Furthermore, we detected no difference in the cell cycle profiles of p21Cip1-silenced cells compared to control siRNA treated cells following ETO treatment.	9594	9750
26102294	In summary, we found that OCT4A tempers p21Cip1 upregulation, restricting entry into senescence, indicating that co-expression defines the pre-senescent state.	9751	9910
26102294	While p21Cip1 did not regulate OCT4A expression or change the cell cycle, depletion of OCT4A profoundly impacted it.	9911	10027
26102294	We also found that p53-activated OCT4A does not support the pluripotency network in pre-senescent cells (owing to the lack of SOX2/NANOG co-ordination), leaving its biological role unclear.	10028	10217
26102294	We, therefore, interrogated its possible role as a stress responder where one of these stresses may be metabolic.	10218	10331
26102294	AMPK is a key sensor of metabolism and energy status.27 Therefore, we next explored the activation of AMPK by virtue of its phosphorylation at Threonine 172 (pAMPKThr172), in relation to OCT4A expression.	10332	10536
26102294	The results of this comparative study are shown in Fig.	10537	10592
26102294	7.	10593	10595
26102294	Microscopy of control, untreated, cells revealed heterogeneous pAMPKThr172 activation with expression in some cell nuclei and also in centrosomes, central spindle and mid-bodies of mitotic cells as described previously,28 and rarely ( <1% cells), in the cytoplasm (Fig.	10596	10865
26102294	7A, upper row).	10866	10881
26102294	In ETO-treated cells the staining for AMPK increased and strikingly coincided with the localization and intensity of staining for OCT4A in most cells (Fig.	10882	11037
26102294	7A, second row) as also confirmed by IF measurements, where clear correlation was shown (Fig.	11038	11131
26102294	7B).	11132	11136
26102294	However, while OCT4A is seen homogenously throughout the nucleus pAMPKThr172 staining revealed a fine (euchromatic) nuclear pattern, which indicates binding to chromatin, unlike OCT4A.	11137	11321
26102294	Intense staining of pAMPKThr172 was also found in apoptotic cell nuclei and bodies, while OCT4A was not (Fig.	11322	11431
26102294	7C).	11432	11436
26102294	In arrested metaphases appearing after ETO on day 4, pAMPKThr172 was localized to multiple centrosomes, while OCT4A was not (Fig.	11437	11566
26102294	7A, second row).	11567	11583
26102294	This difference in staining was confirmed by co-staining for γ-tubulin and AURORA B kinase (not shown).	11584	11687
26102294	Together, these data indicate that OCT4A is co-ordinately regulated alongside pAMPKThr172 in interphase cells but that in apoptotic cells their functions may differ.	11688	11853
26102294	Moreover, the concordant expression of OCT4A and pAMPKThr172 in interphase cells suggests that the p53-dependent OCT4A induction is a result of a stress response following ETO treatment.	11854	12040
26102294	As a part of its role as a central metabolic regulator, AMPK is directly involved in the regulation of autophagy.29 In this regard, previous studies have shown that autophagy is implicated in the chemo-resistance to ETO and this effect is reversed by inhibition of AMPK, which led to cell death by apoptosis.30 Conversely, cellular senescence is also associated with autophagy30 representing another potential cell fate phenotype following ETO-treatment.24 p16ink4a is believed to drive irreversible senescence.	12041	12552
26102294	31 Therefore, we next decided to explore the relationship of p16ink4a and macroautophagy.	12553	12642
26102294	Autophagy was verified using immunofluorescence for p62 as a marker of autophagy.	12643	12724
26102294	Post ETO treatment, an increase in the number of p62 foci/cell was observed by immunofluorescence (Fig.	12725	12828
26102294	8A and B) and mean number of p62 foci/cell in 3 independent experiments was shown to increase > 5-fold (Fig 8C).	12829	12941
26102294	Bafilomycin A (Baf) halted autophagic flux in ETO-treated cells (shown as an accumulation of LC3B in relation to LC3A), confirming functional autophagy and its suppression (Fig.	12942	13119
26102294	8D).	13120	13124
26102294	Baf treatment also enhanced cell death preventing clonogenic recovery only in ETO-treated cells (Fig.	13125	13226
26102294	S5), which indicates the importance of autophagy for cell survival after DNA damage.	13227	13311
26102294	We then assessed immunostaining for p16ink4a and LAMP2 in the presence and absence of Baf post ETO treatment.	13312	13421
26102294	LAMP2 is an important regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, required for the maturation of functional autophagosomes.	13422	13536
26102294	In control, untreated cells, p16ink4a was observed in ˜5% of cells as small aggresomes, surrounded by LAMP2-positive foci (data not shown).	13537	13676
26102294	In ETO-treated cells (day 4), the cytoplasm was highly enriched with LAMP2, while p16ink4a-positive aggresomes (larger and more numerous than in control) were sequestered in autophago-lysosomes (Fig.	13677	13876
26102294	9 A and B).	13877	13888
26102294	Approximately 30% of cells were seen to accumulate large amounts of p16ink4a in multiple aggresomes, as measure by >3 aggresomes and/or diffusely detected within cytoplasm, or in large vacuoles (Fig.	13889	14088
26102294	9A-C), and often showed DNA in cytoplasm (Fig.	14089	14135
26102294	9C).	14136	14140
26102294	The proportion of such cells, with high levels of p16ink4a, increased fold2- (29 ± 6 .5 and 58 ± 3 .5, +/− Baf, respectively) as measured on day 4.	14141	14288
26102294	These observations indicate the important role of autophagy in sequestering and degrading p16ink4a in ETO-treated PA-1 cells, thus preventing senescence.	14289	14442
26102294	They also show that a considerable proportion of ETO-treated cells suffer from exhaustion of autophagy.	14443	14546
26102294	In ETO-treated samples counterstained with DAPI, we noted that the failure of macroautophagy to control and sequester p16ink4a in the cytoplasm coincided with prominent changes in cell nuclei, particularly following Baf treatment.	14547	14777
26102294	Nuclei became thinner, less intensely DAPI-stained (e.g.	14778	14834
26102294	Fig.	3432	3436
26102294	9C), or, more frequently, displaced to one of the cell poles by large autophagic vacuoles (Fig.	14840	14935
26102294	9B).	14936	14940
26102294	Twisting, thinning, and disintegrating cell nuclei were the main phenotypes of ETO+Baf-treated cells.	14941	15042
26102294	As detailed above, in their extreme distortions, the cell nuclei were displaced and squeezed by large autophagic vacuoles and attained a sickle-like shape (Fig.	15043	15203
26102294	9D).	15204	15208
26102294	It remains possible that the loss of sequestration of p16ink4a, distortion of cell nuclei and loss of DNA are all linked, belonging to a related series of processes associated with exhausted autophagy, which is further exaggerated by Baf where full disintegration of the cell nucleus and alveolar LC3-positive cytoplasm are evident (Fig.	15209	15546
26102294	10 A).	15547	15553
26102294	Trying to understand how the penetrability of the cell nuclei was related to DNA damage we stained with an antibody (PL2–6) which detects a unique epitope involving a ternary complex of histones H2A and H2B and DNA at the site of the chromatin attachment to lamin B1.32 We applied it to ETO-treated cell nuclei (day 4) combining it with a label for DNA damage (pCHK2).	15554	15922
26102294	The result shows (Fig.	15923	15945
26102294	10B) bright nuclear staining with PL2–6 in cell nuclei without DNA damage and its reduction in cell nuclei containing DNA damage, possibly suggesting that binding to lamin B receptors in compromised.	15946	16145
26102294	In view of this data, we decided to use detailed stoichiometric DNA image cytometry following ETO treatment in the presence or absence of Baf.	16146	16288
26102294	Typical histograms from one representative experiment are shown in Fig.	16289	16360
26102294	10C, while in Fig.	16361	16379
26102294	S6 comparative DNA histograms of selected normal- and sickle-shaped cell nuclei from ETO+Baf treatment are presented.	16380	16497
26102294	Measurements from ETO-treated cells revealed a peak of delay in late S-phase, which was augmented after Baf treatment showing apparent redistribution from G2 (4C) into <4C, which was exaggerated in selected sickle-type nuclei of ETO+Baf-treated cells (Fig.	16498	16754
26102294	S6).	16755	16759
26102294	These data support our microscopic observations that DNA is preferentially lost from the sickle-like shape nuclei in the cells as a result of failed autophagic processing with the proportion of sickle-like nuclei cells with sickle-like nuclei in ETO-treated samples increased more than 2-fold (2.38 ± 0.2) following Baf treatment (n = 3).	16760	17098
26102294	In this study, we expanded our investigation of the response of PA-1 embryonal carcinoma cells to DNA damaging chemotherapy.	17099	17223
26102294	We previously observed,24 a concurrent p53-dependent increase in OCT4A and p21Cip1 protein expression after ETO-treatment, with the resulting cells transiting through an apparently bi-potential state with hallmarks of both premature multi-centriolar mitoses and senescence.	17224	17497
26102294	Herein, we extended our analysis and highlight a hitherto unobserved DNA damage response (DDR) function of OCT4A following ETO treatment, which is different from its established pluripotency and self-renewal functions.	17498	17716
26102294	This p53-dependant DDR-induced OCT4A is not coordinated with SOX2 or NANOG activity, but does serve to suppress p21Cip1.	17717	17837
26102294	This finding is in accord with the previously shown observation that OCT4A can directly repress p21Cip1 expression by binding its promoter in the absence of SOX2 and NANOG.	17838	18010
26102294	33 Although not yet confirmed in other cell types or following different stimuli, this phenomenon likely relates to properties evidenced during embryonal ‘stemness’, as similar nuclear accumulation of OCT4A was similarly recently reported following laser beam damage of live ESC cells.34 Our measurements of OCT4A and p21Cip1 expression in individual cells revealed that cell fate, in response to extensive DNA damage, occurs with high levels of heterogeneity.	18011	18471
26102294	Both factors increase coordinately with huge variations in expression, covering (at day 5) a wide spectrum of p21Cip1 and OCT4A expression.35 These observations demonstrate a typical characteristic of self-organizing, adapting systems, using heterogeneity over time to provide bifurcations of cell fate choice.36,37 The increased variance in both factors – from day 3 until day 7 – corresponds to the period with most prominent cell death (99% cells will die and only <1% has the chance to survive, likely representing the degree of challenge that they must overcome).24 When OCT4A is silenced the level of p21Cip1 increases, more cells enter senescence and mitotic recovery is reduced, abrogating fragile balance in bifurcation point and removing the possibility for rare cells to choose survival as their fate.	18472	19284
26102294	It is worth noting that this response was phenotypically identical to that seen when silencing p53.24 We hypothesize that the loss of p53 or OCT4A in silencing experiments causes the loss of the embryonal G2M checkpoint leading to increased mitotic slippage, ultimately ending in terminal senescence rather than executing the G2M checkpoint function via apoptosis.	19285	19649
26102294	Continued silencing of OCT4A inhibited clonogenic recovery post ETO treatment highlighting the importance of the pre-senescent G2M arrest for clonogenic recovery of the small percentage of cells that are able to repair their DNA damage.	19650	19886
26102294	Silencing of OCT4A also leads to endoreplication in senescent cells further eluding to the presence of mitotic slippage.38 p21Cip1 silencing experiments demonstrated that the observed G2M arrest was independent of p21Cip1 expression.	19887	20120
26102294	Mitotic survival of the ETO-treated cells ultimately originates from metastable pre-senescence.	20121	20216
26102294	Theoretically, this means that the self-renewal function of OCT4A is finally restored.	20217	20303
26102294	The attractor of self-renewal fate in individual cells is high NANOG,39 released from direct suppression by p5340 and activated by OCT4A-SOX2 heterodimer.	20304	20458
26102294	Although NANOG is only found in a very small number of PA-1 cells, its role requires further exploration.	20459	20564
26102294	This moderator function of DDR-induced OCT4A occurs alongside activation of AMPK.	20565	20646
26102294	AMPK is an evolutionary conserved low-energy checkpoint that operates as a master regulator of cellular metabolism and activator of autophagy.	20647	20789
26102294	AMPK also acts as a genomic stress sensor that is required for the adaptation of metabolism switches and the DDR for efficient repair of DNA.41 We previously observed a bidirectional relationship between AMPK and ATM/CHK2 pathways that integrates both the metabolic and DNA damage stress signaling.42 AMPK activation was previously shown as necessary for maximal stress-induced transcription of p53-dependent genes that promote cell survival.43 Interestingly, AMPK has also been shown to activate and stabilize p53.44,45 Thus, the energetic stress-response of AMPK is tightly linked to the DDR of p53.	20790	21391
26102294	The role of AMPK in the autophagy and cell death response after ETO has previously been reported.30 We previously revealed the p53-dependant DDR-induced elevation in OCT4A in PA-1 cells following ETO treatment.	21392	21602
26102294	Therefore, it was not unexpected that DDR-induced OCT4A and AMPK activation should be coordinately regulated by ETO as we observed here.	21603	21739
26102294	We found that while autophagy apparently remains functional, cells retaining both AMPK and DDR-induced OCT4A in cell nuclei are capable of preventing terminal senescence.	21740	21910
26102294	This data are in accordance with the report by Chitikova and colleagues, 46 who demonstrated that silencing mTOR (the antagonist of AMPK suppressing autophagy) in irradiated, apoptosis-resistant cells caused a reversal of senescence.	21911	22144
26102294	Thus OCT4A moderating p21Cip1 in collaboration with pAMPKThr172, supporting cells with metabolites and energy through autophagy and other means, channel cells through disadaptation chaos caused by high DNA damage toward a survival phenotype.	22145	22386
26102294	ETO-treated PA-1 cells struggle against terminal senescence in particular by autophagic sequestration and removal of its regulator p16ink4a.	22387	22527
26102294	There is much controversy regarding markers of terminal senescence and even what the process really is.	22528	22631
26102294	It has become recently apparent that terminal senescence is not only growth arrest,47 moreover, it is intrinsically associated with the origin of EMT22 and predicts poor clinical outcome after cancer treatment.48 In our previous and current article we have partly unravelled a mechanism showing that in response to DNA damage p53 induces 2 regulators of opposite cell fates.	22632	23006
26102294	The setting is interesting: although they both are positively regulated by the same up-stream inducer, OCT4A suppresses p21Cip1, while the latter does not directly suppress OCT4A.	23007	23186
26102294	Nevertheless, the scattering of the cells in expression of both through the phase space ending up in one of 2 cell fates presumes their reciprocity.	23187	23335
26102294	The observation of cell-to-cell variability can also be a result from biological oscillations in time.49 The best documented example of this is the p53-mdm2 oscillating system in which p53 oscillations are, indeed, crucial for cell recovery after DNA damage.50 It is, therefore, possible that heterogeneity in p53 due to oscillations results in downstream heterogeneity of both OCT4A and p21Cip1 in PA-1 cells.	23336	23746
26102294	Senescence is intrinsically associated with macroautophagy induction (regulated by AMPK and persistent DNA damage).	23747	23862
26102294	51 Here, we found that persistent DNA damage was associated with destruction of the ternary complex of histones (H2A and H2B) and DNA in their attachment to nuclear lamin B1 using a unique antibody reagent.32 This observation is in keeping with data of the thinning and disassembly of lamin B1 and leakage of DNA from cells as a feature of terminal senescence.52 Our DNA cytometric observations revealed a delay in late S-phase after ETO, augmented by BafA1.	23863	24321
26102294	The consequence of this delay would be under-replication of heterochromatin,53 appearance of single strand DNA breaks, demethylation and activation of the transposable elements (TE) ALU/LINE 1, whose mobility after ETO has already been described.54 As sequestering ALU mRNA and LINE 1 by autophagy in the cytoplasm has been reported as a mechanism for protecting against transposition,55 it therefore remains possible, (although purely speculative) that functional autophagy prevents terminal senescence in this manner also.	24322	24846
26102294	The model with the scenario of terminal senescence occurring due to activation of TE as discussed in several other studies.56-58 It follows then that terminal senescence may in fact be mainly triggered by several mechanisms, which potentiate each other and result from failure of autophagy.	24847	25137
26102294	Thus, autophagy should be a key target for preventing resistance of cancer stem cells to genotoxic therapies, a supposition supported by others.59,60 PA-1 is an ovarian teratocarcinoma (a germline tumor) cell-line, obtained from ATCC, with a stable near-diploid karyotype.61 It possesses functional p53, in spite of possible acquisition of one mutated allele reported at passages over 407.62 Importantly it retains the ability to differentiate into all 3 tissue types, thus possessing the features of embryonal carcinoma.61 The NTera 2 (NT2) cell line, obtained from ATCC and used as a positive control for pluruipotency genes OCT4A, SOX2 and NANOG.	25138	25787

26102294	Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad (GraphPad Software Ltd).	32123	32194
26102294	Student t-test was used to calculate the statistical significance of difference of means where appropriate.	32195	32302

28518143	Myocardial diastolic and systolic dysfunction is main characteristic of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM),1 which is mainly related to abnormal synthesis and utilization of ATP.2 The abnormal myocardial energy metabolism will inevitably impair myocardial structure and function, eventually increasing the risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure.3 Mitochondria are well established as the organelles responsible for cellular energy production, such that cellular ATP production is dependent on normal mitochondrial structure and function.	0	541
28518143	Mitochondrial fusion-related proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2) and mitochondrial fission-related proteins (Fis1, Drp1) maintain the dynamic balance of mitochondrial structure together.4, 5 Cardiac energy demand is very large, requiring myocardial cell to produce more ATP by the fusion of the mitochondria.6, 7 Obviously, the decreased expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2 will result in the decrease of ATP synthesis.	542	939
28518143	So, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of Mfn1 and Mfn2 expression is critical to understanding and treating DCM.	940	1056
28518143	The ubiquitin proteasome pathway is the predominant protein degradation pathway,8 and its activation is regulated by various proteins, such as gp78.9 This protein also forms a specialized tubule between the closely adjacent endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and facilitates the rapid transfer of calcium from the former to the latter.10 Besides, gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) consists of hemichannel, which can quickly transmit the materials, energy and electrical signals between adjacent cells.11, 12 Impaired GJIC will result in the leakage of intracellular ATP.	1057	1646
28518143	Therefore, the abnormal energy metabolism is not only related to the decrease of ATP synthesis, but also to the increase of ATP leakage.	1647	1783
28518143	It is reported that DCM can cause the decrease expression of mitochondrial fusion protein and gap junction protein,13, 14 although the mechanisms underlying these effects are not established.	1784	1975
28518143	In addition, whether the activation of the gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system is involved in DCM is not clear.	1976	2084
28518143	Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptors that is widely expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.	2085	2211
28518143	Early study found that the function of CaSR is to regulate the release of parathyroid hormone and maintain the body's calcium homeostasis.15 Furthermore, CaSR is also closely related to cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, apoptosis, brain development, wound healing, and so on.16, 17, 18 The increase of extracellular calcium concentration can directly activate CaSR, and some amino acids are also involved in the regulation of CaSR activation.19 Our previous study found that CaSR is involved in myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction and pulmonary hypertension, and so on.20, 21, 22 And we recently observed that the cardiac function and the expression of CaSR were decreased in the rat diabetic myocardium.23 Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the observed association between the CaSR and ATP remains unclear.	2212	3064
28518143	In present study, by using high glucose (HG)-induced energy metabolism disorder model in the primary cultured cardiomyocytes, we studied the effect of CaSR in maintaining ATP content and protecting the structure and function of mitochondria and gap junction.	3065	3323
28518143	The underlying mechanisms were also explored.	3324	3369
28518143	We detected the expression of CaSR in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes by immunoblotting with β-actin as a reference.	3370	3490
28518143	The results showed that compared with the control group, the expression of CaSR in HG group was significantly decreased.	3491	3611
28518143	Furthermore, the expression of CaSR in HG group was increased or decreased by the pretreatment of CaSR agonist (NPS R568) or CaSR antagonist (Calhex231), respectively (Figures 1a and b).	3612	3798
28518143	The results of chemiluminescence showed that the content of intracellular ATP in HG group was significantly lower than in control group.	3799	3935
28518143	NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment could significantly reduce or enhance the changes above (Figure 2a).	3936	4039
28518143	Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is generally regarded as a marker of stress response.	4040	4123
28518143	We firstly detected Hsp70 expression by immunoblotting with VDAC as a reference.	4124	4204
28518143	The results showed that the expression of Hsp70 was significantly upregulated in HG group (Figure 2b), indicating that HG induces the stress response.	4205	4355
28518143	The proton-transferring ability of mitochondrial respiratory chain is crucial to produce ATP.24 We observed that the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I–V) related proteins (ND1, SDHA, UQCRQ, COX5A, ATP5F1) and the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I–V) were decreased in HG group.	4356	4679
28518143	NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment could weak or enhance the above-mentioned effect induced by HG (Figures 2b and c).	4680	4797
28518143	Calcein-AM cobalt technology was used to detect the status (i.e., open versus closed) of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP).25 The fluorescence intensity in the control group was set as 100%, the fluorescence intensity in the HG group was significantly lowered to 28.34±2.49%.	4798	5093
28518143	NPS R568 increased the fluorescence intensity from 28.34±2.49% to 67.95±2.36%, while Calhex231 pretreatment further decreased the fluorescence intensity from 28.34±2.49% to 25.25±1.72% (Figure 2d).	5094	5291
28518143	An open mPTP has been previously shown to decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm).26 In the present study, the red/green fluorescence ratio in the control group was set as 100%.	5292	5481
28518143	The ratio was significantly decreased to 39.61±4.98% in HG group.	5482	5547
28518143	NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can increase or decrease the ratios from 39.61±4.98% to 95.11±6.34% or 28.81±4.40% (Figure 2e).	5548	5678
28518143	To elucidate the mechanism underlying the observed HG-induced mitochondrial respiratory chain disruption, immunoblotting was used to analyze the mitochondrial structure associated proteins in vitro.	5679	5877
28518143	The results showed that the expression of mitochondrial fusion-related proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2) was decreased and the expression of mitochondrial fission-related proteins (Fis1, Drp1) was increased in HG group.	5878	6085
28518143	NPS R568 attenuated the changes induced by HG, but no significant changes were observed after pretreatment with Calhex231 (Figure 3a).	6086	6220
28518143	The mitochondrial morphology was detected with the Mito-Tracker (red) staining.27 In the control group, the red dye was found to be widely distributed, and exhibited a ‘clubbed’ pattern, while in contrast, it was sparsely distributed, and assumed a ‘dotted’ pattern in HG group.	6221	6499
28518143	(Figure 3b).	6500	6512
28518143	NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can reduce or increase the changes caused by HG (Figure 3b).	6513	6608
28518143	Then the mitochondrial length of the control group was standardized as 100%, the mitochondria length in the HG group was decreased to 32.37±2.79% (Figure 3c).	6609	6767
28518143	NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can increase or decrease the mitochondria length from 32.37±2.79% to 98.75±5.95% or 28.02±4.41% (Figure 3c).	6768	6911
28518143	These data clearly indicate that HG can damage the function and structure of mitochondria in cardiomyocytes, decrease the synthesis of ATP.	6912	7051
28518143	In contrast, activation of CaSR provides protective effect.	7052	7111
28518143	We first detected the cell membrane associated gap junction protein by immunoblotting with Na+ K+-ATPase as a reference.	7112	7232
28518143	The results showed that the expression level of β-catenin, N-cadherin and Cx43 were significantly decreased in the HG group, while the expression level of Cx43 phosphorylation at Ser368 was significantly upregulated in HG group.	7233	7461
28518143	NPS R568 lightened the changes induced by HG, but no significant changes occurred after pretreatment with Calhex231 (Figure 4a).	7462	7590
28518143	Previous study have demonstrated that the downregulation of β-catenin and N-cadherin expression hinders both the complexes formation and cell adhesion, which then destroys GJIC ultimately.28 In the present study, the results of immunocoprecipitation showed that the expression level of complex was significantly decreased in the HG group.	7591	7929
28518143	NPS R568 and Spermine (a non-specific agonist) pretreatment could significantly enhance the complex level in HG group, while Calhex231 pretreatment could reduce the complex level (Figure 4b).	7930	8121
28518143	The effect of HG on the gap junction function was further observed using the scrape-loading dye transfer technique (SLDT).29 The green fluorescence was widely distributed in the control group, but only concentrated at the scratch marks in the HG group.	8122	8374
28518143	Although we detected the extracellular ATP content using the chemiluminescence method.	8375	8461
28518143	The results showed that the extracellular ATP content was significantly increased in the HG group (Figure 4d).	8462	8572
28518143	NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment could reduce or increase the effect of HG (Figure 4c and d).	8573	8668
28518143	Our results also showed that β-catenin (in cytoplasm and nucleus) and the p-GSK-3β were significantly increased in HG group, but the phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33 and Ser37 were decreased in HG group.	8669	8877
28518143	NPS R568 or Calhex231 led to a similar effect as mentioned above (Figure 5).	8878	8954
28518143	We firstly detected the gp78 expression.	8955	8995
28518143	The results showed that gp78 expression increased significantly in the HG group and Calhex231 group, while NPS R568 and Spermine obviously inhibited the action of HG (Figure 6a).	8996	9174
28518143	These results suggested that activation of CaSR can inhibit gp78 expression.	9175	9251
28518143	We then utilized the gp78-siRNA to investigate the role of gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system in HG-induced cardiomyocyte injury.	9252	9379
28518143	The results showed that the gp78-siRNA significantly inhibited the expression of gp78, but con-siRNA had little effect (Figure 6b).	9380	9511
28518143	Compared with the control group, the ubiquitination levels of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43 were markedly increased in HG group and Calhex231 group, which will inevitably decrease the Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43.	9512	9706
28518143	CaSR agonists and gp78-siRNA can weaken the influence of HG (Figure 6c).	9707	9779
28518143	Obviously, activated CaSR could protect cardiomyocytes by inhibiting the HG-induced activation of gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system.	9780	9911
28518143	In recent years, the morbidity and mortality of diabetes are increasing.30, 31 The major complication of diabetes is DCM,32, 33 which specific mechanism has not been clarified.	9912	10088
28518143	In the previous study, we found that the cardiac contraction and relaxation in diabetic rats was decreased,23 which is related to the unbalanced calcium homeostasis caused by downregulation of CaSR expression.	10089	10298
28518143	In present study, we, for the first time, explored that ATP flux disorder (the decrease of ATP synthesis and the increase of ATP leakage) is a crucial mechanism of DCM.	10299	10467
28518143	We observed the effects of HG on ATP content, the expression of CaSR, mitochondria, gap junction and other related protein in primary cultured cardiomyocytes, and analyzed the role and mechanism of CaSR expression change in abnormal myocardial energy metabolism.	10468	10730
28518143	Myocardial contraction and relaxation both require a large amount of ATP, which is mainly generated in mitochondrial respiratory chain in vivo.34 Our results showed that both the CaSR expression and the ATP content of cardiomyocytes was significantly decreased in HG group, suggesting that the two effects may be associated.	10731	11055
28518143	We also observed that the expression and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I–V) related proteins were decreased in HG group, and the pretreatment of NPS R568 or Calhex231 could reduce or further aggravate the above changes.	11056	11298
28518143	These results implicate the downregulated expression of CaSR is involved in the cardiac energy metabolism dysfunction induced by HG.	11299	11431
28518143	To explore the interaction of the downregulation of CaSR expression and the decreased expression and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I–V) related proteins under HG treatment, the mitochondrial related structural proteins were further examined.	11432	11696
28518143	The results showed that the expression of Fis1 and Drp1 were upregulated in HG group.	11697	11782
28518143	By contrast, the expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2 were downregulated in HG group.	11783	11859
28518143	Undoubtedly, the above-mentioned expression changes of Drp1, Fis1, Mfn2 and Mfn1 induced by HG will inevitably lead to the decrease of expression and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I–V) protein, which certainly result in the decrease of ATP synthesis.	11860	12133
28518143	Mitochondria synthesize ATP by the oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transfer of mitochondrial respiratory chain.24, 35, 36 The later depends on the proton pump to maintain normal Δψm.37 Thus, when the intracellular ATP content is reduced, the proton pump failure will inevitably lead to the decrease of Δψm which will further reduce the production of ATP by affecting the electron transfer.37, 38 Therefore, the decrease of intracellular ATP content and Δψm could form a vicious circle.	12134	12630
28518143	Our present study observed that the mPTP was significantly open and the Δψm was decreased in the HG group.	12631	12737
28518143	NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can alleviate or aggravate the changes induced by HG.	12738	12826
28518143	Obviously, the downregulation of CaSR expression is a critical mechanism leading to energy metabolism disorder induced by HG.	12827	12952
28518143	To analyze the reason for decrease of intracellular ATP content further, we simultaneously detected the extracellular ATP content (in cell culture medium).	12953	13108
28518143	The results showed that the content of extracellular ATP was increased.	13109	13180
28518143	As a water-soluble substance, ATP is difficult to pass the cell membrane.	13181	13254
28518143	As reported, GJIC in the pathological state can form an open hemichannel, releasing ATP and other small molecules into the extracellular fluid.39 So, we observed the altered expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) and other related proteins in HG condition.	13255	13505
28518143	Connexin (Cx) is a basic protein of GJIC, which allows rapid transfer of inorganic ions, ATP and other small molecules between the cells.12, 40 Among the Cx superfamily members, the Cx43 is abundantly expressed in myocardium,41 and is critical to maintain the structure and function of cardiac gap junction.	13506	13813
28518143	Clustered N-cadherin/β-catenin complexes at the plasma membrane appear to be a prerequisite for GJIC formed by Cx43.28 Furthermore, phosphorylation of Cx43 at Ser368 has been previously shown to cause GJIC dysfunction.42 Our experimental results showed that the expression of Cx43, N-cadherin and β-catenin protein were downregulated, the N-cadherin/β-catenin complexes were decreased, and p-Cx43 was significantly upregulated in HG group.	13814	14253
28518143	CaSR agonists or inhibitor pretreatment can reduce or aggravate the above-mentioned changes.	14254	14346
28518143	To further prove that the abnormal expression of Cx43 can cause the dysfunction of GJIC, SLDT was used.	14347	14450
28518143	Our results showed that yellow lucifer (green fluorescence) were widely distributed among cells in control group, but only existed in scratch in HG group.	14451	14605
28518143	NPS R568 pretreatment can lead the green fluorescence widely spread among cells in HG group.	14606	14698
28518143	These results collectively suggest that cardiac energy metabolism disorder caused by HG, not only related to the reduction of ATP synthesis induced by downregulating CaSR expression, but also with the increase of ATP leakage by dysfunction of GJIC.	14699	14947
28518143	The classical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in the early development of the embryo, organ formation, tissue regeneration and other physiological processes.43, 44, 45 Under pathological conditions, this pathway is also involved in the occurrence of cancer and metabolic syndrome.46, 47 We observed that the expression of β-catenin was downregulated on the cardiomyocytes membrane, but was upregulated in the cytoplasm and nucleus in HG group.	14948	15403
28518143	At the same time, the expression of p-GSK-3β protein was increased, the p-β-catenin was decreased in HG group.	15404	15514
28518143	NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can significantly inhibit or aggravate the above changes.	15515	15607
28518143	The decreased expression of β-catenin protein on the cell membrane could inhibit the complex formation of N-cadherin and β-catenin, which will damage the integrity of the hemichannel,48 resulting in the increase of ATP leakage.	15608	15835
28518143	Grol et al.49 found that increase of extracellular ATP could abnormally activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.	15836	15943
28518143	Remarkably, the downregulation of CaSR expression have a crucial role in this process.	15944	16030
28518143	Why the activation of CaSR can reduce the adverse effects of HG on mitochondria and cell gap junction?	16031	16133
28518143	We speculated that increase of intracellular calcium induced by activation of CaSR inhibit gp78 expression.	16134	16241
28518143	As mentioned earlier, gp78 can degrade some corresponding proteins by ubiquitin proteasome pathway.9, 50 Present study found that the expression of gp78 was significantly upregulated, while the expression of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43 were markedly downregulated in the HG group.	16242	16514
28518143	CaSR agonist pretreatment could significantly reduce the changes above.	16515	16586
28518143	Therefore, the activation of CaSR protect mitochondria and cell gap junction by inhibiting gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system.	16587	16711
28518143	To verify our speculation, we used siRNA to disrupt the synthesis of gp78 protein and detected the ubiquitination level of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43 by immunoprecipitation.	16712	16878
28518143	The results showed that the ubiquitination level of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43 were significantly increased in HG group.	16879	16992
28518143	The CaSR agonist and the gp78-siRNA both reduced the ubiquitination level of these proteins, and the CaSR inhibitor enhance the level of ubiquitination.	16993	17145
28518143	Goetz JG et al reported that the expression of gp78 protein decreased with the increase of intracellular Ca2+.10 The activated CaSR can increase the intracellular Ca2+ by activating the G protein-PLC-IP3 pathway, which inhibit the abnormal protein ubiquitination induced by gp78.	17146	17425
28518143	Based on the results and discussion of the present study, we suggest that HG induces downregulation of CaSR expression, which causes the activation of gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system.	17426	17610
28518143	On the one hand, activated ubiquitin proteasome promotes the degradation of Mfn1 and Mfn2, resulting in the decrease of ATP synthesis.	17611	17745
28518143	On the other hand, it degrades Cx43, causing ATP leakage (Figure 7).	17746	17814
28518143	These changes destroy the ATP homeostasis (ATP flux).	17815	17868
28518143	Therefore, the downregulation of CaSR expression is probably a crucial cause and mechanism of myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction in DCM.	17869	18016
28518143	Primary cultures of cardiomyocyte from neonatal Wistar rat aged 1–3 days were prepared, as previously described method.51 All the experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee for the Use of Experimental Animals at Harbin Medical University (Heilongjiang, China).	18017	18289
28518143	Briefly, in the super-clean worktable, the hearts were cut into pieces, digested with trypsin (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) for 8 min, then DMEM culture medium was added to terminate the digestion.	18290	18499
28518143	After 8 times of the same process, the cells were collected by 10 min centrifugation with 600 g at 4 °C.	18500	18604
28518143	Two hours after incubation at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, the attached cells were discarded and the unattached cells were continuously cultured.	18605	18768
28518143	The cardiomyocytes were plated in collagen-coated 35 mm petri dish and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin or streptomycin.	18769	18975
28518143	The media was changed two times per week.	18976	19017
28518143	The cultured cardiomyocytes were randomly divided into four groups: (1) Control group (Control): cardiomyocytes cultured with DMEM (glucose 5.5 mM, 10% FBS); (2) High glucose group (HG): cardiomyocytes cultured with DMEM containing high glucose (glucose 40.0 mM); (3) HG+NPS R568 group (HG+NPS R568): 5 μM NPS R568 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the medium for 30 min before HG incubation.	19018	19425
28518143	(4) HG+Calhex231 group (HG+Calhex231): 3 μM Calhex231 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the medium for 30 min before HG incubation.	19426	19572
28518143	The cardiomyocytes were incubated for 48 h. The mitochondria were isolated using previous method with slight modifications.52, 53 Briefly, cardiomyocytes were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with PBS at 4 °C.	19573	19799
28518143	Cells were resuspended with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails.	19800	19935
28518143	The cell suspension was homogenized on ice using a glass homogenizer.	19936	20005
28518143	The number of strokes was optimized by inspecting homogenate under the microscope for unintact cells.	20006	20107
28518143	The cell homogenate was then gently passed twenty times through a 26 G 1/2 needle using a 1 ml syringe and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4 °C.	20108	20255
28518143	The supernatant was collected in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged again at 800 g for 10 min at 4 °C.	20256	20369
28518143	The supernatant, which containing the crude mitochondria, was transferred to a new tube with 1.5 M sucrose solution which final concentration was 180 mM, then centrifuged at 14 000 g for 10 min to get the precipitation of mitochondrial.	20370	20606
28518143	Finally, the specific lysis solution for mitochondria (Beyotime Biotechnology) was used to get the mitochondria related proteins.	20607	20736
28518143	The cellular membrane was extracted by the Membrane and Cytosol Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology).	20737	20849
28518143	Briefly, Primary cardiac myocytes were inoculated into the 35 mm Petri dish.	20850	20926
28518143	After drug treatment, the cells were scraped off by a cell scraper, centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min, put into a pre-cooled EP 1.5 ml tube with cell membrane extraction reagent A containing PMSF for 15 min.	20927	21131
28518143	The cell suspension was homogenized on ice using a glass homogenizer.	19936	20005
28518143	The number of strokes was 120 times.	21202	21238
28518143	After centrifuged at 700 g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was carefully collected into the new 1.5 ml EP tube.	21239	21354
28518143	To precipitate cell membrane fragments, 14000 g centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C was used.	21355	21446
28518143	The supernatant was discard and 200 μl cell membrane extraction reagent B was added into this tube.	21447	21546
28518143	After vortex shock 5 s and ice bath 10 min were repeated 4 times, the tube was centrifuged at 14000 g for 5 min, the cell membrane proteins in supernatant were collected.	21547	21717
28518143	The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology) was used to isolate the cellular nucleus.	21718	21835
28518143	The experimental procedure was carried out per the manufacturer’s protocol.	21836	21911

28518143	At last, the ratio of JC-1 (red/green) was calculated on pictures.	23388	23454
28518143	The decline or rise of ratio represents the decrease or increase in Δψm.	23455	23527

28518143	Cardiomyocytes were seeded in 35 mm petri dish.	28270	28317
28518143	After treatments, cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer plus PMSF (Roche) for 30 min at 4 °C.	28318	28420
28518143	After 14000 g centrifugation for 20 min, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg specific antibody of anti-N-cadherin (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C before coupled to Protein A/G Magnetic Beads (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA) for 2 h according to the instructions of Protein A/G Magnetic Beads for IP (Biotool).	28421	28753

28518143	Then they were harvested and lysed in 1% SDS buffer (Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT).	28980	29069
28518143	The samples undergone the pull-down assays using anti-ubiquitin antibody and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Mfn1, anti-Mfn2 and anti-Cx43.	29070	29237
28518143	All experiments were replicated at least three times independently.	29238	29305
28518143	Differences between groups were analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).	29306	29390
28518143	The results are presented as the mean±standard error.	29391	29444
28518143	P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.	29445	29494
24632946	During embryonic development, the cloaca is a temporal structure that is subsequently divided into the urogenital sinus and rectum by the urorectal septum (hereafter referred to as the URS).1, 2, 3 The URS develops from the proximal umbilical mesenchyme (the rostral portion of the cloaca) around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) (Figure 1a, asterisk)3, 4, 5 and subsequently extends caudally along the cloaca reaching the cloacal membrane.	0	434
24632946	Part of the cloacal membrane degrades with the approximation of the URS tip.	435	511
24632946	As a result, the cloaca is divided into the urogenital sinus and rectum, and the tip of the URS (endodermal epithelia) contributes to forming the ectodermal epithelia of the perineum and external genitalia.6 The contribution of these cells and growth factors expressed in the endodermal epithelia are essential for the proper morphogenesis of the perineal region, based on the phenotypes of several mutants.	512	919
24632946	For instance, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in the endodermal epithelia and has an essential role in both URS formation and GT protrusion by affecting neighboring mesenchymal cells.7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Apoptotic cells are observed in the urogenital tract during URS formation, being distributed primarily in the epithelial layers of the URS, cloacal membrane and mesenchyme of the dorsal surface of the caudal hindgut at E11.5 and E11.75.5, 12 From E12.5, apoptotic cells are also observed in the URS mesenchyme and are thought to be involved in the transformation of the URS and disintegration of the cloacal membrane.5 Several congenital anomalies are frequently observed during urogenital organ development.	920	1629
24632946	These abnormalities are usually accompanied by deficient excretory and copulatory functions, influencing the quality of life of the patient.	1630	1770
24632946	In particular, the incidence of anorectal malformations (ARMs) is approximately 1 in 5000 human births;13 however, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of this condition are currently unknown.	1771	1963
24632946	ARM phenotypes are observed in several diseases, including Currarino syndrome, Townes Brocks syndrome and VACTERL complex.14, 15, 16, 17 Affected patients often display other malformations, such as anal fistulas, sacral malformations and renal malformations.	1964	2222
24632946	Human and mouse genetic analyses have shed light on the possible genetic causes of some of these abnormalities.	2223	2334
24632946	Several mouse mutants for hedgehog signaling genes, ephrin-Eph signaling genes, fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling genes and Wnt signaling genes are reported to display ARM phenotypes.18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Another causative factor for the development of ARM is all-trans retinoic acid (RA), a teratogen and active form of vitamin A. RA treatment in pregnant mice results in imperforate anus in embryos.23, 24 Although these reports have identified causative factors for ARM phenotypes, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of ARM and URS remain elusive.	2335	2907
24632946	The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for embryonic development, and its dysregulation has been implicated in developmental disorders and human diseases.	2908	3062
24632946	Wnt signaling is transmitted primarily via three divergent pathways: the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the planner cell polarity pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway.25, 26 β-Catenin is a key factor for the canonical Wnt pathway and also acts as a subunit of the cadherin protein complex, which controls cell–cell adhesion.	3063	3385
24632946	Owing to the early lethality of β-catenin-deficient mice,27 analyses of the function of β-catenin in organogenesis have been performed using conditional mutants.	3386	3547
24632946	Previous reports have revealed that β-catenin induces the differentiation of hair follicles during hair/skin development according to loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF) approaches.28, 29 The ectopic activation of canonical Wnt signaling results in the ectopic induction of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling, which is essential for hair follicle formation.30, 31 With respect to genital tubercle (primordia of external genitalia: GT) development, region-specific (ectodermal, endodermal and mesenchymal) modulation of the β-catenin gene has revealed essential functions, such as regulation of cell proliferation, epithelial integrity and protrusion/elongation of GT.8, 32, 33 However, the regulatory functions of the β-catenin gene during the development of the URS have not been investigated.	3548	4355
24632946	The current study aimed to investigate the function of the β-catenin gene in URS development.	4356	4449
24632946	We modulated the β-catenin activity in the endodermal epithelia and studied the phenotypic consequences of dysregulated endodermal β-catenin signaling for urorectal development.	4450	4627
24632946	Both β-catenin LOF and GOF mutations resulted in ARM phenotypes.	4628	4692
24632946	The β-catenin GOF mutation led to the ectopic induction of Bmp signaling.	4693	4766
24632946	Moreover, the ARM phenotypes in the β-catenin GOF mutants were restored by additionally introducing the BmprIA gene mutation.	4767	4892
24632946	These results suggest that adequately controlled β-catenin signaling and its downstream growth factor signaling are essential for proper URS formation.	4893	5044
24632946	We first studied the kinetics of the contribution of URS epithelial cells.	5045	5119
24632946	We utilized ShhCreERT2 mice, which are knock-in mice of the tamoxifen (TM)-inducible form of Cre recombinase to the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) locus.34 The Shh gene was expressed in the endodermal epithelia at E10.5–13.5 (Figures 1a–d).	5120	5350
24632946	We crossed ICR female mice with ShhCreERT2/+; R26LacZ/LacZ male mice.	5351	5420
24632946	The pregnant females were subsequently treated with TM at E8.5–13.5, and the embryos were analyzed at E15.5 (Figures 1e–j).	5421	5544
24632946	There were few LacZ-positive cells in the perineal epithelia, urethra and rectum in the embryos upon TM treatment at E8.5 (Figure 1e).	5545	5679
24632946	In contrast, numerous LacZ-positive cells were observed in the perineal epithelia, urethra and rectum in the embryos with E9.5 or E10.5 treatment (Figures 1f and g, red arrows).	5680	5857
24632946	We observed a reduced number of LacZ-positive cells in the perineal ectodermal epithelia following later stage TM treatment, such as at E11.5 and E12.5 (Figures 1h and i).	5858	6029
24632946	Following E13.5 TM treatment, the perineal epithelia were not positive for LacZ signals (Figure 1j).	6030	6130
24632946	These results indicate that the Shh-positive endodermal epithelia labeled by E9.5–10.5 TM treatment can primarily contribute to the perineal epithelium.	6131	6283
24632946	We then asked whether β-catenin regulates URS formation.	6284	6340
24632946	We first analyzed the expression of β-catenin using immunohistochemistry.	6341	6414
24632946	The β-catenin expression was detected in the endoderm, including the URS epithelia, in the wild-type embryos at E11.5 (Figure 1k).	6415	6545
24632946	We next used the ShhCreERT2 system to either constitutively activate or inhibit the β-catenin activity in the endodermal epithelia and studied the effects of dysregulated endodermal β-catenin signaling on URS development.	6546	6767
24632946	β-Catenin floxed mutant mice (β-cateninflox), which contain two loxP sites flanking exons 3–6,28 were crossed to ShhCreERT2, and conditional deletion of β-catenin in the URS epithelia was achieved with TM treatment.	6768	6983
24632946	ShhCreERT2/+; β-cateninflox/− (β-catenin LOF) mutants were analyzed at E18.5 subsequent to TM treatment at E9.5, E11.5 or E13.5 (Figures 2b–d and b′–d′).	6984	7137
24632946	The formation of the URS was perturbed by early-stage TM treatment.	7138	7205
24632946	The mutants treated with TM at E9.5 displayed cleft-like phenotypes in the perineal region (Figures 2b and b′, red arrowheads).	7206	7333
24632946	In addition, anal stenosis was observed in the E9.5-TM-treated mutants (Figure 2b′).	7334	7418
24632946	TM treatment at E11.5 resulted in hypospadias-like phenotypes, although no perineal clefts were observed (Figures 2c and c′).	7419	7544
24632946	The perineal region in the E13.5-TM-treated embryos appeared to be normal (Figures 2d and d′).	7545	7639
24632946	We further analyzed the differentiation of the perineal epithelial cells in the E9.5-TM-treated mutants.	7640	7744
24632946	The expression of keratin 1 (a marker of prickle cells) and filaggrin (a marker of granule cells) was analyzed (Figures 3a–e).	7745	7871
24632946	The perineal epithelia of the wild-type embryos expressed both markers at E18.5 (Figures 3a and d, red arrowheads).	7872	7987
24632946	The expression of these markers was also observed in the perineal epithelia of the E9.5-TM-treated β-catenin LOF mutants (Figures 3b and e, blue arrowheads), indicating that the differentiation of the URS epithelial cells in the β-catenin LOF mutants proceeded normally.	7988	8258
24632946	Next, a constitutively active β-cateninflox(ex3) mutant allele was analyzed to determine whether the enhanced β-catenin activity affects the formation of the URS.	8259	8421
24632946	The Cre activity derived from the ShhCreERT2 allele regulated by TM treatment at E9.5, E11.5 or E13.5 induced a constitutively active β-catenin lacking the N-terminal domain phosphorylation sites essential for its degradation (Figures 2e–g and e′–g′).	8422	8673
24632946	An augmentation of β-catenin expression and its activity as a component of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in E9.5-TM-treated β-catenin GOF mutants were assessed by immunohistochemistry and transgenic reporter, respectively (Supplementary Figures S1a–f).	8674	8920
24632946	Similar to that observed in the β-catenin LOF mutants, early TM treatment resulted in hypoplasia during URS/perineal formation in the β-catenin GOF mutants (Figures 2e, f, e′ and f′, red arrowheads).	8921	9120
24632946	The URS in the E9.5-TM-treated mutants did not reach to the cloacal membrane, leading to incomplete cloacal division of the urogenital sinus and rectum (Figures 2e and e′).	9121	9293
24632946	This phenotype was slightly milder in the E11.5-TM-treated mutants and was not observed in the E13.5-TM-treated mutants (Figures 2f, g, f′ and g′).	9294	9441
24632946	The expression of keratin 1 and filaggrin was also examined in the β-catenin GOF mutants (Figures 3c and f).	9442	9550
24632946	Expression of these markers was not detected in the perineal epithelial region in the E9.5-TM-treated mutants (Figures 3c and f, demarcated by blue squares).	9551	9708
24632946	These results suggest that the GOF β-catenin mutation perturbs the cell differentiation of the URS epithelium and that the proper dose of β-catenin activity in the URS epithelium at early embryonic stages is essential for the formation of the URS.	9709	9956
24632946	To analyze cellular mechanisms inducing mutant phenotypes, we next performed cell proliferation and death analyses in the E9.5-TM-treated β-catenin LOF and GOF mutants.	9957	10125
24632946	The β-catenin LOF mutants displayed hypoplastic URS and markedly reduced cell proliferation of the URS mesenchyme at E11.5 (Figure 3h).	10126	10261
24632946	Decreased mesenchymal cell proliferation was also observed at E13.5 using phosphohistone H3 (pHH3) immunostaining (Supplementary Figure S2).	10262	10402
24632946	However, the cell proliferation of the URS epithelia was comparable with that observed in the controls (Figure 3h).	10403	10518
24632946	On the other hand, the β-catenin GOF mutants displayed hypertrophy and an increased number of cell proliferation in the URS epithelia at E11.5 (Figure 3i).	10519	10674
24632946	This hypertrophic layer was confirmed to be derived from endodermal epithelia using labeling with the ShhCreERT2 system (Supplementary Figure S3).	10675	10821
24632946	As for the mesenchymal cell proliferation in the URS, the β-catenin GOF mutants did not display marked alteration at E11.5 (Figure 3i); however, cell proliferation was decreased at E13.5 (Figure 3k).	10822	11021
24632946	Moreover, we also analyzed the cell death status to judge whether the apoptotic cells were prominent enough to induce elongation defects of the URS in both mutants.	11022	11186
24632946	The distribution of apoptotic cells in the URS mesenchyme was not increased in either the β-catenin LOF or GOF mutants at E11.5 and E13.5 (Figures 4f and h; Supplementary Figure S4).	11187	11369
24632946	These results suggest that the reduced cell proliferation of the URS mesenchyme observed in both the β-catenin LOF and GOF mutants possibly contributes to defective URS elongation.	11370	11550
24632946	Of note, the β-catenin GOF mutants displayed less apoptotic cells in the URS epithelia compared with the controls at E11.5 and E12.5 (Figures 4a, b, f, g, k, l, p and q, red arrows and surrounded by red dotted line).	11551	11767
24632946	This reduced amount of cell death and increased level of cell proliferation possibly resulted in hypertrophy of the URS epithelia at E11.5 (Figure 3i).	11768	11919
24632946	Subsequently, at E13.5 and later embryonic stages, augmented apoptotic cells were observed in the hypertrophic URS epithelia of the β-catenin GOF mutants (Figures 4c–e, h–j, m–o and r–t, blue arrows and surrounded by blue dotted line).	11920	12155
24632946	Such elevated URS epithelial apoptosis may contribute to the lack of differentiation of perineal epithelial cells in the β-catenin GOF mutants (Figures 3c and f).	12156	12318
24632946	Next, we investigated possible causes of the ARM phenotype in the β-catenin GOF mutants.	12319	12407
24632946	Several previous reports have demonstrated the ectopic activation of Bmp signaling in ectodermal β-catenin GOF mutants.31, 32 We therefore analyzed the expression of several Bmp signaling-related molecules in the β-catenin GOF mutants.	12408	12643
24632946	The expression of the Bmp4 gene was observed in the mesenchyme of the URS in the wild-type embryos at E13.5 (Figure 5a).	12644	12764
24632946	The Bmp4 gene expression was ectopically observed in the URS epithelia, in addition to the URS mesenchyme, in the β-catenin GOF mutants (Figure 5e, red arrowheads).	12765	12929
24632946	The ectopic expression of Bmp7 was also observed in the URS epithelia (Figures 5b and f, red arrowheads).	12930	13035
24632946	We also analyzed the downstream molecules of Bmp signaling.	13036	13095
24632946	One of the downstream genes of Bmp signaling, Msx2, was ectopically expressed in the URS epithelia (Figures 5c and g, red arrowheads).	13096	13230
24632946	Moreover, the expression of phosphorylated Smad (pSmad)1/5/8 was increased in both the epithelia and mesenchyme of the mutant URS (Figures 5d and h, red arrowheads).	13231	13396
24632946	To further ascertain the contribution of ectopic Bmp signaling in the abnormal development of the URS in the β-catenin GOF mutants, we analyzed the URS development in compound mutants for the β-catenin GOF mutation and one of the Bmp receptors (BmprIA).	13397	13650
24632946	Although the compound mutants (ShhCreERT2/+; β-cateninflox(ex3)/+; BmprIAflox/−) displayed the perineal cleft, URS elongation was substantially reversed in these mutants compared with that observed in the ShhCreERT2/+; β-cateninflox(ex3)/+ mutants under E9.5-TM administration (Figures 5i–k and k′, blue arrowhead).	13651	13966
24632946	These results may suggest that the ectopically induced endodermal Bmp signaling by augmented β-catenin signaling partly contributes to the ARM phenotypes of β-catenin GOF mutants.	13967	14146
24632946	ARM is one of the most frequently observed congenital diseases in humans.	14147	14220
24632946	However, the pathogenic mechanisms of ARM, including the developmental mechanisms of the URS, a key structure for the formation of the urogenital sinus and rectum, have not been elucidated.	14221	14410
24632946	The current analysis demonstrated perineal clefts and deficient URS elongation phenotypes in both β-catenin LOF and GOF mutants.	14411	14539
24632946	In the case of human ARMs, there are several types of symptoms.35 Focusing on the location of the anal opening, the phenotype of β-catenin LOF mutants may be similar to perineal fistulas, a benign type of ARM.	14540	14749
24632946	In contrast, the phenotype of β-catenin GOF mutants may be similar to a severe type of ARM, namely rectourethral bulbar fistulas, abnormal communications or fistulas, between the rectum and urinary tract.	14750	14954
24632946	These classifications are usually thought to reflect the severity of symptoms, presumably because of the different pathogenic causes.	14955	15088
24632946	β-Catenin is expressed in the normal URS epithelia.	15089	15140
24632946	β-Catenin LOF mutants displayed decreased cell proliferation in the URS mesenchyme.	15141	15224
24632946	This is considered to affect directly to the size of the URS.	15225	15286
24632946	β-Catenin is essential for inducing the expression of several growth factors in the gut endoderm, including the small intestine.36, 37 Likewise, the β-catenin expressed in the URS epithelium may affect downstream growth factor signals.	15287	15522
24632946	The regulation of mesenchymal development is known to occur via the actions of endodermally derived growth factors, such as Shh.	15523	15651
24632946	It has also been suggested that Shh positively regulates the cell proliferation of URS mesenchymal cells.7 The level of β-catenin in the endodermal epithelia is reduced in Shh-null mutants, and the Shh expression is reduced in β-catenin conditional mutants.8 These previous results suggest the possibility of the reduction of downstream growth factor signaling associated with reduced cell proliferation in β-catenin LOF mutants.	15652	16081
24632946	The current results suggest that growth factor signaling, including β-catenin, can regulate URS elongation by affecting URS mesenchymal cell proliferation.	16082	16237
24632946	On the other hand, the β-catenin GOF mutants also displayed ARM phenotypes.	16238	16313
24632946	In this study, we focused on the ectopic induction of Bmp signaling in the URS epithelia and mesenchyme and found that the ARM phenotypes of the β-catenin GOF mutants were partly restored by the additional mutation of Bmp signaling.	16314	16546
24632946	In addition, previous reports have suggested that the ectopic induction of β-catenin signaling can induce the ectopic Fgf8 expression in the cloacal endoderm.8, 11, 32 These findings may indicate that the ectopic induction of several growth factors perturbs proper URS development.	16547	16828
24632946	We also observed transiently reduced apoptosis and subsequently increased apoptosis in the URS epithelium in the β-catenin GOF mutants.	16829	16964
24632946	Such continuous cell death may affect the maturation of the URS epithelia and contribute to phenotypic differences between β-catenin LOF and GOF mutants.	16965	17118
24632946	In support of these findings, null mutants of the Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1) gene, which is primarily expressed at the apical URS endoderm and cloacal membrane, displayed urorectal defects, and the exogenous addition of Wif1 proteins in an urorectal culture caused cloacal membrane disintegration.	17119	17420
24632946	Our results demonstrate that spatiotemporally and properly controlled levels of URS epithelial β-catenin signaling are essential for cloacal septation and that dysregulation of endodermal β-catenin signaling leads to abnormal downstream growth factor activity.	17421	17681
24632946	The current results are considered to contribute to the better understanding of the pathogenesis of ARM.	17682	17786
24632946	The mutant mice used in this study were ShhCreERT2, Rosa26R (R26LacZ), β-cateninflox, β-cateninflox(ex3), BmprIAflox, TopGAL and CAG-Cre.28, 34, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42 The genotypes of each strain were determined as reported previously.	17787	18019
24632946	To obtain ShhCreERT2/+; R26LacZ/+ mice, ShhCreERT2/+; R26LacZ/LacZ male and Jcl:ICR (CLEA Japan, Osaka, Japan) female mice were crossed.	18020	18156
24632946	The BmprIA-null allele (BmprIA+/−) was generated using BmprIAflox and CAG-Cre driver mice.41 The mouse embryos were processed for X-gal or immunohistochemical staining.	18157	18325
24632946	Noon of the day on which the vaginal plug appeared was designated as E0.5.	18326	18400
24632946	All experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the Committees on Animal Research at Wakayama Medical University and Kumamoto University.	18401	18549
24632946	The mouse embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) with PBS, dehydrated with methanol and embedded in paraffin.	18550	18702
24632946	Then, 6-μm serial sections were prepared.	18703	18744
24632946	Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed using standard procedures.	18745	18816
24632946	X-gal staining was carried out as described previously.43 The X-gal-stained samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned.	18817	18941
24632946	The immunohistochemical analysis was performed according to standard procedures using anti-β-catenin antibodies (1 : 100; BD Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) antibodies (1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Tokyo, Japan), anti-keratin 1 antibodies (1 : 200; Covance, Tokyo, Japan), anti-filaggrin antibodies (1 : 300; Covance), anti-pSmad1/5/8 antibodies (1 : 300; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-pHH3 (Ser10) antibodies (1 : 1000; Merck Millipore, Tokyo, Japan).	18942	19436
24632946	Signal amplification was performed using the appropriate VECTASTAIN ABC IgG Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), and the immunocomplexes were detected with DAB staining.	19437	19617
24632946	For the cell proliferation assays, pregnant females were injected with 100 mg of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich) per kg of body weight.	19618	19767
24632946	One hour after injection, the embryos were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry with anti-BrdU antibodies (1:300; Roche, Mannheim, Germany).	19768	19920
24632946	For the cell death analyses, a TUNEL assay was performed with the In situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan).	19921	20042
24632946	Section in situ hybridization for the gene expression analyses was performed as described previously.44 The antisense riboprobe templates have been described previously: Shh (kindly provided by Dr. C Shukunami, Hiroshima, Japan), Bmp4,45 Bmp7 (kindly provided by Dr. M Yoshida, Kobe, Japan) and Msx2 (kindly provided by Dr. Hill RE, Edinburgh, UK and Dr.	20043	20397
24632946	I Satokata, Niigata, Japan).	20398	20426
24632946	The TM-inducible Cre recombinase system removes the floxed sequence from the target genome.46, 47, 48 A 10 mg/ml stock solution of TM (T-5648; Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in sesame oil.8 The pregnant females received 0.1 mg of TM per g of maternal body weight intraperitoneally at the indicated time points.	20427	20734
24632946	No overt teratological effects were observed under these conditions.8, 43, 49	20735	20812
27172902	Cisplatin (cis-DDP, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)), a platinum-based anti-tumor drug, is one of the most commonly used metal-containing compounds in medicine [1–3].	0	168
27172902	Cisplatin and its analogues (i.e., carboplatin and oxaliplatin) are among the most potent chemotherapy drugs used for cancer treatment [1, 3].	169	311
27172902	The discovery of cisplatin as an anti-cancer drug in the 1960s by Rosenberg and colleagues ushered in a new paradigm in cancer treatment [3, 4].	312	456
27172902	Cisplatin is thought to damage rapidly growing tumor cells via the induction of apoptosis following the inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G1, S, or G2-M phase [1, 5, 6].	457	670
27172902	Cisplatin has clinical benefits for several types of solid tumors.	671	737
27172902	However, cisplatin treatment is frequently accompanied by toxic side effects and tumor resistance, which in turn leads to secondary malignancies [1–3].	738	889
27172902	In recent years, medical research has focused on elucidating the mechanisms underlying cancer drugs.	890	990
27172902	The development of new techniques to identify perturbations in cellular functions has increased knowledge of the molecular, physiological and pathological mechanisms of cancer drugs.	991	1173
27172902	In particular, emerging evidence has revealed the complex interplay that exists between the host immune system and many anti-cancer drugs.	1174	1312
27172902	However, little information is available regarding how cisplatin interacts with immune cells.	1313	1406
27172902	Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which cisplatin induces and suppresses immunological responses is needed to develop and optimize new therapeutic strategies using cisplatin.	1407	1612
27172902	In particular, cisplatin has been shown to induce immunosuppressive effects through the inhibition of T cell activity [7, 8].	1613	1738
27172902	However, little is known about how cisplatin suppresses innate and adaptive immunity.	1739	1824
27172902	Immunological interventions for tumor therapy have focused on two aspects: 1) immune cell-based tumor therapy such as dendritic cell (DC)-based tumor immunotherapy, and 2) immune checkpoint inhibition such as blocking PD-1/PD-L1.	1825	2054
27172902	Although these two approaches differ, both enhance tumor-targeted Th1-type T cell immunity by harnessing immunological power or by overcoming tolerance and suppression [9–12].	2055	2230
27172902	In this regard, DCs are the most potent cell type involved in both strategies.	2231	2309
27172902	In fact, DCs are the most important cell population for activating anti-tumor T cell responses.	2310	2405
27172902	However, tumors can also directly or indirectly induce DCs to both functionally and phenotypically favor the tumor environment [12–14].	2406	2541
27172902	DC activation leads to a cascade of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine production, migration to secondary lymphoid tissues, and priming of naïve T cells.	2542	2695
27172902	Therefore, these cells regulate immune homeostasis and the balance between tolerance and immunity [12, 13].	2696	2803
27172902	Most importantly, DCs play a critical role in regulating CD4 and CD8 T cell immunity by controlling Th1, Th2, and Th17 commitment; generating inducible Tregs; and mediating tolerance or immunostimulation [12, 13, 15].	2804	3021
27172902	It is believed that distinct DC subsets have evolved to control these different immune outcomes.	3022	3118
27172902	However, how these DC subsets mount different responses to inflammatory and/or tolerogenic signals to accomplish their divergent functions remains unclear.	3119	3274
27172902	The effects of anti-cancer drugs on the immune system remain controversial.	3275	3350
27172902	However, select chemotherapeutic agents primarily suppress DCs, and the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs on DC function requires further investigation in various inflammatory settings.	3351	3535
27172902	In this context, we characterized the effect of cisplatin on the function of DCs, which play crucial roles in bridging innate and adaptive immunity.	3536	3684
27172902	This study describes for the first time the key mechanisms involved in the switch to a tolerogenic DC phenotype that is induced by cisplatin following toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist activation of inflammation and the resulting consequences on T cell polarization.	3685	3950
27172902	Cisplatin at concentrations ≥ 25 μM or ≥10 μg/ml induces cell death of cancer cell lines and primary cultured cells, such as macrophages, via DNA fragmentation [16, 17].	3951	4120
27172902	Prior to conducting the current study, the viability of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) exposed to cisplatin was investigated to determine a cisplatin concentration that does not cause cell death and could therefore be used in subsequent experiments.	4121	4383
27172902	As expected, a cisplatin concentration over 10 μg/ml showed a cytotoxic effect on BMDCs when measured by MTT assay (Supplementary Figure S1A).	4384	4526
27172902	Therefore, cisplatin concentrations ≤ 10 μg/ml were used for subsequent experiments, as these concentrations did not reduce cell viability.	4527	4666
27172902	In addition, no significant decrease in DC viability following co-treatment with 10 μg/ml of cisplatin and 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was observed by MTT assay (Supplementary Figure S1B) or Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Supplementary Figure S1C).	4667	4940
27172902	This finding suggests that cisplatin is not cytotoxic to DCs when used at concentrations below 10 μg/ml.	4941	5045
27172902	Therefore, concentrations of 1 and/or 5 μg/ml of cisplatin were used for further investigation.	5046	5141
27172902	Elevated expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 as well as MHC class I and II following TLR agonist stimulation is a key feature of mature DCs.	5142	5303
27172902	However, the immunological actions of cisplatin, especially on DC maturation and function, remain unknown.	5304	5410
27172902	We therefore investigated whether treatment with cisplatin resulted in phenotypic alteration in DCs upon stimulation with LPS.	5411	5537
27172902	To accomplish this, CD11c+ DCs were identified using the gating strategy shown in Figure 1A.	5538	5630
27172902	The DCs were cultured for 8 days in OptiMEM supplemented with GM-CSF under standard conditions and then treated with LPS (100 ng/ml), cisplatin (5 μg/mL), or LPS (100 ng/mL) and cisplatin (1, 2, and 5 μg/mL) for one day.	5631	5851
27172902	The cisplatin treatment significantly decreased the LPS-induced expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 and MHC class I and II in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that cisplatin can alter the DC maturation phenotype.	5852	6088
27172902	However, the DCs that were treated with cisplatin alone did not show any increases or decreases in these markers (Figure 1B).	6089	6214
27172902	Importantly, the DCs that were co-treated with cisplatin (5 μg/mL) and LPS (100 ng/mL) showed significant reductions in the levels of the above surface molecules in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S2A).	6215	6431
27172902	The above findings suggest that cisplatin is involved in phenotypic alteration during TLR agonist-induced DC maturation.	6432	6552
27172902	Thus, we hypothesized that cisplatin influences DC function by regulating cytokine production.	6553	6647
27172902	To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed cytokine production in cisplatin-treated DCs following stimulation with various TLR ligands, including Pam3-CSK (TLR2), polyI:C (TLR3), LPS (TLR4), IMQ (TLR7), and ODN (TLR9).	6648	6864
27172902	Surprisingly, for all of the tested TLR agonists, cisplatin dramatically increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in activated DCs.	6865	7016
27172902	Furthermore, none of the tested TLR agonists inhibited or increased the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-12 (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S3).	7017	7201
27172902	These results indicate that cisplatin conditions DCs to produce a high amount of IL-10, independent of the specific TLR pathway being activated.	7202	7346
27172902	Next, we confirmed that cisplatin strongly induced intracellular IL-10 production in LPS-activated DCs.	7347	7450
27172902	We found that DCs co-treated with cisplatin and LPS exhibited a significantly higher percentage of IL-10-positive cells and that this percentage increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no changes were observed in the numbers of TNF-α-positive or IL-12p70-positive cells (Figure 2B).	7451	7739
27172902	Additionally, the co-treated DCs showed increased production of IL-10 in a time-dependent manner, whereas no changes were observed in the production of TNF-α or IL-12p70 (Supplementary Figure S2B).	7740	7937
27172902	A decrease in endocytosis is a hallmark of mature DCs, whereas tolerogenic DCs maintain higher endocytic ability.	7938	8051
27172902	To evaluate whether the antigen uptake ability of LPS-activated DCs is increased or decreased by cisplatin treatment, DCs were activated by LPS in the absence or presence of cisplatin and then assessed for their ability to uptake antigens by endocytosis using FITC-conjugated dextran.	8052	8336
27172902	A significantly lower percentage of FITC-positive DCs were observed among the LPS-stimulated DCs, while the cisplatin and LPS co-treatment enhanced the endocytic activity of DCs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C).	8337	8554
27172902	These results, together with the reduction of mature DC surface markers and the remarkable enhancement in IL-10 production, strongly suggest that cisplatin endows DCs with a tolerogenic property upon TLR stimulation.	8555	8771
27172902	Activation of the MAPK, cyclooxegenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and NF-κB signaling cascades increases IL-10 secretion in DCs [20, 21].	8772	8916
27172902	To examine whether these pathways are involved in increased IL-10 production following treatment with cisplatin, the expression and phosphorylation levels of MAPKs, including p38, ERK, and JNK; the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α; and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 were investigated by Western blot analysis (Figure 3).	8917	9254
27172902	In DCs co-treated with cisplatin and LPS, rapid and prolonged p38 phosphorylation and slightly activated JNK phosphorylation was observed compared to DCs treated with LPS alone.	9255	9432
27172902	Furthermore, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was decreased in the co-treated DCs compared to the DCs treated with LPS alone (Figure 3A).	9433	9560
27172902	Importantly, treatment with cisplatin alone had no effect on MAPK expression and phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S4A).	9561	9685
27172902	Additionally, COX-2 activation and PGE-2 expression were not changed by cisplatin treatment (Supplementary Figure S4B).	9686	9805
27172902	Cisplatin induced the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB-α and the nuclear translocation of p65 from the cytosol (Figure 3B and 3C).	9806	9942
27172902	To confirm the involvement of p38, JNK, and NF-κB in the above phenotypes, we next treated cells with specific pharmacological inhibitors (SB203580 for p38, SP600125 for JNK, and Bay11-7082 for NF-κB) and cisplatin and then evaluated IL-10 production following the cisplatin treatment.	9943	10228
27172902	These pharmacological inhibitors, particularly the p38 inhibitor, significantly abrogated cisplatin-induced IL-10 production in LPS-activated DCs (Figure 3D), suggesting that the p38 and NF-kB signaling cascades are the main pathways responsible for the cisplatin-induced production of IL-10 in LPS-activated DCs.	10229	10542
27172902	IL-10 induces the maturation and phenotypic alteration of DCs towards a tolerogenic state [22, 23].	10543	10642
27172902	Thus, we hypothesized that if cisplatin-induced increases in IL-10 production cause LPS-activated DCs to adopt a tolerogenic phenotype, the absence of IL-10 should restore an activated DC phenotype even in the presence of cisplatin.	10643	10875
27172902	To investigate whether the IL-10 increase stimulated by cisplatin induces DC phenotypic and functional changes, DCs isolated from IL-10−/− mice were treated with cisplatin, LPS or a combination of cisplatin and LPS (Figure 4).	10876	11102
27172902	The IL-10−/− DCs displayed the LPS-activated DC phenotype, including elevated levels of surface molecules (Figure 4A) and reduced endocytic activity (Figure 4C).	11103	11264
27172902	However, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-12p70) and decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were observed in the IL-10−/− DCs compared to WT DCs following co-treatment with LPS and cisplatin (Figure 4B).	11265	11514
27172902	We further confirmed that IL-10 induces LPS-activated DCs to become tolerogenic following cisplatin treatment through experiments in which we blocked the IL-10 cascade with an anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Figure 5).	11515	11739
27172902	Incubation of the co-treated DCs with an anti-IL-10 mAb, but not with control rat IgG, for 18 h restored their surface molecule expression levels (Figure 5A) and IL-12p70 production (Figure 5B) and decreased their endocytic activity (Figure 5C).	11740	11985
27172902	Collectively, these results indicate that the cisplatin-induced tolerogenic DC phenotype requires IL-10.	11986	12090
27172902	Cisplatin treatment in LPS-activated DCs induced them to adopt a tolerogenic phenotype.	12091	12178
27172902	Thus, we hypothesized that cisplatin treatment in LPS-activated DCs may reduce Th1 cell proliferation and alter T cell polarization.	12179	12311
27172902	To precisely characterize the role of cisplatin in DC and T cell interactions, we performed a T cell proliferation assay for antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using OT-I T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic CD8+ T cells and OT-II TCR transgenic CD4+ T cells (Figure 6).	12312	12582
27172902	LPS-treated or untreated DCs in the presence or absence of cisplatin were incubated with OVA257-264 or OVA323-339 peptides, and CFSE-labeled CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were co-cultured.	12583	12763
27172902	As shown in Figure 6A, the cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs reduced the proliferation of both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to the LPS-treated DCs.	12764	12918
27172902	Furthermore, naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells primed with cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs produced significantly lower levels of IFN-γ, IL-17A and IL-2 than those primed with LPS-activated DCs in a cisplatin dose-dependent manner (Figure 6B).	12919	13157
27172902	These results were confirmed by intracellular staining (Figure 6C).	13158	13225
27172902	Interestingly, IL-4, which is mainly produced by Th2-polarized T cells, was highly produced in CD4+ T cells primed with cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs compared to those co-cultured with LPS-treated DCs in a cisplatin dose-dependent manner (Figure 6B and 6C).	13226	13486
27172902	We then investigated the differentiation and polarization of CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th17 cells, regulatory T cells (Treg) and T regulatory type 1 cells (Tr1) after priming with LPS-activated DCs in the presence or absence of cisplatin by analyzing transcription factor expression levels.	13487	13791
27172902	Cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs induced Th2 type cells (CD3+CD4+GATA-3+) and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells (CD3+CD4+CD25−CD49b+LAG-3+Foxp3−IL-10+) but decreased the numbers of Th1 (CD3+CD4+T-bet+), Th17 (CD3+CD4+RoRγt+) and Treg cells (CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127−Foxp3+) (Figure 6D and 6E).	13792	14071
27172902	Additionally, cisplatin treatment produced the same proliferation and differentiation pattern for allogeneic T cells (Supplementary Figure S6).	14072	14215
27172902	These results suggest that cisplatin induces the differentiation of Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells and decreases the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to LPS-activated DCs.	14216	14408
27172902	IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs potently induce the differentiation of naïve T cells towards Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells [22, 24].	14409	14545
27172902	In the same context as the results shown in Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S6, we hypothesized that if IL-10 is a primary factor for inducing tolerogenic DCs and consequently polarizes CD4+ T cells towards Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, the absence of IL-10 in DCs may prime the differentiation of CD4+ T cells towards Th1 and Th17 cells.	14546	14891
27172902	Thus, we evaluated the capacity of IL-10−/− DCs to induce T cell proliferation, differentiation, and polarization using the same experimental conditions described in Figure 6 (results shown in Figure 7).	14892	15095
27172902	IL-10−/—derived DCs co-treated with cisplatin and LPS induced the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 7A) and polarized naïve CD4+ T cells towards Th1 and Th17 cells instead of Th2 and Tr1 cells (Figure 7B) compared with DCs derived from wild-type (WT) mice.	15096	15370
27172902	Finally, we confirmed that IL-10-producing Tr1-type T cells were not induced by IL-10−/—derived DCs in the presence of cisplatin (Figure 7C).	15371	15512
27172902	Collectively, these results indicate that cisplatin functionally and phenotypically induces DCs towards an IL-10-producing tolerogenic phenotype upon TLR stimulation.	15513	15679
27172902	These tolerogenic DCs consequently contribute to the development of Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, suggesting that IL-10 is a primary factor responsible for these cascades.	15680	15856
27172902	Based on the above in vitro results, we next examined whether cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs could suppress Th1-cell proliferation and induce the differentiation of Th2 and Tr1 cells in vivo (Figure 8 and Figure 9).	15857	16074
27172902	Briefly, Ly5.1+ OT-I and OT-II T cells were transferred to Ly5.2+ recipient mice.	16075	16156
27172902	The mice were intravenously injected with OVA protein-pulsed, LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs or OVA protein-pulsed, LPS-activated DCs one day after the T cell transfer.	16157	16319
27172902	At 5 and 7 days after the DC injections, we evaluated the frequencies and types of Ly5.1+ T cells induced by the LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs (Figure 8 and Figure 9) using flow cytometry.	16320	16503
27172902	As shown in Figure 8, significantly reduced frequencies of Ly5.1+CD44+CD4+ cells and Ly5.1+CD44+CD8+ cells were found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) (Figure 8A and 8B) and splenocyte (Figure 8C) populations isolated from the LPS/cisplatin-primed DC group compared to the LPS-activated DC group.	16504	16815
27172902	Importantly, the spleen cells isolated from the LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs group showed significantly reduced frequencies of Th1-type cells (IFN-γ-producing Ly5.1+CD4+ T cells) and IFN-γ-producing Ly5.1+CD8+ T cells compared with the LPS-primed DCs group in response to stimulation with OVA peptides (Figure 9A).	16816	17126
27172902	Additionally, the LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs group showed significant induction of Th2-type cells (IL-4-producing Ly5.1+CD4+ T cells) and Tr1 cells (IL-10-producing Ly5.1+CD25−Foxp3−CD4+ T cells) (Figure 9A and 9B).	17127	17340
27172902	Culture supernatants containing secreted cytokines were collected from the splenocytes following stimulation with OVA peptides and analyzed by ELISA.	17341	17490
27172902	The results showed that the LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs group robustly secreted both Th2-related cytokines and Tr1-related cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, whereas they secreted significantly low levels of Th1-related (IFN-γ) and Th17-related (IL-17A) cytokines (Figure 9C).	17491	17763
27172902	These results indicate that cisplatin-treated DCs have in vivo tolerogenic activity by inducing the differentiation of Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells and decreasing the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.	17764	17975
27172902	Although cisplatin is a common treatment for a broad spectrum of cancers, few studies have evaluated the effect of cisplatin treatment on the immune system.	17976	18132
27172902	In the present study, we described the molecular mechanisms that are required for the immunosuppressive effect of cisplatin, including the phenotypic alteration of DCs and their interactions with T cells, thereby improving our understanding of the immunological aspects of this cancer chemotherapy.	18133	18431
27172902	Cisplatin induced IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs upon TLR agonist treatment by activating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and these cisplatin-induced tolerogenic DCs promoted the generation of two distinct T cell subsets in vivo as well as in vitro: Th2-type T-cells and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells.	18432	18730
27172902	Several cancer drugs are also used as immunosuppressants for the treatment of severe systemic autoimmune diseases.	18731	18845
27172902	Interestingly, cisplatin has shown therapeutic potential for treating inflammation-mediated diseases under different pathophysiological conditions [25, 26].	18846	19002
27172902	For example, cisplatin was shown to ameliorate the symptoms of excessive inflammation-mediated diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), in vivo. EAE is a prototypic Th1-mediated autoimmune inflammatory disease, and Th17 cells are assumed to be crucial effector cells that drive central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and damage [25, 27].	19003	19369
27172902	In addition, low-dose cisplatin administration in a murine cecal ligation and puncture-induced polymicrobial sepsis model was found to attenuate inflammation and lethality.	19370	19542
27172902	Thus, cisplatin might be considered a candidate drug for the control of inflammatory and autoimmune processes.	19543	19653
27172902	However, it remains unclear how cisplatin ameliorates excessive inflammation.	19654	19731
27172902	Our findings help explain the immunomodulatory activities of cisplatin observed in these disease models.	19732	19836
27172902	The nature of DCs determines the quality of T cell responses and the establishment of either immunity or tolerance.	19837	19952
27172902	In a previous study, Dijkgraaf et al. showed that cisplatin treatment increased the PGE2-secreting potency of tumor cells to promote monocyte differentiation into IL-10-producing M2 macrophages.	19953	20147
27172902	These authors proposed a chemotherapy-induced increase in tumor-promoting M2 macrophages may provide an indirect mechanism for chemoresistance and that concomitant therapy with COX inhibitors might enhance the anti-tumor effect of cisplatin.	20148	20389
27172902	Similarly, our data showed that cisplatin directly skewed the phenotype and function of DCs towards IL-10-producing-tolerogenic DCs upon TLR ligand stimulation (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S3).	20390	20589
27172902	However, the COX-2-PGE2 pathway did not induce tolerogenic DCs and IL-10 production in our study (Supplementary Figure S4).	20590	20713
27172902	In addition, MyD88 or TRIF deficiency abrogated IL-10 production in cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs, indicating that TLR signaling is a prerequisite for the generation of IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs (Supplementary Figure S5).	20714	20944
27172902	Although it remains debatable whether the clinical success of cisplatin relies primarily on its ability to trigger apoptosis, cisplatin induces cell death mainly via apoptosis and eventually secondary necrosis, and endogenous TLR ligands are released during cell death.	20945	21214
27172902	Along with the recognition of microbial TLR ligands called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), an increasing number of endogenous TLR stimulators have been reported.	21215	21392
27172902	These endogenous molecules activate TLR signaling and are involved in many pathological processes.	21393	21491
27172902	For example, HMGB1 and heat shock proteins are either passively released from injured/inflamed tissues and dying cells or actively secreted by activated cells under pathological conditions.	21492	21681
27172902	Furthermore, even apoptotic cells may release these endogenous TLR ligands.	21682	21757
27172902	In addition, a single endogenous molecule, such as HMGB1, has the potential to interact with several TLRs.	21758	21864
27172902	Thus, these endogenous TLR ligands may participate in tumor progression.	21865	21937
27172902	In addition, evidence indicates that dying tumor cells release endogenous TLR ligands [30–32].	21938	22032
27172902	In fact, HMGB1 released following chemotherapy-induced cell death activates DCs via the TLR4-MyD88 axis, which leads to the induction of anti-tumor T-cell immunity.	22033	22197
27172902	IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs are potent inducers of naïve T cell differentiation towards Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells.	22198	22324
27172902	During sterile inflammation caused by the exposure of normal cells to anti-cancer drugs, an enormous number of cells undergo apoptosis and/or necrosis in different organs and tissues.	22325	22508
27172902	These dying cells release endogenous ligands, such as intracellular proteins and nucleic acids, which can bind to pattern recognition receptors, particularly those on tissue-resident innate immune cells such as DCs.	22509	22724
27172902	In response to activation signals, these cells can inhibit tissue damage by producing anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10.	22725	22851
27172902	However, because the large amounts of IL-10 that are present in the tumor microenvironment play a major role in suppressing the anti-tumor immune response, strategies to break tolerance by neutralizing the function of IL-10 are important for tumor treatment.	22852	23110
27172902	In a recent study, renal DCs attenuated cisplatin-induced kidney inflammation by producing a high level of IL-10 in response to cisplatin treatment.	23111	23259
27172902	In addition, in vivo cisplatin treatment directly caused a 10-fold increase of IL-10 production in renal DCs, but not in whole kidneys, indicating that DCs are the major source of IL-10 after cisplatin treatment.	23260	23472
27172902	However, little is known about the signaling pathways through which cisplatin triggers the generation of tolerogenic DCs after encountering inflammatory environments and their roles in preserving the tolerogenic properties of DCs.	23473	23703
27172902	Our current study is the first to perform a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the induction of tolerogenic DCs by cisplatin in the inflammatory environment.	23704	23888
27172902	We found that a large amount of IL-10 was produced after cisplatin treatment and that this production was stimulated through the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways (Figure 3).	23889	24063
27172902	Without an IL-10 signal, cisplatin-treated DCs did not differentiate into tolerogenic DCs, indicating that induction of tolerogenic DCs by cisplatin requires IL-10 production (Figure 4 and Figure 5).	24064	24263
27172902	There are several studies showing that p38 MAPK activation in immunosuppressive CD25− regulatory T cells and tolerogenic DCs [39, 40] is a central pathway to induce IL-10 production.	24264	24446
27172902	Our finding that cisplatin activates p38 MAPK may explain why cisplatin treatment leads to the generation of IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs.	24447	24588
27172902	Moreover, the inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling in DCs has been suggested as a way to break immunological tolerance and redirect T cell responses to enhance anti-tumor immunity.	24589	24765
27172902	The importance of IL-10 production by DCs in the induction of tolerance has been demonstrated, as DCs genetically modified to express IL-10 exhibit suppressive effects in models of alloreactivity and autoimmunity [41, 42].	24766	24988
27172902	Jarnicki et al. further demonstrated that the inhibition of p38 MAPK-dependent IL-10 secretion by DCs led to stronger Th1 responses and reduced Tr1 induction, indicating that the immune tolerance that is induced by cisplatin can be overcome by inhibiting p38 signaling in DCs.	24989	25265
27172902	Thus, p38 is an important therapeutic target and provides a mechanism to enhance the efficacy of TLR agonists as vaccine adjuvants together with anti-cancer drugs.	25266	25429
27172902	One provocative finding of our study was the induction of IL-10-producing CD3+CD4+LAG-3+CD49b+CD25−Foxp3− Tr1 cells by cisplatin/LPS-primed DCs both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 6, Figure 8, Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure S6).	25430	25659
27172902	Tr1 cells are induced in the periphery and play a pivotal role in promoting and maintaining tolerance.	25660	25762
27172902	IL-10-secreting Tr1 cells were first defined by their specific cytokine production profile, which includes the secretion of high levels of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), and by their ability to suppress antigen-specific effector T cell responses via a cytokine-dependent mechanism.	25763	26061
27172902	In other words, the induction of IL-10-secreting T-cell populations with regulatory activity is IL-10 dependent.	26062	26174
27172902	In contrast to the naturally occurring Tregs that emerge directly from the thymus, Tr1 cells are induced by antigen stimulation via an IL-10-dependent process in vitro and in vivo.	26175	26355
27172902	Thus, specialized IL-10-producing DCs may play a key role in this process.	26356	26430
27172902	However, we cannot completely exclude the secondary effect of IL-10 produced from T cells in accelerating the differentiation of Tr1 cells, indicating that further study of the induction of Tr1 differentiation via interactions between IL-10-producing DCs and IL-10-producing T cells is required.	26431	26726
27172902	Many studies have suggested that chemotherapy resistance is associated with a strong immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment, and our data suggest a possible underlying mechanism for systemic tumor progression in cases of relapse after chemotherapy.	26727	26978
27172902	Although current treatment protocols, including surgery and chemotherapy, can achieve local control of a tumor, patients who relapse after long-term cisplatin treatment may develop systemic disease due to the cisplatin-induced generation of tolerogenic DCs, which limit the Th1 immune response.	26979	27273
27172902	In summary, we demonstrated that cisplatin reprograms TLR agonist-induced activation of DCs via p38 MAPK-induced IL-10 production to generate tolerogenic DCs, which in turn promote the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into IL-10-producing Tr1 cells.	27274	27528
27172902	A better understanding of the different effects of cisplatin on immune cells compared to cancer cells may lead to the design of more successful anti-tumor drugs and may also provide new therapeutic strategies based on cisplatin-induced immunological modulation.	27529	27790

27172902	On day 8, over 80% of the non-adherent cells expressed CD11c.	30147	30208
27172902	To obtain highly purified populations ( > 95% cell purity), in some experiments, the DCs were labeled with a bead-conjugated anti-CD11c mAb (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) followed by positive selection on paramagnetic columns (LS columns; Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	30209	30525
27172902	After 8 days of culture, BMDCs were treated with LPS and/or cisplatin.	30526	30596
27172902	After 18 h of treatment, harvested DCs were washed with PBS and stained using the Annexin V-PI Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences) protocol.	30597	30742
27172902	Cell viability was measured by MTT assay.	30743	30784
27172902	MTT was dissolved in PBS at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml.	30785	30848
27172902	A 100-μl aliquot of the MTT solution was added to each well of a 96-well plate, and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 4 h. The resultant formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO, and the OD570 nm values of each well were measured using a microplate reader.	30849	31107
27172902	On day 8, BMDCs were harvested, washed once, resuspended at 1×106 cells/ml, and treated with the following stimuli for 18 h: medium alone (CON; control), LPS, cisplatin, or LPS and cisplatin.	31108	31299
27172902	The cells were first blocked with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum for 15 min at 4°C and then stained with anti-MHC-I, anti-MHC-II, anti-CD80, anti-CD86, and anti-CD11c mAbs for 30 min at 4°C.	31300	31487
27172902	Finally, the stained cells were analyzed using an LSRII flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).	31488	31648
27172902	To assess cytokine production, supernatants were collected 18 h after treatment of DCs and stored at −70°C.	31649	31756
27172902	The amounts of TNF-α, IL-12p70, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-17A were measured by sandwich ELISA kits using commercially available pairs of antibodies and standards according to the manufacturer's protocol.	31757	31966

27172902	Cells stained with the appropriate isotype-matched IgG were used as negative controls.	32108	32194
27172902	The cells were fixed and permeabilized with a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences or eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	32195	32339

27172902	BMDCs were equilibrated at 37°C or 4°C for 45 min and then pulsed with fluorescein-conjugated dextran (40,000 Da) from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.	32544	32723
27172902	After several washes with cold phosphate-buffered solution, the cells were stained with a PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD11c mAb and then measured with a FACS LSRII to reveal antigen uptake.	32724	32908
27172902	Nonspecific binding of dextran to DCs was determined by incubating DCs with FITC-conjugated dextran at 4°C, and the resulting background value was subtracted from the specific binding values.	32909	33100
27172902	After stimulation with LPS, cisplatin, or LPS and cisplatin, DCs were lysed in 100 μl lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X100, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 30 mM Na4PO7, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM pervanadate.	33101	33378
27172902	Whole-cell lysate samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for 1 h at 60 V. The membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk and incubated with primary Abs for 2 h, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary Abs for 1 h at room temperature.	33379	33682
27172902	Target protein epitopes were labeled with primary Abs against total MAPKs and IκB-α (1:1,000 diluted in blocking solution) and polyclonal Abs against p-ERK 1/2, p-JNK 1/2, p-p38, p-IκB-α and p65 (1:5,000, 1:2,000, 1:5,000, 1:2,000 and 1:3,000 dilutions, respectively), and the results were visualized using an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection kit (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, U.K.).	33683	34075
27172902	BMDCs were treated with 150 μl lysis buffer [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM KCL, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM PMSF] on ice for 15 min.	34076	34248
27172902	After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 3 min, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl extraction buffer [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF] and incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min.	34249	34501

27172902	A 0.1% DMSO solution was used as the vehicle control.	34803	34856
27172902	For the experiments with inhibitors, cells were treated with pharmacological inhibitors for 1 h prior to treatment with a combination of LPS and cisplatin for 18 h. T cell proliferation and differentiation were assayed in vitro and in vivo using a modified previously described protocol [45, 46].	34857	35153
27172902	Responder T cells, which participate in naive T cell reactions, were isolated using a MACS column from total mononuclear cells prepared from OT-I, OT-II and naive BALB/c mice.	35154	35329
27172902	For the in vitro experiment, OVA-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, both responders, were obtained from the splenocytes of OT-I and OT-II mice, respectively.	35330	35484
27172902	These T cells were stained with 1 μM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Invitrogen).	35485	35589
27172902	DCs (2×105 cells/well) treated with OVA peptide in the presence of LPS (100 ng/ml), cisplatin or a combination of LPS and cisplatin for 18 h were co-cultured with CFSE-stained CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (2×106) at a DC:T-cell ratio of 1:10.	35590	35825
27172902	Naive BALB/c (allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)) T cells (2×106) were co-cultured with DCs (2×105 cells/well) treated with LPS, cisplatin or LPS and cisplatin.	35826	35994
27172902	On day 3 or day 4 of co-culture, T cells were stained using an intracellular staining method.	35995	36088
27172902	Culture supernatants were harvested, and IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-17A levels were measured by ELISA.	36089	36189
27172902	For the in vivo experiment, Ly5.1+ OT-I and OT-II T cells (5 × 105 cells per population) were transferred intravenously into the lateral tail veins of Ly5.2+ recipient mice.	36190	36363
27172902	The next day, BMDCs from Ly5.2+ recipient mice were pulsed with ovalbumin protein (10 μg/ml) for 2 h, and then the cells were washed with wash buffer (RPMI 1640 plus 2% FBS).	36364	36538
27172902	After washing twice with wash buffer, the DCs were stimulated by LPS with or without cisplatin for 18 h. These DCs (5 × 106 cells) were transferred intravenously into the lateral tail veins of Ly5.2+ recipient mice.	36539	36754
27172902	At day 5 and day 7 after the DC transfer, PBMCs were isolated from blood samples collected from each mouse, as previously described.	36755	36887
27172902	To analyze the populations of Ly5.1+ OT-I and OT-II T cells, single-cell suspensions of PBMCs and splenocytes from each mouse were stained with anti-CD4, anti-CD8α, anti-CD44, and anti-Ly5.1 mAbs.	36888	37084
27172902	Dead cells were excluded using a Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stain kit (Invitrogen).	37085	37169
27172902	Data were collected on a FACS Canto II (BD) and a FACSverse (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).	37170	37281
27172902	Additionally, single-cell suspensions prepared from the spleens of each group were stimulated with OVA257-264 (0.2 μg/ml) and OVA323-339 (5 μg/ml) for 12 h at 37°C in the presence of GolgiPlug 7 days after DC transfer.	37282	37500
27172902	At 12 h after stimulation, the types and populations of T cells (Ly5.1+ T cells) present were analyzed by intercellular staining and flow cytometry.	37501	37649
27172902	Supernatants were harvested, and IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17A and IL-10 levels were measured by ELISA.	37650	37743
27172902	Significant differences between samples were determined with Tukey's multiple comparison test and unpaired t-tests using statistical software (GraphPad Prism Software, version 5; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).	37744	37957
27172902	The data in the graphs are expressed as the means.	37958	38008
27172902	*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 were considered statistically significant.	38009	38090
28747658	HIV-1-associated lymphomas have not decreased after the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) represents the most common type of cancer1, 2 and the most frequent cause of death3, 4 in HIV-1-infected (HIV+) individuals.	0	271
28747658	The HIV-1 genome is not integrated in the malignant B cells as seen for the oncogenic retrovirus HTLV-1.	272	376
28747658	For this reason, the most shared assumptions rely on the indirect role of HIV-1 in lymphomagenesis.	377	476
28747658	HIV-1-driven immune dysfunction with overproduction of B-cell stimulatory cytokines5 or loss of immune control, that promotes the reactivation of potentially oncogenic herpesviruses6, 7, are the most credited hypotheses up to date.	477	708
28747658	However, novel findings support the possibility that HIV-1 may directly contribute to lymphomagenesis through mechanisms involving the biologic effects mediated by its gene products.	709	891
28747658	The HIV-1 matrix protein p17 (p17) is a 132 amino acid (aa)-long structural protein, composed of five major α-helixes and a highly basic platform consisting of three β strands8, 9.	892	1072
28747658	Four helixes are centrally organized to form a compact globular domain and a fifth helix (H5) in the COOH-terminus is slightly destabilized, due to the flexible C-terminal tail10, 11.	1073	1256
28747658	The matrix protein is continuously released in the extracellular space from HIV-1-infected cells12.	1257	1356
28747658	It has been detected in the plasma13 and in tissue specimens, such as brain14, liver15, bone marrow16 and lymph nodes of HIV+ patients17.	1357	1494
28747658	In lymph nodes p17 accumulates and persists even during cART and in the absence of any HIV-1 replicative activity17, thus suggesting that it may be persistently expressed in the tissue microenvironment, even during pharmacological therapy, and promote chronic B-cell stimulation18, 19.	1495	1780
28747658	Latest data show that p17 expression in mice transgenic for a defective HIV-1 provirus is associated with lymphoma development20, 21.	1781	1914
28747658	Moreover, p17 variants (vp17s), characterized by scattered mutation along the entire protein sequence22 or by specific aa insertions in the C-terminal region, display a potent B-cell growth-promoting activity triggering the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway22, 23, which is known to be crucial in lymphoma development24.	1915	2223
28747658	Therefore, specific mutations within refp17 could induce a different pathogenetic potential to the viral protein.	2224	2337
28747658	All these findings call for defining the structure-function relationship in clonogenic vp17s as compared to their wild-type counterpart.	2338	2474
28747658	In this study, we investigated the aa substitutions, the structural bases and the molecular mechanisms responsible for opposite effects in modulating B-cell growth between a vp17 derived from a Ugandan HIV-1 strain (subtype A1), named S75X22, and the wild type p17 (reference p17, refp17; from clone BH10 of the clade B isolate).	2475	2804
28747658	Here, we demonstrate that a single arginine (R) to glycine (G) mutation at position 76 in the refp17 backbone, as in S75X, is sufficient to induce dramatic changes in protein folding and stability, making p17 mutant capable of activating Akt and promoting B-cell proliferation.	2805	3082
28747658	We performed in silico studies to elucidate if aa mutations in S75X were responsible for changes in folding and stability of the viral protein as compared to refp17.	3083	3248
28747658	Since mutated residues in S75X (Fig.	3249	3285
28747658	1A) are donors and acceptors of hydrogen bonds, we first performed long Molecular Dynamics simulation (MD) (500 ns) of refp17 to evaluate its hydrogen bond network.	3286	3450
28747658	Side chains of mutated residues in S75X and involved in hydrogen bonds are shown in Fig.	3451	3539
28747658	1B.	3540	3543
28747658	In order to identify key residues involved in interaction network, we evaluated hydrogen bonds during the entire refp17 MD and set the threshold of essential hydrogen bonds in the frames of all the trajectory to 75%25.	3544	3762
28747658	The identified hydrogen bonds were E73-R76 (88%), N80-T84 (83%) and R58-E107 (81%) and the identification of E73-R76 as the most frequent hydrogen bond suggested us to further investigate its role in protein structure.	3763	3981
28747658	In S75X the residue R76 results mutated in a G and this aa substitution leads to the loss of the E73-R76 hydrogen bond.	3982	4101
28747658	Therefore, in order to investigate the role of this hydrogen bond in the stability and folding of the matrix protein, we modeled S75X and p17R76G, a p17 mutant with R76 replaced by a G, and performed long MD (500 ns).	4102	4319
28747658	The stability of refp17, S75X and p17R76G was defined on the basis of these conditions along the dynamics: the total energy less than −40000 kcal/mol, RMSD of the structure in a range of 1 Angstrom around the centre of oscillations, the formation of hydrogen bonds, and the size of nonpolar surface area.	4320	4624
28747658	Refp17 showed a higher stability than S75X and p17R76G, exhibiting a higher average number of hydrogen bonds (58 versus 48.5 and 55, respectively) and lower nonpolar surface areas (31.3% versus 33, 87% and 34, 23%, respectively).	4625	4854
28747658	In addition, the MD frames of p17s were clustered (% of the frames): two clusters (42% and 43%) in refp17, five clusters (29%, 26%, 15%, 9% and 7%) in the S75X and three clusters (25%, 23% and 22%) in p17R76G were obtained.	4855	5078
28747658	The dispersion indices were 12.39, 31.65 and 20.00 for refp17, S75X and p17R76G, respectively.	5079	5173
28747658	All these results suggest that S75X and p17R76G are less structured as compared to refp17.	5174	5264
28747658	In addition, using the DSSP software and calculating the average of helix propensities of each aa along the trajectory, we assessed whether mutations in S75X and p17R76G induce any changes in secondary structure26.	5265	5479
28747658	Interestingly, S75X and p17R76G showed a disorganization in the N-terminal region of H3 and H4, and in the C-terminal region of H3 (Fig.	5480	5616
28747658	2).	5617	5620
28747658	This was not observed in refp17, whose helices of globular domain were stable during simulation.	5621	5717
28747658	A greater stability of H5 is observed in S75X and p17R76G as compared to refp17 (Fig.	5718	5803
28747658	2).	5617	5620
28747658	The stability of H5 in S75X is due to the formation of the new hydrogen bond R91-E106 and in p17R76G of the R58-Q108 and Y86-E107 bonds.	5808	5944
28747658	On the contrary, after 140 ns of MD in refp17 we observed a break in the middle of H5 (residue 105) resulting in displacement of structured C-terminal region towards the N-terminal region of H3.	5945	6139
28747658	This shift allows the formation of a hydrogen bond R76-A112, obtaining a new interaction region.	6140	6236
28747658	In all three proteins, fluctuations from helix to turn or coil structures were observed in the C-terminal region of H5 (Fig.	6237	6361
28747658	2).	5617	5620
28747658	Overall, these findings show that changes in the hydrogen bond network, due to the insurgence of even a single point mutation (R76G), are responsible for changes in the secondary structure of refp17.	6366	6565
28747658	In order to confirm conformational shifts evidenced by MD, the structural conformation of refp17, S75X and p17R76G was investigated.	6566	6698
28747658	To this aim we generated the three recombinant viral proteins and analyzed them in aqueous solution (each at 2.5 μM), using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.	6699	6860
28747658	All proteins displayed alpha-helical secondary structures at room temperature, as evidenced by a strong positive maximum at 195 nm and two negative minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig.	6861	7039
28747658	3A), consistent with the known structural features of p178, 9.	7040	7102
28747658	However, S75X and p17R76G were noticeably less helical than refp17, as indicated by the reduction in ellipticity, suggesting a partial unfold of proteins (Fig.	7103	7262
28747658	3A).	7263	7267
28747658	In order to evaluate the impact of mutations on protein structure, we subjected refp17, S75X and p17R76G to heat-induced denaturation and monitored them at 222 nm by CD spectroscopy.	7268	7450
28747658	As temperature was raised from 25 °C to 90 °C, all three proteins exhibited a co-operative unfolding with a single transition, typical of a compact globular protein (Fig.	7451	7621
28747658	3B).	7622	7626
28747658	Data normalization based on a two-state protein denaturation model gave rise to a characteristic melting temperature (Tm at which 50% of protein is denatured or unfolded) for each protein.	7627	7815
28747658	S75X and p17R76G had similar Tm values, approximately 10 °C lower than refp17 (Table 1).	7816	7904
28747658	These results show that mutations in vp17s destabilize the matrix protein, corroborating findings from CD spectroscopy.	7905	8024
28747658	Since temperature-induced unfolding is usually accompanied by protein aggregation27, we examined the ability of vp17s to oligomerize in solution by dynamic light scattering techniques (Table 1).	8025	8219
28747658	In solution refp17 exists as monomer or trimer depending on protein concentration28.	8220	8304
28747658	At 10 μM refp17 existed as a monomer (Fig.	8305	8347
28747658	3C), while S75X and p17R76G displayed a molecular weight 10 and 170 fold higher than refp17 (Fig.	8348	8445
28747658	3C), respectively.	8446	8464
28747658	These data suggest that a single aa mutation occurring in the refp17 backbone can induce a massive self-association, indicating that some refp17 buried hydrophobic residues become exposed in S75X and p17R76G.	8465	8673
28747658	Then, we analyzed the three p17 proteins using 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and their amide-amide Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra.	8674	8829
28747658	As shown in Fig.	8830	8846
28747658	3D, refp17 displayed a large number of well-dispersed amide-amide Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) signals, which are characteristic of a well-folded alpha-helical protein.	8847	9018
28747658	On the contrary, S75X and p17R76G showed very few amide-amide NOE signals in the same region of the spectrum, consistent with dampened signals arising from the formation of soluble aggregates.	9019	9211
28747658	Overall, our data suggest that a single R76G mutation in refp17 backbone can destabilize the viral protein with a reduction of alpha-helical secondary structures, thermal stability and soluble aggregates formation.	9212	9426
28747658	Destabilization of refp17 with changes in the secondary structure, induced by aa mutations, are known to confer conformational changes sufficient to endow the viral protein with B-cell growth-promoting activity23.	9427	9640
28747658	Since in refp17 the E73-R76 hydrogen bond was identified by MD as an essential interaction for hydrogen bond network and CD and NMR spectroscopy confirm a destabilization of viral protein (Fig.	9641	9834
28747658	3), we aimed at determining whether p17R76G, a mutant bearing a G at position 76 instead of an R, as in S75X, could acquire a B-cell clonogenic activity.	9835	9988
28747658	Then, we tested the p17R76G capability of modulating B-cell growth by soft agar clonogenic assays.	9989	10087
28747658	As shown in Fig.	8830	8846
28747658	4A, refp17 inhibited the colony-forming ability of Raji B cells as compared to untreated cultures, while S75X and p17R76G enhanced their clonogenic activity.	10105	10262
28747658	These results confirm that the rupture of the E73-R76 hydrogen bond generates significant structural changes conferring to the matrix protein a S75X-like B-cell clonogenic activity.	10263	10444
28747658	The PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway represents the major intracellular signaling cascade known to regulate proliferation and malignant transformation29, 30.	10445	10591
28747658	Refp17 was shown to enhance PTEN activity and down-modulate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, exerting an anti-proliferative effect on B cells, while S75X was shown to block PTEN and activate Akt, thus promoting B-cell growth22.	10592	10818
28747658	Due to clonogenic activity of p17R76G (Fig.	10819	10862
28747658	4A), we explored its capability to modulate the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway.	10863	10933
28747658	As shown in Fig.	8830	8846
28747658	4B, Raji cells stimulated with refp17 showed a significant Akt inhibition, as expected, while S75X and p17R76G phosphorylated Akt kinase (Fig.	10951	11093
28747658	4C and D).	11094	11104
28747658	Since Akt can be modulated by PTEN30, we also evaluate the Ser/Thr phosphorylated PTEN inactivation form.	11105	11210
28747658	As shown in Fig.	8830	8846
28747658	4C and D, cells treated with S75X and p17R76G showed an increased PTEN phosphorylation as compared to unstimulated cells, whereas treatment of cells with refp17 resulted in a reduced PTEN phosphorylation level (Fig.	11228	11443
28747658	4B).	11444	11448
28747658	Overall, these data show that p17R76G, like S75X, activates the proliferative PI3K/Akt pathway in B cells through PTEN down-modulation.	11449	11584
28747658	Assessment of protein phosphorylations is essential for understanding intracellular activities controlling cell functions.	11585	11707
28747658	To further investigate the intracellular mechanisms involved in the B-cell growth-promoting activity of S75X and p17R76G, we assessed how these proteins modulate intracellular phosphorylations by employing a high-throughput antibody array technology.	11708	11958
28747658	The lysates of Raji cells, stimulated or not with refp17, p17R76G or S75X (0.1 μg/ml) were processed by Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation for Kinex™ KAM-850 Antibody Microarray.	11959	12137
28747658	Then, in order to rule out false positive array signals, all the protein modulated by S75X and p17R76G were confirmed by a multi-immunoblotting analysis performed by Kinexus.	12138	12312
28747658	The signals relative to the 23 proteins modulated by S75X and p17R76G, verified by densitometric analysis and normalized to refp17, are reported in Table 2.	12313	12469
28747658	Literature data mining and GO biological process database highlighted that most of modulated proteins, as expected, are involved in cell cycle regulation (CDK1, CDK2, CDK8, CHEK1, CHEK2, GSK-3 beta, NPM, PAK1, PP2C-alpha) and apoptosis (CASP-9, CASP-7, DFF-45, NPM, YWHAZ, Src, PAX2, MAPK8).	12470	12761
28747658	In Fig.	12762	12769
28747658	5 we established the known and experimentally verified molecular interactions among the proteins reported in Table 2 using STRING database31 of Protein-Protein Interaction Network and literature data mining.	12770	12977
28747658	Those molecules not displaying confirmed interactions (CaMKK2, CDK8, Lyn, PP2C-delta, SOCS-4, Src, CHEK1, GSK-3 beta, PP5, PKC-beta) were kept out from the signaling network, even if we cannot completely rule out their involvement in vp17s-induced B-cell growth.	12978	13240
28747658	As shown in Fig.	8830	8846
28747658	5, S75X and p17R76G trigger the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which in turn could activate MAPK832 and YWHAZ33, thus creating a positive feedback loop further strengthening Akt activation34.	13258	13446
28747658	In addition, MAPK8, besides its ability to activate PAX2 and promote cancer cell proliferation35, can trigger YWHAZ and inhibit DNA fragmentation process during apoptosis by interacting with DFF-4536.	13447	13647
28747658	PP2C-alpha up-regulation can also concurs likely to further activate PI3K/Akt pathway37.	13648	13736
28747658	Moreover, Akt activation can modulate the activity of PAK138, 39, CASP-940, DFF-4536, 41, NPM42, 43, CDK1 and CDK244, 45.	13737	13858
28747658	Among these factors, a central role can be exerted by NPM, which is known to be directly activated by Akt, but also by YWHAZ and CDK1/246–48.	13859	14000
28747658	Finally, CHEK2 activation can be involved in cytoprotection and cell survival49.	14001	14081
28747658	These data highlight that the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in B cells by clonogenic S75X and p17R76G can orchestrate the function of several molecules involved in promoting tumor survival and proliferation.	14082	14290
28747658	The function of a globular protein is governed by its 3D structure, while different biological functions can be performed by a protein that lacks the ordered secondary structure and thermal stability50–52.	14291	14496
28747658	As several cancer-associated proteins, p17 possesses high levels of predicted intrinsic disorders53, 54, which subtend to a partially unfolded status of specific regions.	14497	14667
28747658	Previously, we showed that in S75X, which contains aa mutations scattered throughout the p17 protein sequence, specific hydrogen bonds stabilizing the refp17 structure are lost, giving rise to a partially unfolded - B-cell growth-promoting - protein18.	14668	14920
28747658	However, it is known that different aa residues can be mutated in vp17s without loss or change in their refp17-like functional activity, suggesting that the clonogenic activity of vp17s do not depend from protein sequence, but only from specific mutations capable of endowing p17s with a B-cell growth-promoting activity23.	14921	15244
28747658	MD simulations showed that S75X displays a single aa mutation (R76G) that is likely to be the most responsible for protein destabilization, with reduction of alpha-helical secondary structures and for shifting the equilibrium toward a partially unfolded conformation.	15245	15512
28747658	CD and 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy confirmed this prediction using a recombinant p17 mutant carrying the single R76G replacement in the refp17 backbone (p17R76G).	15513	15678
28747658	As expected, clonogenic assays showed that the replacement of R to G at position 76, as in S75X, is sufficient to endow refp17 with a B cells growth-promoting activity.	15679	15847
28747658	Therefore, aa mutations, which alter the hydrogen bond network and contribute to an even partial unfolding process of refp17, confer to vp17s different functional outcomes compared to refp17.	15848	16039
28747658	Unfolding and subsequent self-assembly of proteins into various aggregates are common molecular mechanisms involved in important human diseases55, 56.	16040	16190
28747658	Our data show that the partially unfolded conformational ensemble of vp17s favors specific intermolecular interactions and protein aggregation.	16191	16334
28747658	Indeed, vp17s exhibit higher nonpolar surface areas than refp17, probably due to the exposure of some buried hydrophobic residues, which induces them to massively self-aggregate.	16335	16513
28747658	Further studies will address if some of the p17 cell toxic activities57 are dependent on this aggregation status.	16514	16627
28747658	The p17R76G protein, similarly to S75X22, was also found to activate Akt kinase, modulating PTEN activity.	16628	16734
28747658	High-throughput phosphoproteomic and bioinformatics analysis highlighted a central role of Akt kinase in the proliferative signaling pathways induced by S75X and p17R76G in B cells.	16735	16916
28747658	Indeed, Akt can modulate the function of several molecules as PP2C-alpha, YWHAZ, MAPK8, PAX2, PAK1, CASP-9, CASP-7, DFF-45, NPM, PAX2, CDK1, CDK2, CHEK2, involved in apoptosis inhibiton, cell cycle promotion and cancer progression.	16917	17148
28747658	All these findings were not unexpected since the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway represents the major signaling cascade known to play a central role in tumorigenesis58, 59.	17149	17311
28747658	All molecules modulated by S75X and p17R76G, used as input for the Cytoscape ClueGO functional analysis tool60 to cluster them according to the KEGG biological pathway, result to be related to several known biological pathways.	17312	17539
28747658	As shown in Fig.	8830	8846
28747658	6, most of the identified signaling pathways are related to cancer development and progression, as PI3K/Akt, p53, MAPK and ErbB.	17557	17685
28747658	It is important to underline that molecules modulated by S75X and p17R76G are also involved in signaling triggered by oncogenic viruses, like EBV, HTLV-1 and HBV.	17686	17848
28747658	This latter observation suggests that different viruses, and among them HIV-1, may exploit common paths to promote cell proliferation.	17849	17983
28747658	Moreover, EBV infection was recently shown to up-regulate p17Rs expression on primary B lymphocytes, thereby making these cells permissive to the biological effects mediated by p17s19.	17984	18168
28747658	Interestingly, molecules modulated by S75X and p17R76G were also related to the prolactin signaling pathway, supporting previous data showing the presence of higher serum prolactin in HIV+ patients than in healthy individuals and the capability of prolactin to influence normal lymphocyte mitogenesis and lymphoid tumor growth61–63.	18169	18501
28747658	Finally, some molecules modulated by clonogenic vp17s result to be related to chemokine signaling pathway and this finding is not surprising, since p17 is known to act as a viral chemokine15, 64–66.	18502	18700
28747658	Recently, we showed that vp17s derived from HIV+ NHL patients were characterized by specific aa insertions in the C-terminal region, tempting to ascribe this activity to the C-terminus of the protein interacting directly with its putative receptors23.	18701	18952
28747658	Nevertheless, we previously described that the presence of H5 in p17 is not necessary for protein clonogenic activity22, highlighting the intrinsic capability of p17 to exert B-cell clonogenic activity following protein unfolding.	18953	19183
28747658	Indeed, truncation of the last 36 aa residues of p17 resulted in a protein (p17Δ36) capable of promoting B-cell clonogenicity through PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway.	19184	19340
28747658	Moreover, the different biological activity of S75X and p17R76G compared to refp17, underlines how the matrix protein binding to and signaling through p17R(s) can potentially involve distinct determinants of structure or conformations.	19341	19576
28747658	For these reasons, we hypothesize that a specific clonogenic epitope responsible for B-cell clonogenic activity, located probably in N-terminal or in the core of matrix protein, is masked in the properly folded monomeric p17, but exposed in misfolded, aggregated B-cell vp17s.	19577	19853
28747658	Therefore, the molecular reasons for the opposite mechanisms among mutated proteins and wild-type p17 may depend on the exposure or not of a clonogenic epitope and from the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is specific for the mutated clonogenic proteins.	19854	20117
28747658	This downstream signaling pathway might be ascribed to the interaction of the viral mutated proteins, in their unfolded or aggregated form, with a different p17R(s) from the ones known engaged by refp17.	20118	20321
28747658	Up to date, the direct interactor of clonogenic mutated proteins is still unknown and its identification will be sure matter of further investigations.	20322	20473
28747658	In conclusion, our study represents the first molecular and structural characterization of a single point mutated p17 displaying B-cell clonogenic activity.	20474	20630
28747658	Our findings open the way for a better understanding of the structure-function relationship underlying the B-cell clonogenic activity of some vp17s.	20631	20779
28747658	Moreover, demonstration that clonogenic vp17s exert their action on B cells through activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway, which represents a critical driver of lymphoma development and metastasis, may offer new opportunities to identify novel treatment strategies in combating HIV-related B-cell lymphoma.	20780	21088
28747658	Finally, our results provide the rational background for further studies aimed to assess the possible molecular signatures identifying vp17s with B-cell clonogenic activity and recognition of HIV+ individuals at risk to develop lymphoma.	21089	21326
28747658	Human lymphoblastoid cell line (Raji) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM L-glutamine and 1mM sodium pyruvate.	21327	21534
28747658	Purified endotoxin-free recombinant HIV-1 matrix protein p17, S75X and p17R76G were produced as previously described22.	21535	21654
28747658	The mutated matrix protein p17R76G, in which the arginine in position 76 was replaced by a glycine, was generated from p17 sequence by using Quick Change Site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).	21655	21852
28747658	The structures of refp17 were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1TAM, whereas homology modeling (Modeler) was used to obtain the structures of S75X and p17R76G.	21853	22026

28747658	The temperature of the system was regulated using the Langevin thermostat.	23182	23256
28747658	Equilibration was reached in constant NPT ensemble for 7 ns.	23257	23317
28747658	After equilibration, production MD was performed at 300 K using constant pressure without restraints for 500 ns.	23318	23430
28747658	DSSP program was used to assign secondary structures26.	23431	23486
28747658	The convergence was evaluated calculating the time point beyond which the RMSD of the structure stayed in a range of 1 Angstrom around the centre of oscillations.	23487	23649
28747658	The RMSD was calculated considering only the alpha carbon in the not flexible regions (RMSF < 3 Angstrom).	23650	23756
28747658	To assess the different conformations of p17s we performed cluster analysis using the default hierarchical agglomerative algorithm implemented in the cpptraj tool (AmberTools).	23757	23933
28747658	The distance matrix was computed using RMS distance between each pair of frame.	23934	24013
28747658	The dispersion of conformations along the dynamics within of the clusters was evaluated considering a dispersion index that takes into account the fraction of frames (FR i) and the average of RMSD within each cluster: ∑i=1NcRMSDi⋅(1−FRi), where N c is the number of considered clusters.	24014	24300
28747658	The non-polar surfaces area was calculated using the software MDTraj69.	24301	24372
28747658	CD spectra of p17s at 2.5 μM in 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) were obtained at room temperature on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm quartz cuvette.	24373	24522
28747658	Protein thermal denaturation was carried out in PBS on the Jasco spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature controller.	24523	24646
28747658	2.5 mL of protein solution (approximately 10 μM) prepared in PBS (pH 7.4) was aliquoted into a 3 mL cuvette.	24647	24755
28747658	Under constant stirring, CD measurements at 222 nm were made at one degree interval between 25 °C and 90 °C, at a heating rate of 1 °C per minute.	24756	24902
28747658	After each 1-minute heating, the solution in the cuvette waited for 20 s before signals were sampled over a 16 sec period.	24903	25025
28747658	Heating and data acquisition were fully automated with control software provided by Jasco.	25026	25116
28747658	Denaturation data were fitted to the following six-parameter equation derived from a two-state protein denaturation model as previously described23, 70, 71:Sθ=(αn1T+αn2)+(αd1T+αd2)eΔHmRT(Tm−T)Tm1+eΔHmRT(Tm−T)Tmwhere Tm is melting temperature at which 50% of protein is denatured, ∆Hm is the enthalpy of denaturation, αn1, αn2, αd1, and αd2 are parameters for the parabolic equations defining native and denatured states, and the gas constant R = 8.314 J mol−1 K−1.	25117	25581
28747658	The experiments for each protein were repeated three times.	25582	25641
28747658	Concentrated protein solutions were filtered using a Whatman Anotop 10 filter (0.22 μm) and, after UV quantification, diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 10 μM each.	25642	25814
28747658	Protein size measurements were carried out at 25 °C, pH 7.4, with a total ionic strength of 0.1 M, on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument.	25815	25956
28747658	Twenty runs of 30 s each were taken and averaged, and the data were processed using the manufacturer provided software.	25957	26076
28747658	NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on an 800 MHz (800.27 MHz for protons) Bruker Avance-series NMR spectrometer equipped with four frequency channels and a 5 mm triple-resonance z-axis gradient cryogenic probehead.	26077	26291
28747658	A one-second relaxation delay was used and quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions was obtained with states-TPPI phase cycling; initial delays in the indirect dimensions were set to give zero- and first-order phase corrections of 90° and −180°, respectively72, 73.	26292	26564
28747658	Data were processed using the processing program nmrPipe on Mac OS X workstations74.	26565	26649
28747658	2D NOESY experiments with a 150 ms mixing time were collected to monitor changes in the backbone and side-chain 1H protein resonances75.	26650	26786
28747658	Typical NMR samples contained 3 mg/ml protein in a 10 mM sodium phosphate and 25 mM sodium chloride buffer (pH 7.4) to which 10% D2O (v/v) was added.	26787	26936
28747658	Raji cell clonogenic activity was evaluated in soft agar assays as previously described18, 22, 23.	26937	27035
28747658	Raji cells, starved for 24 hours by serum deprivation, were stimulated or not with refp17, p17R76G and S75X (0.05, 0.1, 0.5 μg/ml) for 5 min, then lysed and prepared for KinexTM Antibody Microarray (KAM-850) according to manufacturer’s instructions (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation).	27036	27322
28747658	Then, the samples were checked for pAkt and pPTEN levels by western blot analysis, as previously described23.	27323	27432
28747658	In particular, the blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1) mAb to pAkt (Cell Signaling Technology), 2) mAb to total Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), 3) mAb pPTEN (Ser380/Thr382/383) (Cell Signaling Technology), 3) mAb to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase).	27433	27710
28747658	The lysates of cells stimulated with refp17, p17R76G and S75X (0.1 μg/ml) for 5 min were sent to Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation for processing by Kinex™ KAM-850 Antibody Microarray, which contains 517 pan-specific and 337 phoshpo-site-specific probes, which recognize different epitopes on 466 proteins.	27711	28018
28747658	The raw data, processed by Kinexus with the ImaGene software, were filtered according to company criteria.	28019	28125
28747658	Only probes matching these criteria where considered for further analysis: signal to noise ratio >1.6; or signal to noise ratio <1.6 and noise inferior than the average noise of the array; maximum variation coefficient <0.2.	28126	28350
28747658	The analysis was led with custom R, Visual Basic and MySQL procedures.	28351	28421
28747658	Z-scores for normalization and z-ratios for comparisons were calculated as previously described76, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and a significativity threshold of 1.1 was adopted for the z-ratios.	28422	28638
28747658	In order to rule out false positive array signals, a subsequent multi-immunoblotting verification step was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.	28639	28804
28747658	Therefore, on the 54 most relevant selected probes a pre-screening step was performed by Kinexus to select the reactive antibodies and rule out the false positive array signals due to antibody cross-reactivity.	28805	29015
28747658	After pre-screening, 36 selected antibodies were used for a multi-immunoblotting analysis by Kinexus.	29016	29117
28747658	Blot raw quantification data were processed by log transformation and normalization to either not treated or p17 treated samples for the interpretation of the results.	29118	29285
28747658	STRING database was used to identify known and experimentally verified molecular interactions among proteins modulated by p17s31.	29286	29415

28747658	Data obtained from multiple independent experiments are expressed as the means ± the standard deviations (SD).	29788	29898
28747658	The data were analyzed for statistical significance using one-way ANOVA.	29899	29971
28747658	Bonferroni’s post-test was used to compare data.	29972	30020
28747658	Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.	30021	30073
28747658	Statistical tests were performed using Prism 5 software (GraphPad).	30074	30141
24587916	Chronic administration of glucocorticoid, especially at supraphysiological doses, leads to elevated systolic blood pressure, in man and animals.	0	144
24587916	Increased vascular sensitivity to glucocorticoids has been also demonstrated in patients with essential hypertension.	145	262
24587916	Dexamethasone- (Dex-) induced hypertension is associated with decreased antioxidant levels, enhanced oxidative stress and reduced nitric oxide (NO) level [3, 4].	263	424
24587916	Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurs in this model of hypertension like many other forms of hypertension.	425	548
24587916	Interaction between ROS and NO leads to reduced NO availability and vasoconstriction.	549	634
24587916	An increasing body of evidence has shown the role of antioxidants in preventing increased oxidative stress and blood pressure in Dex-induced hypertension [6–8].	635	795
24587916	Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional iron-binding glycoprotein.	796	860
24587916	Different biological fluids especially milk and also neutrophilic granules contain LF.	861	947
24587916	LF receptors are found in various cell types such as lymphocytes, platelets, macrophages, dopaminergic neurons, megacaryocytes, and endothelial cells.	948	1098
24587916	Some of these receptors are involved in LF uptake.	1099	1149
24587916	In the cerebral endothelial cells, LF is transported through a receptor-mediated process without any intraendothelial degradation.	1150	1280
24587916	LF acts as the first-line defense against bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.	1281	1363
24587916	It has anti-inflammatory effect and its production is increased during inflammatory circumstances.	1364	1462
24587916	LF is a regulator of organ morphogenesis and promotes wound healing and bone growth.	1463	1547
24587916	It has enzymatic activities in some reactions and also some anticancer activities.	1548	1630
24587916	LF has been identified as an antioxidant protein with ability to increase antioxidant capacity and decrease ROS formation [14–16].	1631	1761
24587916	Recently, some studies have demonstrated antihypertensive effects of this food-derived peptide and its hydrolysate in normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) [17, 18].	1762	1938
24587916	The NO-dependent vasodilation, inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and inhibition of endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) activity have been suggested as the mechanisms responsible for antihypertensive effects of LF [19–21].	1939	2187
24587916	The present study aimed to evaluate blood pressure lowering effects of chronic LF in Dex-induced hypertension and to determine the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another probable mechanism of action of LF in prevention of hypertension.	2188	2434
24587916	Male Wistar rats (200–230 g) were obtained from the animal house of the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran.	2435	2600

24587916	In a prevention study, rats received oral LF (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) or captopril treatment (40 mg/kg; a known angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, as the positive control) using an intragastric tube for 4 days followed by Dex administration and continued during the test period (14 days).	3455	3745
24587916	In the reversal study, LF or captopril was administered from day 8 to day 14.	3746	3823
24587916	Six animals were used in each group.	3824	3860
24587916	At the end of the experiment, all groups of animals were sacrificed under ether anesthesia.	3861	3952
24587916	Blood samples were collected into heparinized tubes and plasma was separated.	3953	4030
24587916	The thymus gland was also isolated.	4031	4066
24587916	Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured every week using noninvasive tail-cuff method (AD Instrument PowerLab Data Acquisition System, Australia) in conscious rats.	4067	4234
24587916	The animals were individually restrained in a clear acrylic restrainer at an ambient temperature of 37-38°C for 15 min.	4235	4354
24587916	Five blood pressure values were recorded for each rat and the average of them was taken as the SBP.	4355	4454
24587916	To assure the reliability of the measurements, a training period of one week was established before the experiment time for adaptation of rats to the method.	4455	4612
24587916	The thymus gland was weighed and expressed as milligrams per 100 g body weight.	4613	4692
24587916	The thymus weightwas used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity.	4693	4758
24587916	Plasma hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration was measured based on the ferrous ion oxidation by xylenol orange (FOX) assay using a standard assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.	4759	4951
24587916	Briefly, FOX reagent was mixed with plasma samples and incubated for 30 min in 37°C.	4952	5036
24587916	The absorbance of colored samples was read at 540 nm with ELISA/spectrophotometric reader.	5037	5127

24587916	The antioxidant capacity of plasma samples was determined by FRAP assay based on the reduction of ferric-tripyridyltriazine complex to ferrous form using a standard assay kit.	5233	5408
24587916	Briefly, the FRAP reagent was added to plasma samples and incubated for 40 min in 40°C.	5409	5496
24587916	The absorbance of colored samples was read at 570 nm using an ELISA/spectrophotometric reader.	5497	5591
24587916	The values were calculated against the standard curve of FeSO4.7H2O concentration and absorption values were expressed as micromole of ferrous ion equivalents per liter.	5592	5761
24587916	The data were expressed as the mean ± SEM.	5762	5804
24587916	Statistical analysis was made by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test using SPSS 16.0 software and GraphPad-Prism 5 software.	5805	5962
24587916	P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.	5963	6019
24587916	Dexamethasone significantly increased SBP from 118.9 ± 4.7 to 140.44 ± 10.3 mmHg on day 7 (P < 0.01) and to 150 ± 7.4 mmHg on day 14 (P < 0.001) in comparison with saline control group (116.6 ± 2.4 mmHg).	6020	6224
24587916	The oral administration of LF (30–300 mg/kg) lowered and dose dependently prevented Dex-induced hypertension in reversal and prevention studies (Figures 1 and 2).	6225	6387
24587916	The body weight significantly decreased in Dex-induced hypertensive rats when compared to saline control group (P < 0.001).	6388	6511
24587916	These changes were modified by LF administration (300 mg/kg) but not by captopril (Figure 3).	6512	6605
24587916	Dex significantly decreased thymus weight (P < 0.001) but LF and captopril had no effect on it (Figure 4).	6606	6712
24587916	Dex treatment significantly raised the level of plasma H2O2when compared with saline control rats (P < 0.001).	6713	6823
24587916	LF administration significantly (P < 0.001) prevented the rise in H2O2 concentration at all doses in prevention study and reduced the elevated plasma H2O2 concentration at dose of 300 mg/kg in reversal study (P < 0.05).	6824	7043
24587916	Administration of captopril also prevented and reversed the elevated plasma H2O2 concentration in Dex-induced hypertensive rats (Figure 5).	7044	7183
24587916	Dex-induced hypertensive rats exhibited significant increase in the plasma FRAP values compared with saline control rats (P < 0.001).	7184	7317
24587916	LF administrations also significantly increased FRAP values in Dex-induced hypertensive group at all doses of prevention study (P < 0.001) and at doses 100 and 300 mg/kg of reversal study (P < 0.05).	7318	7517
24587916	In the captopril prevention study, FRAP values were also significantly increased (Figure 6).	7518	7610
24587916	The results of this study showed antihypertensive effect of LF in Dex-induced hypertension.	7611	7702
24587916	LF treatment dose dependently prevented and reversed a rise in SBP upon Dex administration.	7703	7794
24587916	These LF effects were obtained in spite of the fact that dose of Dex used in the current study was 3-fold higher than that of dose used in most studies (10 μg/kg/day).	7795	7962
24587916	The exact mechanism of Dex-induced hypertension has not been fully understood.	7963	8041
24587916	The role of augmented vascular pressor responsiveness, increased vasoconstrictor system activity including renin-angiotensin, endothelin, and sympathetic system, deficiency in vasodilators such as NO and prostanoids, hemodynamic alterations, and oxidative stress have been proposed as the mechanisms of Dex in induction of elevated blood pressure.	8042	8389
24587916	Structural, functional, and mechanical disruption in vessels have important role in Dex hypertensive effect.	8390	8498
24587916	Dex results in increased sensitivity of vascular smooth muscles to vasoconstrictors and also increased vasoconstrictor release including angiotensin II, endothelin, and catecholamines [26, 27].	8499	8692
24587916	NO deficiency occurs during Dex treatment by downregulation of endothelial NO synthase expression and also through increased NO removal by oxidative stress.	8693	8849
24587916	Dex enhances superoxide free radical production through NAPDH oxidase pathway in vasculature when given chronically.	8850	8966
24587916	It also causes significant alterations in antioxidant status.	8967	9028
24587916	Some antioxidants such as tempol, apocynin, and N-acetylcysteine have been shown to prevent Dex-induced hypertension [6, 26, 29].	9029	9158
24587916	LF as a food-derived peptide is believed to be safer than the drugs currently used for hypertension treatment.	9159	9269
24587916	Previous studies have reported blood pressure lowering effects of LF [19–21].	9270	9347
24587916	LF may cross and be internalized via a specific low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein in some capillary endothelial cells and it acts as an antioxidant factor.	9348	9518
24587916	The antihypertensive effects of LF may be attributed to the ACE and ECE inhibitor action and also endothelium-dependent relaxant action of LF [19–21].	9519	9669
24587916	It has been suggested that the vasodilatory action of LF is strongly mediated by NO production because of complete blockade of this effect by a NO synthase inhibitor.	9670	9836
24587916	Ikeda and coworkers have reported significant phosphorylation of Src, Akt, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) after treatment with LF suggesting a Src Akt eNOS-dependent pathway in promotion of vascular endothelial cell function by LF.	9837	10082
24587916	Furthermore, our results exhibited antioxidant effect of LF in Dex-induced hypertension.	10083	10171
24587916	Hypertension of Dex was accompanied by increased plasma hydrogen peroxide level.	10172	10252
24587916	LF administration dose dependently prevented and reversed H2O2 overproduction during Dex injection.	10253	10352
24587916	Our finding showed significant increases in plasma ferric reducing antioxidant power upon Dex administration.	10353	10462
24587916	It has been reported that glucocorticoids may activate the antioxidant enzymes in some tissues due to the state of oxidative stress and in a tissue specific manner.	10463	10627
24587916	However, the antioxidant capacity was higher in LF pretreated rats than that of rats treated with Dex alone.	10628	10736
24587916	The potent antioxidant action of LF has been reported in other studies.	10737	10808
24587916	Two weeks LF supplementation has been able to increase the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity in healthy humans.	10809	10919
24587916	LF has protective effect on pathological circumstances associated with iron-catalysed ROS based on its metal ions-binding capacity.	10920	11051
24587916	It has been suggested that LF contributes in oxidoreductive reactions at the cell membrane.	11052	11143
24587916	An antioxidant effect of LF on erythrocytes through inhibition of lipid peroxidation and hemolysis has been reported.	11144	11261
24587916	LF is an important specialized iron scavenger and its antioxidant activity is most likely linked to its ability to bind ferrous and ferric ions.	11262	11406
24587916	Thus, LF may inhibit the iron-catalyzed formation of hydroxyl radicals through Fenton reaction—an important source of ROS [11, 33].	11407	11538
24587916	Overproduction of ROS and their interaction with NO may contribute to reduction of NO bioavailability and therefore antioxidant effect of LF would prevent NO deficiency.	11539	11708
24587916	The result of this investigation suggested the antioxidant effect as another mechanism responsible for antihypertensive effects of LF.	11709	11843
24587916	Our results showed effectiveness of LF in both prevention and reversal studies.	11844	11923
24587916	Although some antioxidants such as tempol have been effective only in the prevention study LF with potent antioxidant effect could normalize the SBP even in Dex-induced hypertensive rats.	11924	12111
24587916	Metabolic consequences such as muscle and fat catabolism result in decreasing the rate of body weight gain during Dex administration.	12112	12245
24587916	LF could prevent the body weight loss effect of Dex.	12246	12298
24587916	Wakabayashi et al. have also reported protective effect of LF in preventing weight loss during infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 in mice.	12299	12445
24587916	This effect of LF may be mediated through immune modulation and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines production.	12446	12561
24587916	In conclusion, chronic LF treatment strongly reduced production of ROS and improved antioxidant capacity and reduced SBP in Dex-induced hypertension.	12562	12711
24587916	These findings confirm the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of Dex-induced hypertension and provide evidence that antioxidant effect may play a role in the antihypertensive effect of LF.	12712	12910
24587916	With regard to high antihypertensive activity with safety, LF could be suggested for clinical trial studies for prevention and/or treatment of hypertension.	12911	13067
28259923	Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancer and ranks second in cancer related deaths worldwide (1,2).	0	123
28259923	Although mortality from colorectal cancer has been progressively declining over the past two decades, a large number of colorectal cancer patients present with regional or distal metastatic cancer (3).	124	325
28259923	Among multiplex mechanisms, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the most important one to bestow metastatic potential to epithelial cancer cells enabling them to invade, migrate and subsequently disseminate to distant metastases (4,5).	326	568
28259923	EMT is a reversible multi-step process by virtue of which epithelial cells lose their apical polarity and adhesion with other cells and/or extracellular matrix (ECM) and acquire mesenchymal traits of plasticity, mobility and stem cell-like properties (6).	569	824
28259923	EMT is an essential physiological and patho-physiological process which is active during numerous embryogenesis processes and wound healing (7); but unfortunately, EMT can also occur during cancer progression when tumor cells exploit this mechanism to gain invasive and metastatic potential (8).	825	1120
28259923	EMT is the dominant program in human colon cancer, because robust EMT biology is highly prognostic for colon cancer recurrence (9).	1121	1252
28259923	The EMT process also can induce autocrine signaling involving VEGF and Flt-1 that enable invasive cells to become ‘self-sufficient’ for survival (10).	1253	1403
28259923	Induction of EMT in transformed colorectal epithelial cells could induce cells with circulating tumor cell (CTC) properties (10) suggesting that EMT may play a critical role in progression and metastases of colorectal cancer.	1404	1629
28259923	EMT changes will cause some signaling pathways activation, thus, some special biomarkers could be detected in the procedure.	1630	1754
28259923	Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is thought to be the initiation of tumor cell EMT (11–13).	1755	1862
28259923	Binding of Wnt proteins to their trans-membrane cell receptors can activate the downstream pathway known as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.	1863	1997
28259923	The β-catenin protein is the pivotal molecule in this pathway, and is stabilized by the ligand molecule T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (TCF/LEF-1) to form a functional transcription factor that mediates the activation of target genes involved in tumor generation, invasion and metastasis (12,14).	1998	2312
28259923	The activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway can increase the expression of mesenchymal cell marker vimentin, which is also considered to be an EMT marker (15).	2313	2468
28259923	Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament protein that is normally expressed in mesenchymal cells and in migratory epithelial cells, such as during embryogenesis and wound healing (16).	2469	2657
28259923	Vimentin is the cytoskeletal component playing a significant role in anchoring the position of the organelles, such as nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, in the cytosol for maintaining cell integrity (17).	2658	2877
28259923	Vimentin is also overexpressed in some malignant diseases (18–20).	2878	2944
28259923	Vimentin gene is methylated in colorectal cancer and has been established as a biomarker of colon cancer (21).	2945	3055
28259923	Because the promoter has been identified to be a target of the β-catenin-TCF/LEF-1 transcription factor, vimentin now is regarded as an EMT marker (16).	3056	3208
28259923	When EMT occurs, tumors upregulate mesenchymal protein marker N-cadherin and the concurrent loss of the epithelial protein marker E-cadherin (22,23).	3209	3358
28259923	E-cadherin downregulated expression is frequently observed in many different types of cancer (24–27); while N-cadherin in various cancer cell lines enhances their invasion and metastasis even in the presence of E-cadherin (28).	3359	3586
28259923	Interaction between N-cadherin the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) leads to activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway which might promote tumor cell survival and get into the circulation (29,30).	3587	3787
28259923	E-cadherin, also called CD324, encoded by the CDH1 gene, is a major calcium-dependent glycoprotein adhesion molecule mediating cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells (31–33).	3788	3962
28259923	E-cadherin functions as a tumor suppressor contributing to make tumor cells lose or decrease function of proliferation, invasion and/or metastasis (33).	3963	4115
28259923	Pleomorphic adenoma gene-like 2 (PLAGL2) is a class zinc finger protein derived from PLAGL gene family and with the structures of the seven C2H2 zinc finger domain on the N-terminal (34).	4116	4303
28259923	Human PLAGL2 gene expression is rich in fetal period (34).	4304	4362
28259923	The relationship between PLAGL2 and malignant tumor was first studied in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer (35,36).	4363	4497
28259923	Zheng et al (37) reported enhanced expression of PLAGL2 in neural stem cells (NSC) and glioma initiating cells (GIC) in cell lines and found that PLAGL2 gene overexpression strongly inhibits cell differentiation as well as enhance their ability of self-renew.	4498	4757
28259923	The mechanism may be related to the regulation on the Wnt signaling pathway to prevent cell differentiation (37).	4758	4871
28259923	Overexpression of PLAGL2 resulted in the combination of ligand and receptor in Wnt signaling pathway and subsequently Axin/APC/GSK3-β diamorph disrupted, thus, promoting the stability of β-catenin activation and its transfer into the nucleus.	4872	5114
28259923	This functionally contributes to PLAGL2 mediated NSC stop of differentiation and maintain self-renewal ability (37).	5115	5231
28259923	In addition, recent research results show that PLAGL2 can regulate the actin cytoskeleton structure and cell migration, therefore, plays an important role in cell transformation and apoptosis (38).	5232	5429
28259923	In the two ovarian cancer cell lines, ES-2 and HEY, knockout of PLAGL2 results in RhoA activation and Rac1 inactivation; subsequently, RhoA-ROCK (Rho-associated coil-containing protein kinase) pathway activation considerably increases invasive properties of the cells and significantly promote the organization of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in a RhoA-dependent manner; to the contrary, exogenous overexpression of PLAGL2 in the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, results in RhoA inactivation and Rac1 activation (39).	5430	5957
28259923	A previous study revealed that PLAGL2 is a transcription factor that correlated with the development, progression and prognosis of gastrointestinal cancer (40).	5958	6118
28259923	In the study, 225 cases of colorectal cancer specimens and 66 cases of carcinoma adjacent non-tumor tissue were detected and the immunohistochemical analysis reveal that PLAGL2 is expressed significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues and closely related to the depth of the tumor invasion (40).	6119	6419
28259923	In the present study, based on the theories and research findings above, the PLAGL2 was selected to explore its expression occurring in colorectal cancer oncogenesis, development and transfer.	6420	6612
28259923	Furthermore, the mechanism of PLAGL2 action at the cellular level was investigated to clarify the mechanism of influence of the PLAGL2 on the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer and to provide a new theoretical basis for the treatment of colorectal cancer.	6613	6881
28259923	All 44 CRC cases from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 were collected in this study and they were included according to the following criteria: i) First-time diagnosed CRC patients without any chemo, radio, bio-immune or hormone therapy; and ii) without other tumors.	6882	7153
28259923	The age of the patients ranged from 51 to 87 years (mean, 60.6 years).	7154	7224
28259923	Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before sample and data collection.	7225	7319
28259923	The malignant and borderline tissues were extracted from the surgical pathology archives in the Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute.	7320	7455
28259923	Follow-up data were conducted using hospital medical records.	7456	7517
28259923	The protein expression of PLAGL2 in the tissue samples were detected using immunohistochemistry.	7518	7614
28259923	In brief, tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene and gradually rehydrated in descending grades of ethanol.	7615	7730
28259923	Antigen was retrieved by pressure cooking in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 20 psi, 121°C for 30 sec and 90°C for 10 sec.	7731	7861
28259923	Endogenous peroxidase activities were blocked with endogenous peroxidase blocking agent (Dako, Kyoto, Japan) for 10 min followed by washing with 0.05% Tween-20/phosphate-buffered saline (PBST).	7862	8055
28259923	The sections were then incubated with 1:40 dilution of rabbit polyclonal primary antibody against PLAGL2 (ab121239; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 37°C for 35 min.	8056	8213
28259923	Sections were treated with secondary antibodies at 37°C for 30 min by Dako ChemMate Detection kit peroxidase/DAB+, rabbit/ mouse kit (Dako).	8214	8354
28259923	Finally, tissue sections were counterstained using haematoxylin.	8355	8419
28259923	Primary malignant tissue grade 4 was applied as positive control of PLAGL2; negative control was performed using the normal tissue and the same condition.	8420	8574
28259923	The strength of cell positive-staining was estimated in a semi-quantitative method.	8575	8658
28259923	The score of the staining intensity was classified as colorless (0), buff (1), brownish yellow (2), and dark brown (3) and the score of the positive cell percentage was classified as no positive cells (0), 15% positive cells or less (1), 16–50% positive cells (2), 51–75% positive cells (3), and >75% positive cells (4).	8659	8979
28259923	The staining index was calculated by multiplying the staining intensity score to the positive cell percentage score.	8980	9096
28259923	Finally, we applied the mean optical density (MOD) to evaluate the staining intensity of each slide for the consistencies in IHC staining intensities.	9097	9247
28259923	The MOD of each slices were determined by randomly selecting 6 representative fields, which were used to represent the whole tissue concentration of the stain or proportion of positive pixels.	9248	9440
28259923	The human cDNA template was preserved in our laboratory.	9441	9497
28259923	The PCR condition was 95°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 55 V for 30 sec and 72°C for 1 min plus a final extension period at 72°C for 5 min.	9498	9660
28259923	The PCR products were confirmed by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into pUM-T simple vector (Beijing Bioteke Biotechnology, Co., Ltd., Beijing, China).	9661	9825
28259923	Positive clones were sequenced by ABI 3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA).	9826	9921
28259923	Subsequently, the plasmid of T-PLAGL2 and pcDNA3.1 (Beijing Bioteke Biotechnology) were extracted using a plasmid preparation kit (Beijing Bioteke Biotechnology) and the nucleotides digested with BamHI (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) and EcoRI (Fermentas) enzymes.	9922	10186
28259923	The gel purified segments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas).	10187	10258
28259923	The constructed vector was transformed into E. coli and positive colons labeled pcDNA3.1- PLAGL2 were identified by colony PCR.	10259	10386
28259923	SW480, human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, was obtained from the Cell Bank of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Science (SIBS; Shanghai, China) and cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and kept in a humidified incubator (Heracell 150i; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Langenselbold, Germany) at 37°C, 5% CO2.	10387	10782
28259923	After reaching 90–95% confluency, SW480 cells were transfected with the vector pcDNA3.1- PLAGL2 using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturers instructions.	10783	10978
28259923	Forty-eight hours later, G418, 200 mg/l (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium for cell selection.	10979	11083
28259923	Single or mixed clonal populations of stably transfected cells were grown under G418 selection for 1–2 weeks and followed by routine DMEM culture for 2 weeks.	11084	11242
28259923	The expression level of PLAGL2 in G418-resistant clones was thereafter evaluated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis.	11243	11420
28259923	The human PLAGL2 gene nucleotide sequence NM-002657.2 was found in GeneBank, then PLAGL2 siRNA target sequence: AAGTGGGCTGGAAACTAGTTC was selected applying siRNA Target Finder (Ambion®; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX, USA) and the gene alignment analysis was performed using NCBI's BLAST to confirm the specificity of the gene silence.	11421	11762
28259923	According to the selected siRNA target sequence, synthetic two single stranded template DNA, 5′-AAAGCAGGAGGAGGAAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTATATGGTCTCTGCTC-3′, were designed and synthetized.	11763	11945
28259923	Positive sense oligonucleotide 3 µl and antisense oligonucleotide 3 µl were mixed and incubated at 90°C for 3 min and then slowly cooled to 37°C for 60 min.	11946	12102
28259923	The annealing fragment was inserted into pSilencer 2.0-U6 vector between the enzyme cut sites of BamHI and HindIII.	12103	12218

28259923	SW480 cells ~2×104 each well was cultured in 24-well plate, 37°C, 5% CO2, overnight.	12459	12543
28259923	After the cells grew to 90–95% confluent monolayer, the recombinant plasmid and liposome FuGENE 6 to 1:2 mixing ratio were transfected into the cells.	12544	12694
28259923	Twenty-four hours later, the cells were diluted with 1:10 and then cultured in the fresh medium.	12695	12791
28259923	After 48 h, the cells were replaced with medium with G418 400 mg/l for the selection of culture medium.	12792	12895
28259923	The resistant clones were obtained approximately 3 weeks later, and the cells were cultured with maintenance medium containing G418 of 200 mg/l culture.	12896	13048
28259923	In the present study, the siPLAGL2 expression in SW480 cell line was selected as the experimental group, and the wild-type SW480 cell line was used as the control group.	13049	13218
28259923	All operations were performed using RNase free instruments treated with DEPC.	13219	13296
28259923	Total RNA of the tissues or cells were extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcription PCR kit, SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis system for RT-PCR (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), according to the manufacturers instruction.	13297	13601
28259923	PLAGL2 gene expression at the mRNA level was tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) using Exicycler™ 96 Real-Time Quantitative Thermal Block from Bioneer (Shanghai, China).	13602	13792
28259923	All samples were run in triplicate in a total volume of 20 µl, which contains cDNA templet 1 µl, 10 µM forward primers 0.5 µl, 10 µM reversed primer 0.5 µl, SYBR-Green Master Mix 10 µl and nuclease-free water.	13793	14002

28259923	Human β-actin was used as the reference gene.	14146	14191
28259923	The relative expression analysis was performed using the 2−ΔΔCt relative quantification (RQ) method by comparing Ct values of PLAGL2 mRNA expression relative to the reference gene.	14192	14372
28259923	Cell motility was evaluated using scratch wound-healing and Transwell assays.	14373	14450
28259923	For the scratch wound-healing assay, SW480 cells (2.5×105/ml) were seeded in 6-well plates and grown to 80–90% confluence.	14451	14573
28259923	After aspirating the growth medium, cell monolayers in each group were scratched with a sterile pipette tip to generate a denuded zone.	14574	14709
28259923	Subsequently, the well plate was washed with PBS to remove the cellular debris and the cells left were cultured in the DMEM medium again.	14710	14847
28259923	The images were taken using a Olympus microscope (CH-BI45-T; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 0 and 24 h of incubation.	14848	14960

28259923	Lung are the most common organ for colorectal cancer metastasis.	18946	19010
28259923	Intra-vital video microscopy (IVVM) can directly observe the situation of tumor metastasis.	19011	19102
28259923	In this study, the SW480 cells expressing recombinant green fluorescent protein were injected into rats and then the colonization and growth of colorectal cancer cells in lung tissue were observed and analyzed using the IVVM technique.	19103	19338
28259923	The tumor cell staining was performed in accordance with the manual of CellTracker™ Green CMFDA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and the protocol was outlined below: Prepared 1 mM CMFDA working solution was stored in the dark.	19339	19568
28259923	For the SW480 cells with good growth state, the culture medium was drained and washed 3 times with PBS.	19569	19672
28259923	CMFDA working solution (10 µl) was added as well as culture media 2 ml and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30–45 min.	19673	19788
28259923	After washed 3 times with PBS, the cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and cell suspension was prepared.	19789	19901
28259923	The cells were counted using a hemocytometer and the cell viability was determined with the trypan blue exclusion method (living cells in >95% could be applied to the next step of the experiment).	19902	20098
28259923	Ninety healthy Wistar rats, 4–5 weeks old, weighing ~110-130 g, were purchased from the China Medical University Experimental Animal Center and were divided into 5 groups, each group of 18, using random number table method.	20099	20322
28259923	All the experiments on animals were performed follow internationally recognized guidelines on animal welfare and the national regulations.	20323	20461
28259923	The experimental protocol was conducted in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines for Investigations in Laboratory Animals and was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of China Medical University (Shenyang, China).	20462	20706
28259923	CMFDA-labeled SW480 cells were injected into the tail vein of the rats, 1×106 cells/rat and 6 animals of each group were sacrificed at 2 h, days 3 and 8, respectively, and the lungs were excised.	20707	20902
28259923	After ventilated perfusion, intact rat lung tissue was placed under a fluorescence microscope (glass plate 0.12 mm thick as slide) immediately and the number of metastatic cells or the fluorescence intensity on the surface of the pulmonary pleura was observed.	20903	21163
28259923	The images were recorded with CCD camera Sony ICX205, CoolSNAP cf™ (Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed using software of application of image analysis and processing, MetaMorph (Beijing Pioneer Technology, Beijing, China).	21164	21390
28259923	When the cell number was counted, 50 view fields were selected under the visual field of 10 (ocular) × 10 (objective) magnifications.	21391	21524
28259923	The actual number of tumor cells on 1-cm2 pulmonary pleura was estimated by the following formula: The average cell number per view field/32.5 (each view field area is 0.325 mm2).	21525	21704
28259923	The SPSS version 20 statistical software package was used to optimize the image quality analysis.	21705	21802
28259923	The χ2 test was used to assess the correlation between the PLAGL2 protein expression and various clinicopathological parameters.	21803	21931
28259923	The enumeration data values are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed by one-way ANOVA.	21932	22038
28259923	P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.	22039	22087
28259923	In general, the PLAGL2 immunohistochemistry staining intensity gradually increased from benign, early stage to advanced stage (Fig.	22088	22219
28259923	1A).	22220	22224
28259923	To further identify the differential expression of PLAGL2 between CRCs and their corresponding adjacent benign colorectal tissues, immunohistochemistry analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed in primary CRC and corresponding adjacent colorectal tissue samples from 44 patients.	22225	22530
28259923	As shown in Fig.	22531	22547
28259923	1B and C, both immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR detection found that PLAGL2 expression in primary CRC tissues was significantly higher than that observed in adjacent non-tumor tissues (P<0.001); in addition, compared with the 14 cases in clinical stage I–II, the PLAGL2 expression was significantly higher in the samples in clinical stage III–IV (P<0.001).	22548	22904
28259923	These results suggested that upregulation of PLAGL2 was correlated with the benign tissue canceration.	22905	23007
28259923	The PLAGL2 expression level is represented with immunohistochemistry staining index evaluated by multiplying the staining intensity score to the positive cell score.	23008	23173
28259923	Based on a measure of heterogeneity, a staining index of 3 or greater was defined as high expression, and 2 or lower as low expression.	23174	23309
28259923	In the univariate statistical analysis, the results in Table I show that the PLAGL2 expression level was correlated with tumor size (P=0.006), metastasis status (P<0.001) and clinical stage (P=0.034); while, there was no association with the patients age or the tumor pathological subtype.	23310	23599
28259923	These data indicated that the upregulation of PLAGL2 expression predicated advanced clinicopathological features and poor prognosis in patients with CRC.	23600	23753
28259923	To confirm the role of PLAGL2 in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis of colorectal cells and to the mechanisms, the full-length coding sequence (CDS) encoding PLAGL2 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 and the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 was digested with BamHI + EcoRI.	23754	24024
28259923	At the same time, siRNA for PLAGL2 was designed and synthesized by Guangzhou Ribobio, Co., Ltd., (Guangzhou, China) and the effect of siRNA was identified by qRT-PCR.	24025	24191
28259923	The in vitro transcription of PLAGL2 gene and PLAGL2 silencing in the SW480 cells were analyzed by real-time PCR and western blot analysis.	24192	24331
28259923	The cycle number of PLAGL2 at which the amplification reached the threshold was normalized against β-actin cycle number to determine the relative copy numbers between SW480 cell line, pcDNA3.1 transfected SW480 cell line, PLAGL2 silenced cell line and pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 transfected cell line.	24332	24622
28259923	The PLAGL2 exhibited significantly higher level of transcription in the pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 transfected cell line compared with PLAGL2 silencing cell line, pcDNA3.1 transfected cell line and SW480.	24623	24816
28259923	The results suggested that PLAGL2 gene transcription was upregulated in pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cell line (Fig.	24817	24938
28259923	2A).	24939	24943
28259923	Expression of PLAGL2 protein in SW480 cells was detected by western blot analysis.	24944	25026
28259923	The results confirmed that PLAGL2 protein was significantly highly expressed in the pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cells, whereas, very weak expression was seen in other cells (Fig.	25027	25211
28259923	2B).	25212	25216
28259923	The results showed that the colorectal cancer cell line stably overexpressing exogenous PLAGL2 and PLAGL2-silence were successfully established.	25217	25361
28259923	Since the expression change of PLAGL2 in pcDNA3.1 vector and empty vector of PLAGL2 silence was similar, in the subsequent results, only one set of vectors was used to represent both vector controls.	25362	25561
28259923	Promotion effect of PLAGL2 on SW480 cell migration was evaluated by scratch wound healing assay (Fig.	25562	25663
28259923	3A).	25664	25668
28259923	At time-point 0 h, scraped cells were photographed.	25669	25720
28259923	After 24 h, migration of cells into wounded areas was effectively increased in the PLAGL2 group.	25721	25817
28259923	This result suggests that PLAGL2 promoted migration of the SW480 cells.	25818	25889
28259923	PLAGL2 promoting invasion of SW480 cell invasion was determined by Transwell invasion assay.	25890	25982
28259923	PLAGL2 significantly promoted invasion of the cells (Fig.	25983	26040
28259923	3B).	26041	26045
28259923	Quantitative data derived from three independent experiments supported that PLAGL2 high expression effectively prevented invasion characteristics of tumor cells.	26046	26207
28259923	The expression level of EMT markers, N-cadherin and vimentin and epithelial marker, E-cadherin, were compared between the PLAGL2 silenced SW480 cells and PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cells by western blot assay.	26208	26415
28259923	The results of this analysis confirmed that the SW480 cells (low expressed PLAGL2) and PLAGL2 silenced cells produced N-cadherin and vimentin in substantially lower amounts than the SW480 cells highly expressing PLAGL2 and with opposite E-cadherin changing in the cells (Fig.	26416	26691
28259923	3C).	26692	26696
28259923	The results also revealed that the vectors had no effect on the protein expression.	26697	26780
28259923	Subsequently, to verify whether the PLAGL2 promoted CRC cell EMT through the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, we analyzed the β-catenin protein levels of the cell lysates.	26781	26952
28259923	The results showed that the whole protein level of β-catenin in the PLAGL2 cells were significant increased compared with the control cells, vectors transected cells and the PLAGL2-silenced cells (Fig.	26953	27154
28259923	4A).	27155	27159
28259923	Then, 20 mM FH535, the β-catenin inhibitor, was used to co-incubate the PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cells for 48 h. The β-catenin expression was activated after PLAGL2 decreased significantly, but PLAGL2 expression was not affected, after FH535 co-incubation.	27160	27416
28259923	This suggested that PLAGL2 is an upstream protein inducing EMT through activating the β-catenin pathway (Fig.	27417	27526
28259923	4B).	27527	27531
28259923	β-catenin is a nuclear transcription factor; therefore, we further used nuclei plasma separation technique to detect the regulation of nuclear β-catenin in colorectal cancer cell line PLAGL2.	27532	27723
28259923	The results showed that the overexpression of PLAGL2 increased the expression of β-catenin in the nucleus significantly; while the cytoplasmic β-catenin increased but the change was not obvious.	27724	27918
28259923	After overexpression of PLAGL2, the increase of β-catenin expression in the nucleus was ~2-3 times higher than that in the cytoplasm (Fig.	27919	28057
28259923	4C).	28058	28062
28259923	In the course of tumor metastasis, the adhesion of metastatic tumor cells to vascular endothelium is one of the key steps in the transfer process.	28063	28209
28259923	Lung is the most common organ for tumor metastasis occurrence of colorectal cancer.	28210	28293
28259923	To determine whether downregulation of PLAGL2 is capable of suppressing metastasis in lung cancer, the PLAGL2 introduced SW480 cells, PLAGL2 silenced SW480 cells and SW480 cells were injected into rats and evaluated for metastatic colonization capacity in a tail-vein assay.	28294	28568
28259923	Since the in vitro experiments showed that the empty vectors did not affect the expression of PLAGL2, in order to reduce the number of experimental animals as much as possible, the vector controls were not set, but only PLAGL2 high expression, PLAGL2 low expression and cell control group were set in the in vivo experiments.	28569	28894
28259923	The rats were dissected after 2 h of the cell injection into the caudal vein and the intact lung tissues were observed under fluorescence microscope.	28895	29044
28259923	Retention of metastatic tumor cells in pulmonary capillaries could be seen and the knockdown of PLAGL2 genes led to significant suppression of metastatic cell number in the lungs.	29045	29224
28259923	The reduction in the cell numbers had statistical significance (Fig.	29225	29293
28259923	5).	565	568
28259923	Three days later, due to excessive colonization of the cells on the lung pleural surface forming cell clusters that could not be counted, the fluorescence intensity was applied for cell metastasis assessment.	29298	29506
28259923	The rats were dissected on days 3 and 8, respectively.	29507	29561
28259923	The lung tissue was taken for observation and image acquisition.	29562	29626
28259923	MetaMorph software was used to measure the area and the fluorescence intensity of each group.	29627	29720
28259923	With the increase of the number of days, the total fluorescence area and the fluorescence intensity of the cell clusters formed on the lung surface was also significantly increased.	29721	29902
28259923	The statistical comparison between PLAGLA group with cell control group and comparison between PLAGLA group with PLAGL2 silenced group were all significant (P<0.01) (Fig.	29903	30073
28259923	5).	565	568
28259923	PLAGL2 is a member of the polymorphic adenoma gene zinc finger protein family, the other members include PLAGl and PLAGLl.	30078	30200
28259923	The PLAG family protein, mainly as a nuclear transcriptional regulator, is important to regulate various gene expressions, including physiological cell proliferation and pathological tumorigenesis.	30201	30398
28259923	Some previous studies have demonstrated that PLAGL2 is a transcription factor that overexpress and has active function in cancer progression (41–43).	30399	30548
28259923	In the present study, we started with an overview of 44 colorectal patients data for analyzing the relationship between the PLAGL2 expression and the clinicopathological manifestation.	30549	30733
28259923	Here, we report the overexpression of PLAGL2 at the invasive and high grade cases.	30734	30816
28259923	Thus, the PLAGL2 genes may be a new severity hallmark of the CRC patients.	30817	30891
28259923	In this context, we also confirmed the significant upregulation of PLAGL2 by immunohistochemistry in the tumor samples from clinical stage III–IV patients.	30892	31047
28259923	PLAGL2 was stained in both cytoplasm and nuclei.	31048	31096
28259923	Because of these finding, we initially confirmed the tumor metastasis promoting role of PLAGL2.	31097	31192
28259923	It showed clear and consistent role on CRC cell proliferation, invasion, migration and evident through both pathological tests and the clinicopathological data retrospective analysis.	31193	31376
28259923	We also found that the malignant level of CRC has a correlation in an PLAGL2 expression-dependent manner.	31377	31482
28259923	Our results further validated and confirmed a previous study (40).	31483	31549
28259923	In the present study, PLAGL2 overexpression is necessary for EMT as demonstrated by the pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 vector transfection and stable silencing via PLAGL2-silence vector transfection, respectively.	31550	31748
28259923	The results indicated that PLAGL2 upregulation may facilitate CRC tumor cell invasion and metastasis by regulating multiple EMT molecular expression parallel or dependent, including β-catenin, E-cadherin, vimentin and N-cadherin with in vitro CRC model and these promote the ability of tumor cell migration and invasion; in contrast, the SW480 cells with low expression of PLAGL2 showed more epithelial characteristics.	31749	32168
28259923	Therefore, the current studies consistently suggest that PLAGL2 is a key protein and might have potential to effectively induce cell EMT by itself.	32169	32316
28259923	Wnt/β-catenin activation was necessary for EMT, although it might not be required for the final effects.	32317	32421
28259923	Previously it was reported that tumor cells undergo EMT in response to Wnt/β-catenin activation and inhibition of the pathway could induce a reversal in the expression of epithelial to EMT markers with the restoration of the epithelial marker in carcinoma (44).	32422	32683
28259923	The results of the present study showed that PLAGL2 upregulation modulates Wnt/β-catenin activity in SW480 cells so that tumor cells may obtain the ability of migration and invasion by this pathway activity.	32684	32891
28259923	Whether PLAGL2 is an indispensable molecule or just facilitate cell EMT is still unclear, its overexpression represents an important initiation step for tumor cells to gain a migration and/or invasion advantage.	32892	33103
28259923	Intriguingly, when the PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cells were co-cultured with Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor FH535, the β-catenin protein expression was significantly prohibited but the PLAGL2 expression maintaining the normal.	33104	33322
28259923	Therefore, it can be postulated that PLAGL2 overexpression was necessary and initiation for induction of tumor cell EMT progression and PLAGL2 acts as the upstream molecule in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in favor of EMT rather than directly acting EMT itself.	33323	33586
28259923	This observation indicated that PLAGL2 may be an essential bio-factor in tumor cell migration and invasion that is upregulated in CRC, and its depletion might be accompanied by profound inhibition of EMT and thus could be a novel therapeutic target in metastatic carcinoma.	33587	33860
28259923	We further defined the relationships of β-catenin in nucleus and plasma using nucleus plasma isolation techniques.	33861	33975
28259923	It can be seen that with the overexpression of the PLAGl2, the expression level of β-catenin in the nucleus increased and the change in plasma was not obvious.	33976	34135
28259923	These results clearly told us that PLAGL2 mainly regulates the expression of β-catenin in the nucleus.	34136	34238
28259923	Finally, to confirm that PLAGL2 acts as a tumor EMT promoter during colorectal cancer lung metastasis in vivo.	34239	34349
28259923	The intra-vital video microscopy (IVVM) technique was used to show an early and constant enhanced tumor metastasis and growth progression.	34350	34488
28259923	PLAGL2 overexpressing SW480 cell injection into rats led to an increase of tumor colony formation on the pulmonary pleura in both very early and late stage, compared with the SW480 cell control group and the PLAGL2 silenced group.	34489	34719
28259923	In conclusion, the present study characterized PLAGL2 as a key regulator of EMT in SW480 cells, because increased migration and invasion activities of SW480 cells observed with PLAGL2 transfection.	34720	34917
28259923	Additionally, the findings of this study also indicate that EMT activity contributed to the overexpression of PLAGL2 molecule influencing several EMT relative protein expression alteration.	34918	35107
28259923	These data suggested that, Wnt/β-catenin pathway may be involved in the EMT and PLAGL2 might contribute substantially to the basic role of procession.	35108	35258
28259923	However, the accurate mechanism of PLAGL2 function on Wnt/β-catenin will have to be addressed in our follow-up study.	35259	35376
28260110	Colon cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide, as >1,000,000 individuals are diagnosed with colorectal cancer annually, resulting in a mortality rate of ~715,000 in 2010, compared with 490,000 in 1990 (1,2).	0	236
28260110	It is more common in developed countries, in which >65% of cases are found (3).	237	316
28260110	Colon cancer treatment options include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy; however, options are limited for patients with advanced colon cancer.	317	487
28260110	Therefore, the identification of novel therapeutic targets is important to develop a therapeutic strategy, which may improve survival rates.	488	628
28260110	Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a multifunctional enzyme, which catalyzes fatty acid synthesis from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a cofactor.	629	821
28260110	FASN is the key enzyme for de novo long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis.	822	892
28260110	In normal human tissues or cells, FASN is downregulated following the ingestion of a sufficient level of dietary fatty acids.	893	1018
28260110	However, several solid tumor and cell lines derived from these tumors overexpress FASN (4).	1019	1110
28260110	The different expression levels of FASN between cancer and normal tissues suggest that FASN may be a potential target for cancer therapy (5).	1111	1252
28260110	FASN relies on enzymatic activity for survival and proliferation in various types of human cancer (6).	1253	1355
28260110	The pharmacological or genetic inhibition of FASN induces growth arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells (7–9).	1356	1463
28260110	Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone found in certain plants and has been evaluated for its antiproliferative and apoptotic activities in various cancer cell lines, including breast (10), liver (11), lung (12), prostate (13) and cervical cancer (14), leukemia (15) and colon cancer (16).	1464	1782
28260110	Emodin has an anticancer effect based on the suppression of migration, invasion and angiogenesis (17,18).	1783	1888
28260110	The underlying mechanism of the anticancer activities of emodin includes generating reactive oxygen species (12) and inhibiting the expression of casein kinase II (19), protein kinase C (20), extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 (21), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor phosphorylation (22) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)/neu tyrosine kinase (23).	1889	2274
28260110	However, the function of emodin in the FASN-induced toxicity of human colon cancer cells remains to be elucidated.	2275	2389
28260110	The present study investigated the effects of FASN on intracellular fatty acid biosynthesis in emodin-induced cytotoxicity.	2390	2513
28260110	The findings suggested that emodin may be a novel FASN inhibitor and may assist in formulating a therapeutic strategy for colon cancer.	2514	2649

28260110	CCK8 (10 µl) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at 37°C, following which cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were assessed by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader.	5540	5737
28260110	Three replicate wells were used for each experimental condition.	5738	5802
28260110	The cells were harvested using Trypsin-EDTA, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed with lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM PI, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF, and placed on ice for 1 h with occasional vortexing.	5803	6098
28260110	Centrifugation followed at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to collect the supernatant.	6099	6182
28260110	A Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was used to determine the protein concentration.	6183	6302
28260110	The cell lysate (50 µg) was subjected to 6 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in Tris-Glycine buffer (25 mM Tris, 200 mM Glycine and 20% methanol) for 2 h (60 V).	6303	6534
28260110	The blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 h at 25°C and were then incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:3,000) for 2 h at room temperature and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence.	6535	6864
28260110	Following drug treatment, the cells were subjected to total RNA isolation using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer's protocol.	6865	6994
28260110	The RNA concentrations were determined by measuring the absorption at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer.	6995	7095
28260110	Aliquots of 1 µg total RNA from each sample were reverse transcribed into cDNA in a total volume of 20 ul using AccuPower® CycleScript RT PreMix (dT20) according to the manufacturer's protocol.	7096	7289

28260110	The PCR reactions were subjected to the following amplification conditions: denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 60°C for 30 sec and extension at 68°C for 60 sec.	7514	7685
28260110	FASN and GAPDH were incubated for 40 cycles.	7686	7730
28260110	The PCR products (10 µl) were separated on a 1% agarose gel and detected using ethidium bromide staining.	7731	7836
28260110	Following exposure to emodin and/or cerulenin, cells were harvested and suspended with cold PBS.	7837	7933
28260110	The cells were sonicated at 4°C and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min to obtain particle-free supernatants.	7934	8044
28260110	FASN activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the decrease of absorption at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH, as previously described (24).	8045	8207
28260110	Particle-free supernatant (20 µl), 25 mM KH2PO4-K2HPO4 buffer, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, 30 µM acetyl-CoA and 350 µM NADPH (pH 7.0) in a total volume of 200 µl were monitored at 340 nm for 5 min to measure background NADPH oxidation.	8208	8453
28260110	Following the addition of 100 µM of malonyl-CoA, the reaction was assayed for an additional 3 min to determine FASN-dependent oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm again.	8454	8615
28260110	Following treatment of cells with emodin and/or cerulenin at the corresponding concentration and for the indicated durations, the cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS.	8616	8798
28260110	The levels of intracellular free fatty acids were measured in the cells using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification Colorimetric kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.	8799	8968
28260110	The samples were measured against a standard of varying concentrations of palmitic acid (provided by the kit) and the optical density was measured at 570 nm in a 96-well microplate reader (VersaMax ELISA microplate reader; VersaMax; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).	8969	9241
28260110	The levels of free fatty acid in the samples were calculated using the slope of the standard curve, with the concentration expressed as nmol/µl.	9242	9386
28260110	The cells were cultured at a 106 density and treated with emodin and/or or cerulenin for 24 h. The cells were centrifuged and washed three times with PBS.	9387	9541
28260110	The supernatant was discarded and resuspended in 0.5 ml of cold PBS.	9542	9610
28260110	The cells were processed and labeled according to the EzWay Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit used for this assay.	9611	9730
28260110	The labeled cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto™ II; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).	9731	9843
28260110	The cells (1×105 cells/ml) were suspended in 300 µl PBS to which 700 µl ethanol was added.	9844	9934
28260110	The cells were incubated at 4°C for 1 h, washed with PBS and suspended in 250 µl of 1.12% sodium citrate buffer (pH 8.4) together with 12.5 µg RNase.	9935	10084
28260110	Incubation was continued at 37°C for 30 min.	10085	10129
28260110	The cellular DNA was stained by applying 250 µl propidium iodide (50 µg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature.	10130	10237

28260110	1.	10019	10021
28260110	3 (BD Biosciences) to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells.	10384	10450
28260110	Several colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480, SNU-C2A and SNU-C5) were treated with emodin for 24 h to determine its effect on cell proliferation (Fig.	10451	10604
28260110	1A).	10605	10609
28260110	Emodin exerted a significant dose-dependent antiproliferative effect in the HCT116 cell line (30.4 and 24.2% reduction at concentrations of 25 and 50 µM, respectively; Fig.	10610	10782
28260110	1A).	10605	10609
28260110	Among the cell lines, HCT116 cells expressed the highest protein level of FASN, whereas SW480, SNU-C2A and SNU-C5 cells expressed lower protein levels of FASN (Fig.	10788	10952
28260110	1B).	10953	10957
28260110	The results of the western blot analysis showed that emodin downregulated the protein expression of FASN, particularly in the HCT-116 cells, moderately downregulated expression in the SNU-C5 cells, and had no effect in the SW480 or SNU-C2A cells (Fig.	10958	11209
28260110	1C).	11210	11214
28260110	Cell proliferation decreased and the expression of FASN was downregulated in SW480 cells following exposure to emodin for 48 h (data not shown).	11215	11359
28260110	This result showed that emodin-induced cell death may be associated with the overexpression of FASN.	11360	11460
28260110	Emodin (25 and 50 µM) significantly downregulated the protein expression of FASN in HCT116 cells (Fig.	11461	11563
28260110	1C).	11210	11214
28260110	The HCT116 cells were then treated with emodin and the expression of FASN was measured over time (0–24 h).	11569	11675
28260110	The protein levels of FASN decreased following exposure to emodin for 6 h and were significantly decreased at 24 h (Fig.	11676	11796
28260110	2A).	11797	11801
28260110	The mRNA level of FASN also decreased following emodin treatment; however, the effect on protein was more marked, compared with that on mRNA (Fig.	11802	11948
28260110	2A).	11797	11801
28260110	CHX, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis, was added during emodin (25 µM) exposure to examine whether emodin regulates degradation of the FASN protein in HCT116 cells.	11954	12127
28260110	Degradation of the FASN protein increased with an additive effect in the presence of emodin and CHX (Fig.	12128	12233
28260110	2B).	12234	12238
28260110	Protein degradation is usually triggered by ubiquitin moieties attaching to protein.	12239	12323
28260110	Therefore, the present study examined whether emodin induced protein ubiquitination in the HCT116 cells.	12324	12428
28260110	The results showed that emodin induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig.	12429	12516
28260110	2C), and MG-132 was used as a potent proteasome inhibitor.	12517	12575
28260110	Whether emodin stimulated lysosomal activity was also examined.	12576	12639
28260110	Emodin did not convert LC3-I to the smaller form, LC3-II, which is an autophagy marker (Fig.	12640	12732
28260110	2D).	12733	12737
28260110	This result suggested that emodin induced the degradation of FASN protein caused by increased protein ubiquitination activity.	12738	12864
28260110	A high expression level of FASN is a molecular change associated with colon cancer.	12865	12948
28260110	In the present study, the cells were incubated with 25 µM emodin and/or the FASN inhibitor cerulenin (100 µM) for 24 h to evaluate cellular FASN activity.	12949	13103
28260110	Emodin reduced cellular FASN activity in the HCT116 cells to 39.2%, cerulenin reduced FASN activity to 60.4% and the two in combination reduced FASN activity to 53.8% (Fig.	13104	13276
28260110	3A).	13277	13281
28260110	The overexpression of FASN in several types of cancer markedly induces de novo lipogenesis, including phospholipids, which are necessary for de novo synthesis of the cell membrane (25).	13282	13467
28260110	Thus, inhibiting FASN can reduce the levels of phospholipids and free fatty acids required (26).	13468	13564
28260110	The present study measured free fatty acids using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification lit, as the primary function of FASN is to catalyze long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis.	13565	13735
28260110	Emodin treatment reduced the level of intracellular free fatty acids (Fig.	13736	13810
28260110	3B).	13811	13815
28260110	The emodin-induced (25 µM) FASN inhibitory activities were more marked, compared with those of cerulenin (100 µM) in HCT116 cells.	13816	13946
28260110	These results indicated that emodin inhibited FASN function.	13947	14007
28260110	To assess whether the FASN inhibitor, cerulenin, enhances the emodin-induced expression of FASN in HCT116 cells, the cells were incubated with emodin (25 µM) and/or cerulenin (100 µM) for 24 h. The combined treatment of emodin and cerulenin decreased the protein expression of FASN, compared with either treatment alone (Fig.	14008	14333
28260110	4A).	14334	14338
28260110	To determine whether cerulenin enhanced emodin-induced anticancer effects in HCT116 cells, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of emodin (10 and 25 µM) for various durations (6, 12 and 24 h), with or without cerulenin (100 µM), and performed a CCK8 assay.	14339	14613
28260110	Emodin exhibited cytotoxic effects in a dose-and time-dependent manner.	14614	14685
28260110	The combination of emodin and cerulenin induced higher antiproliferative effects, compared with those of emodin or cerulenin alone (Fig.	14686	14822
28260110	4B and C).	14823	14833
28260110	The induction of apoptosis by emodin and/or cerulenin was concordant with the cell viability results.	14834	14935
28260110	Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining (Fig.	14936	15015
28260110	4D) and caspase cleavage (Fig.	15016	15046
28260110	4E) following exposure of emodin (25 µM) and/or cerulenin (100 µM) for 24 h. The apoptotic effect of emodin and cerulenin in combination was higher, compared with apotosis induced by emodin or cerulenin alone.	15047	15256
28260110	These results suggested that the emodin-induced inhibition of FASN enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis.	15257	15365
28260110	In the present study, cells were also treated with emodin and palmitate (75 µM), the end product of the FASN reaction, to determine whether the emodin-induced cell death activities were associated with inhibiting FASN.	15366	15584
28260110	In the presence of palmitate, emodin-induced decreased cell viability was increased (Fig.	15585	15674
28260110	5A).	15675	15679
28260110	Propidium iodide staining was used to measure the number of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry.	15680	15774
28260110	Addition exogenous palmitate reduced the level of emodin-induced apoptosis (Fig.	15775	15855
28260110	5B).	15856	15860
28260110	These results suggested that emodin-stimulated cytotoxicity was regulated by fatty acid synthesis.	15861	15959
28260110	The PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 cascades are involved in cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis associated with FASN regulation in cancer (27–29).	15960	16107
28260110	The present study examined the effect of inhibiting FASN by emodin on PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.	16108	16214
28260110	Inhibiting FASN caused a time-dependent decrease in PI3K/Akt phosphorylation and increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the HCT116 cells (Fig.	16215	16356
28260110	6A).	16357	16361
28260110	The combined treatment with cerulenin enhanced these activities (Fig.	16362	16431
28260110	6A).	16357	16361
28260110	LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) were added with the emodin to determine whether these two pathways regulated the emodin-induced inhibition of FASN.	16437	16605
28260110	The inhibitors altered the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and ERK modulated by emodin (Fig.	16606	16694
28260110	6B and C).	16695	16705
28260110	These data indicated that the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways regulated the reduced expression of FASN induced by emodin.	16706	16834
28260110	Different expression levels of FASN between cancerous and normal cells have been suggested as a potential target for anticancer drug development (4).	16835	16984
28260110	FASN has been implicated in breast cancer predominantly through its connection with the activity of HER2 in transcriptional, proteomic and functional analyses (8,30,31).	16985	17154
28260110	The expression of FASN also appears to be important in cell growth and pathogenesis in colon cancer (32).	17155	17260
28260110	FASN is expressed in all colorectal neoplasms and there is a concomitant increase in fatty acid synthesis (32).	17261	17372
28260110	The overexpression of FASN by tumors is associated with improved survival rates of patients with colon cancer (33), and high serum levels of FASN in patients with colorectal cancer are associated with tumor events, lymph node metastasis status, distant metastasis and tumor clinical stage (5).	17373	17666
28260110	It has been suggested that inhibiting FASN pharmacologically reduces cell growth and survival, and induces the apoptosis of colon cancer cells (34).	17667	17815
28260110	For example, cerulenin, a natural FASN inhibitor, enhances antitumor activity when combined with oxaliplatin in human colon cancer cells (35) and suppresses liver metastasis of colon cancer (36).	17816	18011
28260110	C75, a stable synthetic small molecule developed specifically for inhibiting FASN, produces a cytotoxic effect modulated by p53 in colon carcinoma cells (37).	18012	18170
28260110	Naturally occurring olive oil polyphenols have the ability to suppress FASN, providing a well-tolerated novel colon cancer therapy (38).	18171	18307
28260110	However, no studies have reported that emodin has FASN inhibitory activity in cancer.	18308	18393
28260110	It has been suggested that emodin may be a fat-reducing drug by inhibiting FASN (39).	18394	18479
28260110	The findings of the present study revealed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that emodin suppressed the protein expression of FASN and reduced its activity in human colorectal cancer cells.	18480	18685
28260110	As shown in Fig.	18686	18702
28260110	1B, the HCT116 cell line had significantly elevated expression levels of FASN, compared with levels in the other colon cancer cell lines.	18703	18840
28260110	This elevated expression of FASN in HCT116 cells was more effective in reducing cancer cell death following emodin treatment, compared with cells with a low expression level of FASN (Fig.	18841	19028
28260110	1A).	10605	10609
28260110	Emodin only downregulated the expression of FASN in HCT116 cells (Fig.	19034	19104
28260110	1C), suggesting that emodin-induced cell death may be regulated by FASN-involved de novo fatty acid synthesis.	19105	19215
28260110	These data suggested that inhibiting FASN may be an effective strategy for treating colon cancer overexpressing FASN.	19216	19333
28260110	Previous studies have demonstrated that emodin suppresses tumor growth in LS1034 human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (40), induces apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress in colon cancer cells (16) and inhibits colon cancer cell growth by inhibiting VEGFR signaling (22).	19334	19615
28260110	However, the molecular mechanisms underlying emodin-induced cell death in colorectal cancer cells have not been investigated in detail.	19616	19751
28260110	Until now, no studies have reported the effect of emodin on the expression of FASN or its activity in cancer, including colorectal cancer.	19752	19890
28260110	The present study found that emodin suppressed the expression of FASN by degrading FASN protein, which was caused by elevated protein ubiquitination, in HCT116 cells (Figs.	19891	20063
28260110	1C and 2).	20064	20074
28260110	Tomek et al (9) reported that inhibiting FASN with C75 results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, including PI3K and MAPK signaling proteins, in ovarian cancer (9).	20075	20251
28260110	Emodin also induces the proteosomal degradation of EGFR/EGFR variant III in glioma stem cells (41).	20252	20351
28260110	However, no previous study has reported that emodin induces the degradation of FASN protein.	20352	20444
28260110	In the present study, emodin concomitantly inhibited FASN activity and downregulated the protein expression of FASN (Fig.	20445	20566
28260110	3A and B).	20567	20577
28260110	FASN is a key lipogenic enzyme.	20578	20609
28260110	The overexpression of FASN in several types of cancer induces de novo lipogenesis, which is involved in cell survival, proliferation, migration and invasion (27).	20610	20772
28260110	Therefore, downregulating the activity of FASN in cancer cells is necessary for tumor cell death.	20773	20870
28260110	The present study determined concentrations of free fatty acids using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification kit (Fig.	20871	20983
28260110	3B).	13811	13815
28260110	Emodin reduced the concentration of fatty acids, indicating that emodin inhibited the function of FASN in HCT116 cells.	20989	21108
28260110	FASN is essential for the proliferation and survival of human colorectal carcinoma cells, as demonstrated by the FASN inhibitor, which reduces the cell growth and promotes apoptosis (42).	21109	21296
28260110	The present study hypothesized that emodin induces colorectal cancer apoptosis by inhibiting the expression and function of FASN.	21297	21426
28260110	It was shown that emodin produced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in HCT116 cell viability (Fig.	21427	21527
28260110	4B and C) and induced apoptosis, as shown by Annexin/propidium iodide double staining and caspase cleavage (Fig.	21528	21640
28260110	4D and E).	21641	21651
28260110	It was also observed that cell viability and apoptosis were partially rescued following the addition of palmitate, which is the final product of FASN activity (Fig.	21652	21816
28260110	5A and B).	21817	21827
28260110	Palmitate-induced toxicity has been reported in various cell lines; however, the present study demonstrated that exogenous palmitate and emodin treatment increased HCT116 cell viability.	21828	22014
28260110	These results suggested that inhibiting FASN was a direct contributor to the anticancer effects of emodin on HCT116 colon cancer cells, and that fatty acid synthesis was closely associated with colon cancer cell death.	22015	22233
28260110	The PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways promote cell proliferation, survival and the anti-apoptotic response, and have been implicated in regulating the expression of FASN in cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer (28,43).	22234	22469
28260110	The level of FASN and activity of Akt are higher in HER2-positive cancer, and inhibiting fatty acid synthesis affects the HER2 and PI3K/Akt pathways (42).	22470	22624
28260110	FASN is regulated in malignancies by growth factor-dependent signaling, which activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways (44).	22625	22763
28260110	The downregulation of PI3K/Akt phosphorylation can attenuate the expression of FASN (27).	22764	22853
28260110	The FASN inhibitor, C75, inhibits pAkt, but increases pERK1/2 in ovarian cancer cells (7); the α-mangostin-induced inhibition of FASN decreases pAkt, but increases active pERK1/2 in breast cancer cells (27).	22854	23061
28260110	In the present study, it was found that emodin downregulated pPI3K and pAkt in a time-dependent manner (Fig.	23062	23170
28260110	6A).	16357	16361
28260110	Emodin upregulated active levels of pERK1/2 in HCT116 cells (Fig.	23176	23241
28260110	6A).	16357	16361
28260110	These data demonstrated that the emodin-induced inhibition of FASN may be associated with the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in colorectal cancer.	23247	23401
28260110	The findings of the present study suggested that emodin downregulated the expression of FASN, inhibited intracellular FASN activity and fatty acid biosynthesis, and induced antiproliferation and apoptosis in HCT116 human colon cancer cells.	23402	23642
28260110	Therefore, the results showed that emodin has therapeutic potential as a colon cancer treatment, and may provide a novel method in developing target-directed anticancer drugs for further investigations.	23643	23845
28204828	Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and extended ischaemia leads to irreversible myocardial damage (1,2), which results in pathological ventricular remodelling (3).	0	214
28204828	Therefore, strategies with which to reduce the myocardial injury have been the focus of studies on MI (4,5).	215	323
28204828	The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1), also known as Kruppel-like factor 10, was first discovered in foetal osteoblasts using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (6).	324	528
28204828	TIEG1 expression is induced by TGF-β, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and other cytokines (7).	529	626
28204828	It is located in multiple cell types and tissues, such as myocytes, tumour tissues and osteoblasts (8,9).	627	732
28204828	The TIEG1 gene encodes a 72 kDa protein, which regulates cell growth and apoptosis (10,11).	733	824
28204828	There has been significant progress regarding the role of TIEG1 in various diseases.	825	909
28204828	In the field of cancer studies, Yao et al found that TIEG1 blocked the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of leukaemic cell lines, including HL-60, U937, Raji and K562 in both a time- and dose-dependent manner (12).	910	1130
28204828	Jiang et al proved that the transactivation of TIEG1 inhibited the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner (13).	1131	1271
28204828	Moreover, Jin et al demonstrated that TIEG1 inhibited the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer by suppressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transcription and the EGFR-related signalling pathway (14).	1272	1485
28204828	However, the biological function of TIEG1 in the cardiovascular field remains unclear.	1486	1572
28204828	In 2011, Miyake et al discovered that TIEG1 was a feedback regulator of myostatin in myoblasts (9), and Li et al illustrated that TIEG1 played a novel role as a blocker in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy via the GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) signalling pathway (15).	1573	1852
28204828	In this study, we investigated both the functional changes and underlying pathway variations caused by TIEG1 deficiency in ischaemic heart disease, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments in an aim to fully determine the role of TIEG1 in heart disease.	1853	2106

28204828	Statistical analyses for the measurement of significant differences between the TIEG1 KO and WT groups were performed using the Student's t-test.	14517	14662
28204828	Probability values of P<0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences.	14663	14758
28204828	To examine the biological role of TIEG1 in CM apoptosis, CMs isolated from TIEG1 KO and WT mice underwent 48 h of exposure to hypoxic conditions.	14759	14904
28204828	We evaluated TUNEL-positive cells and found that TIEG1 deficiency led to an approximately 15% decrease in the apoptosis of myocytes in the border areas compared to the WT group (P<0.05; Fig.	14905	15095
28204828	1A and D).	15096	15106
28204828	To determine the functional role of TIEG1 in CM proliferation, Ki67 immunostaining was performed.	15107	15204
28204828	We calculated the number of Ki67-positive cells and found that TIEG1 deficiency led to a 20% greater number of proliferative CMs than the WT mice (P<0.05; Fig.	15205	15364
28204828	1B and E).	15365	15375
28204828	To determine the functional role of TIEG1 in endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation was performed.	15376	15482
28204828	We calculated the length of capillary structure in the TIEG1 KO and WT group, and found that the endothelial cells from the TIEG1 KO mice had a greater powerful ability of microvessel formation than those from the WT mice (P<0.05; Fig.	15483	15718
28204828	1C and F).	15719	15729
28204828	To determine whether TIEG1 plays a key role in cardiac function, we evaluated the myocardial contractile parameters at 3 and 28 days post-MI in mice.	15730	15879
28204828	The echocardiographic results indicated that the absence of TIEG1 led to an improvement in heart function compared to the WT group at 28 days post-MI (Fig.	15880	16035
28204828	2A), including a better EF (TIEG1 KO, 41.496±2.131%; WT, 27.616±2.503%), and FS (TIEG1 KO, 23.522±0.870%; WT, 17.536±1.585%) (P<0.05; Fig.	16036	16174
28204828	2B and C).	16175	16185
28204828	Furthermore, the LVEDD and LVESD were shorter in the TIEG1 KO mouse hearts than in the WT group at 28 days post-MI (LVEDD: TIEG1 KO, 3.841±0.122 mm; WT, 4.165±0.108 mm; LVESD: TIEG1 KO, 2.950±0.133 mm; WT, 3.420±0.112 mm) (P<0.05; Fig.	16186	16421
28204828	2D and E).	16422	16432
28204828	Moreover, the haemodynamic results revealed a similar effect.	16433	16494
28204828	Compared to the WT group, the TIEG1 KO mice had a significantly higher LVSP, a lower LVEDP and a higher ±dp/dt (TIEG1 KO: LVSP, 125±12 mmHg; LVEDP, 2.4±0.8 mmHg; dp/dt, 11500±1050; −dp/dt, −9700±790 mm; WT: LVSP, 95±7 mmHg; LVEDP, 5.9±1.1 mmHg; dp/dt, 7800±1100; −dp/dt, −5400±850) (P<0.05; Fig.	16495	16790
28204828	2F–I).	16791	16797
28204828	To evaluate the effect of TIEG1 on infarct size variation, Masson's trichrome staining was used.	16798	16894
28204828	The quantitative assessment of myocardial fibrosis indicated that the TIEG1-deficient mice had reduced 10% scar area compared to the WT group (P<0.05; Fig.	16895	17050
28204828	4A and B).	17051	17061
28204828	We validated the role of TIEG1 in apoptosis in vivo using TUNEL staining in 3-day samples.	17062	17152
28204828	Our findings revealed that the defect of TIEG1 markedly decreased the number of apoptotic nuclei in the border zone compared to the WT group (P<0.05; Fig.	17153	17307
28204828	3A and B).	17308	17318
28204828	The proliferation ratio of myocytes in the border area of 7-day-samples was measured by immunostaining with BrdU antibody.	17319	17441
28204828	We observed more double-positive staining of BrdU and TnI (P<0.05; Fig.	17442	17513
28204828	3C and D) in the CMs in the border zones from the TIEG1 KO mice than those from the WT mice.	17514	17606
28204828	We validated the role of TIEG1 in angiogenesis in vivo using immunofluorescence staining in 28-day-samples.	17607	17714
28204828	Our findings suggested that the defect of TIEG1 markedly increased microvessel formation in the border zone compared to the WT group (P<0.05; Fig.	17715	17861
28204828	3E–H).	17862	17868
28204828	In order to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for the anti-apoptotic effects observed with the loss of TIEG1 in CMs, we analysed the relative expression levels of Pten/Akt and Bcl-2/Bax signalling pathway molecules by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis.	17869	18133
28204828	Our results revealed that a deficiency in TIEG1 led to the differential expression of the Pten/Akt and Bcl-2/Bax signalling pathway molecules at the mRNA and protein level.	18134	18306
28204828	Specifically, the deficiency of TIEG1 decreased the expression of Pten, Bax and caspase-3, and increased the p-Akt/t-Akt ratio and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio (P<0.05; Fig.	18307	18471
28204828	4C–E).	18472	18478
28204828	We also examined the expression of related molecules in the Pten/Akt and Bcl-2/Bax signalling pathways in endothelial cells.	18479	18603
28204828	Our results revealed the deficiency of TIEG1 also decreased Pten expression in endothelial cells, as in the CMs, and increased VEGF expression (P<0.05; Fig.	18604	18760
28204828	4F–H).	18761	18767
28204828	Our study first assessed the role of TIEG1 in reducing myocardial damage and promoting microvessel generation in the infarcted heart.	18768	18901
28204828	The major findings of our study are as follows: i) the lack of TIEG1 improves heart function and haemodynamics; ii) the absence of TIEG1 results in less myocardial apoptosis and greater myocyte proliferation, as shown by both in vitro and in vivo experiments; and iii) TIEG1 deficiency causes the variable expression of the Pten/Akt and Bcl-2/Bax signalling pathways; thus, these are the mechanisms through which TIEG1 deficiency has cardioprotective effects.	18902	19361
28204828	A number of studies have revealed the biological functions of TIEG1 in different cells (12,15,21).	19362	19460
28204828	Of these properties, apoptosis induction and proliferation inhibition by TIEG1 have garnered attention from researchers.	19461	19581
28204828	In the field of oncology, higher levels of TIEG1 protein have been shown to be expressed in epithelial cells compared to breast tumour cells, whereas it was absent in infiltrative tumour tissues, demonstrating its inhibitory role in cell growth (22).	19582	19832
28204828	The results of haematological tumour analyses have also demonstrated the effects of TIEG1 (23,24).	19833	19931
28204828	Jin et al found that TIEG1 is a key regulator that promotes the apoptosis of K562 leukaemic cells (25).	19932	20035
28204828	Furthermore, TIEG1 has been shown to promote the apoptosis of different leukaemia cell lines, such as HL-60, U937, Raji and K562, in a dose- and time-dependent manner (12).	20036	20208
28204828	For cardiovascular diseases, TIEG1 was first reported to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy in 2007 (26), and this result was confirmed in a later clinic study (27).	20209	20374
28204828	Currently, TIEG1 prevents CMs from Ang II-mediated hypertrophy, which provides a novel strategy for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy (15).	20375	20517
28204828	Although the effect of TIEG1 on hypertrophy has been studied, the functional role of TIEG1 in myocardial infarction remains unknown.	20518	20650
28204828	In this study, we examined cell apoptosis and proliferation in the myocardium both in vitro and in vivo, in a TIEG1-deficient mouse model of MI compared to a WT mouse model of MI.	20651	20830
28204828	Moreover, we characterised the heart function and haemodynamics of the TIEG1 KO mice and investigated the underlying pathway responsible for these phenotypic changes.	20831	20997
28204828	For our in vitro experiments, CMs from TIEG1 KO mice were significantly more resistant to apoptosis according to the results of TUNEL assay.	20998	21138
28204828	By contrast, Ki67 immunostaining demonstrated that the lack of TIEG1 was also beneficial to myocyte proliferation.	21139	21253
28204828	These results suggest the acceleration of apoptosis and the suppression of proliferation by TIEG1 in CMs, which have not been previously reported, at least to the best of our knowledge.	21254	21439
28204828	Notably, our findings using the animal model of MI also revealed that the TIEG1 KO mice had better cardiac functional recovery than WT mice following coronary artery ligation surgery.	21440	21623
28204828	The results of histological analysis confirmed greater myocardium preservation and a smaller scar area in the TIEG1 KO infarcted mouse heart than in the WT mouse hearts.	21624	21793
28204828	Our results provide strong evidence for the apoptosis-promoting role of TIEG1 in CMs both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis can be initiated by the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway.	21794	21980
28204828	This pathway is controlled by the Bcl-2 protein family, which is critical for regulating apoptosis and cell survival.	21981	22098
28204828	Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by forming heterodimers with Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein, to stop its release (28).	22099	22208
28204828	Bcl-2 and Bax are relevant to apoptosis in CMs, and they are apoptosis involved factors in myocytes under ischaemic conditions (29,30).	22209	22344
28204828	A correlation between TIEG1 and Bcl/Bax in tumour cells has been confirmed (12); however, this remains unclear in cardiovascular cells.	22345	22480
28204828	The tumour suppressor gene, Pten, inactivates the signalling pathway by promoting protein phosphatase to reduce tumour cell growth and invasion (31,32).	22481	22633
28204828	Similarly, Pten inhibition results in cardioprotective effects against ischaemia reperfusion injury of the myocardium by stimulating apoptotic survival signals (33).	22634	22799
28204828	Furthermore, the inactivation of the Pten gene is regulated by transcriptional modification (34).	22800	22897
28204828	Pten and Bcl-2/Bax are associated with apoptosis, and they are critical apoptosis factors in CMs.	22898	22995
28204828	In this study, we found an increased Bcl-2 expression, and decreased Bax and downregulated expression of Pten caused by TIEG1 deficiency at both the mRNA and protein level in CMs, which is key to protecting CMs against apoptosis.	22996	23225
28204828	However, the details of this process require further investigation.	23226	23293
28204828	In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the deletion of TIEG1 results in a significant anti-apoptotic effect for myocardium salvage following ischaemic injury.	23294	23454
28204828	The cardioprotective effects caused by TIEG1 defects are associated with variations in the expression of Pten, Akt and Bcl-2/Bax.	23455	23584
28204828	These data suggest that TIEG1 may be a novel target for the effective therapy of MI.	23585	23669
27630165	The cytokine IL-10 plays a central role in determining the outcome of many different infections, including malaria (1, 2).	0	122
27630165	In murine models of primary malaria infection, IL-10 is critical for repressing the development of immune-mediated pathology in tissues, including the liver, lung, and brain (3–7).	123	303
27630165	In agreement, levels of IL-10 are frequently lower in individuals with severe Plasmodium falciparum infections compared with individuals with mild or asymptomatic infections (8, 9).	304	485
27630165	Nevertheless, in both human and murine malaria infections, overproduction or mistimed production of IL-10 can also blunt protective immune responses during infection, resulting in high parasite burdens and morbidity (10, 11).	486	711
27630165	Although the precise mechanisms of action of IL-10 during malaria infection remain to be defined, it has been shown to suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IFN-γ, and IL-12 (4, 6).	712	924
27630165	In other models, IL-10 can directly suppress the inflammatory activity of multiple cell types within the innate and adaptive immune compartments, including macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells (1, 2, 12).	925	1143
27630165	CD4+ T cells, and in particular the Th1 subset, are the major source of IL-10 during both murine and human malaria infections (3, 5, 13, 14).	1144	1285
27630165	As a consequence, IL-10–producing Th1 cells are nonredundantly required for attenuation of morbidity and immune-mediated pathology during primary murine malaria infection (3, 5).	1286	1464
27630165	At present, however, the fate and the memory potential of these IL-10–producing Th1 cells following clearance of primary malaria infection remains unclear, both in mice and in humans.	1465	1648
27630165	A number of the signals that instruct IL-10 expression by Th1 cells during primary malaria infection, including IL-27R and ICOS, play major roles in programming the development, maintenance, and function of memory T cell populations (15–18), implying that IL-10–producing Th1 cells may have a selective advantage in transitioning into long-lived memory cells.	1649	2008
27630165	In apparent agreement, it has been reported that durable parasite-specific IL-10–, but not IFN-γ–, producing CD4+ T cell responses can be sustained in individuals many years after malaria infection (19).	2009	2212
27630165	However, in contrast to the results reported by Wipasa et al. (19), long-lived IFN-γ–producing activated CD4+ T cells have been observed during malaria and multiple other infections (20–22).	2213	2403
27630165	Moreover, it has recently been suggested that P. falciparum–induced IL-10 production is maintained only during the duration of active malaria infection (23), and that the frequencies of maintained IL-10–producing CD4+ T cells are inversely correlated with duration from previous exposure (14).	2404	2697
27630165	These latter results are consistent with the divergent or linear limited potential models of memory T cell development where fully differentiated effector T cells—it is currently thought that IL-10 expression is induced in fully differentiated effector Th1 cells (24, 25)—have limited capacity to form memory T cells (26, 27).	2698	3024
27630165	Thus, it remains to be definitively resolved, in any model, whether IL-10–producing Th1 cells have the capacity to become long-lived memory cells that subsequently regulate the nature and strength of anamnestic immune responses during secondary infections.	3025	3281
27630165	Of relevance, it has been hypothesized that infection-acquired protection against severe malaria disease (termed antidisease immunity) involves development of immune mechanisms that attenuate the strong inflammatory responses that contribute toward much of the morbidity and mortality of initial malaria infections (9, 28).	3282	3605
27630165	At present, the molecular and cellular basis of protective anamnestic immune responses to malaria are unclear (9, 28); however, given the importance of IL-10 in regulating inflammatory responses during malaria infection (1–9), it is foreseeable that IL-10 may play a major role in acquired (antidisease) protection against severe malarial disease.	3606	3953
27630165	Nevertheless, whether primary parasite exposure leads to qualitative or quantitative reprogramming of the dynamics of the IL-10 response during subsequent malaria infections, and whether IL-10 exerts stronger or dichotomous activity during secondary versus primary malaria infections, has yet to be definitively addressed.	3954	4276
27630165	In this study, utilizing a novel tractable IFN-γ and IL-10 dual reporter system, we have shown that IL-10–producing Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells generated during the early phases of primary malaria infection have limited ability to populate the memory CD4+ T cell compartment that functions during subsequent parasite infections.	4277	4605
27630165	However, CD4+IFN-γ–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)+IL-10–GFP− memory T cells rapidly express IL-10 during parasite re-exposure, which leads to enhanced IL-10 production during secondary malaria infection compared with primary infection.	4606	4843
27630165	We have addressed the impact of elevated IL-10 production during secondary infection in shaping anamnestic immune responses and demonstrate that IL-10 may play an important role in regulating reactivation of memory CD4+ T cells.	4844	5072
27630165	Our results significantly increase our understanding of the dynamics and maintenance of IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells postinfection and reveal the functions of IL-10 during secondary parasite infections.	5073	5279

27630165	The concentrations of IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-10 in supernatants were measured by a cytometric bead array mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine kit (BD Biosciences), following the manufacturer’s instructions.	10640	10834
27630165	The concentrations of multiple innate and adaptive-derived cytokines and chemokines in plasma were measured by ProcartaPlex 26-plex mouse cytokine and chemokine panel (eBioscience) using a Luminex 100/200 system, following the manufacturer’s instructions.	10835	11090
27630165	For two group comparisons, statistical significance was determined using a t test.	11091	11173
27630165	For three or more group comparisons, statistical significance was determined using a one-way or two-way ANOVA, with a Bonferroni post hoc analysis.	11174	11321
27630165	Results were considered as significantly different when p < 0.05 To date, the fate of CD4+IFN-γ+IL-10+ T cells postinfection and their capacity to enter into the long-lived (memory) CD4+ T cell pool has not been assessed in detail in any model.	11322	11566
27630165	Thus, to definitively investigate whether a long-lived CD4+IFN-γ+IL-10+ T cell population is maintained after malaria infection, we generated dual IFN-γ–YFP and IL-10–GFP reporter mice and determined the kinetics of the Ag-experienced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell response during and after primary malaria infection.	11567	11874
27630165	We assessed the expansion and contraction of the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell response in the spleen, BM, and selected nonlymphoid organs to identify whether particular tissue sites provided niche environments for the preferential survival or maintenance of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells.	11875	12145
27630165	Because tetramers do not exist for tracking parasite-specific CD4+ T cell responses during P. yoelii NL infection, we used CD11a and CD49d as proxy markers for activated Ag-experienced cells, which include malaria-specific effector and memory CD4+ T cell populations (31, 32).	12146	12422
27630165	Of note, IL-10 is only expressed by the CD11a+CD49d+ subset during malaria infection (32).	12423	12513
27630165	As previously described (32), the numbers of IFN-γ–YFP and IL-10–GFP dual-expressing CD4+CD11a+CD49d+ T cells increased significantly in all examined organs by day 7 of infection, before antimalarial drug administration (Fig.	12514	12739
27630165	1A, 1B).	12740	12748
27630165	Following antimalarial drug administration, used to terminate infection at a defined time point and to replicate chemotherapy of human malaria infection, the numbers of Ag-experienced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells declined heterogeneously in the examined tissues, with the contraction being extremely fast in the spleen and slowest in the BM (Fig.	12749	13087
27630165	1B).	12744	12748
27630165	By day 60 postinfection, the numbers of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells had returned to approximately baseline levels in all examined organs, indicating that Ag-experienced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were not maintained long-term in any anatomical compartment after malaria infection (Fig.	13093	13365
27630165	1B).	12744	12748
27630165	Consistent with the above data, IL-10–GFP+ T cells were disproportionately lost within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell population after malaria infection during the memory maintenance phase (which we define as the interval between clearance of infection and the time of reinfection) (Fig.	13371	13658
27630165	1C, 1D).	13659	13667
27630165	By day 60 postinfection the frequencies of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell response were ∼20–25% of those observed on day 7 (Fig.	13668	13824
27630165	1C, 1D).	13659	13667
27630165	This is in contrast to the frequencies of YFP+GFP− cells within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell pool, which was stably maintained (or increased) in all examined tissues between days 14 and 60 postinfection (Fig.	13834	14044
27630165	1E, 1F).	14045	14053
27630165	In agreement with the reporter data, Ag-experienced splenic CD4+ T cells obtained on day 7 of infection produced high levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 protein (Fig.	14054	14211
27630165	1G, 1H).	14212	14220
27630165	Moreover, whereas Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells obtained on day 60 of infection produced only marginally less IFN-γ, they produced significantly less IL-10 than did counterpart cells obtained from day 7 of infection (Fig.	14221	14440
27630165	1G, 1H).	14212	14220
27630165	Collectively, these data show that CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells are less able to populate the long-lived Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell compartment than are other CD4+ T cell subsets after malaria infection.	14450	14645
27630165	Furthermore, IL-10 production is extinguished rapidly within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell compartment postinfection.	14646	14764
27630165	The disproportionate loss of the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell pool after clearance of malaria infection indicated that the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells may exhibit specific cellular characteristics that restricted their maintenance.	14765	15019
27630165	To examine this, CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells and, for comparison, CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells that survived postinfection were first subcharacterized into various populations of effector and memory T cell subsets (Fig.	15020	15224
27630165	2A).	15225	15229
27630165	As anticipated, high frequencies of both CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells and CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell subsets exhibited an effector T cell phenotype (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R−, KLRG-1−) on day 14 of infection; however, at later time points after clearance of infection (days 30 and 60) there was a significant divergence in phenotypes of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells and CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells, with significantly higher frequencies of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells exhibiting an effector T cell profile compared with CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells (Fig.	15230	15735
27630165	2B).	15736	15740
27630165	Correspondingly, a significantly higher frequency of CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells exhibited an effector memory T cell signature (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R+, CD103−KLRG-1−) after clearance of infection compared with CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells (Fig.	15741	15969
27630165	2B), and the proportion of CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells exhibiting an effector memory T cell phenotype increased with time during the memory maintenance phase postinfection (Fig.	15970	16140
27630165	2B).	15736	15740
27630165	Thus, the loss of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells after malaria infection (Fig.	16146	16214
27630165	1) appears to be related to their skewed differentiation as short-lived effector T cells and their inability to acquire durable effector memory T cell characteristics.	16215	16382
27630165	Of note, very few CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells and CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells displayed phenotypic characteristics of resident memory (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R+, CD103+), central memory (CD44+CD62Lhigh, IL-7R+), terminally differentiated effector (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R−, KLRG-1+), or effector-like effector memory T cells (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R+, CD103−, KLRG-1+) on any day after clearance of malaria infection (Fig.	16383	16781
27630165	2A, 2B and results not shown).	16782	16812
27630165	It is clear that in addition to differentiation status, the activation profile of T cells may determine their ability to populate the long-lived memory T cell compartment postinfection (22, 33).	16813	17007
27630165	CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells expressed significantly higher levels of markers associated with cellular activation and exhaustion/regulation, including PD-1, ICOS, Lag3, and TIGIT on days 30 and 60 compared with CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells (Fig.	17008	17237
27630165	2C and results not shown).	17238	17264
27630165	Thus, these data suggest that the activation profile of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells, as well as their differentiation status, may restrict their maintenance after malaria infection.	17265	17439
27630165	The failure of the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells to express characteristics of memory T cells after malaria infection indicated that the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were lost from the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell population after infection because they were short-lived and rapidly died postinfection.	17440	17723
27630165	To directly investigate this, total splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells (CD11a+CD49d+) and Ag-experienced YFP+GFP− and YFP+GFP+ subsets were purified from dual reporter mice on day 7 of infection (Fig.	17724	17925
27630165	3A), and equal numbers were adoptively transferred, separately, into infected CD45.1 congenic mice (day 7 of infection).	17926	18046
27630165	Thus, donor T cell populations were transferred into the same physiological environment (i.e., Ag load and cytokine milieu) from which they were obtained, ensuring that the memory capacity of the cells could be appropriately defined.	18047	18280
27630165	Utilizing the established drug cure model, recipient mice were treated with antimalarial drugs on day 9 to clear infection, and the maintenance of the donor populations was examined on day 60 postinfection.	18281	18487
27630165	All three adoptively transferred populations were identified in the spleen on day 60 postinfection and they remained CD11a+ and CD49d+, verifying the validity of the surrogate marker system (Fig.	18488	18683
27630165	3B).	18684	18688
27630165	Significantly fewer CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were, however, recovered in the spleen than CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells, and a lower trend in recovery of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells was observed compared with total Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells (Fig.	18689	18916
27630165	3C).	18917	18921
27630165	The reduced maintenance of transferred CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells in the spleen compared with the CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell population was not because they preferentially accumulated within other tissues, as fewer CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were recovered in the BM and liver than CD4+YFP+GFP− or total Ag-experienced T cell populations (Fig.	18922	19246
27630165	3C).	18917	18921
27630165	Notably, in addition to their apparent short life span, a high proportion of the transferred donor CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells had extinguished GFP expression, to a similar degree in all the tissues analyzed, by day 60 postinfection (Fig.	19252	19483
27630165	3D).	19484	19488
27630165	Consequently, as the Vert-X mice are transcriptional reporters (30), these data imply that uniform and stable transcription of IL-10 mRNA does not occur in malaria-specific activated CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells during and/or after malaria infection, suggesting that the IL-10 gene is not epigenetically imprinted for poised production in these cells.	19489	19832
27630165	Alternatively, the IL-10 gene may be epigenetically silenced in the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells postinfection, actively inhibiting gene expression.	19833	19973
27630165	In contrast, consistent with data in Fig.	19974	20015
27630165	1, donor CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells maintained IFN-γ–YFP expression (Fig.	20016	20083
27630165	3D).	19484	19488
27630165	As the YETI mice are also transcriptional reporters (29), this may suggest that the IFN-γ gene is epigenetically modified in IFN-γ–producing (IL-10–GFP+/−) CD4+ T cells, leading to poised expression of the cytokine mRNA in Th1-derived memory cells after malaria infection, as has been shown in NK cells and CD8+ T cells in other models (29, 34).	20089	20434
27630165	This is consistent with the ability of Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells to maintain IFN-γ protein production postinfection (Fig.	20435	20558
27630165	1G).	20559	20563
27630165	Collectively, these data show that not only are CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells inherently short-lived compared with other Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell subsets, but they fail to stably express IL-10 postinfection.	20564	20764
27630165	The extensive contraction of the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell population, as well as their exhausted phenotype, after malaria infection indicated that the subset may not play a major role in shaping anamnestic immune responses during temporally separated rechallenge infections.	20765	21034
27630165	Consistent with this scenario, following adoptive transfer (utilizing the same methodology as in Fig.	21035	21136
27630165	2), the small number of maintained CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell–derived memory cells were unresponsive during early secondary infection, failing to proliferate and increase in number in any examined organ (Fig.	21137	21338
27630165	4A).	21339	21343
27630165	Moreover, the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell–derived cells also failed to re-express IL-10–GFP following pathogen re-exposure in either the spleen or liver (Fig.	21344	21494
27630165	4B–D), with the latter being a major tissue site where IL-10 limits immune-mediated pathology during malaria infection (3–7).	21495	21620
27630165	These data suggest that CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell–derived cells are unable to expand and accumulate in number and are not imprinted to immediately replicate their early effector phenotype upon reactivation during reinfection.	21621	21840
27630165	In contrast, CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell–derived memory cells responded rapidly during secondary infection, expanding to a significantly greater extent than CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell–derived memory cells in the spleen (fold change expansion of 2.3 versus 0.8) and liver (fold change expansion of 5.8 versus 1.0) by day 4 of infection (Fig.	21841	22166
27630165	4A).	21339	21343
27630165	Moreover, CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell–derived memory cells rapidly upregulated IL-10–GFP expression in the spleen during challenge infection (Fig.	22172	22310
27630165	4B, 4C), leading to a significant increase in generation of new CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells in the spleen during secondary infection (Fig.	22311	22442
27630165	4D).	22443	22447
27630165	Although CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell–derived memory cells did not upregulate IL-10 expression within the liver during secondary infection (Fig.	22448	22583
27630165	4B, 4C), the large expansion of CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell–derived memory cells within the organ during challenge infection (Fig.	22584	22706
27630165	4A) led to a significant increase in the number of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells within the liver during secondary infection (Fig.	22707	22828
27630165	4D).	22443	22447
27630165	Consistent with the reporter data, splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells purified on day 60 postinfection (which were predominantly YFP+GFP−, as shown in Fig.	22834	22990
27630165	1C–F) rapidly produced IL-10 and IFN-γ protein following reactivation, producing significantly more of each cytokine than did CD4+ T cells purified from naive mice after 24 h anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation (Fig.	22991	23206
27630165	4E).	23207	23211
27630165	Moreover, the Ag-experienced memory CD4+ T cells continued to produce more IL-10 than did naive CD4+ T cells following 72 h restimulation, vastly upregulating production from that observed at 24 h (Fig.	23212	23414
27630165	4E).	23207	23211
27630165	In contrast, the memory Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells produced equivalent quantities of IFN-γ as did naive CD4+ T cells after 72 h restimulation (Fig.	23420	23568
27630165	4E).	23207	23211
27630165	Thus, reactivating malaria infection–induced Ag-experienced memory CD4+ T cells appear specifically programmed to rapidly become differentiated IL-10–producing cells following challenge infection.	23574	23770
27630165	Notably, splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells purified on day 60 postinfection also produced large amounts of IL-2 very rapidly upon PMA/ionomycin restimulation (4 h) (Fig.	23771	23942
27630165	4F), most likely facilitating their rapid expansion during the early phases of secondary infection, as shown specifically for the CD4+YFP+GFP− subset (Fig.	23943	24098
27630165	4A).	21339	21343
27630165	Collectively, these data indicate that CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell–derived memory cells are unlikely to play a major role in influencing the nature of amnestic immune responses during malaria infection.	24104	24298
27630165	Instead, CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell–derived memory cells, due to their rapid ability to produce IFN-γ, IL-2, and proliferate and their capacity to secrete large amounts of IL-10, may play an important role in coordinating inflammation and regulation during the early phases of secondary malaria infections.	24299	24598
27630165	Given the ability of memory Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells to produce IL-10 during challenge infection, we hypothesized that the dynamics of IL-10 production may be altered in secondary malaria infection compared with primary infection, providing a mechanism underlying infection-induced resistance to severe malarial disease.	24599	24922
27630165	In agreement with this, circulating plasma IL-10 levels trended higher on days 2 and 7 and were significantly increased on day 4 in secondary-infected dual IFN-γ and IL-10 reporter mice compared with primary-infected counterparts (Fig.	24923	25158
27630165	5A).	25159	25163
27630165	Importantly, peripheral parasitemia was comparable during secondary and primary infections during the early phase of infection (up to and including day 4), after which time secondary-infected mice rapidly cleared peripheral parasites (Fig.	25164	25403
27630165	5B).	25404	25408
27630165	Thus, enhanced expression of IL-10 occurs during the early stages of secondary infection and is not simply a consequence of altered parasite burdens.	25409	25558
27630165	Consistent with the plasma IL-10 data, significantly increased frequencies and numbers of total IL-10–GFP+ cells were observed in the spleen and liver during the period of patent parasitemia on day 2 and/or day 4 after secondary-infected mice compared with primary-infected mice (Fig.	25559	25843
27630165	5C, 5D).	25844	25852
27630165	Concordant with the upregulation of GFP by CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell–derived memory CD4+ T cells during challenge infection (Fig.	25853	25976
27630165	4B), CD4+ T cells were the predominant source of IL-10 in both the spleen and liver on days 2 and 4 of secondary infection (Fig.	25977	26105
27630165	5E).	26106	26110
27630165	All GFP-expressing CD4+ T cells in the spleen and liver during secondary infection coexpressed YFP, showing that IFN-γ+CD4+ T cells were also the dominant source of IL-10 during secondary infection (Supplemental Fig.	26111	26327
27630165	1).	708	711
27630165	Although CD4+YFP+ T cells were also the major source of IL-10 in the spleen during the early stages of primary infection, the numbers of splenic CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were significantly lower during primary infection than during secondary infection (Fig.	26332	26585
27630165	5F).	26586	26590
27630165	Notably, CD4+ T cells constituted a significantly higher fraction of the IL-10+ cells in the liver during the early stages of secondary compared with primary infection (Fig.	26591	26764
27630165	5E).	26106	26110
27630165	These data show that IL-10 production, principally from CD4+YFP+ T cells (most probably reactivated memory cells), is amplified during the early phases of secondary infection compared with primary malaria infection.	26770	26985
27630165	The altered dynamics of IL-10 production during secondary infection compared with primary malaria infection suggested that IL-10 may exert different quantitative and/or temporal roles during the early phases of primary and anamnestic immune responses to malaria.	26986	27248
27630165	To assess whether this hypothesis was correct, we administered anti–IL-10R Ab to mice prior to primary or secondary infection and examined the effect on parasite control and the innate and adaptive immune responses.	27249	27464
27630165	IL-10R blockade did not significantly modify peripheral parasitemia during the early phases of either primary or secondary infection, with an effect observed only during primary infection on day 8 postinfection (Fig.	27465	27681
27630165	6A).	27682	27686
27630165	This was consistent with the unaltered parasite burden observed in IL-10−/− mice compared with WT mice during the early phase of primary Plasmodium berghei NK65 infection (35).	27687	27863
27630165	Ablation of IL-10R signaling did, however, cause significantly increased levels of weight loss during both primary and secondary infection, which was particularly evident during secondary infection on day 6 postinfection (Fig.	27864	28090
27630165	6B).	28091	28095
27630165	The numbers of inflammatory monocytes (CD68+, CD11b+, Ly6Chigh), dendritic cells (which include monocyte-derived dendritic cells [CD11c+, CD11b+, F4-80−], classical dendritic cells [CD68−, CD11c+], and plasmacytoid dendritic cells [CD19+, CD11c+]), and neutrophils (Ly6G+, Ly6Clow, CD11b+, CD68−) were significantly increased in spleens of secondary-infected mice compared with primary-infected mice (Fig.	28096	28501
27630165	6C), indicating differences in the general nature of the innate immune response during primary and repeat malaria infections.	28502	28627
27630165	Whereas anti–IL-10R mAb treatment failed to significantly increase the numbers of any of the examined splenic innate populations during primary or secondary infection, including red pulp macrophages (the numbers of which were comparable in primary- and secondary-infected mice [Fig.	28628	28910
27630165	6C]), anti–IL-10R significantly elevated the expression of MHC II by inflammatory monocytes during both primary and secondary infections, and by red pulp macrophages and dendritic cells specifically during primary infection (Fig.	28911	29140
27630165	6D).	29141	29145
27630165	Consequently, irrespective of the higher production during secondary infection, IL-10 appears to play a broader and quantitatively stronger role in inhibiting MHC II expression and potentially suppressing the Ag-presenting function of APC populations during the early stages of primary infection compared with secondary malaria infections (Fig.	29146	29490
27630165	6E).	29491	29495
27630165	Despite the effects on the innate immune response during primary infection, anti–IL-10R administration caused a slight decrease (rather than the expected increase) in the numbers of Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells during the early phases of primary infection (Fig.	29496	29756
27630165	7A).	29757	29761
27630165	In contrast, anti–IL-10R administration led to a significant increase in Ag-experienced splenic CD4+ T cell numbers during secondary infection (Fig.	29762	29910
27630165	7A).	29757	29761
27630165	Consequently, the effect of anti–IL-10R administration on splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell numbers was quantitatively higher during secondary infection compared with primary infection (Fig.	29916	30107
27630165	7B).	30108	30112
27630165	Of note, the numbers of Ag-experienced splenic CD4+ T cell cells were significantly increased in secondary-infected mice compared with primary-infected mice, most probably reflecting reactivation of memory CD4+ T cells (Fig.	30113	30337
27630165	7A).	29757	29761
27630165	Anti–IL-10R administration did not, however, affect splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell activation (as determined by CD69 or ICOS expression) during the early phase of primary or secondary infections, and the activation of splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells was not significantly different during primary and secondary infections (results not shown).	30343	30693
27630165	Consistent with a specific effect of anti–IL-10R administration on the adaptive compartment during secondary infection, anti–IL-10R administration caused a quantitatively larger increase in plasma IFN-γ levels during secondary infection compared with primary infection (Fig.	30694	30968
27630165	7C, 7D).	30969	30977
27630165	Collectively, these data suggest that IL-10 may have diversified functions within the innate and adaptive immune compartments during primary and secondary malaria infections, respectively.	30978	31166
27630165	This indicates that different targeted regulatory immune responses may be necessary to modify innate immunity compared with reactivation of memory immune responses during primary and secondary malaria infections, respectively, to prevent formation of infection-induced immunopathology.	31167	31452
27630165	IL-10–producing Th1 cells play critical and nonredundant regulatory roles in limiting inflammation and controlling the outcome of many different infections (1, 2, 24, 25).	31453	31624
27630165	As a consequence, the molecular signals instructing their development have been extensively studied, demonstrating the involvement of myriad cytokines and suites of transcription factors working in coordinated or context-specific pathways (1, 24, 25).	31625	31876
27630165	However, the stability and memory potential of IL-10–producing Th1 cells after primary infection, as well as their relative influence on the course of secondary infections, have, until now, been significantly understudied.	31877	32099
27630165	In this study, we have shown that CD4+IFN-γ–YFP+IL-10–GFP+ T cells have limited capacity to become long-lived memory cells following the resolution of primary malaria infection.	32100	32277
27630165	Endogenous CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were disproportionately lost from the memory-fated and maintained Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell population postinfection, as compared with CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells.	32278	32467
27630165	Moreover, significantly fewer infection-induced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell–derived cells were obtained following adoptive transfer into malaria-infected and drug-cured recipient mice in comparison with total Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells or CD4+YFP+GFP− counterpart cells.	32468	32731
27630165	Consistently, the total Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell population maintained the capacity to produce IFN-γ but rapidly stopped producing IL-10 postinfection.	32732	32885
27630165	To our knowledge, we have provided the first evidence that the ephemeral nature of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells may be intrinsically dictated by their skewed effector differentiation state, as well as by their apparent cellular exhaustion.	32886	33117
27630165	The short-lived effector phenotype of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells, in comparison with CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells, is consistent with the idea that IL-10 is expressed only by mature effector T cells following strong TCR activation (24, 25), and that strong T cell activation restricts memory potential (26, 27).	33118	33415
27630165	Additionally, high expression of markers of exhaustion, including LAG-3, PD-1, and TIGIT, by CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells potentially restricted their capacity to receive and/or respond to homeostatic signals such as IL-7 during the memory maintenance phase postinfection (36).	33416	33685
27630165	Of relevance, however, IL-10–producing CD4+ T cells have also been shown to express high levels of BLIMP-1 and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, both of which instruct IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells via direct binding within the gene locus (37, 38).	33686	33934
27630165	BLIMP-1 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression have been shown to antagonize CD4+ T cell memory potential in nonmalarial models (39, 40).	33935	34074
27630165	Thus, the molecular network operational in IL-10–producing CD4+ T cells, coupled with their differentiation as short-lived effector cells and the coordinated expression of multiple inhibitory cell surface receptors, may directly restrict their memory potential postinfection.	34075	34350
27630165	Consequently, it is probable that IL-10–producing CD4+ T cells may only be effectively maintained in the presence of malaria Ag in context of TCR engagement.	34351	34508
27630165	This is consistent with recent data obtained in the field showing that the maintenance of IL-10–producing CD4+ T cells is inversely correlated with the duration from previous P. falciparum infection (14, 23).	34509	34717
27630165	Whether IL-10–producing CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells play an important role in shaping the nature of the memory compartment postinfection, such as has been proposed for Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (13, 41), will require further investigation.	34718	34948
27630165	Although the restricted life span of YFP+GFP+ T cells appeared to be a dominant factor driving their loss from the Ag-experienced memory CD4+ T cell pool, it was also clear that a high proportion of primary infection–induced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells downregulated IL-10–GFP expression following drug-induced resolution of infection.	34949	35277
27630165	Consequently, a logical conclusion from our results is that IL-10 production by CD4+YFP+ T cells is inherently unstable during/after malaria infection and that most CD4+YFP+ T cells do not necessarily become programmed for extended production.	35278	35521
27630165	Indeed, it would be unexpected for Ag-experienced, including parasite-specific, memory CD4+ T cells to continue to produce IL-10, or any nonhomeostatic cytokine, in the absence of inflammation and TCR signals after infection (26, 27, 42).	35522	35760
27630165	Nevertheless, as the Vert-X mice are transcriptional reporters, our data importantly show that CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells do not uniformly maintain a poised signature postinfection, where the IL-10 gene is continually transcribed but not actively translated.	35761	36013
27630165	In agreement with this, it has been suggested that the IL-10 gene does not undergo extensive epigenetic remodeling in memory IFN-γ+CD4+ T cells (43) but depends upon constant stimulation to maintain IL-10 transcription (44).	36014	36238
27630165	This is opposed to the archetypal CD4+ T cell lineage–defining cytokines IFN-γ or IL-4, which display permissive hypermethylation (H3K4me3) marks in memory cells with Th1 and Th2 ontogenies, respectively (45).	36239	36448
27630165	Consequently, following transcription in T cells and NK cells, epigenetic remodeling of the IFN-γ gene leads to maintained gene transcription, even though translation may be prevented by destabilizing elements within the mRNA untranslated regions (46).	36449	36701
27630165	This is consistent with our observation that memory Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells from infected/drug-cured mice (most of which are YFP+GFP−) have the maintained capacity to produce IFN-γ protein immediately ex vivo following mitogenic restimulation.	36702	36949
27630165	Of note, we have previously shown that cell-sorted IFN-γ–YFP+ and IL-10–GFP+ T cells actively translate the respective cytokines on day 7 of infection (33).	36950	37106
27630165	This demonstrates, in agreement with previous studies, that functionally defined mature Th1 cells can be maintained long-term after malaria infection (21).	37107	37262
27630165	Despite the limited maintenance of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell after malaria infection, we found that the IL-10 response was amplified during secondary malaria infection compared with primary infection.	37263	37457
27630165	Notably, CD4+YFP+ T cells were the major source of IL-10 during secondary infection in all examined organs, implying that memory CD4+ T cells rapidly expanded and expressed IL-10 during secondary infection.	37458	37664
27630165	In agreement with this, we found that CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell–derived memory cells reactivated quickly during secondary infection, proliferating and upregulating IL-10 GFP expression.	37665	37844
27630165	Of note, the small frequency of GFP+ cells within the CD4+YFP+GFP− T cell–derived memory cell population on day 60 postinfection likely reflects induction of IL-10 in the transferred population prior to drug treatment of the recipient mice (Fig.	37845	38090
27630165	4B, 4C).	38091	38099
27630165	In contrast, consistent with their exhausted phenotype, the small numbers of residual primary infection–derived CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were relatively unresponsive during secondary infection.	38100	38289
27630165	These results suggest that infection-induced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells may not play a major role in modulating the course of anamnestic responses during subsequent temporally separated malaria infections.	38290	38489
27630165	Importantly, we observed that purified memory Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells (most of which were YFP+GFP−) produced significant quantities of IL-10 protein in vitro following 24 and 72 h restimulation in vitro.	38490	38697
27630165	This indicates that memory Ag-experienced CD4+YFP+GFP− T cells are predisposed and programmed toward rapid induction of IL-10 following reactivation during secondary infection.	38698	38874
27630165	Thus, the enhanced IL-10 response during secondary infection is unlikely to be dominantly or solely controlled by the specific environment the CD4+ T cells are exposed to during rechallenge.	38875	39065
27630165	Also importantly, the accelerated and amplified IL-10 production during rechallenge did not cause generalized immune inhibition during infection, as innate and adaptive responses were increased during the early phases of secondary infection compared with primary infection.	39066	39339
27630165	These data are, therefore, inconsistent with a model where generalized suppression of inflammation contributes toward infection-induced resistance to symptomatic malaria.	39340	39510
27630165	Rather, our data suggest that during secondary malaria infections strong antiparasitic immune responses are allowed to develop to facilitate rapid control and elimination of the parasite, but counterbalancing regulatory responses, of which IL-10 plays a pivotal role, are instructed to ensure that inflammation is restricted below tissue-damaging levels.	39511	39865
27630165	Such a model is in agreement with recent results showing that upon re-exposure to P. falciparum, children develop co-ordinately enhanced antiparasitic and immunoregulatory responses that facilitate parasite control while limiting pathogenic inflammation (23).	39866	40125
27630165	Of relevance, high ratios of plasma proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, are a common feature of severe malaria disease, emphasizing the importance of infection-instructed immune balance in enabling optimal control of malaria infection (9).	40126	40394
27630165	Interestingly, our results also highlight distinct activities for IL-10 during primary and subsequent malaria infections.	40395	40516
27630165	The main function of IL-10 during primary infection appears to be inhibition of MHC II expression by APCs and innate cells, whereas during secondary infection its primarily role appears to be controlling T cell responses and, putatively, the early reactivation of memory CD4+ T cells.	40517	40801
27630165	IL-10 has been previously shown to target and regulate different immune cell populations, depending on the nature of inflammation (47–49), Thus, the varied activity of IL-10 during primary and secondary infections is likely determined by the different immune environments and contrasting responsiveness of immune cells within primary- and secondary-infected hosts.	40802	41166
27630165	Although the differential sensitivity of recently primed effector T cells and memory CD4+ T cells to IL-10 regulation has yet to be examined in detail in any model, IL-10 has been shown to suppress IFN-γ production by TCR-activated memory CD4+ T cells (50).	41167	41424
27630165	In summary, in this study we have directly shown that malaria infection–induced IL-10–expressing CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells have limited memory cell potential and do not respond strongly during pathogen re-exposure.	41425	41632
27630165	These results substantially increase our understanding of the fate of IL-10–expressing CD4+ T cells after malaria, and infection in general.	41633	41773
27630165	In contrast, memory CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells rapidly expand and produce IL-10 during secondary malaria infection, leading to augmented IL-10 production and coordinated strong antiparasitic and regulatory immune responses.	41774	41989
27630165	These data provide new insights into the importance and role of IL-10 during primary and repeat malaria infections and reveal the memory CD4+ T cell subset that dominantly produces IL-10 to influence the nature of anamnestic immune responses during secondary malaria infection.	41990	42267
28846666	Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common endocrine and metabolic disease with different degrees of glucose and lipid metabolic disorders during pregnancy, causing danger to the mothers and the perinatal infants, and can even be life-threatening.	0	252
28846666	However, the pathogenesis of GDM is still unclear, and might be related to hormone level changes, insulin resistance (IR), obesity, a chronic inflammatory reaction, oxidative stress, genetics, insulin-secretion deficiency, immunity and so on.	253	495
28846666	Recently attention has focused on the relationship between inflammatory reaction and IR, indicating that inflammation is a critical factor in promoting IR.	496	651
28846666	During pregnancy, the maternal tissues become insensitive to insulin resulting from changes due to placental lactogen and other hormones.	652	789
28846666	For women with GDM, IR results in maternal hyperglycemia and stimulates fetal hyperinsulinemia.	790	885
28846666	IR and reduced secretory function of β cell are important pathological features of GDM.	886	973
28846666	After giving birth, GDM in women disappears immediately.	974	1030
28846666	Risk factors, such as increased maternal age, previous occurrence of GDM, and family history of diabetes, are helpful for diagnosis of GDM.	1031	1170
28846666	In China, a universal screening program for GDM in women living in the six urban districts of Tianjin was carried out, with the results showing that the GDM prevalence was as low as 2.3% in 1998.	1171	1366
28846666	However, there is scant research on the prevalence of GDM in the Chinese population, and in particular Inner Mongolia.	1367	1485
28846666	In our study, we analyzed the expressions of IL-65–72C/G and TNF-α-857C/T SNPs in GDM patients from Inner Mongolia, as well as their relationship with glucose and lipid metabolism, in order to inform clinical diagnosis and prevention of GDM with information on related molecular mechanisms.	1486	1776

28846666	When the fasting glucose was higher than 92 mg/d/L but lower than 126 mg/d/L, GDM was diagnosed at any gestational age.	2557	2676
28846666	Those pregnant women in early pregnancy, not meeting the diagnostic criteria for GDM, were asked to have oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) from the 24th and 28th gestational weeks.	2677	2858
28846666	We collected 10 mL peripheral blood at 9: 00 in the morning, which was then store at −28°C for subsequent experiments.	2859	2977

28846666	The distribution frequency of CT in GDM pregnancies was significantly higher than in healthy pregnancies (OR=3.316, 95% CI=1.092–8.304, p=0.025), which showed that the risk of developing GDM for patients carrying CT genotype.	7399	7624
28846666	Table 5 and Figure 2A show the results of the comparisons of clinical characteristics, serum metabolic biomarkers, and inflammatory biomarkers of the pregnancies with or without GDM.	7625	7807
28846666	There were significant differences (p<0.05) between the GDM pregnancies and the healthy pregnancies in clinical characteristics, including maternal age (29.13±3.65 versus 25.06±5.94 years), pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (38.68±9.50 versus 28.74±7.26), nulliparous women (10 women versus 28 women), family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (34 women versus 13 women), and history of GDM (8 women versus 1 woman), but not for gestational age.	7808	8263
28846666	Additionally, serum inflammatory biomarkers were also significant different (p<0.05) between GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies, including hs-CRP (8.38±1.67 versus 4.60±1.04 mg/L), IL-6 (5.85±1.41 versus 3.91±1.66 ng/L), IL-8 (2.17±0.45 versus 0.74±0.12 ng/L), and IL-6/IL-10 ratio (3.15±0.73 versus 1.93±0.46), while excluding IL-10, IL-1β, and TNF-α.	8264	8621

28846666	In Figure 2B, except for IL-10, all the inflammatory biomarkers in placentas had significant differences (p<0.05) between GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies, including NF-κB (283.56±31.32 versus 125.69±17.38 μg/L), IL-6 (177.09±22.68 versus 103.85±15.6 μg/L), IL-8 (126.43±16.02 versus 45.70±4.95 μg/L), IL-6/IL-10 ratio (3.09±1.40 versus 1.51±1.06), IL-1β (36.42±5.10 versus 13.48±2.06 mg/L) and TNF-α (21.61±3.21 versus 13.82±2.02 mg/L).	9379	9823
28846666	IRS-1 (83.94±13.22 versus 106.01±14.30 μg/L) and IRS-2 (104.28±10.95 versus 190.11±20.58 μg/L) in placentas were significantly different (p<0.05) between GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies.	9824	10018
28846666	Lipid metabolic indexes all had significant differences (p<0.05) between GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies as follows: leptin (16.36±2.03 versus 9.17±1.88 mg/L), adiponectin (92.58±13.20 versus 150.14±17.21 μg/L), visfatin (127.39±18.68 versus 52.28±9.05 μg/L), RBP-4 (22.46±3.01 versus 10.72±2.05 mg/L), chemerin (11.20±1.17 versus 5.76±0.03 mg/L), nesfatin-1 (178.32±20.77 versus 93.59±11.64 μg/L), FATP-4 (13.06±2.90 versus 6.50±0.75 mg/L), EL (154.91±20.16 versus 89.04±10.37 μg/L), LPL (17.14±3.68 versus 10.32±1.07 mg/L), FABP-1 (115.60±12.44 versus 63.38±9.83 μg/L), FABP-3 (235.17±20.84 versus 105.26±13.02 μg/L), FABP-4 (178.37±20.98 versus 112.64±14.02 μg/L) and FABP-5 (99.40±11.37 versus 42.31±8.29 μg/L).	10019	10742
28846666	In our study, we firstly detected the SNPs of IL-65–72C/G and TNF-α-857C/T in GDM and healthy pregnancies.	10743	10849
28846666	The results showed that the differences in the CC and CT genotypes of TNF-α-857C/T were statistically significant between GDM and healthy pregnancies, while IL-65–72C/G was without significance.	10850	11044
28846666	The distribution frequency of TNF-α-857CT in GDM pregnancies was higher than that in healthy pregnancies, which indicated a risk of developing GDM for patients carrying TNF-α-857CT, and T allele was the risk factor.	11045	11260
28846666	According to previous studies, IL-65–72C/G is associated to obesity, colon cancer, and T2DM; as is TNF-α-857C/T, but no research has focused on their relationship with GDM.	11261	11433
28846666	In our study, we did not find an association of IL-65–72C/G with GDM pregnancies.	11434	11515
28846666	Therefore, we presumed that women carrying TNF-α-857CT in Inner Mongolia were at higher risk for GDM than those without.	11516	11636
28846666	In addition, by detecting serum factors we found that hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-6/IL-10 were significantly associated with GDM.	11637	11765
28846666	The inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, hs-CRP, IL-1 β, and IL-8 have mostly been found to be increased in GDM pregnancies compared to healthy pregnancies.	11766	11921
28846666	However, in our study, TNF-α and IL-1β was found to be abnormal in GDM pregnancies, but not significantly.	11922	12028
28846666	This difference might be due to differences in pregnancies within different population, indicating that for GDM women in Inner Mongolia, abnormal levels of hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-6/IL-10 ratio may be diagnostic biomarkers.	12029	12255
28846666	In women with GDM, the placenta may adapt to the inflammatory environment and exhibit morphological changes [19–21].	12256	12372
28846666	In our study, we collected the placentas from GDM and healthy pregnancies.	12373	12447
28846666	By detecting the metabolic indexes, we found that the inflammatory biomarkers, including NF-κB, IL-6, IL-8, IL6/IL-10 ratio, IL-1β, and TNF-α, had significant differences between GDM and healthy pregnancies, as well as the adipokines, including leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, RBP-4, chemerin and nesfatin-1, IRS-1, IRS-2, FATP-4, EL, LPL, FABP-1, FABP-3, FABP-4, and FABP-5.	12448	12822
28846666	This phenomenon showed that the placentas of GDM women were in an inflammatory environment, and that the increased inflammatory mediators might promote intraplacental inflammatory cascades by specific gene transcription or translation.	12823	13058
28846666	Additionally, the adipose tissue also generated numbers of adipokines to promote the production of inflammatory cytokines, which aggravated the GDM status.	13059	13214
28846666	Otherwise, we found that both FBG and FINS in serum obviously increased, and the HOMA-IR and HOMA-β were significantly different between GDM and healthy pregnancies.	13215	13380
28846666	Considering the decreased IRS-1 and IRS-2 in placentas of GDM, we confirmed that glucose metabolism was disordered in the whole body, a finding which was in accorded with previous studies, as was lipid metabolism.	13381	13594
28846666	However, which cytokines were regulated and how deregulation led to the GDM progression, is still unclear.	13595	13701
28846666	In the future, there should be further investigations using larger sample sizes and collecting data from pregnant women in different regions.	13702	13843
28846666	Our study confirmed that TNF-α-857C/T SNPs and inflammation were associated with GDM, and glucose and lipid metabolisms were disordered in GDM.	13844	13987
28393239	Psoriasin, also known as S100A7, is a member of the S100 protein family of calcium binding proteins and was first identified as being overexpressed in psoriatic skin lesions (1).	0	178
28393239	It is a 11.4-kDa secretory protein encoded on chromosome 1q21, clustered alongside 16 other members of the S100 family within a region known as the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) (2,3).	179	373
28393239	The S100 family encodes both cytoplasmic and secreted proteins that share EF-hand helix-loop-helix domains, important for their role as calcium binding proteins (4).	374	539
28393239	Psoriasin S100 proteins are widely expressed in numerous cell types localised to the cytoplasm and/or nucleus, or in some cases are secreted.	540	681
28393239	Due to their role in calcium binding and signalling, they are involved in numerous cell functions including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.	682	846
28393239	In addition to its overexpression in psoriatic skin lesions, aberrant Psoriasin expression has been implicated in a range of human diseases including cancer.	847	1004
28393239	Interestingly, Psoriasin is a chemotactic factor for keratinocytes and leukocytes (5–7), and is also upregulated and excreted from cells of the epidermis during inflammation.	1005	1179
28393239	Additionally, Psoriasin has been implicated as an antimicrobial peptide, selectively killing E. coli on the surface of the skin (8).	1180	1312
28393239	Therefore, Psoriasin may be utilised, via the host immune response, as a selective chemotactic factor both in psoriasis and cancer (9).	1313	1448
28393239	The expression of Psoriasin during carcinogenesis has been studied in detail, and its overexpression has been linked to a number of cancers including breast (10), prostate (11), skin (12), head and neck (13), bladder (14) and lung cancer (15).	1449	1692
28393239	It is also often associated with poor prognosis.	1693	1741
28393239	For example in breast cancer, Psoriasin expression correlates with features of poor prognosis, including oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negativity, HER2 positivity, and the presence of lymphocytic infiltration (16–18).	1742	1984
28393239	The precise role of Psoriasin in cancer remains unclear.	1985	2041
28393239	One hypothesis links Psoriasin expression with stimulation of angiogenesis regulated by VEGF (19).	2042	2140
28393239	In the development of breast cancer, Psoriasin regulates epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR), actin remodelling and NF-κβ mediated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) secretion, promoting tumour development and metastasis (20).	2141	2412
28393239	These results suggest Psoriasin plays an important role in carcinoma development.	2413	2494
28393239	Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in Western countries and carries a very poor prognosis due to delayed diagnosis and lack of effective treatments.	2495	2671
28393239	The majority of patients present with metastasis at diagnosis; 25% with local metastasis and 55% with regional metastasis (21).	2672	2799
28393239	The most common sites of metastasis are the liver, followed by the peritoneum, lung and pleura, bones and adrenal glands.	2800	2921
28393239	Outcome for patients is poor with a 5-year survival rate of <5% (22).	2922	2991
28393239	In comparison to the studies of other malignancies, pancreatic cancer requires more intensive study for understanding genetic and molecular machinery which is utilised by cancerous cells during disease progression and metastasis.	2992	3221
28393239	This study aimed to examine the role of Psoriasin in pancreatic cancer with a focus for its involvement in local invasion and distant metastasis.	3222	3367
28393239	Pancreatic cell lines (MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).	3368	3498
28393239	Both cell lines are derived from primary tumours of pancreatic cancer.	3499	3569
28393239	MIA-PaCa-2 was isolated from a pancreatic carcinoma while PANC-1 was derived from an epithelioid carcinoma of pancreas.	3570	3689
28393239	The pancreatic cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-F12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics.	3690	3852
28393239	LP-9 mesothelial cells were purchased from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ, USA) and maintained in M199 medium supplemented with 15% FCS and antibiotics.	3853	4029
28393239	Matrigel (BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix) was obtained from BD Biosciences (Oxford, UK).	4030	4124
28393239	Anti-human Psoriasin hammerhead ribozymes were designed based on the secondary structure of the mRNA generated using Zuker's RNA Mfold program (23).	4125	4273
28393239	The ribozymes were synthesized and cloned into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).	4274	4379
28393239	The primers used for ribozyme synthesis are shown in Table I.	4380	4441
28393239	Similarly, full-length human Psoriasin coding sequence amplified from normal human prostate tissues was cloned into the same vector.	4442	4574
28393239	Constructed plasmids were extracted using the Genelute Plasmid Mini-Prep kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK).	4575	4679
28393239	Ribozyme transgenes, overexpression constructs, and control plasmids were transfected into MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells by electroporation (Gene Pulser Xcell; Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK).	4680	4866
28393239	Stable transfectants were obtained and verified following two weeks selection using blasticidin (5 μg/ml, Melford Laboratories Ltd., Suffolk, UK).	4867	5013
28393239	The cells were then cultured in DMEM with blasticidin at a lower concentration (0.5 μg/ml) to maintain plasmid expression.	5014	5136
28393239	Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich).	5137	5194
28393239	First strand cDNA synthesis was undertaken using the Precision nanoScript Reverse Transcription kit (Primer Design, Southampton, UK).	5195	5328
28393239	PCR was performed using GoTaq Green MasterMix (Promega, Dorset, UK).	5329	5397
28393239	Cycling conditions were as follows: 94°C for 5 min followed by 36 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 40 sec.	5398	5528
28393239	This was followed by a final extension of 72°C for 10 min.	5529	5587
28393239	Products were visualised using 2% agarose gels stained with SYBR Safe (Invitrogen).	5588	5671
28393239	QPCR was performed using the Icycler IQ5 system (Bio-Rad, Hammel Hempsted, UK).	5672	5751
28393239	Pancreatic cancer cell cDNA samples were examined for Psoriasin transcript expression, alongside a set of standards and negative controls.	5752	5890
28393239	The Amplifluor system (Intergen Inc., Oxford, UK) and qPCR mastermix (Bio-Rad) were used.	5891	5980
28393239	Psoriasin primer pairs were designed using Beacon design software (Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA), whereby the reverse primer contained an additional Z sequence (5′-ACTGAACCTGACCGTACA) complementary to the universal Z probe (Intergen Inc.).	5981	6227
28393239	Reaction conditions were as follows: 94°C for 12 min, followed by 90 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 40 sec and 72°C for 20 sec.	6228	6360
28393239	Human pancreatic tissue was collected from patients undergoing surgical resection of pancreatic tumours at the Beijing Cancer Hospital.	6361	6496
28393239	The specimens retrieved comprised 126 pancreatic tumours and 114 along with matched adjacent normal pancreatic tissues over a period from 2002 to 2011 with follow-up information up to 2013 (median, 12 months, IQR, 6–20.5 months).	6497	6726
28393239	The tissues were stored immediately after surgery at −80°C until use.	6727	6796
28393239	Clinicopathological factors, including age, sex, histological type, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastases and embolism, were recorded and stored in the patient database.	6797	6981
28393239	The protocol and procedure were reviewed and approved by the Beijing Cancer Hospital Research Ethics Committee and written consent was obtained from all patients involved.	6982	7153
28393239	Total RNA extraction was then performed using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich).	7154	7228
28393239	Psoriasin transcripts were determined using QPCR together with an internal control keratin 19 (CK19).	7229	7330
28393239	Normalised Psoriasin transcript levels are shown in Table II.	7331	7392
28393239	Primer sequences are provided in Table I.	7393	7434
28393239	A standard growth assay was undertaken as previously described (15,24).	7435	7506
28393239	Cells were plated into a 96-well plate (3,000 cells/well) and growth was assessed after 1, 3 and 5 days.	7507	7611
28393239	Crystal violet was used to stain the cells, and absorbance was determined at a wavelength of 540 nm using a spectrophotometer (Elx800; Bio-Tek, Bedfordshire, UK).	7612	7774
28393239	An ECIS-Ztheta instrument (Applied Biophysics Ltd.; Troy, NJ, USA) was used with a 96-well 96W1E microarrays and wounding module.	7775	7904
28393239	Pancreatic cancer cells were seeded at 40,000 cells per well and cell adhesion was tracked immediately over a range of frequencies from 1,000 to 64,000 Hz.	7905	8060
28393239	Once the cells reached confluence, a current of 2,600 μA was passed across each well for 20 sec to produce a reproducible wound, after which cell migration was automatically tracked.	8061	8243
28393239	A total of 20,000 cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate previously prepared by coating with Matrigel (5 μg/well).	8244	8368
28393239	The cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 45 min and the medium was then discarded.	8369	8457
28393239	Non-adherent cells were washed off using balanced salt solution (BSS) buffer.	8458	8535
28393239	Adherent cells were then fixed in 4% formalin, stained with crystal violet and absorbance determined at 540 nm.	8536	8647
28393239	LP-9 mesothelial cells were trypsinised and transferred to a 96-well plate at 30,000 cells per well and grown to confluence over a 24-h period.	8648	8791
28393239	Pancreatic cancer cells were stained with 10 μg/ml DiI membrane stain (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindo-carbocyanine perchlorate, Life Technologies) before being added at 20,000 cells per well to the mesothelial cell mono-layer.	8792	9030
28393239	Pancreatic cancer cells were left to adhere for 40 min before non-adherent cells were washed off using BSS buffer.	9031	9145
28393239	Adherent cells were then fixed (4% formalin) and images were taken at 549 excitation/565 emission and phase contrast using an EVOS FL auto (Life Technologies), before the total number of adherent pancreatic cancer cells was counted.	9146	9378
28393239	Transwell inserts with 8 μm pore size (Greiner Bio-One, Gloucester, UK) were coated with 50 μg Matrigel and air-dried before being rehydrated.	9379	9521
28393239	A total of 20,000 cells were added to each insert.	9522	9572
28393239	Following 72-h incubation, cells that had migrated through the matrix and pores were fixed (4% formalin), stained in crystal violet and absorbance determined at 540 nm.	9573	9741
28393239	Pancreatic cancer cells (3×106) were seeded into a 75-cm2 flask.	9742	9806
28393239	Following overnight culture, cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and cultured in serum-free DMEM for 6 h. The conditioned medium was then collected by centrifugation to remove any cells.	9807	10002
28393239	Samples were prepared in non-reducing sample buffer (containing 0.625 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 2% bromophenol blue).	10003	10133
28393239	Each sample (30 μl) was loaded into each lane and separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatine (Sigma-Aldrich).	10134	10322
28393239	The gel was then renatured at room temperature in washing buffer (containing 2.5% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3), before being incubated in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mM CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3 for 72 h before staining with Coomassie blue.	10323	10578
28393239	The clear bands of gelatin digested by MMPs was documented and analysed using densitometry.	10579	10670
28393239	Cell aggregation was measured over a time course of 3 h, at 1 h intervals.	10671	10745
28393239	MiaPa-Ca-1 cells with varying Psoriasin expression were harvested using trypsin.	10746	10826
28393239	A small amount was aliquoted for initial measurements.	10827	10881
28393239	The remaining solution was left at 37°C, on a tilt table, to prevent adherence.	10882	10961
28393239	The collected samples were kept on ice to prevent additional aggregation.	10962	11035
28393239	Cells were aliquoted out at 1, 2 and 3 h. Cell aggregation was measured using a Neubauer haemocytometer (Celeromics, Cambridge, UK) under a light microscope, with total individual cells counted followed by the number of cell groups.	11036	11268
28393239	Cells (250,000–500,000) per experiment were transferred to a fresh UC and spun down in a centrifuge at 1700 rpm for 5 min and washed with ice-cold PBS and re-centrifuged.	11269	11439
28393239	The cells were suspended in 250 μl of Annexin V binding (Invitrogen) buffer per 250,000 cells.	11440	11534
28393239	This solution (100 μl) was mixed with 5 μl of pre-mixed staining solution (0.2 μl propidium iodide, 0.8 μl Annexin V-FITC, 4 μl Annexin V binding buffer) (Invitrogen) and left in the dark, at room temperature, for 30 min.	11535	11756
28393239	It was then diluted with 400 μl of filtered PBS and kept on ice.	11757	11821
28393239	The remaining cell solution was incubated at 37°C at 5% CO2 and the process repeated at 1 and 2 h. The samples were then run through a flow cytometer (Cyflow, Sysmex UK Ltd.).	11822	11997
28393239	Equal amount of total proteins of each cell line was separated on an SDS-PAGE gel.	11998	12080
28393239	The proteins were then electrically transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-caspase 3 and GAPDH antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), respectively, and also corresponding peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich).	12081	12346
28393239	Images of the protein bands were developed using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Luminata, Millipore) and a UVITech imager (UVITech, Inc.).	12347	12489
28393239	Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).	12490	12568
28393239	The t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for normally distributed and non-normally distributed data respectively.	12569	12686
28393239	Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyse the correlation with patient survival.	12687	12767
28393239	Differences were considered statistically significant at p<0.05.	12768	12832
28393239	In the search of gene expression array data base at PubMed, a reduction was seen in the expression of Psoriasin in pancreatic cancers in comparison with the paired adjacent normal pancreatic tissues (GDS4336) (Fig.	12833	13047
28393239	1A).	13048	13052
28393239	We further determined the transcript levels of Psoriasin in a cohort of 126 pancreatic tumours and 114 adjacent normal pancreatic tissues.	13053	13191
28393239	Psoriasin expression appeared to be reduced in the tumours but did not reach a significant level in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues (Table II).	13192	13347
28393239	An even lower expression of Psoriasin was seen in tumours with distant metastases.	13348	13430
28393239	Interestingly, higher Psoriasin transcript levels were seen in locally invasive tumours which extended beyond the pancreas (T3 and T4) in comparison with tumours confined to the pancreas (T1 and T2) (Table II).	13431	13641
28393239	It suggests that Psoriasin plays a significant role in regulation of invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.	13642	13747
28393239	To clarify the involvement of Psoriasin in metastasis, we analysed the expression of Psoriasin in another gene expression array of pancreatic tumours which includes 145 primary tumours and 61 metastatic tumours (GSE71729) (25).	13748	13975
28393239	An increased expression of Psoriasin was seen in the secondary tumours in comparison with its expression in primary tumours (Fig.	13976	14105
28393239	1B).	14106	14110
28393239	The mRNA expression of Psoriasin in three different pancreatic cancer cell lines was evaluated using RT-PCR (Fig.	14111	14224
28393239	1C).	14225	14229
28393239	RAGE, the receptor of Psoriasin was detected in the three pancreatic cancer cell lines.	14230	14317
28393239	PCR products of 528 bp were amplicons of both variant 2 and 4, while 480-bp products represented amplicons from variant 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.	14318	14461
28393239	However, exact variants expressed in these cell lines are yet to be further determined (Fig.	14462	14554
28393239	1C).	14225	14229
28393239	The expression of Psoriasin in MIA-PaCa-2 is higher than that for PANC-1, and lowest in AsPc-1.	14560	14655
28393239	Psoriasin knockdown and overexpression was verified in the MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines transfected with ribozyme transgenes using RT-PCR (Fig.	14656	14803
28393239	1D) and qPCR (Fig.	14804	14822
28393239	1E).	14823	14827
28393239	The Psoriasin-modified MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines were used for subsequent experiments.	14828	14921
28393239	A significant decrease in cellular growth was observed in Psoriasin knockdown MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig.	14922	15016
28393239	2A, p<0.001) and PANC-1 (Fig.	15017	15046
28393239	2B, p<0.05) cell lines in comparison with controls.	15047	15098
28393239	Conversely, overexpression of Psoriasin resulted in increased growth of MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines (p<0.05).	15099	15213
28393239	Psoriasin knockdown resulted in decreased migration of MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig.	15214	15285
28393239	2C, p<0.001) and PANC-1 (Fig.	15286	15315
28393239	2D, p<0.05) cell lines compared to controls.	15316	15360
28393239	Conversely, Psoriasin overexpression resulted in increased migration of MIA-PaCa-2 (p<0.001) and PANC-1 (p<0.05) cell lines.	15361	15485
28393239	An in vitro cell-matrix adhesion assay was adopted to investigate the effect of Psoriasin knockdown and overexpression on the adhesive ability of pancreatic cancer cells to extracellular matrix.	15486	15680
28393239	MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig.	15000	15016
28393239	3A, p<0.05) and PANC-1 (Fig.	15698	15726
28393239	3B, p<0.05) Psoriasin overexpressing cells exhibited decreased cell-matrix adhesion whilst Psoriasin knockdown resulted in increased adhesion to matrix (p<0.05).	15727	15888
28393239	According to the involvement in adhesion of pancreatic cancer cells, we were curious about a possible implication in dissemination through peritoneal cavity.	15889	16046
28393239	Therefore, we determined the effect of Psoriasin expression on pancreatic cancer cell adhesion to mesothelial which constitute peritoneum.	16047	16185
28393239	Neither Psoriasin overexpression nor knockdown had any significant effect on the adhesion of PANC-1 cells to peritoneal mesothelia compared to control (Fig.	16186	16342
28393239	3C).	16343	16347
28393239	The influence of Psoriasin expression on MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell invasion was examined.	16348	16438
28393239	Interestingly, Psoriasin overexpression resulted in increased invasion of MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig.	16439	16529
28393239	4A, p<0.001) and PANC-1 (Fig.	16530	16559
28393239	4B, p<0.05) cell lines whilst Psoriasin knockdown resulted in decreased invasion of MIA-PaCa-2 (p<0.001) and PANC-1 (p<0.05) cells.	16560	16691
28393239	At the mRNA level, MMP-9 expression was significantly increased in Psoriasin overexpression MIA-PaCa-2 cells compared to controls (Fig.	16692	16827
28393239	4C).	16828	16832
28393239	Conversely, MMP-9 expression was decreased in Psoriasin knockdown MIA-PaCa-2 cells.	16833	16916
28393239	As the results from zymography show, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity is increased in Psoriasin overexpression MIA-PaCa-2 cells compared to control (Fig.	16917	17062
28393239	4D), whilst MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity is decreased in Psoriasin knockdown MIA-PaCa-2 cells.	17063	17153
28393239	As shown in Fig.	17154	17170
28393239	4C, decreased Psoriasin expression resulted in the decreased expression of cyclin D2 at the mRNA level in MIA-PaCa-2 cells in which an increased level of p27Kip1 was also noted.	17171	17348
28393239	Moreover, overexpression of Psoriasin resulted in increased cyclin D2 expression.	17349	17430
28393239	In order to evaluate how MIA-PaCa-2 cells interact with one another in suspension, a cell aggregation assay was performed.	17431	17553
28393239	Cells with increased Psoriasin expression demonstrated an increased propensity to form cell-cell contacts whilst in suspension, reaching significance at 3 h (Fig.	17554	17716
28393239	5, p<0.05).	17717	17728
28393239	To determine whether this observation had an impact on the anoikis resistance in this cell line, an apoptosis assay was performed.	17729	17859
28393239	We observed cell survival after suspension was increased in Psoriasin overexpressing cell lines (Fig.	17860	17961
28393239	6).	17962	17965
28393239	Western blot analyses of adherent cells showed an enhanced activation of caspase-3 in MIA-PaCa-2 cells as cleaved proteins in comparison with the control (Fig.	17966	18125
28393239	7).	18126	18129
28393239	A reduction in the cleavage of caspase-3 was not observed in the Psoriasin overexpression cells compared with the control which also exhibited a lower level of the activation.	18130	18305
28393239	Psoriasin was first identified as being overexpressed in the hyperproliferative skin disease psoriasis.	18306	18409
28393239	Numerous studies have since demonstrated Psoriasin overexpression to be associated with tumour progression.	18410	18517
28393239	Upregulation of Psoriasin in cancer was initially identified in pre-invasive carcinomas; whether this upregulation occurs in pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasia progression that proceeds to pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains to be elucidated.	18518	18761
28393239	Increased Psoriasin expression has also been identified in cancers at an advanced stage.	18762	18850
28393239	In breast cancer, Psoriasin overexpression is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis.	18851	18943
28393239	In the present study, Psoriasin expression was determined in a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients.	18944	19044
28393239	Psoriasin expression tended to be reduced in the pancreatic cancers compared to adjacent normal pancreatic tissues, though did not reach statistical significance.	19045	19207
28393239	This observation is similar to findings from a GEO data set (GDS4336) (Fig.	19208	19283
28393239	1A) (26).	19284	19293
28393239	A reduced expression was noted in primary tumours (n=9) with distant metastases.	19294	19374
28393239	This finding is yet to be verified by examining of a large cohort pancreatic primary tumours with a reasonable number of primary tumours which have distant metastasis.	19375	19542
28393239	In an analysis of a gene expression array data, an increased expression levels of Psoriasin was seen in metastases of pancreatic cancer in comparison with primary tumours (Fig.	19543	19719
28393239	1B).	14106	14110
28393239	Interestingly, a greater expression of Psoriasin was evident in locally advanced pancreatic tumours.	19725	19825
28393239	It suggests that Psoriasin may play differential roles during the development and progression of the disease, in particular, the metastatic process.	19826	19974
28393239	We determined the expression of Psoriasin in the cell lines AsPc-1, MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1, and expression appeared highest in MIA-PaCa-2 which is the most tumourigenic of the three cell lines (27).	19975	20172
28393239	These results demonstrate that Psoriasin overexpression is associated with increased cancer cell growth in vitro, whilst knockdown inhibits growth.	20173	20320
28393239	Interestingly, during breast cancer progression, Psoriasin has been shown to interact with Jab1 (c-jun activation-domain binding protein), which is involved in proteosomal degradation and signal transduction.	20321	20529
28393239	Interaction between Psoriasin and Jab1 results in increased activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity, increased expression of AP-1 and HIF-1-dependent genes, and reduced expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, resulting in enhanced tumourigenesis and metastasis in vivo (28).	20530	20808
28393239	It may be that in pancreatic cancer, the same mechanisms are taking place promoting tumour growth and metastasis.	20809	20922
28393239	Jab1 is a negative regulator of p27Kip1, promoting its degradation (29).	20923	20995
28393239	p27Kip1 normally binds to and prevents the activation of cyclin complexes controlling cell cycle progression at G1 (30).	20996	21116
28393239	Thus, it may be that increased interaction between Psoriasin and Jab1 results in decreased p27Kip1.	21117	21216
28393239	In line with this, an increased expression of p27Kip1 was also observed in the Psoriasin knockdown cells (Fig.	21217	21327
28393239	4C).	16828	16832
28393239	We also found that Psoriasin overexpression results in increased expression of cyclin D2, which may explain the mode of action for Psoriasin-mediated promotion of cyclin activation and cell cycle progression.	21333	21541
28393239	Additionally, differential expression of RAGE, the receptor of Psoriasin was seen in three pancreatic cancer cell lines.	21542	21662
28393239	RAGE has 8 isoforms of protein products encoded by 9 different splicing variants in humans (listed at PubMed Gene).	21663	21778
28393239	However, we cannot identify which variants were expressed by these cell lines.	21779	21857
28393239	The exact role played by RAGE in mediating functions of Psoriasin in pancreatic cancer is yet to be investigated.	21858	21971
28393239	In this study, Psoriasin expression was inversely linked to cell-matrix adhesion.	21972	22053
28393239	This is similar to our results observed in both prostate and lung cancer (11,15).	22054	22135
28393239	It suggests that expression of Psoriasin is a response by cancer cells to changes of cell-matrix adhesion and reciprocally affects cell adhesion to matrix.	22136	22291
28393239	We also found Psoriasin expression has no effect on the adhesion of pancreatic cancer cells to peritoneal mesothelial in vitro, and conclude that Psoriasin may not be required for the adhesion during peritoneal metastasis of pancreatic cancer.	22292	22535
28393239	Psoriasin is regarded as an inflammation-associated protein and has chemoattractant properties, promoting migration of granulocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages and monocytes.	22536	22708
28393239	Our study showed Psoriasin overexpression results in increased migration of pancreatic cancer cells.	22709	22809
28393239	The multi-ligand receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) has been identified as a Psoriasin receptor, and implicated in leukocyte migration and the inflammatory process.	22810	22991
28393239	It may be that, similar to leukocyte migration, Psoriasin attaches to RAGE in order to promote cancer cell migration (5).	22992	23113
28393239	Further to its influences on cell growth, adhesion and migration, we also examined the effect of Psoriasin on pancreatic cancer cell invasion.	23114	23256
28393239	It is well known that activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 promotes the invasive and metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells (31,32).	23257	23391
28393239	In our recent study of Psoriasin in prostate cancer, Psoriasin has been shown to have an effect on prostate cancer cell invasion via MMPs (11).	23392	23535
28393239	This is subsequently confirmed herein, whereby Psoriasin overexpression in pancreatic cancer cells resulted in increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity.	23536	23697
28393239	Taken together, these data suggest Psoriasin regulates invasion of pancreatic cancer cells via regulation of MMPs.	23698	23812
28393239	In a recent study, Morgan et al observed interaction between Psoriasin and the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β6 subunit is required for αvβ6-dependent breast cancer cell invasion.	23813	23997
28393239	Similarly, they showed upregulation of MMPs in Psoriasin overexpressing breast cancer cells (33).	23998	24095
28393239	In line with its higher expression levels in local invasive tumours, Psoriasin promotes invasion of pancreatic cancer cells which leads to a greater local invasive expansion of the disease.	24096	24285
28393239	A recent report of disruption of cell anchorage inducing apoptosis led us to investigate whether Psoriasin has a role of inducing this form of anoikis resistance in pancreatic cancer cells (34).	24286	24480
28393239	Anoikis is referred to as a programmed cell death or apoptosis which happens to adherent cells lacking anchorage (34).	24481	24599
28393239	It can occur during the dissemination of pancreatic cancer cells through circulation and peritoneal cavity when they lose anchorage.	24600	24732
28393239	At 3 h we saw a significant rise of cell-cell aggregates, indicating a role for Psoriasin in inducing these aggregates.	24733	24852
28393239	Previous experiments showed a role for Psoriasin in preventing anoikis (34), a result we confirmed in our cell lines, hinting that cell-cell aggregation may contribute to preventing anoikis.	24853	25043
28393239	Despite this, based on our results, the number of cell-cell aggregates show a significant increase only at 3 h, whereas cells display anoikis resistance at 1 h, indicating other mechanisms must be at play to compensate for the disparity.	25044	25281
28393239	Western blot analyses of adherent cells showed an increased activation of caspase 3 in the Psoriasin knockdown MIA-PaCa-2 cells.	25282	25410
28393239	The involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic caspase pathways and activation of caspase-3 in pancreatic cancer cells undergoing anoikis remains unclear and is yet to be investigated.	25411	25591
28393239	Further investigation is also required to reveal molecules involved in the enhanced cell-cell adhesion and aggregation.	25592	25711
28393239	In conclusion, reduced expression of Psoriasin was seen in pancreatic cancers with distant metastases, whilst higher transcript levels were seen in locally advanced tumours.	25712	25885
28393239	Psoriasin expression in pancreatic cancer cells is associated with cell growth, cell-matrix adhesion and migration.	25886	26001
28393239	Psoriasin regulates invasion of pancreatic cancer cells via expression of MMPs.	26002	26081
28393239	The implication of Psoriasin expression in invasion, disease progression and potential as a therapeutic target warrants further investigation.	26082	26224
27866394	Otilonium bromide (OB) – also known by its IUPAC chemical name N,N‐diethyl‐N‐methyl‐2‐(4‐[2‐(octyloxy)benzamido]benzoyloxy)ethanaminium bromide – is prescribed in Europe, Asia and South America as an anti‐spasmodic for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 1.	0	269
27866394	This drug contains a charged quaternary ammonium that favours its accumulation within the gastrointestinal wall 2.	270	384
27866394	The OB spasmolytic activity is mainly because of the interference of calcium influx through L‐type Ca2+ channels and the mobilization of cellular calcium required for smooth muscle contraction, thereby limiting excessive intestinal contractility.	385	631
27866394	Otilonium bromide also inhibits T‐type Ca2+ channels and muscarinic and tachykinin receptors (NK1r and NK2r) on smooth muscle and primary afferent neurons that may have the joint effect of reducing motility and abdominal pain 3.	632	860
27866394	Indeed, in strips of human colon, exposure to OB, either alone or in the presence of the tachykinin agonist, caused a concentration‐dependent reduction in the number of the cells that internalized the receptor NK2r 4.	861	1078
27866394	A recent clinical trial has confirmed the OB efficacy in IBS patients and has shown, for the first time, the long‐term beneficial effect of the drug during the follow‐up period in a group of patients previously treated with OB as compared to placebo group 5.	1079	1337
27866394	These findings suggest that OB given in a long‐term way is able to preserve the clinical beneficial effects beyond its interruption.	1338	1470
27866394	Several experiments have been done in rats repeatedly treated with OB to ascertain its cellular targets and mechanisms of action.	1471	1600
27866394	The results obtained demonstrated: in the smooth muscle cells, morphological changes in the structures involved in calcium handling and storage (caveolae, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria) and in the NK1r distribution and Mr2 expression; in the enteric neurons, immunohistochemical and functional changes in the nNOS/SP/NK1r mediated signalling circuit 6, 7, 8.	1601	1972
27866394	Colonic biopsies from IBS patients show an increase in activated lymphocytes, mast cells, and neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes in the mucosa suggestive for a local inflammation 9, 10.	1973	2166
27866394	Moreover, an increase in the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 no‐selective ionic channel and SP expression has been reported and related to pain 11.	2167	2323
27866394	A main role in the aetiopathogenesis of IBS has been attributed to a psychosocial stress and animal models based on this hypothesis and reproducing some of the most common IBS symptoms have been developed.	2324	2529
27866394	We recently demonstrated in rats underwent to the wrap restrain stress (WRS) the development of an increased colonic activity and faecal excretion and, as in IBS patients, a mild inflammation in the mucosa 12.	2530	2739
27866394	Interestingly, we also found important changes in glial cells and in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the entire colonic wall, and an increase in CRF1r expressing myenteric neurons.	2740	2935
27866394	The peculiar features of the WRS model make it particularly suitable to investigate the ability of OB to prevent or attenuate the appearance and evolution of the colonic alterations induced by stress.	2936	3136
27866394	Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate whether a repeated treatment with OB prevented the functional and immunohistochemical changes characterizing the WRS rats.	3137	3306
27866394	Male Wistar rats (n = 71) from Janvier Labs (Saint‐Berthevin, France) weighing around 250–350 g on the day of experiments were used for this study and housed at Syncrosome Laboratories (Marseille, France).	3307	3512
27866394	The acclimatization of the animals lasted at least 5 days.	3513	3571
27866394	They had free access to food and drinking water ad libitum.	3572	3631
27866394	The experimental procedures were carried out in accordance to European guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Directive 2010/63/UE) and were approved by the French Ethical Committee C2EA‐/71, of which Syncrosome is a member.	3632	3872
27866394	Every effort was done to maintain animal's health, safety and welfare, minimize suffering and reduce the number of animals used in the experiments.	3873	4020
27866394	Furthermore, Syncrosome laboratories and its animal housing facilities are accredited by French Authorities and audited every year by French Department of Veterinary Service.	4021	4195
27866394	The study was divided into two consecutive phases.	4196	4246
27866394	The first phase was carried out to better define the OB dose to be used in the second one, consisting in the main session of experiments.	4247	4384
27866394	First phase: OB was given 4 hrs before colorectal distension (CRD) and abdominal contraction (AC) recordings at doses of 2 or 20 mg/kg p.o. (Fig.	4385	4530
27866394	1 and Table S1).	4531	4547
27866394	These doses and time were chosen on the basis of previous experiments 6, 7 and of pharmacokinetic properties of the drug 2.	4548	4671
27866394	Second phase: The chosen OB dose of 20 mg/kg was administered for 10 days and on the day 11, the rats received the last dose 4 hrs before undergoing to CRD (Fig.	4672	4833
27866394	1 and Table S1).	4531	4547
27866394	In both phases, rats were subjected to WRS for 2 hrs, starting at 1.5 hrs after the last OB administration.	4851	4958
27866394	For the total number of rats used for each phase, see Table S1.	4959	5022
27866394	The drug was dissolved in water at final concentrations of 0.4 and 4 mg/ml and a total volume of 5 ml/kg was administered to reach the 2 or 20 mg/kg dose respectively.	5023	5190
27866394	The controls received an equal volume of water.	5191	5238
27866394	Otilonium bromide was given p.o. For the first phase, OB was administered once at Day 0 (D0) 4 hrs before CRD test; for the second phase OB was administered twice daily from D−10 to D0 and the last dose on D0 4 hrs before CRD test (Fig.	5239	5475
27866394	1 and Table S1).	4531	4547
27866394	The application of WRS consists in the block of the upper forelimbs and thoracic trunk for 2 hrs.	5493	5590
27866394	The timing and the procedure of WRS application was described in detail in Data S1.	5591	5674
27866394	Faecal pellet collection and ACs following colorectal distention by the insertion of a balloon were chosen as functional parameters.	5675	5807
27866394	The details about the timing of functional evaluations and methods were explained in Data S1.	5808	5901
27866394	As depicted on Figure 1 and Table S1, the animals that did not undergo to CRD were killed at T0 with pentobarbital and the colon was removed.	5902	6043
27866394	In particular, three full‐thickness samples (length: 1 cm/each) of the ascending colon (starting 1 cm far from the ileo‐caecal junction) were taken from each experimental group and randomly assigned to the different procedures described below.	6044	6287
27866394	For paraffin embedded tissue, the sample was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) over night (ON) at 4°C, dehydrated in graded ethanol series, cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin.	6288	6515
27866394	Then, the sections (5 μm thick) were cut using a rotary microtome (MR2; Boeckeler Instruments Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA) and collected on positively charged slides.	6516	6676
27866394	For frozen tissue, a second sample after fixation was cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS ON at 4°C, embedded in Killik cryostat medium (Bio‐Optica, Milan, Italy) and frozen at −80°C.	6677	6862
27866394	Transverse cryosections (8 μm thick) were cut using a cryostat (Leica Microsystem CM 1950, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected on positively charged slides.	6863	7015
27866394	For western blot analysis, a third sample was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.	7016	7116
27866394	To evaluate the tissue organization, either paraffin embedded or frozen sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin.	7117	7239
27866394	The paraffin embedded sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated as usual and for antigen retrieval boiled 10 min.	7240	7355
27866394	in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0; Bio‐Optica) or treated for 20 min.	7356	7431
27866394	at 90–92°C in Tris buffer (10 mM) with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (1 mM, pH 9.0), as appropriate, followed by cooling to room temperature (RT).	7432	7580
27866394	For fluorescence microscope examination, the frozen and the deparaffinized sections were washed in PBS and blocked for 20 min.	7581	7707
27866394	at RT with 1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Applichem, Darmstad, Germany) in PBS, plus 0.5% Triton (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for the frozen ones.	7708	7862
27866394	The primary antibodies diluted in PBS were applied ON at 4°C.	7863	7924
27866394	The day after, the sections were washed in PBS and incubated for 2 hrs at RT in the dark with appropriate fluorochrome‐conjugated (AlexaFluor 488‐ or 568‐conjugated) secondary antibodies (goat anti‐rabbit, goat anti‐mouse, donkey anti‐goat, or goat anti‐guinea pig, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) diluted 1:333 in PBS.	7925	8244
27866394	The sections were washed in PBS and mounted in an aqueous medium (Immuno‐Mount; Thermo scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) with or without 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (Sigma‐Aldrich).	8245	8425
27866394	The immunoreaction products were observed under an epifluorescence Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using 488‐, 568‐ and 370‐nm excitation wavelength for the green, red and blue fluorescent labels, respectively, and the fluorescence images were captured using a Leica DFC310 FX 1.4‐megapixel digital camera, equipped with the Leica software application suite LAS V3.8 (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany).	8426	8856
27866394	For light microscope examination, after deparaffinization, rehydration and antigen retrieval phase as reported, the sections were treated with 3% H2O2 in PBS for 5 min.	8857	9025
27866394	to block endogenous peroxidase activity.	9026	9066
27866394	After washing, the sections were incubated with 1.5% BSA in PBS for 20 min.	9067	9142
27866394	at RT.	9143	9149
27866394	The anti‐S100β primary antibody was applied ON at 4°C.	9150	9204
27866394	The day after, the sections were incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibody diluted 1:300 (goat anti‐mouse; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) in PBS for 2 hrs at RT.	9205	9389
27866394	Subsequently, the sections were washed, treated with ABC Reagent (Vectastain ABC/Elite Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 20 min.	9390	9535
27866394	and developed with 3,3′‐diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma‐Aldrich), as chromogen.	9536	9612
27866394	Sections were counter‐stained with haematoxylin.	9613	9661
27866394	After washing in PBS, the sections were mounted in an aqueous medium (Sigma‐Aldrich) and observed under the Microstar IV light microscope (Reichert Technologies, Reichert Inc, Depew, USA).	9662	9850
27866394	For CRF1r staining, the procedure described by 13, 14 has been followed.	9851	9923
27866394	Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation for 30 min.	9924	9992
27866394	with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS and nonspecific reaction was blocked by incubation in 3% normal donkey serum (60 mg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min.	9993	10138
27866394	at RT.	9143	9149
27866394	Sections were incubated with anti‐CRF1r in PBS 0.3% Triton X‐100 and the day after with the secondary antibody (rabbit anti‐goat; Jackson ImmunoResearch).	10146	10300
27866394	Finally, these sections were processed for avidin‐biotin‐peroxidase procedure using DAB and observed under the light microscope.	10301	10429
27866394	Negative controls were performed omitting the primary antibody or using the specific blocking peptide to exclude the presence of nonspecific staining.	10430	10580
27866394	The procedure followed foreseen the protein content extraction from full‐thickness samples of ascending colon.	10581	10691
27866394	After spectrophotometrically protein quantification, samples and appropriate molecular‐weight markers were resolved by standard electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane.	10692	10898
27866394	After the incubation with primary and peroxidase‐conjugated secondary antibodies, the immunoreaction products were revealed by chemiluminescence reagent.	10899	11052
27866394	To normalize the values of the antibody, the runs were also immunostained with anti‐β‐actin, assumed as housekeeping protein.	11053	11178
27866394	The details about western blot procedures were explained in Data S1.	11179	11247
27866394	Information on primary antibody sources and used concentrations for fluorescence, light microscope examination and WB analysis is shown in Table S2.	11248	11396
27866394	The faecal pellets and AC number was quantified and expressed as number ± S.E.M.	11397	11477
27866394	A quantitative analysis of the immunoreactive (IR) structures was done by the acquisition of digitized images of the labelling (1 section/animal; 5 animals/group) using 20× or 40× objectives, as appropriate; attention was made to avoid overlapping between the adjacent portions.	11478	11756
27866394	Each image was analysed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, ML, USA) to evaluate the intensity of labelling and to quantify the area of the IR structures.	11757	11904
27866394	The photographs’ threshold values were set to analyse the structures of interest exclusively.	11905	11998
27866394	The labelling was converted to a binary image and the number of pixels and the IR intensity were measured.	11999	12105
27866394	The results are expressed as optical density ± S.E.M.	12106	12159
27866394	The quantitative analysis of the number of IR neurons or inflammatory cells was done by two observers, blind to each other, along the entire section (three sections/animal; five animals/group) and expressed as number ± S.E.M.	12160	12385
27866394	The quantitative analysis of western blot‐IR bands was performed by computer‐assisted densitometry by using the QuantityOne analysis software (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with each band corresponding to a single specimen.	12386	12607
27866394	The results for the protein of interest were normalized to the corresponding β‐actin band.	12608	12698
27866394	Statistical analysis was performed by one‐way anova followed by Newman–Keuls post‐test to compare the three groups.	12699	12814
27866394	Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.	12815	12869
27866394	A statistically significant increase (P < 0.05) in the weight and number of faecal pellets was found in rats subjected to WRS as compared to controls (2869 ± 416 versus 986 ± 219 mg and 10.63 ± 1.97 versus 5.88 ± 1.27 respectively).	12870	13102
27866394	Acute administration of OB (2 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) did not affect these parameters (data not shown).	13103	13201
27866394	AC numbers of rats subjected to WRS was increased only at 1.2 ml distension as compared to controls (21.00 ± 3.09 versus 14.43 ± 2.62).	13202	13337
27866394	This increase (35% from controls) was reduced by 20 mg/kg p.o. OB at 14.63 ± 1.89 and by 2 mg/kg p.o. OB at 17.88 ± 2.97.	13338	13459
27866394	On the basis of these results, the dose of 20 mg/kg OB was chosen for the next experiments.	13460	13551
27866394	Number and weight of faecal pellets showed a statistically significant increase (P < 0.05) in the WRS group as compared to control one (10.0 ± 1.64 versus 7.25 ± 1.10 and 2724 ± 364 versus 1146 ± 151 mg respectively).	13552	13769
27866394	The repeated treatment with 20 mg/kg of OB was unable to affect these parameters (values in number and weight of faecal pellets were: 10.25 ± 1.22 and 2327 ± 277 mg).	13770	13936
27866394	Increase in distension volume produced an increase in AC in all groups.	13937	14008
27866394	Controls: 3.75 ± 1.39, 7.75 ± 0.86, 13.25 ± 1.79, 21.75 ± 2.30; WRS rats: 4.13 ± 1.11, 5.88 ± 1.57, 18.13 ± 1.92, 29.00 ± 2.00; OB/WRS rats: 1.75 ± 0.56, 6.50 ± 1.73, 17.38 ± 1.61, 25.25 ± 3.52 at 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 ml of volume distension, respectively.	14009	14266
27866394	The increase was statistically significant (P < 0.05) as compared to 0 volume distension at 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 ml of volume distension in controls and at 0.8 and 1.2 ml in WRS and OB treated animals.	14267	14464
27866394	Comparison between controls and WRS rats showed a statistically significant increase (P < 0.05) in the latter group at 0.8 and 1.2 ml of volume distension.	14465	14620
27866394	OB/WRS did not show any significant difference in the number of AC at any volume of distension examined as compared to WRS rats.	14621	14749
27866394	However, at variance with WRS rats, the number of AC in OB treated rats at 1.2 ml of volume distention was not significantly different from controls.	14750	14899
27866394	To note, in the absence of volume distension, OB/WRS group showed a statistically significant decrease (P < 0.05) in number of AC (1.75 ± 0.56) versus WRS (4.13 ± 1.11) and control rats (3.75 ± 1.39).	14900	15100
27866394	Histological evaluation of the colonic wall with haematoxylin and eosin showed a substantial integrity of mucosa, submucosa and muscle wall in all groups of animals.	15101	15266
27866394	Similarly, the labelling with the pan‐neuronal marker PGP9.5 showed no changes among the groups in the total number of neurons either in the myenteric or submucous plexus (SMP; data not shown).	15267	15460
27866394	Haematoxylin and eosin staining and c‐kit‐IR labelling revealed the presence of a mild inflammation consisting in clusters of immunity cells beneath the lining epithelium and in the mucosa a significant increase in eosinophilic granulocytes (controls: 51.50 ± 6.652; WRS: 76.50 ± 3.775; OB/WRS: 71.50 ± 6.764, P < 0.05) and mast cells (controls: 166 ± 7.371; WRS: 231.3 ± 7.219; OB/WRS: 221.3 ± 4.978, P < 0.001), in WRS and OB/WRS rats compared to controls.	15461	15919
27866394	CGRP‐IR nerve fibres were significantly increased in WRS rats.	15920	15982
27866394	This increase was prevented by OB treatment, especially in the submucosa (Fig.	15983	16061
27866394	2A–D and Table 1).	16062	16080
27866394	S100β‐IR structures were significantly decreased in WRS rats compared to controls.	16081	16163
27866394	This decrease was not present in OB/WRS rats (Table 1).	16164	16219
27866394	VIP‐IR neurons were decreased in WRS rats.	16220	16262
27866394	This decrease was prevented in OB/WRS group (Fig.	16263	16312
27866394	3A–D and Table 1).	16313	16331
27866394	nNOS‐IR neurons were significantly decreased either in WRS or OB/WRS rats compared to controls (Table 1).	16332	16437
27866394	NK1r‐ and ChAT‐IR neuron number was unchanged in the SMP among the groups of animals (Table 1).	16438	16533
27866394	To note, whereas in controls and OB/WRS rats, the NK1r‐IR labelling was located along the plasma membrane, in WRS rats, it was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm.	16534	16697
27866394	c‐kit‐IR interstitial cells of Cajal showed no changes in organization, size, shape and number; however, the labelling distribution appeared clustered in OB/WRS and WRS rats instead to be uniformly distributed along the cell profile as in controls (Fig.	16698	16951
27866394	4A–C).	16952	16958
27866394	Mr2‐IR in the smooth muscle cells was decreased in WRS rats compared to controls and OB/WRS rats (Fig.	16959	17061
27866394	5A–C).	17062	17068
27866394	Quantization of the receptor by WB confirmed this decrease (Fig.	17069	17133
27866394	5D).	17134	17138
27866394	ChAT‐IR neuron number showed no change in WRS rats while it was significantly decreased in OB/WRS rats (Fig.	17139	17247
27866394	5E–G and Table 1).	17248	17266
27866394	S100β‐IR structures were significantly reduced in WRS rats compared to controls; this decrease was prevented by OB treatment (Table 1).	17267	17402
27866394	CRF1r‐ and CRF2r‐IR neurons (Fig.	17403	17436
27866394	6A–F) were significantly increased in WRS rats compared to controls.	17437	17505
27866394	To note, OB prevented the CRF1r increase exclusively (Fig.	17506	17564
27866394	6G and H, Table 1).	17565	17584
27866394	VIP‐, nNOS‐ and NK1r‐IR neuron number was significantly decreased in WRS rats; these decreases were completely prevented in OB treated rats (Figs 3A–C, E and 7D; Table 1).	17585	17756
27866394	Similar to the SMP neurons, in controls and OB/WRS rats the NK1r‐IR labelling was mostly distributed along the plasma membrane (Fig.	17757	17889
27866394	7A and C), while in WRS rats the majority of the neurons were labelled also in the cytoplasm (Fig.	17890	17988
27866394	7B).	17989	17993
27866394	SP‐ and nNOS‐IR nerve structures were significantly decreased in WRS rats; these decreases were undetected in OB/WRS group of animals (Table 1).	17994	18138
27866394	This study demonstrates that repeated OB administration in rats subjected to acute WRS is able to counteract most of the morphological changes caused by this psychosocial stressor in the colonic wall.	18139	18339
27866394	In particular, the drug prevents the decrease in SP‐, NK1r‐, nNOS‐, VIP‐ and S100β‐IR as well as the increase in CGRP‐, and CRF1r‐IR detected in WRS rats.	18340	18494
27866394	As expected, OB does not interfere with the mild mucosal inflammation because of WRS.	18495	18580
27866394	Interestingly, OB treatment per se increases the Mr2 expression in the muscle wall and decreases the number of the ChAT‐IR myenteric neurons.	18581	18722
27866394	Noteworthy, OB does not affect the increase in CRF2r‐IR neurons observed in WRS rats.	18723	18808
27866394	With regard to the functional findings, OB is able to significantly reduce the number of spontaneous AC compared to WRS and control rats but not of those induced by volume distention.	18809	18992
27866394	Several studies have been addressed to identify the OB molecular targets 15, 16.	18993	19073
27866394	The results obtained in in vitro experiments after acute exposition of rat colonic strips to the drug showed that OB behaves as antagonist of the L‐type Ca2+ channel, M2 and neurokinin receptors 3, 17, 18.	19074	19279
27866394	These effects were considered the consequence of the OB interaction with the colonic smooth muscle cells because of the very poor systemic absorption of the drug 2.	19280	19444
27866394	Recently, a series of publications where OB was administered repeatedly has allowed to extend the knowledge on the complexity of OB pharmacology unmasking a constant involvement of the enteric nervous system in mediating the drug actions 6, 7, 8.	19445	19691
27866394	Otilonium bromide is commonly used to control the main symptoms of IBS, a chronic disease characterized by visceral pain and/or discomfort, hypersensitivity and abnormal motor responses 19.	19692	19881
27866394	Although the aetiopathogenesis of IBS is only partially understood, a main role has been attributed to psychosocial stressors of different origin 20, 21.	19882	20035
27866394	The WRS is considered a psychosocial stress model adequate to reproduce in the animals, some of the typical symptoms and signs of IBS 22, 23, 24.	20036	20181
27866394	Accordingly, we recently reported functional and morphological alterations in WRS rat similar to those described in IBS patients 12 and, presently, we demonstrate that repeated OB administration prevents most of the changes caused by the WRS, particularly those on the enteric nervous system.	20182	20474
27866394	However, the cellular mechanism through which OB could interfere with the nerve structures is undefined.	20475	20579
27866394	Among the several pharmacological properties attributed to OB, the inhibition of the calcium entry by binding to the L‐type Ca2+ channels has been considered the most significant 3, 6, 16, 17.	20580	20772
27866394	In this respect, since the neurons express the L‐type Ca2+ channels, the possibility that OB, blocking these channels, could modify the neuronal response to physiological 6, 7 or pathological 12 stimuli has to be considered.	20773	20997
27866394	As a matter of fact the variations in the neurotransmitters’ expression found in the myenteric neurons after repeated OB treatment 6, 7, 8 are coupled to significant changes in neuronal activity 8.	20998	21195
27866394	Of particular interest are the changes in the CRF1r and CRF2r expression presently detected in the myenteric neurons of WRS rats and in WRS rats pre‐treated with OB.	21196	21361
27866394	The presence of these two receptors was already demonstrated either by PCR techniques in the human colon 13 or by immunohistochemistry in the rat colon 14 and it was shown that the CRF2r is higher expressed compared to the CRF1r.	21362	21591
27866394	In agreement, we presently detect a greater number of CRF2r‐IR neurons compared to the CRF1r‐IR ones.	21592	21693
27866394	Pharmacological studies have shown that the endogenous ligand cortical releasing factor (CRF) shows higher affinity to the CRF1r respect to the CRF2r 14, 25.	21694	21851
27866394	Cortical releasing factor is considered the primary hypothalamic mediator of the mammalian neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to stress 26 and the adverse gastrointestinal effects (visceral hypersensitivity, increased colonic transit) caused by its injection or by psychosocial stressors are blocked by CRF1r antagonists 27, 28.	21852	22186
27866394	With regard to the CRF2r role, it was reported that injection of selective agonists did not provoke any measurable response in the rat colonic wall 14 and it has been suggested that the CRF2r activation could negatively modulate the CRF1r mediated responses.	22187	22445
27866394	In fact, the administration of the selective CRF2r agonist, Urocortin 2, inhibits the CRF1r mediated stimulation of colonic motor function induced by acute partial restrain stress or by CRF injection 14.	22446	22649
27866394	In a recent paper, we reported that WRS causes an increase in the CRF1r expressing neurons in the myenteric plexus of rat colon.	22650	22778
27866394	Presently, we show also a significant increase in the CRF2r‐IR myenteric neurons in WRS rats.	22779	22872
27866394	Thus, it can be inferred that stress causes a complex neuronal response consisting not only of a predictable increase in CRF1r, as mediator for the adverse local effects, but also of an unexpected increase in CRF2r.	22873	23088
27866394	On the basis of the literature, this latter finding might be interpreted as an attempt to cope to the CRF1r mediated stress effects that could bring to an overdrive state and predispose to diseases.	23089	23287
27866394	The relevance of the CFR2r in determining the outcome of a stress condition is likely underestimate.	23288	23388
27866394	In a recent report on the lack of a CRF1r antagonist efficacy to ameliorate colonic symptoms in IBS patients 29, it has been suggested that impairment in the CRF1r‐CRF2r integrated response might be implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease.	23389	23635
27866394	In the muscle wall of WRS rats, the expression of the inhibitory (nNOS, VIP) and excitatory (SP/NK1r) neurotransmitters investigated is decreased suggesting that stress causes an impairment of the neuronal activity.	23636	23851
27866394	Reasonably, this impairment is triggered by the CRF through its receptors.	23852	23926
27866394	To note, the CRF, beyond the central nervous system, is also expressed and likely released by the enteric neurons and, in stress conditions, the number of the neurons expressing the CRF is increased 13.	23927	24129
27866394	Few and partial information is available on the specific neuronal population releasing the CRF and/or expressing the CRF receptors 30, 31.	24130	24268
27866394	Noteworthy, presently, we show that repeated administration of OB prevents almost of the neurotransmitters’ decreases and the overexpression of the CRF1r in the myenteric plexus without modifying that of the CRF2r.	24269	24483
27866394	Our experimental conditions do not allow to establish a direct relationship between the two events; however, the ability of OB to prevent the neurotransmitters’ changes due to stress and the reduction in the excitatory ChAT expressing neurons, caused by the drug per se, might explain the spasmolytic activity exerted by OB and the relief from most of the IBS symptoms.	24484	24853
27866394	As expected OB does not show any anti‐inflammatory activity when measured as cell infiltrate and mast cell increase.	24854	24970
27866394	However, through its ability to interact with the nerve structures, OB prevents the increase in the CGRP expression in the submucosa and mucosa of WRS rats.	24971	25127
27866394	CGRP is mainly expressed by sensory neurons and in IBS patients or in rats underwent to maternal deprivation, CGRP‐positive fibres are increased and strictly associated with mast cells 32, 33, 34.	25128	25324
27866394	Moreover, stress conditions favour mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators able to sensitize sensory afferents such as those carrying CGRP 35, 36.	25325	25493
27866394	Furthermore, the rectal biopsy samples taken from patients with well‐characterized rectal hypersensitivity showed a marked increase in submucosal CGRP 11.	25494	25648
27866394	Therefore, although OB does not interfere with the mast cell increase present in WRS rats, it is reasonable to infer that, because of its ability to prevent the overexpression of CGRP, it might also ameliorate symptoms such as pain.	25649	25881
27866394	The results obtained with the functional studies appear contrasting also in view of the known OB efficacy in counteract visceral sensitivity in IBS patients 37, 38.	25882	26046
27866394	Interestingly, OB causes a significant reduction in the spontaneous AC contraction respect to controls and WRS rats.	26047	26163
27866394	This datum indicates that OB induces muscle relaxation, thus reducing the visceral motility.	26164	26256
27866394	The inability of OB to reduce the number of AC because of volume distention might be explained by the modalities provided by the CRD test.	26257	26395
27866394	In fact, it has been reported that the application of a progressive volume of distention increasing the painful sensations recruits central efferent fibres 22 insensitive to OB effects 3.	26396	26583
27866394	Accordingly, when this test was applied to measure the efficacy of other drugs known to be able to reduce the visceral sensitivity in humans, the results failed 39.	26584	26748
27866394	In conclusion, this study confirms the WRS as a model suitable to mimic most of the IBS symptomatology and adequate to investigate the OB cellular targets to ameliorate our understanding of the drug mechanisms of action in IBS.	26749	26976
27866394	The findings obtained indicate that most of the OB activity is exerted at the enteric nervous system level by preventing the neuronal changes caused by the stress.	26977	27140
27866394	How OB act at the cellular level is not defined yet; however, its ability to block the calcium entry could represent a plausible explanation.	27141	27282
27866394	This pharmacological property might play a role also in avoiding the increase in the neuronal cells that express the CRF1r, as observed in the WRS rats.	27283	27435
27866394	We are aware that the combination of a repeatedly pre‐treatment with the application of an acute model of stress might represent a limitation of this study.	27436	27592
27866394	However, the results obtained in the clinical studies of OB efficacy in IBS patients 40 have brought to hypothesize that cyclic or intermittent treatment, independently on the presence of the IBS symptoms, might be an adequate therapeutic strategy to manage the IBS 41.	27593	27862
27866394	We declare that no conflict of interests in our study is going to disclose.	27863	27938
27866394	CT performed the immunohistochemical and biomolecular research; VG performed the WRS and functional experiments; CT and VG analysed the data and performed the statistics; SE performed a critical review of the manuscript and contributed to the support of the study; MSFP prepared the figures and performed a critical revision of the manuscript; CT, MSFP and MGV wrote the article; MGV carried out a critical revision of the data obtained, a critical review of manuscript, study concept and design for important intellectual content and obtained funding.	27939	28491
28512644	Erysipelas is an acute bacterial infection of the upper part of the dermis and superficial lymphatic vessels.	0	109
28512644	In addition to nonspecific symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting, erysipelas has unique clinical features of infection including skin lesions, intense erythema, tenderness, and swelling of the lymph nodes.	110	325
28512644	The legs and faces are the most common areas of localization for erysipelas [1, 2].	326	409
28512644	Group A (β-hemolytic) streptococcus (GAS) bacteria are the main causative agent for erysipelas that often began with breakages on the skin barriers allowing the microorganism to penetrate into the skin.	410	612
28512644	Diagnosis of erysipelas is largely based on clinical findings, but laboratory diagnosis of group A streptococcal infections is still largely used to identify the causative organism.	613	794
28512644	GAS-related erysipelas has often been diagnosed in old and immunocompromised individuals as well as in neonates and young children.	795	926
28512644	The commonly accepted antibiotic for the treatment of erysipelas is penicillin, but it is important to note that since the 1980s, cases of severe invasive penicillin-resistant GAS diseases have been on the rise and that to date, no licensed vaccines against GAS have been designed.	927	1208
28512644	A major clinical problem that has been encountered with erysipelas is its recurrence.	1209	1294
28512644	There are 18 million cases of severe GAS-related infections annually reported, with approximately 2.3% fatality.	1295	1407
28512644	It is believed that the severity of the disease and its fatality rate are associated with penicillin-resistant GAS.	1408	1523
28512644	Despite intense research, our knowledge of the GAS pathogenesis is incomplete.	1524	1602
28512644	It has been shown that GAS-induced production of free radicals plays several roles in the pathogenesis of infections.	1603	1720
28512644	An increased production of free radicals can affect cell vitality by disrupting the integrity and function of cytoplasmic membranes, damaging membrane lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.	1721	1908
28512644	Additionally, free radicals can inhibit the immune system's ability to identify and eliminate GAS.	1909	2007
28512644	These negative effects are referred to as oxidative stress and can be reduced with the aid of exogenous or endogenous antioxidants.	2008	2139
28512644	There are three main endogenous antioxidant systems: superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and catalase (CAT).	2140	2274
28512644	SOD1 is found in the cytosol and nucleus, as well as in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria.	2275	2375
28512644	SOD1 is a major cytoplasmic antioxidant enzyme that metabolizes superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (Н2О2), thus protecting the cells against oxygen-related toxicity.	2376	2568
28512644	SOD2 is the only antioxidant located exclusively in the mitochondria, where it scavenges the superoxide radicals and converts them to molecular oxygen and peroxide.	2569	2733
28512644	Catalase (CAT) is generally found in the liver, kidney, and erythrocytes.	2734	2807
28512644	CAT catalyzes the hydrogen peroxide decomposition to harmless compounds such as water and oxygen.	2808	2905
28512644	Therefore, antioxidants are important in preventing harmful effects of free radicals.	2906	2991
28512644	Disturbed function of superoxide dismutase antioxidants can reduce cell protection against free radicals released during the course of infection.	2992	3137
28512644	Although cytokines play an important role in host defenses against infection, inflammatory cytokines may favor production of free radicals and facilitate oxidative stress.	3138	3309
28512644	For example, overexpression of inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β has been found in oxidative stress-induced melanomas.	3310	3445
28512644	Also, TNF-α-induced oxidative stress and subsequent redox system dysfunction have been described in patients with cardiac dysfunction.	3446	3580
28512644	In another study, the overexpression of IL-6 and TNF-α was shown to be associated with an increased severity of GAS infection, higher rate of toxic shock, and tissue necrosis [11, 12].	3581	3765
28512644	Currently, our knowledge on the association between SOD1, SOD2, and CAT gene expression and severity of erysipelas is limited.	3766	3892
28512644	Relationships between serum cytokine levels and erysipelas infection are also scarcely known.	3893	3986
28512644	Also, correlation between expression of SOD1, SOD2, and catalase genes and activation of inflammatory cytokine in erysipelas still remain unknown.	3987	4133
28512644	Therefore, we sought to determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes encoding SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and cytokine levels and their interaction can serve as susceptibility markers for erysipelas.	4134	4347
28512644	For that, we analyzed clinical characteristics of the disease in conjunction with SNPs in the selected genes and cytokine levels among residents of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia.	4348	4530
28512644	Additionally, relationships between the studied SNPs and serum cytokine profile were studied in erysipelas patients.	4531	4647
28512644	Seventy-one erysipelas subjects (average age 63.89 ± 10.33) admitted into the “Republican Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital named after Professor A. F. Agafonova” of The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan were enrolled into this study.	4648	4900
28512644	Diagnosis was established based on clinical symptoms and laboratory bacterial culture test results.	4901	5000
28512644	Subjects with concomitant severe and chronic inflammatory diseases in the acute phase were excluded.	5001	5101
28512644	One blood sample was collected from each of the 71 erysipelas cases.	5102	5170
28512644	Additionally, serum samples were collected from 50 patients, each of whom, one sample was taken from at the acute and another at the convalescent phase of the disease.	5171	5338
28512644	The clinical characteristics of the subjects are summarized in Table 1.	5339	5410
28512644	Fifty-five age-matched controls were recruited (average age 58.34 ± 6.93) as well.	5411	5493
28512644	Blood samples were collected from 55 controls, while serum was obtained from 26 controls.	5494	5583
28512644	The Ethics Committee of Kazan State Medical University approved this study (N6, 06.25.2012), and informed consent was obtained from each study subject, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Article 20, Federal Law “Protection of Health Right of Citizens of Russian Federation” (N323-ФЗ, 11.21.2011).	5584	5900
28512644	Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood sample using phenol-chloroform protocol.	5901	5982
28512644	DNA was stored at −40°C until further use.	5983	6025
28512644	DNA was analyzed for the presence of the SNPs in the SOD1 (G7958A; rs4998557), SOD2 (C60T, rs4880), SOD2 (T2734C; rs11575993), and CAT (C262T; rs101179) using SNP diagnostic kits 01327-100, 01333-100, 01281-100, and 01342-100, respectively (JSC “Lytech,” Russia).	6026	6289
28512644	Amplification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	6290	6363
28512644	A total of 44 cytokines were analyzed in the serum samples using Bio-Plex Pro™ Human Cytokine 27-plex and Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 21-plex Assay multiplex kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.	6364	6572
28512644	These cytokines include IL-1ra, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-2Rα, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, CCL27, CXCL1, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12, FGF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, HGF, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, LIF, β-NGF, PDGF-BB, SCF, SCGF-β, TNF-α, TRAIL, and VEGF.	6573	6907
28512644	A fifty-microliter serum sample was used to determine cytokine concentration according to the manufacturer's instructions.	6908	7030
28512644	Data collected was analyzed using MasterPlex CT control software and MasterPlex QT analysis software (MiraiBio, Division of Hitachi Software, San Francisco, CA, USA).	7031	7197
28512644	Statistical analysis of genotypes of the studied SNPs in our case-control study was carried out comparing the additive, dominant, and recessive models as earlier defined.	7198	7368
28512644	The Pearson x2 test, analysis of variance, and logistic regression were used to analyze the clinical differences between the subject groups and the control.	7369	7525
28512644	Allele and genotype frequencies in the subject and control groups were compared with those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equations using x2 test.	7526	7673
28512644	The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was satisfied in most of the distributions.	7674	7748
28512644	The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to assess the association between the alleles and the risk of the studied infection.	7749	7907
28512644	The association between cytokine levels, genotype, and clinical presentation of the study group was calculated using logistic regression and linear regressions using an earlier described web application SNPStats (http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats).	7908	8162
28512644	Statistical difference (p) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (K) were used to analyze the cytokine profile of the patients.	8163	8290
28512644	A value of р < 0.05 signifies a statistical significant difference in cytokine levels between groups and subgroups.	8291	8406
28512644	The value of K > 0.4 was used to indicate a high degree of correlation in changes of a cytokine in infected individuals when the level of the cytokines during the acute phase is compared to the level of the same cytokine during the convalescent phase.	8407	8658
28512644	Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software 22 (IBM).	8659	8723
28512644	All erysipelas patients enrolled in this study were grouped based in the frequency of the infection: those without previous diagnosis of erysipelas (primary) within the last 365 days (38 patients) and others with more than one episode of erysipelas (recurrent) within the last 365 days (33 patients) (Table 1).	8724	9034
28512644	Forty-eight patients were females, with an equal number of females having the primary form erysipelas (24 cases) and the recurrent form erysipelas (24 cases).	9035	9193
28512644	Twenty-three were males, where 14 cases had primary and 9 had recurrent form of the infection.	9194	9288
28512644	Erysipelas cases were analyzed based on the severity (moderate and severe) of the infection.	9289	9381
28512644	A total of nine patients were diagnosed with the severe form of erysipelas, and 62 had a moderate form of the infection.	9382	9502
28512644	The number of male and female patients with the moderate form of erysipelas was fairly similar (22 males; 95.7% of all males, versus 40 females; 83.3% of all females).	9503	9670
28512644	However, a higher proportion of females had the severe form of the infection (8 females; 16.7%) than that of males (1 male; 4.3%).	9671	9801
28512644	Based on the clinical manifestation of erysipelas, the subjects were also grouped based on the form of the infection into having erythematous form—33 patients (46.5%), and bullous form—38 patients (53.5%), of the disease.	9802	10023
28512644	Erysipelas patients were also divided based on the localization of infection.	10024	10101
28512644	The majority of patients were having infection on the lower limbs (83.1%), followed by the face (12.7%), and, least of all, on the upper limbs (4.2%).	10102	10252
28512644	Additionally, a higher proportion of male patients had facial localization of the infection when compared to that of females (5 patients; 21.7% versus 4 patients; 8.3%).	10253	10422
28512644	There were no significant differences between men and women having infection on the limbs.	10423	10513
28512644	From the observed results, we suggest that erysipelas has a higher chance to develop the severe form of erysipelas in females than in males.	10514	10654
28512644	Also, more significantly higher number of female adults are prone to have the recurrent form of the infection than that of male adults but a higher proportion of males are prone to having erysipelas on their faces than that of females.	10655	10890
28512644	Association analysis revealed significantly higher predisposition to erysipelas in patients with G/G genotype (OR = 10.63, 95% CI = 4.45–25.40, p < 0.0001) as compared to patients with A/A or A/G genotype.	10891	11096
28512644	When the G/G genotype was compared to combined G/A and A/A genotypes, the association with erysipelas was still significant (OR = 8.79, 95% CI = 3.76–20.56, p < 0.0001) in patients with G/G genotype (Table 2).	11097	11306
28512644	These results suggest that individuals with the G/G genotype are predisposed to erysipelas as compared to other genotypes.	11307	11429
28512644	An association was found between SOD2 C2734T SNP and the risk of erysipelas (Table 3).	11430	11516
28512644	The T/T and C/T genotypes had a significant association with erysipelas.	11517	11589
28512644	The T/T genotype had the highest predisposition to erysipelas (OR = 8.33, 95% CI = 2.44–28.41, p < 0.0007), followed by the C/T genotype (OR = 5.55, 95% CI = 1.98–15.55, p < 0.0011), and then the C/C genotype (OR = 1).	11590	11808
28512644	It appears that the presence of a T allele (in T/T and C/T) increases the predisposition to erysipelas (OR = 6.19, 95% CI = 2.28–16.84, p < 0.0004) than that of C/C genotype.	11809	11983
28512644	There was a lack of predisposition to erysipelas in SOD2 T/T genotype (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 0.93–5.72, p < 0.0724) when compared to the C/T and C/C genotypes combined (Table 3).	11984	12159
28512644	Our data suggest that individuals with the T allele (homozygous T/T or heterozygous C/T genotype) have a higher predisposition to erysipelas as compared to those with C/C genotype.	12160	12340
28512644	The frequency of the SOD2 C60T SNP allele and genotype distribution in the erysipelas patients and controls were not significantly different (Table 4).	12341	12492
28512644	Therefore, we conclude that the SNP SOD2 C60T has a limited effect on the predisposition to erysipelas.	12493	12596
28512644	When analyzed individually, no association between genotypes C/C, C/T, and T/T and predisposition to erysipelas was found.	12597	12719
28512644	However, when the predisposition was compared between patients with C/C genotype against those with T/T and C/T genotypes together, a significantly higher frequency of erysipelas was found in patients with C/C genotype (OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.24–5.38, p < 0.01) than in those with T/T and C/T genotypes combined (Table 5).	12720	13041
28512644	Also, analysis revealed a lack of predisposition to erysipelas when patients with T/T genotype were compared to those with C/C and C/T genotypes.	13042	13187
28512644	We conclude that the C/C genotype of CAT C262T may be linked to a higher predisposition to erysipelas than the C/T and T/T genotypes.	13188	13321
28512644	The subjects were grouped based on gender, multiplicity of infection, lesion location, severity of the disease, and form of infection (Table 6).	13322	13466
28512644	There were lack of differences in the distribution of SOD1 (G7958A), SOD2 (T2734C), SOD2 (C60T), and CAT (C262T) SNPs in subjects with erysipelas based on gender, multiplicity, and severity of the disease (p > 0.05).	13467	13683
28512644	However, when SNPs were analyzed based on the form of erysipelas, a significant difference (p < 0.001) in frequency of SOD2 (T2734C) was found between the bullous and erythematous forms of erysipelas.	13684	13884
28512644	There was a higher frequency of C allele in patients with erythematous erysipelas (48 patients—33.8%) as compared to that in patients with bullous form (37 patients—26.1%).	13885	14057
28512644	In contrast, the frequency of patients with the erythematous form having the T allele was lower (18 patients—12.7%) than that in the patients with bullous form (39 patients—27.5%).	14058	14238
28512644	Therefore, we concluded that the presence of C allele could define development of erythematous form of the disease, while T allele delineates bullous erysipelas.	14239	14400
28512644	There were no differences in the distribution of the SOD1 (G7958A), SOD2 (C60T), and CAT (C262T) SNPs between patients diagnosed with erythematous and bullous forms.	14401	14566
28512644	Next, SNPs were analyzed based on the localization of erysipelas: the lower limbs, face, or the upper limbs (Table 6).	14567	14685
28512644	We observed an association between SOD1 (G7958A) and localization of infection, where higher proportion of G/A and A/A genotypes was found in patients who had erysipelas on the upper limb, (p = 0.041).	14686	14887
28512644	Conversely, a higher number of patients with the G/G genotype had the infection predominantly on the lower limbs.	14888	15001
28512644	There was a lack of the association between the erysipelas location and SOD2 (T2734C), SOD2 (C60T), or CAT (C-262T) genotypes (Table 6).	15002	15138
28512644	All cytokines analyzed in the erysipelas patients and control group were divided into four based on their expression levels during the acute phase and convalescent phase of the infection compared to their expression levels in the control group (Table 7).	15139	15393
28512644	Group 1 consists of IL-1β, CCL11, IL-2Rα, HGF, CXCL9, and TRAIL.	15394	15458
28512644	Serum level of these cytokines was significantly higher during the acute phase of the infection in the controls (p < 0.05).	15459	15582
28512644	There was a lack of differences in these cytokine levels during the convalescent phase as compared to the controls (p > 0.05).	15583	15709
28512644	Group 2 included IL-7, IL-8, PDGF-BB, CCL4, and CXCL12 cytokines.	15710	15775
28512644	Serum level of these cytokines did not differ in the acute phase of the disease when compared to the controls (p > 0.05); however, these cytokine levels differed significantly in the convalescent phase of erysipelas as compared to the controls (p < 0.05).	15776	16031
28512644	The values of IL-7, IL-8, and PDGF-BB in patients were higher in the convalescent phase of the disease than those in controls.	16032	16158
28512644	Interestingly, the serum level of CCL4 and CXCL12 was higher in the acute phase of the disease as compared to that in the convalescent phase.	16159	16300
28512644	Group 3 contained IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL10, VEGF, MIF, SCF, and SCGF-β cytokines, which differed significantly in the acute phase and as well in the convalescent phase of the disease when compared to values in the control group (p < 0.05).	16301	16595
28512644	Finally, group 4 included IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-16, IL-18, CCL5, CCL7, CCL27, CXCL1, FGF, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, TRAIL, and β-NGF.	16596	16757
28512644	Serum level of these cytokines remained unchanged during the course of the disease and was similar to that in the controls (p > 0.05).	16758	16892
28512644	Since serum level of cytokines in groups 1 and 2 differed depending on the phase of the disease, we concluded that changes in these cytokines could be related to the disease pathology.	16893	17077
28512644	Therefore, we focused our analysis on these cytokines.	17078	17132
28512644	From cytokines in group 1, we found that the amount of reduction in values of IL1-β, CCL11, IL-2Rα, CXCL9, and TRAIL from the acute phase to the convalescent phase was significantly similar in all the patients (K > 0.4).	17133	17353
28512644	In group 2 cytokines, similar changes of serum levels of cytokines PDGF-BB and CCL4 from the acute phase to the convalescent phase were observed in all the patients (K > 0.4).	17354	17529
28512644	Although the change was a similar reduction from the acute phase in CCL4, serum levels of PDGF-BB were on an average higher during the convalescent phase than the acute phase.	17530	17705
28512644	Other cytokines of groups 1 and 2 did not express a similar change in values among the patients (K < 0.4).	17706	17812
28512644	Therefore, we suggest that serum level of IL1-β, CCL11, IL-2Rα, CXCL9, TRAIL, PDGF-BB, and CCL4 could serve as markers of clinical symptoms associated to erysipelas infection.	17813	17988
28512644	Since serum levels of group 3 cytokines in the patients differed from the values observed in the controls during the acute phase and also in the convalescent phase, we could suggest that these cytokines are associated to the predisposition of erysipelas and possible recurrence of the infection.	17989	18284
28512644	Serum levels of IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, and VEGFr expressed a similar change in values among the patients (K > 0.4) with the values of IL-6, IL-13, and G-CSF having a similar decrease in the patients from the acute phase to the convalescent phase; VEGFr is maintaining a similar level in the acute and convalescent phases, and IL-9, IL-10, IL-15, and IL-17 expressing a similar value increase from the acute phase to the convalescent phase.	18285	18748
28512644	Other cytokines of group 3 did not express a similar change in value between the acute phase and the convalescent phase.	18749	18869
28512644	Cytokines in group 4 did not differ significantly in values between the patients and the controls, but a similar reduction in value from the acute phase to the convalescent phase in the patients was observed in FGF (K = 0.79), while a similar increase in value from the acute phase to the convalescent phase was observed in TNF-α (K = 0.83) and CCL27 (K = 0.43).	18870	19232
28512644	Serum cytokines were analyzed in 50 erysipelas patients and 26 relatively healthy (control) individuals.	19233	19337
28512644	Two serum samples were collected from each erysipelas case at the time of the admission (acute phase) and the time of discharge (convalescent phase).	19338	19487
28512644	Erysipelas patients were grouped based on the identified SNPs in SOD T2734C and CAT C262T.	19488	19578
28512644	Correlation between serum cytokines and SOD C60T was not analyzed since there was a lack of predisposition between this SNP and erysipelas.	19579	19718
28512644	Also, the SOD 1 G7958A SNP correlation with serum cytokines was not analyzed due to a lack of control individuals with the A/A genotype.	19719	19855
28512644	The frequency of C/C and C/T genotypes within the 50 erysipelas patients was 25 (50%) and 25 (50%), respectively, while in controls, genotype distribution was 6 (25%) and 18 (75%), respectively.	19856	20050
28512644	Significant differences in the cytokine values when compared to the genotypes of CAT C262T were observed only in PDGF-BB and CCL2.	20051	20181
28512644	Cytokine analysis revealed increased PDGF-BB level in serums of patients with C/T genotype (in the acute and convalescent phases) compared to that with controls (p = 0.045) (Table 8).	20182	20365
28512644	Serum levels of CCL2 were significantly lower in the acute (p = 0.02) and the convalescent phases (p = 0.018) in patients with the CC genotype than in controls (Table 8).	20366	20536
28512644	Distribution of C/C, C/T, and T/T alleles within the 50 erysipelas patients was 9 (18%), 38 (76%), and 3 (6%), respectively.	20537	20661
28512644	The values observed in the 26 controls were 4 (15.4%), 17 (65.4%), and 5 (19.2%), respectively.	20662	20757
28512644	Although IL-1β level was elevated in the serum of erysipelas with T/T genotype as compared to the controls, differences in IL-1β levels were not significant between the acute and convalescent phases in the patients.	20758	20973
28512644	There was a T allele dependency on IL-7, IL-8, IL-17, and CCL5 serum level in the patients during the acute phase of the infection.	20974	21105
28512644	Interestingly, only HFG serum level was associated with the presence of C/C genotype in the erysipelas patients (Table 9).	21106	21228
28512644	Erysipelas is a superficial skin infection with its etiology often linked to group A streptococci (GAS).	21229	21333
28512644	The skin of the infected portion is often red, swollen, soft to the touch, and with clearly visible boundaries.	21334	21445
28512644	Associated clinical symptoms may vary depending on the form of the infection, but typical symptoms could include fever, chills, malaise, and sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting.	21446	21632
28512644	A major problem of erysipelas to clinicians is its recurrence, which occurs in 8 to 23 percent of cases.	21633	21737
28512644	Erysipelas is mostly affected but restricted to the elderly; it has also been observed in younger people.	21738	21843
28512644	Our observed age distribution of the study group could be on one hand related to the fact that more elderly than younger people with erysipelas are prone to seeking medical care or that the elderly are at a greater risk.	21844	22064
28512644	Other research had also observed a similar distribution in the age of their studied group [18, 20].	22065	22164
28512644	Our study, which was restricted to people who could be categorized as elderly, showed that there was a sex dependence on the recurrence and severity of the infection with more elderly females having more of the recurrent and severe forms of the infection.	22165	22420
28512644	The elderly female predisposition to recurrence could be associated to treatment or the presence of other ailments such as post breast cancer treatment, osteoporosis, and vaginal colonization of related microbes.	22421	22633
28512644	Gender-associated differences in the susceptibility to erysipelas could also be attributed to hormonal variations between male and female as has been previously shown by Bellanti et al.. Our observation also revealed that a higher proportion of male patients had facial localization of the infection when compared to that of females.	22634	22967
28512644	To date, our knowledge on SOD1 G7958A significance is limited to Yi et al. data presenting the association between the mutant allele (A) and increased expression of SOD1 mRNA, while the presence of the wild type (G) was related to reduced gene transcription and consequent increase and accumulation of free radicals in the cells.	22968	23297
28512644	Our data corroborates this observation, as a significant association was demonstrated between G allele of SOD1 G7958A and predisposition to erysipelas.	23298	23449
28512644	We propose that the presence of G allele reduces transcription of SOD1 gene leading to decreased protein synthesis of the SOD1 enzyme.	23450	23584
28512644	As a result, oxidative stress could develop leading to reduced antibacterial defense.	23585	23670
28512644	Another finding showed that a dysfunctional or reduction in SOD1 expression favored the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza virus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [27, 28].	23671	23839
28512644	In another research, an in vitro model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis showed that cells transfected with the mutant SOD1 were more vulnerable to infectious stimuli of the bacteria than cells overexpressing normal SOD1.	23840	24060
28512644	We observed an association between SOD1 (G7958A) and localization of infection, where higher proportion of G/A and A/A genotypes were found in patients who had erysipelas on the upper limb.	24061	24250
28512644	Conversely, a higher number of patients with the G/G genotype had the infection predominantly on the lower limbs.	14888	15001
28512644	This differential distribution of the infection relative to SNP cannot be explained at the moment but needs to be studied.	24365	24487
28512644	The SOD2 C2734T polymorphism was shown to cause an amino acid substitution from leucine to phenylalanine at codon 84 of the SOD2 gene.	24488	24622
28512644	Our data provides evidence suggesting this SOD2 substitution of leucine to phenylalanine increases susceptibility to erysipelas and was linked to the more severe bullous form of the infection.	24623	24815
28512644	It was proposed that due to this substitution, the produced protein subunits fail to properly interact, causing reduction of SOD2 activity and accumulation of free radicals in vitro.	24816	24998
28512644	Not much data is available about the role of the SOD2 C2734T, but an earlier research had showed that the SNP influenced susceptibility to vitiligo, a skin phenomenon characterized by long-term patches on the skin and loss of skin colour.	24999	25237
28512644	Other studies had shown that a dysfunctional SOD2 is positively associated with cardiovascular disease risk, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and different forms of cancers [36–38].	25238	25415
28512644	The C to T substitution in the 60th amino acid position of the SOD2 leads to an alanine to valine substitution.	25416	25527
28512644	Our data demonstrated lack of association between the SOD2 C60T SNP and predisposition to erysipelas.	25528	25629
28512644	Therefore, we suggest that SOD2 C60T SNP has limited role in pathogenesis of erysipelas.	25630	25718
28512644	The CAT C262T SNP is located in the promoter region regulating gene transcriptional activity.	25719	25812
28512644	It has been shown that the C allele of CAT causes reduction of the transcriptional activity as compared to the T allele.	25813	25933
28512644	Additionally, C262C genotype of CAT was shown to produce more single-strand DNA breaks than C/T and T/T genotypes.	25934	26048
28512644	Our data demonstrate that erysipelas patients with the C allele have a higher risk of developing erysipelas.	26049	26157
28512644	We believe that patients with C262C genotype have lower CAT activity, which can cause accumulation of free radicals and oxidative stress.	26158	26295
28512644	The association between the CAT C262T SNP was found to have an effect on the predisposition to male infertility, Shigella flexneri-related infection, asbestosis, vitiligo, and cancer although it remains highly contradictory and inconclusive.	26296	26537
28512644	Our data suggest that IL1-β, IL-2Rα, CCL4, CCL11, CXCL9, TRAIL, IL-1 β, and PDGF-BB cytokines could be linked to the clinical symptoms displayed during erysipelas infection.	26538	26711
28512644	We have found that serum cytokine levels of these cytokines change during the course of the disease.	26712	26812
28512644	The values of these cytokines during the acute phase in the patients significantly differed from that in the controls.	26813	26931
28512644	However, during the convalescent phase, these cytokine levels returned to levels similar to that found in the controls.	26932	27051
28512644	We also suggest that IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, and VEGF could play a role in the clinical patterns and susceptibility of erysipelas infection.	27052	27215
28512644	This suggestion was based on our finding that serum levels of cytokines in the acute and convalescent phases of the infection significantly differed from values observed in the controls.	27216	27402
28512644	More research is however suggested to be able to draw out a more direct link between these cytokines and erysipelas infection.	27403	27529
28512644	Activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β is a hallmark of bacterial infections that is crucial for host-defense responses to infection and injury [10, 44].	27530	27698
28512644	The T allele of SOD2 C2734T was shown to be associated with decreased antioxidant capacity in the mitochondria and, subsequently, an increased oxidative stress.	27699	27859
28512644	Our results show that increased serum IL1-β level in erysipelas patients is the T allele of SOD2 SNP C2734T dependent.	27860	27978
28512644	Based on these observations, we propose that the T allele of SOD2 C2734T could trigger the upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, which would in turn attempt to stimulate the production of a functional SOD2 production which is downregulated in individuals with the T allele.	27979	28273
28512644	This assumption is supported by our observation that serum IL-1β levels were higher in erysipelas patients homozygous for T allele than in patients with the heterozygous form.	28274	28449
28512644	Therefore, we believe that serum levels of IL-1β could serve as a surrogate marker for predisposition to erysipelas and impaired antioxydase system.	28450	28598
28512644	More study into the role of antioxydase system in erysipelas will help to understand the mechanisms of cytokine activation and their role in disease pathogenesis.	28599	28761
28512644	IL-7 regulates the development of T cells, enhances cytolytic T lymphocyte activity, and induces lymphokine-activated killer cells [45, 46].	28762	28902
28512644	Bacterial invasion induces IL-7 expression in T cells.	28903	28957
28512644	The role of IL-7 in oxidative stress remains largely unknown.	28958	29019
28512644	However, studies suggest that IL-7 could be upregulated in patients with increased mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress [48, 49].	29020	29156
28512644	Our observation supports the notion that decreased mitochondrial activity is associated with upregulation IL-7.	29157	29268
28512644	We have found upregulated serum IL-7 in patients with SNP in SOD2 suggesting decreased mitochondrial activity and increased ROS formation.	29269	29407
28512644	IL-8 is a chemoattractant for inflammatory leukocytes.	29408	29462
28512644	We found increased IL-8 in patients with the T allele of SOD2 C2734T that causes a decreased antioxidant activity.	29463	29577
28512644	This observation supports previous observations which showed that IL-8 gene expression can be upregulated by free radicals, while antioxidants reduce the cytokine transcription.	29578	29755
28512644	We propose that infection could trigger oxidative stress and subsequently IL-8 production.	29756	29846
28512644	These would exacerbate the generation of the reactive oxygen species and, when combined with decreased SOD2 activity, lead to perpetuate upregulation of IL-8.	29847	30005
28512644	The cytokine IL-17 is known to recruit leukocytes such as neutrophils to the site of infection thus aiding in the host's defense mechanism against extracellular bacteria.	30006	30176
28512644	IL-17 also induces neutrophilic release of antimicrobial substances and ROS.	30177	30253
28512644	Our observation supports this observation as high IL-17 values were associated to the TT genotype of SOD2 C2734T and thus elevated oxidative stress.	30254	30402
28512644	CCL5 plays an active role in recruiting leukocytes and natural killer cells into inflammatory sites.	30403	30503
28512644	A strong positive association between CCL5, ROS generation, and systemic lupus erythematosus had earlier been observed.	30504	30623
28512644	Our observation linked the high levels of expressed CCL5 in erysipelas patients who were linked to the homozygous T genotype in SOD2 C2734T SNP.	30624	30768
28512644	Interestingly, we have found increased serum level of HGF in erysipelas with C/C genotype of SOD2 C2734T.	30769	30874
28512644	The C/C genotype is associated with the production of the functional SOD2 protein.	30875	30957
28512644	Therefore, we suggest that expression of functional SOD2 protein, which is associated with properly functioning antioxidant, is linked to normal cell growth and differentiation.	30958	31135
28512644	Our conclusion corroborates Borawski et al. data showing increased HGF in individuals with properly functioning SOD.	31136	31252
28512644	PDGF-BB is known for its participation in cell growth and differentiation.	31253	31327
28512644	The mitogenic stimulus function of PDGF was shown to be mediated via ROS to activate cell proliferation.	31328	31432
28512644	Our research showed that while elevated values of PDGF-BB was observed in the erysipelas patients with the C/T genotype of CAT C262T during the acute phase and convalescent phase, the elevated value of PDGF-BB was observed in the patients with the C/C genotype only during the acute phase of the infection.	31433	31739
28512644	As mentioned earlier, the C allele of CAT C262T was considered poorly functional and contributed to the predisposition of erysipelas.	31740	31873
28512644	We propose that the functional T allele of CAT C262T contributed to maintaining high PDGF-BB values during the convalescent stage of the infection.	31874	32021
28512644	Thus, the PDGF-BB-mediated T allele of CAT C262T aided in cell growth and differentiation to replace the erysipelas damaged cells.	32022	32152
28512644	CCL2 otherwise known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been demonstrated to mediate the migration of monocytes from the blood stream across the vascular endothelium for routine immunological surveillance of tissues, as well as in response to inflammation.	32153	32424
28512644	The cytokine values of CCL2 were observed to be significantly lower in erysipelas patients with the C/C genotype of CAT C262T than in the individual in the control group with the C/C genotype.	32425	32617
28512644	Values of the cytokine in patients with the C/T genotype were not significantly different from the values in the individuals of the control group with the C/T genotype.	32618	32786
28512644	These observations lead us to propose that the C allele of CAT C262T which has been earlier shown to code for a poorly functioning catalase and higher predisposition to erysipelas is linked to low functioning of CCL2, thus hampering immunological surveillance of tissues in erysipelas patients.	32787	33081
28512644	Our research has been able to demonstrate that erysipelas infection predisposition and its clinical characteristics are affected by age, sex, and SNPs found in SOD1, SOD2, and catalase genes.	33082	33273
28512644	These SNPs have an influence on an array of cytokines whose values were found to be different from values found in individuals not suffering from erysipelas.	33274	33431
28777492	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is usually associated with a very poor prognosis.1 Given the increase in non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis and imminent disappearance of chronic viral hepatitis, hepatosteatosis is a major risk factor for HCC.2 Although a causal relationship between chronic damage, inflammation and carcinogenesis has been widely recognized, the exact molecular mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be elucidated.	0	529
28777492	Hepatic progenitor cells are bipotential cells residing in normal liver and are thought to be implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis.3 A stem cell marker Bmi1 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, tumorigenesis and tumor progression.4, 5 Bmi1 is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene in several human malignancies, including HCC.6, 7 The expression of another “stemness”‐related marker epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in HCC is associated with an aggressive biological behavior and poor clinical outcome.8 In chronic inflammation, inflammatory signaling is important for the dedifferentiation and expansion of tumor‐initiating cells.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Gankyrin (also named p28GANK or PSMD10) is commonly overexpressed in human cancers.15, 16 In our previous study, we used a conditional gankyrin “floxed” (gankyrin f/f) strain to generate Villin‐Cre;gankyrin f/f and Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice lacking gankyrin in intestinal epithelial cells and inflammatory cells to assess the role of gankyrin in the development of colorectal cancer.12 We found that gankyrin promoted the development of inflammation‐induced colorectal cancer.	530	1705
28777492	We now describe that gankyrin enhances signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, interleukin (IL)‐6 production and subsequent hepatocarcinogenesis in mice exposed to the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN).	1706	1941
28777492	Gankyrin upregulates the expression of stem cell markers in tumors.	1942	2009
28777492	In addition, gankyrin expression in human non‐parenchymal cells is inversely correlated with progression free survival (PFS) in HCC patients treated with sorafenib, suggesting that gankyrin expression may be considered as a new biomarker to predict the likelihood of response to sorafenib.	2010	2299
28777492	Gankyrin f/f mice were crossed with Alb‐Cre and Mx1‐Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) to generate Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f and Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice, respectively.12 Induction of Mx1‐Cre was achieved with three intraperitoneal injections of 300 μg poly(I:C) (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) every other day to 4–8‐week‐old mice.	2300	2651
28777492	All mice were maintained in the C57BL/6 background in filter‐topped cages at Kindai University.	2652	2747
28777492	Male mice (2‐week old) were injected intraperitoneally with 25 mg/kg DEN (Sigma).	2748	2829
28777492	After 8 months on normal chow, mice were killed and analyzed for the presence of HCC.	2830	2915
28777492	To examine the effect of gankyrin in non‐parenchymal cells, we performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiments.	2916	3035
28777492	Because only 30% of Kupffer cells are reconstituted by donor‐derived bone marrow cells 6 months after BMT,17 we gave mice an intravenous injection of liposomal clodronate (200 uL intravenously) before irradiation to deplete Kupffer cells and accelerate macrophage turnover.18 We then flushed the tibias and femurs of donor mice to obtain bone marrow.	3036	3386
28777492	We injected 1 × 107 bone marrow cells into the tail veins of lethally irradiated (11 Gy) recipient mice.	3387	3491
28777492	Six weeks after BMT, mice were injected intraperitoneally with DEN (100 mg/kg).	3492	3571
28777492	Four hours after DEN injection, mice were killed and their livers were removed.	3572	3651
28777492	All animal procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Kindai University Faculty of Medicine and Institutional Animal Care and in accordance with the recommendations for proper care and use of laboratory animals.	3652	3913
28777492	Real‐time quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed as previously described.12, 19, 20 The following antibodies were purchased: anti‐actin and anti‐PSMD10 (gankyrin) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA); anti‐Ki67, anti‐STAT3, anti‐phospho‐STAT3, anti‐extracellular signal‐regulated kinases (ERK), anti‐phospho‐ERK, anti‐p38 and anti‐phospho‐p38 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA); and anti‐Src homology 2 domain‐containing protein tyrosine phosphatase‐1 (SHP‐1) from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).	3914	4454
28777492	Anti‐gankyrin antibody was described previously.16 Immunohistochemistry was performed using ImmPRESS reagents (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.	4455	4654
28777492	Immunofluorescent TUNEL staining was performed to measure apoptosis in paraffin‐embedded sections using the In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit, as described by the manufacturer (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and previous reports.12, 21 Nuclei were stained with 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole.	4655	4935
28777492	Duolink fluorescence method was employed to study the interaction between gankyrin and SHP‐1, as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma Aldrich).	4936	5088
28777492	The interaction of gankyrin with SHP‐1 was assessed under a confocal laser microscope using antibodies against human gankyrin and SHP‐1.	5089	5225
28777492	THP‐1 cells and Mono Mac 6 cells, an immortalized line of human monocyte, were maintained in RPMI‐1640 medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, containing penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and transfection of gankyrin siRNA (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) was carried out using X‐treme GENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).	5226	5607
28777492	To evaluate gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment, we assessed the expression in tumor‐infiltrating cells and non‐tumor cells at the invasive front of the HCC samples by immunohistochemistry.	5608	5811
28777492	The evaluation of gankyrin was performed at high magnification (×100) on the tumor material obtained before receiving sorafenib treatment.	5812	5950
28777492	The staining status was obtained by calculating the intensity × extensity score (gankyrin expression score) as described previously.22 Intensity of the staining was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak) or 2 (strong).	5951	6163
28777492	Extensity of the staining was scored as 0 (1%–5% of non‐tumor cells), 1 (6%–30%), 2 (3%–70%) or 3 (71%–100%).	6164	6273
28777492	To calculate the intensity × extensity score (gankyrin expression score) of non‐tumor cells of the HCC samples, five fields were selected at the invasive front as well as within tumors and the average of five fields (magnification 100 × ) was used to determine the score.	6274	6545
28777492	Scoring was performed in a blinded fashion by two investigators (T. S. and N.	6546	6623
28777492	Y.).	6624	6628
28777492	Samples were considered high expression for gankyrin if the intensity × extensity score (gankyrin expression score) was more than a median value.	6629	6774
28777492	The gankyrin expression score was evaluated in tumor cells as well.	6775	6842
28777492	From May 2009 to June 2010, 38 patients with refractory HCC uncontrolled with standard therapeutic modalities received sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals‐Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Leverkusen, Germany) at Kindai University.	6843	7079
28777492	All pathological specimens of HCC were collected using needle biopsy before sorafenib treatment.	7080	7176
28777492	Demographic profiles of patients were previously described.21 In addition, liver specimens were collected with needle biopsy in 13 patients who were clinically suspected of non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis.	7177	7380
28777492	The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review boards.	7381	7524
28777492	Written informed consent was obtained from all patients for subsequent use of their resected tissues.	7525	7626
28777492	The eligibility criteria for sorafenib therapy were previously described.16 Sorafenib was administered orally at a daily dose of 800 mg divided into two equal doses.	7627	7792
28777492	Treatment interruptions and up to two dose reductions (first to 400 mg once daily, followed by 400 mg every 2 days) were permitted for drug‐related adverse effects (National Cancer Institute‐Common Terminology Criteria [NCI‐CTC, version 3]).	7793	8034
28777492	Treatment was continued until the occurrence of radiologic progression, as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, Version1.1).	8035	8191
28777492	Data are presented as means ± SEM.	8192	8226
28777492	Statistical differences between groups were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test or Student's t‐test.	8227	8330
28777492	A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.	8331	8392
28777492	We previously generated Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice by crossing gankyrin f/f mice with Mx1‐Cre mice.	8393	8491
28777492	Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice exhibited gankyrin deletion both in parenchymal cells and non‐parenchymal cells of the liver (Fig.	8492	8616
28777492	1a and Fig.	8617	8628
28777492	S1).12 Histomorphology and serum levels of ALT revealed no apparent liver dysfunction in Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice.	8629	8744
28777492	The strain failed to exhibit spontaneous liver tumors up to 1 year of age.	8745	8819
28777492	However, DEN injection on postnatal day 1423 induced well‐differentiated HCC in all gankyrin f/f and Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice (Fig.	8820	8952
28777492	S2a).	8953	8958
28777492	Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice showed gankyrin deletion both in tumor cells and non‐parenchymal cells (Fig.	8959	9061
28777492	1a).	9062	9066
28777492	In comparison to gankyrin f/f controls, Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice exhibited reduced HCC multiplicity and size (Fig.	9067	9182
28777492	1b–d).	9183	9189
28777492	HCC isolated from Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice exhibited reduced expression of IL‐6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Fig.	9190	9322
28777492	1e).	9323	9327
28777492	Kupffer cell is a major source of IL‐6 production in the liver.24 Therefore, we purified Kupffer cells from Mxl‐Cre;GK f/f mice and examined whether gankyrin in Kupffer cells affect IL‐6 production.	9328	9526
28777492	We found that gankyrin deletion reduced IL‐6 expression in Kupffer cells (Fig.	9527	9605
28777492	S2b).	9606	9611
28777492	Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of VEGF was reduced in tumor cells of Mxl‐Cre;GK f/f mice compared with control mice (Fig.	9612	9746
28777492	S2c).	9747	9752
28777492	Gankyrin deficiency would downregulate the expression of IL‐6 in Kupffer cells and that of VEGF in tumor cells.	9753	9864
28777492	Thus, the deletion of gankyrin both in parenchymal and non‐parenchymal cells inhibited hepatocarcinogenesis.	9865	9973
28777492	We evaluated the role of gankyrin in HCC development in the liver parenchymal cells.	9974	10058
28777492	Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice were generated by crossing gankyrin f/f mice with Alb‐Cre mice.	10059	10148
28777492	Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice were negative for gankyrin only in liver parenchymal cells (Fig.	10149	10239
28777492	1a and Fig.	8617	8628
28777492	S1b).12 Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f progeny obtained in the expected Mendelian ratio was healthy and failed to show any apparent liver dysfunction.	10252	10392
28777492	The strain showed no spontaneous liver tumors up to 1 year of age.	10393	10459
28777492	All gankyrin f/f and Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice challenged with DEN developed well‐differentiated HCC (Fig.	10460	10566
28777492	S2a).	8953	8958
28777492	Gankyrin deficiency in liver parenchymal cells reduced HCC size but not HCC number (Fig.	10573	10661
28777492	2a–c).	10662	10668
28777492	Furthermore, the deletion of gankyrin in tumor cells reduced the expression of VEGF but not IL‐6 (Fig.	10669	10771
28777492	2d).	10772	10776
28777492	Several studies report that gankyrin promotes proliferation of cancer cells through the inhibition of apoptosis and cell cycle progression in vitro.15, 25, 26 We assessed the effect of gankyrin on cell death and proliferation in vivo. Gankyrin deletion exhibited no significant reduction in apoptosis and proliferation of tumors, as assessed by TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry using anti‐Ki67 antibody, respectively (Fig.	10777	11203
28777492	S3a,b).	11204	11211
28777492	Gankyrin deletion affected neither the protein levels of p53 and RB1 nor the mRNA levels of their target genes (Fig.	11212	11328
28777492	3a and Fig.	11329	11340
28777492	S3c).	11341	11346
28777492	Next, we examined the differentiation status of HCC obtained from gankyrin f/f, Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f and Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice.	11347	11478
28777492	Analysis of H&E‐stained HCC sections did not show any difference in the differentiation status among these strains (Fig.	11479	11599
28777492	S2a).	8953	8958
28777492	Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a multistep biological process whereby epithelial cells change in plasticity by transient de‐differentiation into a mesenchymal phenotype.	11606	11790
28777492	Gankyrin overexpression was reported to exhibit EMT phenotype, including loss of the epithelial marker E‐cadherin and gain of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in cell lines.27 However, gankyrin deficiency did not show significant difference in expression of EMT‐related genes (Fig.	11791	12071
28777492	S4a,b).	12072	12079
28777492	Studies have shown that STAT3 plays a critical role in HCC development.24, 28 We examined the consequences of gankyrin deletion on several signaling pathways in liver parenchymal and non‐parenchymal cells.	12080	12285
28777492	Gankyrin deletion significantly reduced the expression of phosphorylated STAT3 in tumors, and slightly reduced the expression in non‐tumor liver tissues (Fig.	12286	12444
28777492	3a).	12445	12449
28777492	Gankyrin‐induced pro‐inflammatory response enhances the activation of ERK in colorectal tumors.12 This is in line with our result, wherein gankyrin deletion in non‐parenchymal cells reduced ERK activity in HCC (Fig.	12450	12665
28777492	3a).	12445	12449
28777492	Previous studies have described a critical role of c‐Jun and c‐Jun N‐terminal kinases (JNK) in the development of HCC.20, 21, 29 We observed no effect of gankyrin deficiency on JNK activity (Fig.	12671	12866
28777492	S5a).	12867	12872
28777492	SHP‐1, a well‐known inhibitor of activation‐promoting signaling cascades, negatively regulates signaling by STAT3 dephosphorylation.12, 30 The Duolink Assay showed the interaction between gankyrin and SHP‐1 as red punctate dots in liver tumors (Fig.	12873	13122
28777492	3b and Fig.	13123	13134
28777492	S6), suggestive of STAT3 activation following gankyrin/SHP‐1 interaction in non‐parenchymal cells where SHP‐1 was predominantly expressed (Fig.	13135	13278
28777492	3c).	11342	11346
28777492	HCC isolated from Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice exhibited reduced expression of IL‐6, a downstream molecule of STAT3.	13284	13397
28777492	To confirm the effect of gankyrin in non‐parenchymal cells, we performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiments.	13398	13517
28777492	Six weeks after BMT, mice were injected intraperitoneally with DEN (100 mg/kg).	3492	3571
28777492	Four hours after DEN injection, mice were killed and their livers were removed.	3572	3651
28777492	GK f/f mice rescued with gankyrin‐deficient bone marrow exhibited a reduced expression of phosphorylated STAT3 and IL‐6 compared with those rescued with wild‐type bone marrow (Fig.	13678	13858
28777492	3e and Fig.	13859	13870
28777492	S7).	13871	13875
28777492	In addition, no difference in IL‐6 expression and STAT3 activity was found between Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice and gankyrin f/f controls (Fig.	13876	14016
28777492	2d and Fig.	14017	14028
28777492	S5b).	14029	14034
28777492	Given that IL‐6 produced by non‐parenchymal cells activates the transcription factor STAT3 in the liver,24 the decrease in IL‐6 production in gankyrin‐deficient inflammatory cells may lead to reduced STAT3 activity in tumor cells through a paracrine mechanism.	14035	14295
28777492	Indeed, immunohistochemistry results showed that the STAT3 activity in tumor cells as well as non‐parenchymal cells of Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice was reduced as compared to that in gankyrin f/f controls (Fig.	14296	14503
28777492	3d).	14504	14508
28777492	These data indicate that gankyrin in non‐parenchymal cells plays a crucial role in the regulation of STAT3/IL‐6 signaling, which is critical for DEN‐induced hepatocarcinogenesis.24 Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 is essential for the expansion of liver cancer stem cell.11, 12, 28 Inflammatory cytokines such as IL‐6 are important for the dedifferentiation and generation of tumor‐initiating cells.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 HCC isolated from Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice, but not Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice, exhibited decrease in the expression of stem cell markers Bmi1 and EpCAM as compared to those from controls (Fig.	14509	15141
28777492	1e and 2d).	15142	15153
28777492	Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of Bmi1 was reduced in tumor cells of Mxl‐Cre;GK f/f mice compared with control mice (Fig.	15154	15288
28777492	S8).	15289	15293
28777492	Taken together, gankyrin in non‐parenchymal cells may control STAT3 signaling and stem cell expansion within the tumor microenvironment.	15294	15430
28777492	Gankyrin accelerates proteasomal degradation of RB.15 Recently, we reported that gankyrin knockdown reduced STAT3 activities in a myeloid cell line.15 To investigate whether the gankyrin‐mediated STAT3 activation depends on degradation of SHP‐1 protein, we examined the protein expression level of SHP‐1 in the myeloid cell line.	15431	15760
28777492	Gankyrin knockdown did not affect the protein level of SHP‐1 (Fig.	15761	15827
28777492	S9a), suggesting that gankyrin activates STAT3 by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of SHP‐1, but not by accelerating the degradation of SHP‐1.	15828	15973
28777492	Gankyrin knockdown decreased the mRNA level of SHP‐1 in THP‐1 cells (Fig.	15974	16047
28777492	S9b).	16048	16053
28777492	Given that gankyrin knockdown did not affect the protein level of SHP‐1, gankyrin might be involved in degradation of SHP‐1, but it is not the mechanism by which gankyrin activates STAT3.	16054	16241
28777492	In myeloid cell lines, Mono Mac 6 cells and THP‐1 cells, gankyrin knockdown decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 and the expression of downstream target genes Pim1 and Mcl‐1 (Fig.	16242	16423
28777492	S9b,c).12 In our previous study, we showed that longstanding intestinal inflammation increases the expression of gankyrin in the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.12 We assessed the association between gankyrin and chronic hepatitis by collecting liver biopsy specimens from patients clinically suspected to have non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis.	16424	16792
28777492	Patient characteristics are shown in Table S1.	16793	16839
28777492	Patients with chronic hepatitis exhibited an increase in the expression of gankyrin as compared with those without inflammation (Fig.	16840	16973
28777492	4a).	16974	16978
28777492	Thus, gankyrin expression was associated with the disease activity of chronic hepatitis.	16979	17067
28777492	Immunohistochemical studies has shown that gankyrin expression was enhanced in inflammatory cells as well as hepatocytes (Fig.	17068	17194
28777492	4b), indicative of the increased gankyrin expression in non‐parenchymal cells and hepatocytes during chronic inflammation.	17195	17317
28777492	Sorafenib is the only anticancer drug with proven prognostic efficacy in HCC.	17318	17395
28777492	Identification of surrogate biomarkers that predict the biological and clinical efficacy may help us predict the therapeutic response of patients.31 Cancer stem cells have been reported to play a pivotal role in drug resistance of various cancer types.	17396	17648
28777492	Given the critical role of gankyrin in the regulation of STAT3 signaling and stem cell marker expression, we investigated the association between the therapeutic response to sorafenib and gankyrin expression using human HCC specimens collected prior to treatment.	17649	17912
28777492	HCC specimens collected before sorafenib treatment were stained with anti‐gankyrin antibody (Fig.	17913	18010
28777492	4c).	18011	18015
28777492	Based on immunohistochemistry, patients were divided into high‐gankyrin expression and low‐gankyrin expression groups.	18016	18134
28777492	In line with the data in DEN‐induced hepatocarcinogenesis model, increased gankyrin expression in non‐parenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal cells, is significantly associated with enhanced IL‐6 expression (Fig.	18135	18349
28777492	4d and Fig.	18350	18361
28777492	S10a).	18362	18368
28777492	As regards VEGF, we previously reported that gankyrin expression is significantly associated with VEGF expression in human HCC.32 Our data using Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice indicates a significant relationship between gankyrin and VEGF in tumor cells (Fig.	18369	18623
28777492	5).	18624	18627
28777492	We examined the impact of gankyrin expression in non‐parenchymal cells on the therapeutic response of patients treated with sorafenib.	18628	18762
28777492	A log‐rank test using the Kaplan–Meier method showed that the low‐gankyrin expression group exhibited significant prolongation of PFS (P = 0.011, Fig.	18763	18913
28777492	4e), but not overall survival (OS; Fig.	18914	18953
28777492	S11), as compared to the high‐expression group.	18954	19001
28777492	By contrast, gankyrin expression in tumor cells affected neither PFS nor OS in patients treated with sorafenib (Fig.	19002	19118
28777492	S10b,c).	19119	19127
28777492	We have assessed the relationship between gankyrin expression in non‐parenchymal cells or parenchymal cells and several clinical parameters, including differentiation and stage of HCC (Table S2 and S3).	19128	19330
28777492	No significant difference was observed in any parameters other than PFS between gankyrin low and high expression groups.	19331	19451
28777492	Studies have shown that gankyrin is upregulated in many HCC cell lines, wherein it promoted the proliferation of cancer cells through the inhibition of apoptosis and cell cycle progression.15, 25, 26 However, the role of gankyrin in the development of HCC in vivo was unclear.	19452	19728
28777492	Here, we investigated the role of gankyrin in controlling the tumor microenvironment.	19729	19814
28777492	In our recent study, we revealed that gankyrin upregulates IL‐17 and TNF‐alpha expression in lamina propria cells of the colon and accelerates the development of colitis‐associated cancer.12 In the present study, we found that gankyrin activates STAT3 through SHP‐1 inhibition and IL‐6 upregulation in the tumor microenvironment, leading to enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis.	19815	20186
28777492	Thus, STAT3/IL‐6 signaling may mediate the gankyrin‐induced cross‐talk between tumor cells and non‐parenchymal cells.	20187	20304
28777492	Gankyrin has been suggested as a regulator for liver tumor‐initiating cells.12, 16, 33 STAT3 activation in inflammatory cells regulates the expansion of cancer stem cells through augmented inflammatory response in the liver.11, 28 Thus, it is generally accepted that cytokine‐mediated inflammatory signaling pathways are important for dedifferentiation and generation of tumor‐initiating cells.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 However, the precise mechanism involved in the activation of cancer‐initiating cells in response to pro‐inflammatory cytokines has been poorly understood.	20305	20875
28777492	In this study, we provide the evidence that gankyrin expression in non‐parenchymal cells increases levels of cancer stem cell markers (Bmi1 and EpCAM), thereby promoting the expansion of cancer‐initiating cells in tumor microenvironment.	20876	21113
28777492	We show that the molecular interaction between gankyrin and SHP‐1 leads to the activation of STAT3 and secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐6, which may explain the mechanism of gankyrin‐induced inflammatory responses by non‐parenchymal cells.	21114	21362
28777492	Thus, understanding of the function of gankyrin in non‐parenchymal cells has elucidated a part of the molecular mechanism involved in HCC development.	21363	21513
28777492	In this study, we used two types of conditional gankyrin‐deficient mice: Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f and Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice.	21514	21638
28777492	Gankyrin deletion was confirmed in cancer cells in Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice and non‐parenchymal as well as cancer cells in Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice.	21639	21789
28777492	DEN‐induced HCC development was attenuated in Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice and to a greater extent in Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice as compared with that in control gankyrin f/f mice.	21790	21966
28777492	These studies with two types of conditional gankyrin‐deficient mice strongly suggest the important role played by gankyrin‐expressing non‐parenchymal and cancer cells in HCC development.	21967	22153
28777492	This was supported by our observation that gankyrin expression was enhanced both in non‐parenchymal cells and hepatocytes of the liver tissue from patients with chronic hepatitis.	22154	22333
28777492	In addition, DEN treatment significantly reduced the expression of the proangiogenic factor VEGF in HCC tissues of both Alb‐Cre;gankyrin f/f and Mx1‐Cre;gankyrin f/f mice.	22334	22505
28777492	Thus, gankyrin may enhance tumor development through its effect in the tumor cell as well as the tumor microenvironment.	22506	22626
28777492	The therapeutic options for advanced‐stage HCC are limited, as HCC displays a poor response to systemic treatments such as conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.	22627	22793
28777492	So far, sorafenib is the only anticancer drug with proven prognostic efficacy in HCC.	22794	22879
28777492	Identification of surrogate biomarkers that predict the biological and clinical efficacy may help to tailor treatment to every individual patient.31 Sorafenib targets the abnormal activation of ERK often observed in human HCC.34 However, the predictive value of ERK signaling, including VEGF, for the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC remains uncertain.35, 36 The activation of other signaling pathways such as JNK and STAT3 may bypass the sorafenib‐induced blockade of ERK signaling, resulting in sorafenib resistance.21, 37 Thus, JNK and STAT3 signaling pathways are potential predictive biomarkers.	22880	23476
28777492	To date, no robust predictive biomarker has been developed.	23477	23536
28777492	In this study, we found a strong correlation between elevated gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment and unfavorable PFS in patients treated with sorafenib.	23537	23704
28777492	Evaluation of gankyrin expression in HCC may be useful to differentiate between responders and non‐responders before starting sorafenib treatment and may help to select patients who are likely to benefit from the treatment.	23705	23928
28777492	STAT3 modulation by gankyrin will contribute to sorafenib resistance, and gankyrin may represent a candidate biomarker to predict the likelihood of response to sorafenib in future HCC patients.	23929	24122
28777492	Targeting gankyrin might be a promising strategy for cancer prevention and treatment.	24123	24208
28777492	Small molecular drugs that inhibit gankyrin have gained increasing interest as therapeutics for liver cancer.38 Given that gankyrin deletion has no effect on liver injury in several hepatitis models (data not shown), gankyrin inhibitors may work without severe adverse side effects.	24209	24491
28777492	Further work should be performed to obtain more information about the clinical implication of gankyrin and for the development of new therapeutic strategies.	24492	24649
28777492	Taken together, gankyrin, upregulated in chronic inflammation, induces STAT3 activation and IL‐6 production by binding to SHP‐1 in non‐parenchymal cells.	24650	24803
28777492	Such pro‐inflammatory cytokine responses may upregulate the expression of stem cell markers in the tumor microenvironment and eventually promote the development of HCC (Fig.	24804	24977
28777492	5).	18624	18627
28777492	Thus, suppression and measurement of gankyrin expression is a promising approach for advanced treatment and personalized management of HCC patients.	24982	25130
28777492	The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.	25131	25183
28428256	The endothelial cell (EC) barrier controls physiological mass transport across the vessel but also regulates tissue inflammatory response to bacterial, chemical, and mechanical insults by allowing proinflammatory cytokines and leukocyte transmigration to the sites of injury.	0	275
28428256	Precise control of endothelial barrier and inflammatory status is especially important to avoid devastating complications of infections, traumatic tissue injury, and other pathological conditions and to prevent development of pulmonary or brain edema.	276	527
28428256	Prostaglandins (PGs) are bioactive lipid mediators elevated during inflammation and generated in vivo by enzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid (AA).	528	681
28428256	AA peroxidation by cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2 generates the unstable intermediate prostaglandin PGH2, which then is metabolized by various enzymes to generate a spectrum of PGs, including PGE2, PGI2 (prostacyclin), PGF2α, PGD2, and thromboxane A2.	682	934
28428256	Dehydratation of PGE2 yields the cyclopenthenone PG, prostaglandin A2 (PGA2).	935	1012
28428256	Whereas the biological activities of PGE2, PGF2α, and PGI2 have been investigated, the vascular effects of other prostaglandins, such as PGA2, are virtually unknown.	1013	1178
28428256	PGE2 mediates its effects in target cells by binding to specific G protein–coupled prostanoid receptors: EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4; PGI2 acts via the IP receptor, and PGF2 α acts via the FP receptor.	1179	1375
28428256	All of these receptors are expressed in the endothelium, and EP and IP receptors are expressed in lung tissues.	1376	1487
28428256	A cell surface receptor mediating PGA2 effects has not been defined.	1488	1556
28428256	Basal EC barrier control is mediated by cell junctions containing adherens junction (AJ) and tight junction (TJ) protein complexes linked to the peripheral actin cytoskeleton network.	1557	1740
28428256	Increased assembly of AJ complexes containing vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), α,β,γ-catenins, and p120-catenin (Bazzoni and Dejana, 2004) and their interactions with cortical cytoskeleton is precisely regulated by small GTPases Rac, Cdc42, and Rap1.	1741	2003
28428256	Similar to AJs, TJs are composed of integral membrane proteins: occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), and intracellular proteins, including ZO-1 and cingulin (Miyoshi and Takai, 2005).	2004	2210
28428256	Although AJs and TJs are separate structural entities, under certain conditions, their components may interact with each other, leading to further enhancement of the cell–cell barrier.	2211	2395
28428256	These interactions are essential for enhancement of the pulmonary endothelial barrier caused by circulating bioactive molecules.	2396	2524
28428256	Better understanding of pathophysiological effects and molecular pathways activated by specific PGs is essential to link basic findings with dysregulation of EC behavior in pathologically relevant conditions and ways of pharmacologically correcting endothelial function.	2525	2795
28428256	For example, stable prostacyclin analogues beraprost and iloprost, which exhibit pronounced vasodilating and antiremodeling effects on vasculature, are widely used to treat pulmonary hypertension (Howard and Morrell, 2005).	2796	3019
28428256	Effects of other PGs on vascular inflammation and endothelial barrier dysfunction associated with acute lung injury and other inflammatory conditions are far less explored.	3020	3192
28428256	This study investigated effects of PGA2 on human lung vascular endothelial hyperpermeability and inflammation caused by barrier disruptive and inflammatory mediators.	3193	3359
28428256	PGA2 effects were further tested in animal models of acute lung injury caused by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or mechanical ventilation at high tidal volume (HTV) combined with intravenous (i.v.) injection of thrombin receptor–activating peptide (TRAP).	3360	3619
28428256	We identify a receptor mediating barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 in pulmonary endothelium and describe the cellular mechanism of cytoskeletal remodeling induced by PGA2 and contributing to protection of lung endothelial barrier.	3620	3873
28428256	Dose-dependent effects of PGA2 on EC barrier properties were monitored by changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) of cell monolayers grown on microelectrodes.	3874	4048
28428256	PGA2 caused dose-­dependent TER increases in the concentration range of 0.05–1 µM (Figure 1A).	4049	4143
28428256	A barrier-enhancing effect was observed by 2 min of PGA2 stimulation, reached maximal levels by 15–30 min of stimulation, and was sustained in the next 4–6 h after stimulation.	4144	4320
28428256	Treatment of preconfluent EC monolayers with PGA2 caused rapid formation of cell–cell contacts and establishment of the EC monolayer, leading to decreased paracellular permeability for macromolecules, as detected by decreased accumulation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–labeled avidin on the coating substrate underneath the cells (Figure 1B).	4321	4670
28428256	In agreement with barrier-enhancing effects on human pulmonary EC monolayers, we saw increased VE-cadherin– and ZO-1–positive areas at the cell–cell junctions of PGA2-treated cells, indicating enhanced AJs and TJs, respectively (Figure 1, C and D).	4671	4919
28428256	The PGA2-induced increase in VE-cadherin–positive areas at the cell–cell junctions was further verified by the surface protein biotinylation assay described in Materials and Methods.	4920	5102
28428256	After in situ biotinylation of cell surface proteins in control and PGA2-stimulated cells, the level of biotinylated VE-cadherin was assessed by Western blotting.	5103	5265
28428256	VE-cadherin surface expression, as reflected by the levels of biotinylated VE-cadherin, increased in PGA2-treated EC monolayers (Figure 1E).	5266	5406
28428256	These findings are consistent with PGA2-induced EC morphological changes and monolayer barrier function.	5407	5511
28428256	Coimmunoprecipitation assays with VE-cadherin antibody showed that PGA2-induced enhancement of the EC barrier was also associated with increased association of VE-cadherin with other AJ proteins: p120-catenin, α-catenin, and TJ-associated protein ZO-1 (Figure 1F).	5512	5776
28428256	The PGA2-mediated TER increase was accompanied by a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP levels within 2 min (Figure 2A).	5777	5898
28428256	Direct measurements of small GTPase activation showed that barrier enhancement in response to PGA2 was associated with rapid activation of Rap1 and Rac1 GTPases (Figure 2B), whereas RhoA activity was not affected (unpublished data).	5899	6131
28428256	As a reflection of elevated cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) enzymatic activity, PGA2 treatment increased phosphorylated levels of PKA substrates cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the actin-binding protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP; Figure 2C).	6132	6412
28428256	Tyrosine phosphorylation of a regulator of cortical actin polymerization, cortactin, is promoted by activated Rac1.	6413	6528
28428256	Consistent with activation of Rac1, PGA2 caused rapid phosphorylation of cortactin (Figure 2C).	6529	6624
28428256	Of interest, coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that PGA2 also stimulated association of VE-cadherin, α-catenin, and ZO-1 with the PKA cytoskeletal target VASP (Figure 2D).	6625	6799
28428256	These results demonstrate a convergence of PKA- and Rac-mediated signaling pathways on cytoskeletal and cell junction proteins involved in PGA2-induced EC barrier response.	6800	6972
28428256	Elevation of cAMP by other prostaglandins—PGI2 and PGE2—is mediated by IP and EP receptors.	6973	7064
28428256	Therefore we hypothesized that the observed effects of PGA2 on intracellular signaling are mediated by one or more prostaglandin receptors.	7065	7204
28428256	We tested such receptors in the following experiments.	7205	7259
28428256	We screened potential receptors mediating PGA2-induced EC barrier enhancement using specific agonists and inhibitors of prostanoid receptors.	7260	7401
28428256	EC permeability assays of PGA2-stimulated EC monolayers using TER measurements showed that specific inhibitors of FP, TP, DP2, and IP prostanoid receptors did not affect PGA2-induced EC barrier enhancement response (Figure 3A).	7402	7629
28428256	EC pretreatment with AH6809, an EP1-3 and DP receptor antagonist with nearly equal affinity for the cloned human EP1, EP2, EP3, and DP1 receptors, also did not affect the barrier-enhancing response to PGA2.	7630	7836
28428256	In turn, pretreatment with EP4 receptor inhibitor L161982 or GW627368X abolished PGA2-induced EC barrier enhancement (Figure 3, A and B).	7837	7974
28428256	In turn, stimulation of pulmonary EC with pharmacological EP4 receptor activator CAY10580 recapitulated EC barrier enhancement caused by PGA2 (Figure 3A, right).	7975	8136
28428256	As an alternative to pharmacological inhibition, we performed molecular inhibition of EP4 receptor by small interfering RNA (siRNA)–induced EP4 knockdown.	8137	8291
28428256	Treatment with EP4-specific siRNA suppressed the barrier-enhancing effect of PGA2 (Figure 3B).	8292	8386
28428256	Activation of Gs-coupled EP4 receptor leads to Gs-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase and elevation of intracellular cAMP levels.	8387	8522
28428256	Control experiments (Figure 3C) showed that the EC barrier enhancement response to elevation of intracellular cAMP caused by cell treatment with stable cAMP analogue Br-cAMP or adenylate cyclase activator forskolin was not affected by cell pretreatment with EP4 antagonist.	8523	8796
28428256	EP4 antagonist did not affect EC barrier enhancement caused by prostacyclin, known to act via the IP receptor, but abolished EC barrier response to PGA2.	8797	8950
28428256	In turn, IP antagonist was without effect on prostacyclin-induced cell response but inhibited EC barrier enhancement response to PGA2.	8951	9085
28428256	Taken together, these results show a specific role of EP4 receptor in mediating the pulmonary EC barrier-enhancing response to PGA2.	9086	9218
28428256	Involvement of EP4 in PGA2-induced cytoskeletal remodeling linked to EC barrier enhancement was evaluated using siRNA-induced EP4 knockdown and pharmacological EP4 receptor antagonist L161982.	9219	9411
28428256	EP4 antagonist abolished PGA2-induced activation of Rac1 and Rap1 (Figure 4A).	9412	9490
28428256	Analysis of downstream cytoskeletal targets of Rap1/Rac1 and cAMP/PKA signaling showed that inhibition of EP4 by L161982 (Figure 4B) or siRNA-induced EP4 knockdown (Figure 4C) suppressed PGA2-induced phosphorylation of Rac1-dependent regulator of actin polymerization, cortactin and cAMP/PKA substrates, actin-binding protein VASP, and transcription factor CREB.	9491	9853
28428256	A role of EP4 in PGA2-activated EC cytoskeletal dynamics critical for EC barrier-enhancing response was further evaluated using live-cell microscopy.	9854	10003
28428256	Pulmonary ECs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)–labeled cortactin were treated with nonspecific or EP4-specific siRNA, followed by stimulation with PGA2.	10004	10166
28428256	PGA2 stimulated formation of lamellipodia (shown by arrows in Figure 4D, top), also associated with accumulation of GFP-cortactin at the cell periphery.	10167	10319
28428256	These changes reflect PGA2-­induced activation of peripheral cytoskeletal remodeling.	10320	10405
28428256	This cytoskeletal response was abolished in cells with EP4 knockdown (Figure 4D, bottom).	10406	10495
28428256	The higher-magnification insets in Figure 4D show details of the peripheral cortactin arrangement.	10496	10594
28428256	The bar graph depicts a quantitative image analysis of peripheral cortactin accumulation in stimulated control and EP4 knockdown cells.	10595	10730
28428256	Next we studied effects of EP4 inhibition on PGA2-induced enhancement of AJs.	10731	10808
28428256	PGA2 stimulated enlargement of VE-cadherin–positive and ZO-1–positive areas at the cell junctions in EC monolayers, which was abolished by siRNA-induced EP4 knockdown (Figure 5A).	10809	10988
28428256	In biochemical studies, in situ biotinylation assay showed decreased levels of biotinylated VE-cadherin in PGA2-stimulated ECs pretreated with EP4 antagonist (Figure 5B).	10989	11159
28428256	AJ enhancement is associated with increased interactions of AJ proteins.	11160	11232
28428256	We visualized intracellular colocalization and protein interaction of VE-cadherin and p120-catenin using a proximal ligation assay (PLA).	11233	11370
28428256	Increased accumulation of both proteins at the cell junction areas of PGA2-stimulated ECs and their interaction was suppressed by EC pretreatment with EP4 receptor inhibitor (Figure 5C).	11371	11557
28428256	Coimmunoprecipitation assays with anti-VE-cadherin and anti-VASP antibodies showed that PGA2 increased association of ZO-1, α-catenin, VASP, and VE-cadherin, which was abolished by pretreatment with EP4 receptor inhibitor (Figure 5D).	11558	11792
28428256	These findings suggest an EP4-dependent mechanism of PGA2-induced enhancement of endothelial AJs and activation of AJ–TJ functional interactions.	11793	11938
28428256	Epithelial barrier protects the lung from invasion of bacterial particles.	11939	12013
28428256	In cooperation with pulmonary vascular endothelium, lung epithelial cells form a second barrier to control fluid balance and prevent alveolar flooding and pulmonary edema.	12014	12185
28428256	We tested effects of PGA2 on barrier properties of small airway epithelial cell (SAES) monolayers using TER measurements.	12186	12307
28428256	Similar to the response developed by pulmonary ECs, PGA2 caused rapid elevation of TER in SAES in the concentration range of 0.2–3.0 µM (Figure 6A).	12308	12456
28428256	The barrier-enhancing effect developed within 2–5 min of PGA2 stimulation, reached maximal levels by 15–30 min, and then gradually declined, reaching basal levels by 5 h poststimulation.	12457	12643
28428256	SAEC stimulation with PGA2 (0.5 µM) caused time-dependent phosphorylation of regulators of peripheral actin remodeling, VASP and cortactin (Figure 6B, left).	12644	12801
28428256	Inhibition of EP4 by L161982 suppressed the PGA2-induced phosphorylation of cortactin and VASP (Figure 6B, right).	12802	12916
28428256	The barrier-enhancing effect of PGA2 and increased phosphorylation of cortactin and VASP were associated with increased F-actin immunoreactivity at the cell periphery (Figure 6C) and enhancement of AJs indicated by increased peripheral accumulation of p120-catenin, an AJ adaptor and signaling protein (Figure 6D).	12917	13231
28428256	These cytoskeletal effects caused by PGA2 were inhibited by cell pretreatment with EP4 inhibitor L161982.	13232	13337
28428256	The higher-magnification insets depict details of cortical actin remodeling.	13338	13414
28428256	To study the physiological role of PGA2 in modulation of agonist-induced EC responses, we evaluated the effect of PGA2 on the endothelial barrier using a model of thrombin-induced EC permeability.	13415	13611
28428256	Pretreatment of pulmonary EC monolayers with PGA2 suppressed the acute TER decline in response to thrombin (Figure 7A).	13612	13731
28428256	In addition to TER measurements, we examined PGA2 protective effects against thrombin-induced EC hyperpermeability using an imaging assay detecting EC monolayer permeability for macromolecules.	13732	13925
28428256	Consistent with TER results, PGA2 attenuated thrombin-induced EC monolayer permeability for FITC-labeled tracer (Figure 7B, left).	13926	14056
28428256	The barrier-protective effect of PGA2 was abolished by EC pretreatment with EP4 inhibitor (Figure 7B, right).	14057	14166
28428256	We made similar observations in experiments with EP4 knockdown.	14167	14230
28428256	We evaluated EC monolayer integrity by immunofluorescence staining for F-actin.	14231	14310
28428256	Whereas PGA2 suppressed stress fibers and gap formation induced by thrombin, EP4 knockdown abolished PGA2-protective effects (Figure 7C).	14311	14448
28428256	Because thrombin-induced disruption of ECl junctions and EC barrier dysfunction are associated with activation of the Rho pathway (Fukata and Kaibuchi, 2001), we next examined effects of PGA2 on the thrombin-induced Rho signaling.	14449	14679
28428256	Pretreatment with PGA2 markedly suppressed thrombin-induced Rho activation (Figure 7D) and Rho-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain phosphatase (MYPT) and myosin light chain (MLC; Figure 7E).	14680	14882
28428256	In turn, EP4 inhibitor abolished PGA2-mediated inhibition of Rho activation and phosphorylation of MYPT and MLC caused by thrombin (Figure 7, D and E).	14883	15034
28428256	Bacterial compounds such as LPS cause pronounced activation of inflammatory signaling in pulmonary ECs and disruption of EC monolayers.	15035	15170
28428256	We tested the effects of PGA2 on EC barrier dysfunction caused by LPS.	15171	15241
28428256	LPS decreased TER, reflecting endothelial barrier dysfunction, and PGA2 pretreatment abolished this effect (Figure 8A).	15242	15361
28428256	Of importance, the protective effect of PGA2 was inhibited by EP4 antagonist.	15362	15439
28428256	Activation of the NFκB signaling cascade manifested by phosphorylation of the NFκB subunit and degradation of the inhibitory IκBα subunit is a hallmark of LPS-induced inflammation.	15440	15620
28428256	LPS triggered the canonical inflammatory pathway and induced phosphorylation of NFκB and degradation of IκBα.	15621	15730
28428256	LPS-induced NFκB phosphorylation was suppressed by PGA2, and this anti-inflammatory effect of PGA2 was abolished by cell pretreatment with EP4 inhibitor (Figure 8B).	15731	15896
28428256	Because our studies showed activation of Rap1/Rac1 and PKA signaling by PGA2 (Figure 2), we tested involvement of these pathways in the PGA2-induced inhibition of NFκB phosphorylation.	15897	16081
28428256	Inhibition of either PKA or Rac1 activity attenuated PGA2-induced NFκB phosphorylation (Figure 8C), suggesting critical involvement of both PKA and Rac1 signaling in PGA2 anti-inflammatory effects.	16082	16279
28428256	Activation of NFκB-dependent inflammatory signaling stimulates expression of ICAM1 and VCAM1, the EC adhesion molecules involved in neutrophil adhesion (Smith, 1993).	16280	16446
28428256	Pretreatment with PGA2 inhibited LPS-induced expression of ICAM1 and VCAM1, and this protective effect was inhibited by EP4 antagonist (Figure 8D).	16447	16594
28428256	Similarly, siRNA-induced knockdown of EP4 abolished the protective effect of PGA2 against LPS-stimulated ICAM1 expression (Figure 8E).	16595	16729
28428256	In accordance with the anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 on LPS-challenged EC, PGA2 pretreatment also attenuated LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by pulmonary ECs (Figure 8, F and G, left).	16730	16968
28428256	Of note, PGA2 was also protective against endothelial barrier disruption induced by EC exposure to individual cytokines (Figure 8, F and G, right).	16969	17116
28428256	Because treatment of ongoing inflammation with protective compounds represents a more clinically relevant scenario of pharmacological intervention, we next tested the effects of PGA2 against LPS-induced EC barrier dysfunction as a posttreatment option.	17117	17369
28428256	PGA2 added after 30 min, 2 h, or 5 h of LPS stimulation also had a potent barrier-protective effect, reflected by pronounced and sustained elevation of TER (Figure 9A).	17370	17538
28428256	This effect was abolished in ECs with siRNA-induced EP4 knockdown (Figure 9B).	17539	17617
28428256	Protective effects of PGA2 posttreatment on LPS-induced disruption of EC monolayers were further monitored by analysis of actin cytoskeletal remodeling.	17618	17770
28428256	Pulmonary ECs were treated with LPS with or without PGA2 added 5 h after LPS challenge.	17771	17858
28428256	Immunofluorescence staining of actin cytoskeleton was performed 1 h after PGA2 addition.	17859	17947
28428256	LPS induced formation of paracellular gaps.	17948	17991
28428256	These changes were reduced by EC posttreatment with PGA2 (Figure 9C, top).	17992	18066
28428256	Restoration of EC monolayer integrity, gap closure, and disappearance of actin stress fibers caused by PGA2 posttreatment were abolished in EC with EP4 knockdown (Figure 9C, bottom).	18067	18249
28428256	Protective effects of PGA2 were next tested in the murine models of acute lung injury (ALI).	18250	18342
28428256	In the model of nonbacterial lung injury, mice were exposed to mechanical ventilation as described in Materials and Methods and i.v. injection of TRAP.	18343	18494
28428256	PGA2 treatment was performed by i.v. administration of PGA2 at the beginning and 2 h later during mechanical ventilation.	18495	18616
28428256	Injection of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a control.	18617	18692
28428256	After 4 h of mechanical ventilation mice, developed a prominent acute inflammatory response characterized by increased cell counts and protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples (Figure 10A).	18693	18897
28428256	These effects were significantly attenuated by injection of PGA2.	18898	18963
28428256	There was no significant difference in BAL cell count and BAL protein between PGA2-treated animals and a control group without PGA2 treatment in the absence of HTV (unpublished data).	18964	19147
28428256	Effects of PGA2 on the lung vascular leak induced by TRAP/HTV were evaluated by measurement of Evans blue extravasation into the lung tissue, as described in Materials and Methods.	19148	19328
28428256	Increased Evans blue accumulation in the lung parenchyma caused by TRAP/HTV was attenuated by PGA2 (Figure 10B).	19329	19441
28428256	Barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 were further tested in the animal model of ALI caused by intratracheal (i.t.)	19442	19576
28428256	injection of bacterial wall LPS.	19577	19609
28428256	Two i.v. injections of PGA2, concurrently and 5 h after LPS instillation, significantly decreased BAL protein content and total cell count in the LPS-treated mice (Figure 11A).	19610	19786
28428256	Effects of PGA2 on the lung vascular leak induced by LPS were further evaluated by measurement of Evans blue extravasation into the lungs.	19787	19925
28428256	PGA2 treatment suppressed LPS-induced Evans blue accumulation in the lung parenchyma (Figure 11B).	19926	20024
28428256	Next, to evaluate the rate of ALI recovery, we performed image analysis of PGA2 effects on lung recovery after LPS-induced injury.	20025	20155
28428256	Lung vascular leak in mice treated with LPS and PGA2 was monitored in the same animals prospectively 1, 2, 3, and 6 d after treatment.	20156	20290
28428256	Lung accumulation of the Angiosense 680 EX tracer was performed in anesthetized animals using noninvasive fluorescence optical imaging as described in Materials and Methods.	20291	20464
28428256	Accumulation of the fluorescent tracer reflecting lung inflammation and vascular barrier compromise increased 24 and 48 h after LPS injection and gradually declined by day 6 (Figure 11C).	20465	20652
28428256	Of importance, LPS-induced lung dysfunction was markedly reduced by PGA2 treatment (two injections, concurrently and 5 h after LPS challenge), and recovery of lung function occurred earlier than in LPS-challenged mice without PGA2 treatment.	20653	20894
28428256	To test the role of endothelial EP4 in the mediation of the barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 in vivo, we used endothelial EP4-knockout mice generated by cross-breeding of the inducible endothelial VECad-Cre-ERT2 line and EP4lox/lox mice.	20895	21156
28428256	Generation and characterization of EC-specific EP4-knockout mice (EC-EP4–/–) were described previously.	21157	21260
28428256	First, we evaluated the magnitude of LPS-induced lung injury in EC-EP4–/– mice and matching controls.	21261	21362
28428256	Parameters of lung injury were analyzed 24 h after LPS administration.	21363	21433
28428256	EC-EP4–/– mice developed higher levels of lung injury in response to LPS, which was reflected by increased total and neutrophil cell counts and protein content in BAL samples (Figure 12A).	21434	21622
28428256	Of greater importance, PGA2 treatment significantly attenuated parameters of LPS-induced lung injury and vascular leak in wild-type controls, as reflected by reduced cell count and protein content in BAL samples (Figure 12A) and decreased Evans blue accumulation in lung parenchyma (Figure 12B).	21623	21918
28428256	In contrast, this lung-protective effect of PGA2 treatment was abolished in EC-EP4–/– mice.	21919	22010
28428256	Western blot analysis of lung tissue samples also revealed increased ICAM1 expression in EC-EP4–/– mice and matching wild-type controls after 24 h of LPS challenge (Figure 12C).	22011	22188
28428256	LPS-induced activation of ICAM1 expression was strongly suppressed by PGA2 treatment of wild-type mice but remained at levels similar to those for animals treated with LPS alone in EC-EP4–/– mice.	22189	22385
28428256	Taken together, these results demonstrate pronounced anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective effects of PGA2 in the two animal models of ALI and emphasize a key role for endothelial EP4 receptor in PGA2-induced protection against LPS-induced lung vascular inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and lung injury.	22386	22694
28428256	The role of PGA2 in regulation of endothelial permeability and lung inflammatory response to bacterial pathogens remains virtually unknown.	22695	22834
28428256	This is the first report demonstrating PGA2 vascular protective and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. PGA2 caused sustained barrier enhancement of pulmonary EC monolayers, dramatically attenuated EC permeability caused by thrombin, and restored the barrier function of EC monolayers challenged with LPS.	22835	23152
28428256	Cell membrane receptor(s) mediating PGA2 effects are not well defined.	23153	23223
28428256	An earlier study suggested PGA2 interaction with two groups of cell membrane receptors—one stimulating phospholipase C and calcium entry and the other stimulating production of cAMP.	23224	23406
28428256	Both receptor types were also activated by other PGs: PGE2, PGI2, PGF2α, and others.	23407	23491
28428256	We screened potential receptors engaged in PGA2 signaling and identified EP4 as a receptor mediating vascular endothelial barrier–protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 in vitro and in vivo.	23492	23692
28428256	This novel finding was further verified using a genetic model of EC-specific EP4-knockout mice.	23693	23788
28428256	EP4 is a Gs-coupled receptor stimulating cAMP production primarily activated by PGE2 but may also ligate PGF2α and PGD2 at much higher concentrations.	23789	23939
28428256	Of interest, accumulating evidence suggests considerable functional selectivity among the structurally related prostaglandins.	23940	24066
28428256	PGE2 was the most selective in activating Gαs, whereas PGF2α and PGE1 were the most biased for activating Gαi1 and β-arrestin, respectively.	24067	24207
28428256	Physiological effects of PGE2, PGF2α, and PGD2 are quite different because these prostaglandins also interact with their other cognate receptors (EP1-3, FP and DP, respectively) and stimulate additional functional responses mediated by Gs-, Gq-, and Gi-coupled signaling pathways.	24208	24488
28428256	Furthermore, depending on receptor subtype, cell population, and the context of activation, PGE2 displays pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas PGI2 and its stable analogues have mostly anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective properties.	24489	24733
28428256	These unique patterns of receptor activation by each class of prostaglandin likely define the specific type of tissue or organ response to these mediators.	24734	24889
28428256	Ligation of EP4 receptor stimulates Gα-protein–mediated transient increase in intracellular cAMP (Sugimoto and Narumiya, 2007).	24890	25017
28428256	In turn, cAMP activates PKA, which then phosphorylates downstream effector proteins—in particular, CREB.	25018	25122
28428256	In addition, elevation of intracellular cAMP activates the PKA-induced independent pathway mediated by cAMP-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor EPAC (Bos, 2006).	25123	25294
28428256	Activation of Rap1, Rac1, and PKA pathways observed in PGA2-stimulated EC is consistent with engagement of EP4 receptor and stimulation of downstream cell adhesion and cytoskeletal targets as a potential mechanism involved in the enhancement of the EC barrier.	25295	25555
28428256	Activation of Rac1 by PGA2 in this study was accompanied by peripheral translocation of cortactin linked to EC barrier enhancement.	25556	25687
28428256	PKA-dependent phosphorylation of another actin-binding protein, VASP, which was observed in PGA2-stimulated ECs, leads to structural relaxation of the actin cytoskeleton, its linkage with tight junctions via the VASP/ZO-1 complex.	25688	25918
28428256	PGA2 in this study increased association of VASP with the AJ protein α-catenin and other AJ–TJ complex members—p120-catenin, VE-cadherin, and ZO-1.	25919	26066
28428256	This functional association reflects PGA2-induced enhancement of the EC barrier via increased interactions between AJ and TJ complexes assisted by VASP.	26067	26219
28428256	In turn, pharmacological or molecular inhibition of EP4 receptor attenuated PGA2-induced activation of peripheral actin cytoskeleton, AJ and TJ assembly, and formation of the VASP/AJ/TJ functional complex.	26220	26425
28428256	Whereas direct interaction of VASP and α-catenin at the AJs has been reported (Kobielak and Fuchs, 2004), the presence of VASP in ZO-1, p120-catenin, and VE-cadherin complexes may reflect functional AJ–TJ interactions contributing to PGA2/EP4-induced EC barrier enhancement.	26426	26700
28428256	Of interest, PGA2 also induced the barrier-enhancing response and remodeling of peripheral actin cytoskeleton and cell junctions in pulmonary epithelial cells; however these effects were less sustained.	26701	26903
28428256	These results may indicate cell type–specific differences in PGA2 effects.	26904	26978
28428256	In addition to pulmonary artery ECs, PGA2 also exhibited barrier protective effects in LPS-challenged lung microvascular EC monolayers (unpublished data).	26979	27133
28428256	Such complementary PGA2 effects on both lung endothelial and epithelial cells may further promote lung barrier function in the ALI settings in vivo.	27134	27282
28428256	However, in this study, we focused on the endothelial side, and the i.v. route of PGA2 administration used in this study more specifically targeted pulmonary endothelium.	27283	27453
28428256	PGA2 attenuated EC barrier dysfunction caused by thrombin.	27454	27512
28428256	This effect is consistent with attenuation of thrombin-induced RhoA signaling, a major pathway of EC barrier dysfunction.	27513	27634
28428256	Our result show that PGA2 induced activation of Rap1/Rac1/PKA signaling, which was previously shown to down-regulate barrier-disruptive RhoA signaling via mechanisms of negative cross-talk.	27635	27824
28428256	Besides the canonical activation by the TLR4-MyD88-IRAK-TRAF6 cascade, LPS-induced stimulation of RhoA pathway also contributes to the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inflammatory response.	27825	28044
28428256	Activated p38 MAPK phosphorylates the NFκB RelA/p65 subunit, which further stimulates NFκB transcription activity.	28045	28159
28428256	Inhibition of Rho activities by Clostridium difficile toxin B, inhibition of RhoA nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1, or p38 MAPK knockdown suppressed the LPS-induced NFκB phosphorylation and transactivation and increased IL-8 synthesis.	28160	28396
28428256	Our data show that PGA2-induced elevation of cAMP was associated with activation of Rap1 and Rac1 GTPases (Figure 2).	28397	28514
28428256	PGA2 pretreatment attenuated agonist-induced activation of RhoA (Figure 7) and inflammatory signaling, including LPS-induced NFκB phosphorylation (Figure 8).	28515	28672
28428256	In turn, inhibition of Rac1 attenuated anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 and restored the increased NFκB phosphorylation caused by LPS.	28673	28808
28428256	These findings are in line with work showing that inhibition of Rho signaling by the activated Rap1/Rac1 cascade down-regulated the lung inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the model of ventilator-induced lung injury.	28809	29030
28428256	Our data also demonstrate an additional PKA-dependent mechanism of the cAMP anti-inflammatory effect.	29031	29132
28428256	Inhibition of PKA blocked effects of PGA2 on LPS-induced phosphorylation of NFκB (Figure 8C).	29133	29226
28428256	Increased intracellular cAMP in endothelial cells was previously found to prevent NFκB-dependent ICAM-1 expression induced by inflammatory agonists.	29227	29375
28428256	Elevation of intracellular cAMP in pulmonary ECs blocked p38 MAPK activation in a PKA-dependent manner, which prevented NFκB RelA/p65 subunit phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of nuclear DNA-bound NFκB.	29376	29589
28428256	Previous work also shows the anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 on other cells involved in the inflammatory response.	29590	29706
28428256	PGA2 inhibited the production of NO, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 from astrocytes stimulated with LPS.	29707	29810
28428256	Cyclopentenone isoprostanes also inhibited the inflammatory response in macrophages.	29811	29895
28428256	PGA2 potently inhibited LPS-stimulated IκBα degradation and subsequent NFκB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity in macrophages.	29896	30038
28428256	PGA2-induced inhibition of the NFκB pathway in macrophages was at least partially mediated by a redox-dependent mechanism.	30039	30161
28428256	However, evaluation of PGA2-EP4 mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects in other cells was beyond the scope of this study.	30162	30283
28428256	Of importance, PGA2 had potent protective effects in two animal models of ALI—one due to i.t.	30284	30377
28428256	instillation of LPS and the other to mechanical ventilation at high tidal volume and injection of TRAP peptide.	30378	30489
28428256	In both models, PGA2 treatment improved lung vascular endothelial barrier function, as indicated by decreased cell and protein content in BAL samples and decreased extravasation of Evans blue tracer into the lung parenchyma.	30490	30714
28428256	These effects were also observed in the setting of more clinically relevant PGA2 posttreatment.	30715	30810
28428256	Experiments with noninvasive optical imaging of LPS-challenged mice with or without PGA2 treatment made it possible to monitor the progression and recovery of ALI.	30811	30974
28428256	The role of endothelial EP4 receptor in the barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 observed in animal models was confirmed in a genetic model of EC-specific ablation of EP4 receptor.	30975	31175
28428256	In these experiments, conditional deletion of EP4 in vascular endothelium abolished the anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective effects of PGA2 treatment.	31176	31331
28428256	In summary, this study described PGA2-induced barrier-enhancing and barrier-protective effects in cell and animal models of endothelial vascular leak, inflammation, and lung barrier dysfunction.	31332	31526
28428256	We identified EP4 as a receptor mediating barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 in pulmonary endothelium and described PGA2-induced cell junction and cytoskeletal remodeling contributions to protection of the lung endothelial barrier.	31527	31780
28428256	Our results suggest that PGA2 may also enhance resolution of lung injury and accelerate EC barrier restoration.	31781	31892

28428256	The siRNA transfection efficiency according to our protocol was >90%.	34225	34294
28428256	EC monolayer barrier properties were evaluated by two complementary methods.	34295	34371
28428256	Analysis of agonist-induced changes in TER was performed using the ECIS Z electrical cell–substrate impedance-sensing system (Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY).	34372	34528
28428256	This method allows measurements of TER in real time, which reflects agonist-induced EC permeability changes.	34529	34637
28428256	Analysis of EC monolayer permeability for macromolecules was performed using Vascular Permeability Imaging Assay (17-10398; Millipore).	34638	34773
28428256	The method is based on high-affinity binding of avidin-conjugated, FITC-labeled tracer added in cell culture medium during agonist stimulation to the biotinylated ligand in the substrate coating underlying EC monolayers.	34774	34994
28428256	In permeability visualization experiments, cells grown on biotinylated gelatin–coated glass coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS (10 min, room temperature), and imaging of areas with substrate-bound FITC-avidin was performed as described elsewhere.	34995	35258
28428256	Endothelial cells plated on glass coverslips were treated with PGA2 with or without pretreatment with inhibitors, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4°C, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS-Tween (PBST) for 30 min at room temperature, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST for 30 min.	35259	35610

28428256	Ligation and amplification were performed as described in the manufacturer’s protocol (Duolink In Situ PLA; Sigma-Aldrich), using the following reagents: PLA probe anti-rabbit plus; PLA probe anti-mouse minus, and detection reagent Red.	36911	37147
28428256	After PLA, the samples were incubated for an additional 30 min with FITC-labeled donkey antibody against mouse immunoglobulin G. Cells were treated with 0.5 µM PGA2, washed with PBS at 37°C, and incubated for 10 min with 5 mM Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) at room temperature.	37148	37451

28428256	Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 × g, and supernatants were subjected to Western blot analysis with VE-cadherin antibody.	37885	38016
28428256	Protein extracts from cell or mouse lung tissue samples were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were incubated with antibodies of interest.	38017	38217
28428256	Equal protein loading was verified by probing of membranes with antibody to β-tubulin or a specific protein of interest.	38218	38338
28428256	Coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed as described elsewhere.	38339	38407

28428256	All experimental protocols involving the use of animals were approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for the humane treatment of experimental animals.	39559	39751
28428256	Endothelial-specific, EP4-knockout mice were previously described.	39752	39818
28428256	C57Bl6 mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1.5 mg/kg) and subjected to mechanical ventilation as previously described.	39819	39999
28428256	Briefly, tracheotomy was performed, and the trachea was cannulated with a 20-gauge, 1-inch catheter tied into place to prevent air leak.	40000	40136
28428256	The animals were then placed on a mechanical ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, Boston, MA).	40137	40225
28428256	Mice received PGA2 (10 µg/kg, i.v. administration) before a single dose of TRAP6 (1.5 × 10−5 mol/kg, i.t.	40226	40331
28428256	instillation), followed by 4 h of mechanical ventilation with high tidal volume (30 ml/kg, 75 breaths/min, and 0 positive end expiratory pressure, HTV).	40332	40484
28428256	Control animals were anesthetized and allowed to breathe spontaneously.	40485	40556
28428256	In the model of LPS-induced lung injury, bacterial LPS (0.63 mg/kg body weight; Escherichia coli O55:B5) or sterile water was injected i.t.	40557	40696
28428256	in a small volume (20–30 µl) using a 20-gauge catheter (Penn-Century, Philadelphia, PA).	40697	40785
28428256	PGA2 (10 μg/kg) or sterile saline solution was administrated two times, concurrently and after 5 h of LPS instillation, by i.v. injection in the external jugular vein.	40786	40953
28428256	Animals were killed by exsanguination under anesthesia 24 h after LPS challenge and used for evaluation of lung injury parameters.	40954	41084
28428256	After the experiment, collection of BAL fluid was performed using 1 ml of sterile Hanks balanced saline buffer.	41085	41196
28428256	The BAL protein concentration was determined by a BCATM Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).	41197	41307
28428256	BAL inflammatory cell counting was performed using a standard hemacytometer technique.	41308	41394
28428256	Evans blue accumulation in the lung tissue was evaluated as described previously.	41395	41476
28428256	At the end of the experiment, thoracotomy was performed, and the lungs were perfused in situ via the left atrium with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA to flush the blood off the lungs.	41477	41653
28428256	Left and right lungs were excised and imaged by a Kodak digital camera.	41654	41725
28428256	Mice treated with LPS or cotreated with PGA2 and LPS were injected i.v. via tail vein with 100 µl of 2 nmol Angiosense 680 EX (a vascular fluorescent blood pool imaging agent purchased from PerkinElmer, Boston, MA; NEV10054EX).	41726	41953
28428256	After 24 h, fluorescence optical imaging was performed in the Integrated Small Animal Imaging Research Resource at the University of Chicago using the Xenogen IVIS 200 Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, CA).	41954	42168
28428256	Mice were exposed to isoflurane anesthesia with O2 through the gas anesthesia manifold and placed on the imaging stage.	42169	42288
28428256	Acquisition and image analysis were performed with Living Image 4.3.1 Software.	42289	42368
28428256	Results are expressed as means ± SD.	42369	42405
28428256	Experimental samples were compared with controls by unpaired Student’s t test.	42406	42484
28428256	For multiple-group comparisons, a one-way analysis of variance and post hoc multiple comparison tests were used.	42485	42597
28428256	p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.	42598	42648
27798239	The two human type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KII) enzymes display 68% sequence identity across their conserved catalytic domains and exist in multiple subcellular membrane compartments (Balla and Balla, 2006; Minogue and Waugh, 2012).	0	245
27798239	Since the molecular characterization of the PI4KIIs, a general model of PI4KII function in post–trans-Golgi network (TGN) traffic has gradually emerged in which the kinases generate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), which is required for the recruitment of clathrin adaptors needed in TGN-to-endosomal traffic.	246	565
27798239	PI4KIIs have been most extensively described in endosomes (Balla et al., 2002), the TGN (Wang et al., 2003), and at the plasma membrane (Minogue et al., 2006), as has PI(4)P (Hammond et al., 2014).	566	763
27798239	The PI4KIIα isoform generates PI(4)P, which interacts with AP-1 (Wang et al., 2003), GGAs (Wang et al., 2007), and AP-3 (Salazar et al., 2005; Craige et al., 2008; Mossinger et al., 2012) and therefore has roles in TGN-to-endosome and TGN-to–late endosomal trafficking known to be important in transport to the lysosome.	764	1084
27798239	More recently, a mechanism has been described involving the redirection of PI from phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) into PI(4)P synthesis, which is required for exocytic traffic from endosomes.	1085	1287
27798239	This pathway requires PI4KIIα and is significant because it represents an important step in the recycling of plasma membrane cargoes such as β1-integrin and the transferrin receptor (Ketel et al., 2016).	1288	1491
27798239	PI4KIIα has also been implicated in human cancer (Li et al., 2010, 2014).	1492	1565
27798239	PI4KIIβ functions in TGN-to-endosomal traffic by directly interacting with AP-1, playing a role in developmental signaling by controlling the endosomal traffic of Frizzled, a receptor for Wnt (Wieffer et al., 2013).	1566	1781
27798239	The PI4KII isoforms therefore produce lipids needed for different steps in post-TGN trafficking.Protease-dependent matrix remodeling performs key physiological functions during embryo development and in the pathogenesis of metastatic disease.	1782	2024
27798239	In metastatic cells, proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) is mediated by extracellular proteases such as the membrane type I metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), whose increased expression is associated with a poor prognosis in a wide variety of human tumors (Egeblad and Werb, 2002).	2025	2318
27798239	ECM invasion by tumor-derived cells is mediated in part by specialized actin- and phosphotyrosine-rich protrusions termed invadopodia, which are capable of degrading extracellular matrix through the directed membrane traffic of MMPs (Poincloux et al., 2009).	2319	2577
27798239	The overexpression of components of invadopodia such as cortactin in breast and squamous carcinomas and ovarian, bladder, and lung cancers is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poorer patient prognosis (Paz et al., 2014).	2578	2812
27798239	MT1-MMP is a key component of mature invadopodia and has been implicated in breaching of basement membranes and invasion through interstitial collagen (Sabeh et al., 2004; Hotary et al., 2006).	2813	3006
27798239	Trafficking to the plasma membrane from endosomal compartments is a recognized pathway for the delivery of MT1-MMP to invadopodia (Steffen et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2012).	3007	3177
27798239	However, the molecular machinery controlling the complex trafficking of this key protease is not fully understood.The PI4KII enzymes have been associated with both the development of breast cancer (Li et al., 2014) and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; Mazzocca et al., 2008), but links between the PI4KIIs and cellular processes such as actin reorganization during oncogenesis are unclear.	3178	3579
27798239	We therefore investigated the role of PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ in actin remodeling and found that depletion of the enzymes had starkly different effects on the actin cytoskeleton.	3580	3754
27798239	We also found that PI4KIIβ depletion specifically induced the formation of invadopodia and was sufficient to convert HeLa and MCF-7 cells into an invasive phenotype.	3755	3920
27798239	Loss of PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ affected different PI(4)P TGN pools and post-TGN traffic.	3921	4006
27798239	The steady-state distribution of MT1-MMP was also shifted from an endosomal to an exocytic trafficking route.	4007	4116
27798239	Finally, database analyses indicated that PI4KIIβ was lost in human cancers, indicating that PI4KIIβ may be a clinically significant tumor suppressor.We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to induce loss of PI4KII function.	4117	4339
27798239	Gene silencing was confirmed by immunoblotting 72 h after transfection of HeLa cells with isoform-specific siRNA SMARTpools.	4340	4464
27798239	We repeatedly achieved at least 85% reduction in levels of PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ compared with nontargeted controls (Figure 1, A and B, and Supplemental Figure S1, A and B).	4465	4636
27798239	When we specifically depleted PI4KII isoforms in this way, we noted that monolayers of cells treated with PI4KIIβ siRNA were more dispersed than with PI4KIIα and controls (unpublished results), as described previously (Mazzocca et al., 2008).	4637	4879
27798239	To investigate this further, we stained the actin cytoskeleton with fluorescently labeled phalloidin and found that, in comparison to controls, loss of PI4KIIα led to increased actin stress fiber formation at leading edges (Figure 1C).	4880	5115
27798239	Cells also showed some clear focal colocalization with phosphotyrosine (Figure 1C).	5116	5199
27798239	Loss of PI4KIIβ, on the other hand, resulted in complete loss of actin stress fibers and increased the intensity of cortical actin staining (Figure 1C), as well as of the formation of scattered, actin-rich punctae staining positive for phosphotyrosine (Figure 1C), which were absent in PI4KIIα and control siRNAs.	5200	5513
27798239	Actin remodeling was confirmed by analyzing the ratio of cortical actin:stress fiber signals (Figure 1D), and normal actin phenotypes were restored by reexpression of siRNA-resistant PI4KIIβ (Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure S1, C–F).	5514	5749
27798239	The same rescue experiment with overexpressed GFP-PI4KIIα led to increased levels of cortical actin (Figure 1E), a likely consequence of increasing PI(4)P levels (Henmi et al., 2016), which would be expected to alter the actin cytoskeleton.	5750	5990
27798239	These data indicate that loss of PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ has markedly different effects on the actin cytoskeleton.We sought to confirm the identity of the scattered actin-rich punctae in Figure 1C formed as a result of loss of PI4KIIβ.	5991	6222
27798239	Initially, we costained F-actin along with the early endosomal marker EEA1; however, these showed minimal colocalization (Supplemental Figure S2A), indicating that these punctae were distinct from actin comets localized to endosomal membranes (Taunton et al., 2000).	6223	6489
27798239	Furthermore, these structures typically had average diameters of ≤0.25 μm, mostly clustered in regions under the nucleus, and were thus suggestive of invadopodia (Garcia et al., 2014).	6490	6674
27798239	To confirm the identity of these punctae, we immunostained cells for actin and cortactin, the coincidence of which is diagnostic of invadopodia and related structures (Garcia et al., 2014).We found that loss of PI4KIIβ, but not of PI4KIIα, induced the formation of punctae staining positive for both markers in HeLa cells (Figure 2A).	6675	7009
27798239	When we acquired confocal z-series data from PI4KIIβ-depleted cells, we observed the colocalization of actin and cortactin at the ventral surface of gelatin-coated coverslips (Figure 2B), thereby confirming that these structures were indeed invadopodia.	7010	7263
27798239	As further confirmation, we performed a positive control by treating cells with the phorbol ester phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; Tatin et al., 2006) and found that the actin- and cortactin-rich structures were indistinguishable from those obtained by depletion of PI4KIIβ (Figure 2B).	7264	7555
27798239	Key constituents of invadopodia are the matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP (Poincloux et al., 2009) and β1-integrin (Destaing et al., 2010).	7556	7694
27798239	To determine whether the ventral structures contained known components of mature invadopodia, we stained siRNA-treated cells plated on coverslips coated with a three-dimensional (3D) layer of collagen for MT1-MMP and β1-integrin or cortactin.	7695	7937
27798239	Confocal microscopy demonstrated the colocalization of these markers with MT1-MMP (Figure 2, C and D), particularly on the ventral surface of PI4KIIβ-depleted cells (Figure 2, E and F).	7938	8123
27798239	Furthermore, these structures were seen to penetrate the 3D ECM when we performed Z-series confocal microscopy (Figure 2, E and F).MT1-MMP requires posttranslational processing to become active (Williams and Coppolino, 2011).	8124	8349
27798239	We therefore determined whether the structures formed upon the loss of PI4KIIβ expression were capable of ECM degradation.	8350	8472
27798239	We plated target and control siRNA-transfected HeLa cells on an ECM composed of cross-linked fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated gelatin.	8473	8619
27798239	In comparison with PI4KIIα and control siRNA–transfected cells, loss of PI4KIIβ resulted in an approximately fourfold increase in fluorescent matrix degradation in comparison with PI4KIIα (Figure 3, A and B).	8620	8828
27798239	Areas of degradation also corresponded to clusters of actin-rich punctae (Figure 3A), demonstrating that they were the source of the gelatinolytic activity.We also performed Transwell invasion assays to measure the ability of PI4KII-depleted cells to invade a 3D collagen matrix in response to chemoattractant (serum).	8829	9147
27798239	Invasion in the absence of serum was relatively low but significantly higher in PI4KIIβ siRNA cells.	9148	9248
27798239	The introduction of serum to the lower chamber increased the number of migrating cells, with PI4KIIβ cells invading at approximately three times control values and two times that recorded for PI4KIIα-depleted cells (Figure 3, C and D, and Supplemental Figure S2B).PI4KII isoforms are not known to directly influence the actin cytoskeleton; instead, they control trafficking from the TGN to endosomes through the recruitment of clathrin adaptors.	9249	9694
27798239	To address the question of how PI4KIIβ knockdown leads to increased matrix degradation, we asked whether the PI4KII isoforms synthesized separate pools of PI(4)P and whether loss of this PI(4)P affected post-TGN membrane traffic.	9695	9924
27798239	We visualized the PI(4)P generated by each PI4KII isoform by inhibiting PI4KIII activities with wortmannin in control and siRNA-treated cells.	9925	10067
27798239	When we stained siRNA-treated cells with the PI(4)P reporter glutathione S-transferase (GST)–FAPP-PH, we noted that the intensity of staining in the Golgi region was affected in both PI4KIIα- and PI4KIIβ-knockdown cells but included signal from PI(4)P synthesized by the Golgi enzyme PI4KIIIβ (Supplemental Figure S3A).	10068	10387
27798239	We therefore treated the same cells with wortmannin to inhibit PI4KIIIβ and fixed and stained the cells with recombinant GST-P4C, which is an unbiased PI(4)P reporter (Luo et al., 2015).	10388	10574
27798239	The residual GST-P4C signal allowed us to report the PI(4)P derived from the activity of PI4KIIα (PI(4)PPI4KIIα) and PI4KIIβ (PI(4)PPI4KIIβ; Figure 4, A–C, and Supplemental Figure S4D), which in both cases localized to membranes in the Golgi region and on cytoplasmic vesicles (Figure 4, A–C).	10575	10868
27798239	Cells in which PI4KIIα was depleted showed residual PI(4)PPI4KIIβ staining that colocalized with TGN46 (Figure 4, A and D).	10869	10992
27798239	In contrast, PI(4)PPI4KIIα predominantly colocalized with the TGN marker syntaxin 6 (Figure 4, B and D).	10993	11097
27798239	Colocalization of PI(4)P with syntaxin 6 and TGN46 was restored upon expression of plasmids containing silent mutations rendering them resistant to siRNA (Figure 4, E and F, and Supplemental Figure S3, E and F).	11098	11309
27798239	This demonstrates that the wortmannin-insensitive PI(4)PPI4KIIα and PI(4)PPI4KIIβ pools generated by the PI4KIIs exist in distinct subdomains of TGN/endosomal membranes and that knockdown of each isoform affects a metabolically separate PI(4)P compartment.PI(4)P at the TGN is known to control the recruitment of the clathrin adaptor AP-1 in TGN-to-endosomal traffic (Wang et al., 2003; Wieffer et al., 2013), and we therefore reasoned that loss of TGN PI(4)P would affect this trafficking route.	11310	11806
27798239	We investigated how loss of TGN PI(4)P altered the steady-state distribution of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), finding that PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ led to a significant loss in colocalization between PI(4)P and this AP-1 cargo (Figure 4, C and D).	11807	12082
27798239	This effect was particularly marked in PI4KIIβ cells, which also displayed a more compact staining pattern in the Golgi region and an absence of vesicular M6PR (Figure 4C).	12083	12255
27798239	We also stained cells transfected with GFP-M6PR for AP-1 and found that PI4KIIβ siRNA cells showed reduced colocalization between them (Figure 4, G and H), indicating defective TGN-to-endosomal traffic.	12256	12458
27798239	We tested the consequences on endolysosomal traffic by performing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation assay and found that depletion of both PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ significantly impaired ligand-induced degradation of the EGFR (Figure 4, I and J).	12459	12721
27798239	Given that loss of either PI4KII isoform impairs EGFR degradation, we coimmunostained MT1-MMP with the lysosomal marker CD63 and found that both PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ siRNA resulted in reduced colocalization (Supplemental Figure S4, A and B).	12722	12962
27798239	Collectively these results show that loss of either PI(4)P pool affects TGN-to-endosome traffic and ultimately the degradation of cargo destined for lysosomes.MT1-MMP is delivered to invadopodia from endosomal compartments (Steffen et al., 2008; Wiesner et al., 2013).	12963	13231
27798239	We therefore considered that altered intracellular traffic might play a role in the increased localization of MT1-MMP to invadopodia.	13232	13365
27798239	We analyzed cell surface MT1-MMP staining versus total cellular MT1-MMP using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and found that loss of either PI4KII isoform led to an increase in total cellular MT1-MMP levels compared with controls (Supplemental Figure S4C); however, loss of PI4KIIβ led to an approximately threefold increase in MT1-MMP at the cell surface compared with control and PI4KIIα siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 5A).Increased surface MT1-MMP could result from a decreased rate of endocytosis or an increased rate of exocytic trafficking.	13366	13924
27798239	We therefore analyzed changes to the complex trafficking itinerary of MT1-MMP by coimmunostaining MT1-MMP and a selective panel of Rab GTPases known to control traffic of cargo in endosomal and Golgi membranes (Wiesner et al., 2013).	13925	14158
27798239	On loss of PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ, MT1-MMP displayed decreased colocalization with early endosomal Rab5 and the late endosomal Rab7 (Figure 5, B and C).	14159	14308
27798239	A significant increase in colocalization was observed with the post-Golgi Rab8, but meaningful differences were not detected in the colocalization of MT1-MMP with late endosomal Rab9 or the recycling endosomal Rab11 (Figure 5, B and C).	14309	14545
27798239	This analysis demonstrates that MT1-MMP trafficking is redirected from an early endosomal (EE)–late endosomal (LE) route to the plasma membrane via a Rab8 exocytic route.We asked whether PI4KIIβ depletion was sufficient to convert the minimally invasive MCF-7 epithelial cell line into an invasive migratory phenotype.	14546	14864
27798239	To test this, we evaluated the ability of PI4KIIβ-depleted MCF-7 cells to degrade FITC-gelatin matrix and invade a collagen layer in the Transwell chamber assay.	14865	15026
27798239	PI4KIIβ-depleted MCF-7 cells degraded FITC-gelatin to an extent comparable to the highly invasive MDA-MDB-231 line (Figure 6, A and B).	15027	15162
27798239	Furthermore, they displayed increased invasiveness and the ability to invade collagen ECM and cross the membrane toward a chemoattractant (Figure 6C).	15163	15313
27798239	These findings indicate that PI4KIIβ suppresses cell invasion in vitro.A region of human chromosome 4 encompassing the gene for PI4KIIβ (PI4K2B) contains tumor suppressor genes associated with sporadic colorectal carcinoma (Zheng et al., 2008).	15314	15558
27798239	We therefore interrogated oncogenomic and transcriptomic data in the CBioPortal and Oncomine databases and found an association between heterozygous loss of PI4K2B and lung (squamous cell and adenocarcinoma), esophageal, pancreatic, prostate, breast, liver, and various other epithelial cancers (Figure 7A and Supplemental Figure S5).	15559	15893
27798239	In pancreatic tumors, homozygous loss of PI4K2B was detected in 2.75% of samples, heterozygous loss in 43.1%, and gain in 12.8%.	15894	16022
27798239	Copy number was normal in 39.44% (n = 109 samples; Figure 7B).	16023	16085
27798239	In HCC, both PI4K2B alleles were deleted in 0.52%, 23.68% displayed heterozygous deletion, 64.73% had normal copy numbers, and 10.52% showed gain of PI4K2B (n = 190; Figure 7C).	16086	16263
27798239	Significant reductions in PI4KIIβ mRNA expression were detected in invasive breast carcinoma (n = 59; Figure 7D).	16264	16377
27798239	We also analyzed survival data in the small number of cases available (Ciriello et al., 2015) and found that loss of PI4KIIβ expression correlated with poor survival in patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast (Figure 7E).	16378	16607
27798239	Together these data support the hypothesis that loss of PI4KIIβ is a risk factor in cancers.Here we identify a post-TGN trafficking pathway that negatively regulates endolysosomal traffic and the formation of invadopodia.	16608	16829
27798239	Loss of the PI4KII isoforms had dramatically different and unexpected effects on the actin cytoskeleton.	16830	16934
27798239	An additional and striking feature of PI4KIIβ-depleted cells was the appearance of mature and functional invadopodia on the ventral surface.PI4KIIβ plays a role in the development of a migratory phenotype in HCC (Mazzocca et al., 2008), but there is limited evidence for the direct involvement of mammalian PI4KII isozymes in actin regulation.	16935	17278
27798239	In contrast, several studies have described PI4KII functions in post-TGN traffic through PI(4)P biosynthesis and direct binding to clathrin adaptors AP-1 and AP-3 (Wang et al., 2003, 2007; Salazar et al., 2005; Craige et al., 2008), both pathways that contribute to endolysosomal traffic.	17279	17567
27798239	PI4KIIα controls LE traffic of the EGFR (Minogue et al., 2006), endolysosomal traffic mediated by AP-3 (Craige et al., 2008), and that of lysosomal membrane proteins and hydrolases such as the enzyme β-glucocerebosidase (Jovic et al., 2012).	17568	17809
27798239	This explains the similar effects of PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ depletion on EGFR degradation and LE traffic (Figure 4, I and J).	17810	17932
27798239	PI4KIIβ localizes to the TGN and recruits AP-1, where it controls the endosomal sorting of Frizzled by traffic to degradative compartments (Wieffer et al., 2013).	17933	18095
27798239	There is therefore a substantial amount of data from our study and in published work indicating that each PI4KII contributes to TGN-EE/LE traffic by acting at different points in a pathway leading to lysosomal degradation.	18096	18318
27798239	The other principal way in which the PI4KII isoforms differ is in the regulation of their PI4KII activity.	18319	18425
27798239	The reported low activity of PI4KIIβ (Balla et al., 2002) and the need to recruit this isoform to membranes (Jung et al., 2011) illustrate the importance of regulating its activity and suggest that this isoform is subject to tight regulation.Few studies have investigated the role of PI4KIIs in TGN PI(4)P synthesis.	18426	18742
27798239	Our data demonstrate for the first time that the PI4KII enzymes synthesize separate TGN pools of PI(4)P that are defined by the markers syntaxin 6 and TGN46.	18743	18900
27798239	This is consistent with our previous description of a TGN-endosomal compartment enriched in syntaxin 6 containing highly active PI4KIIα (Simonsen et al., 1999; Waugh et al., 2003).	18901	19081
27798239	The structurally unrelated, wortmannin-sensitive PI4KIIIβ also contributes to PI(4)P synthesis in the Golgi of MDCK cells (Weixel et al., 2005), indicating that the Golgi complex contains at least three metabolically separate PI(4)P pools.Cells such as HeLa and MCF-7 normally display minimal invasive potential and typically have low levels of surface MT1-MMP, reflecting the importance of controlling surface metalloproteinase activity (Poincloux et al., 2009).	19082	19545
27798239	Loss of either PI4KII isoform led to increased levels of the metalloproteinase, consistent with a general impairment of endolysosomal degradative traffic; however, only depletion of PI4KIIβ caused increased levels of surface MT1-MMP, indicating that intracellular traffic of MT1-MMP was affected in an isoform-specific manner.The reduced colocalization of MT1-MMP with Rab7, which acts at the EE-LE boundary, in both PI4KII-depleted cells demonstrates that the proteinase is not sorted to the LE.	19546	20042
27798239	This is consistent with the elevated levels of MT1-MMP observed in both PI4KII knockdowns (Supplemental Figure S4C), the impaired degradation of the EGFR (Figure 4, I and J), and the failure of MT1-MMP to traffic to CD63-containing lysosomes (Supplemental Figure 4, A and B).	20043	20318
27798239	The most dramatic change in colocalization was a PI4KIIβ-specific increase in association with Rab8 membranes.	20319	20429
27798239	Rab8 operates in a post-Golgi exocytic pathway that determines directional traffic to protrusions of the plasma membrane (Hattula et al., 2006) and is known to mediate the trafficking of MT1-MMP (Bravo-Cordero et al., 2007).	20430	20654
27798239	A mechanistic investigation of Rab8 was outside the scope of our study, but it is interesting to note that this GTPase was recently shown to regulate the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Bravo-Cordero et al., 2016), suggesting that the mistrafficking of Rab8 may contribute to the actin phenotype.We were unable to detect increased trafficking of MT1-MMP-GFP to invasive structures in live cell experiments; however, our attempts were fraught with technical difficulties arising from the substantial MT1-MMP signal present in multiple subcellular compartments that obscured invadopodia dynamics.	20655	21246
27798239	The trafficking of MT1-MMP is known to be complex, and surface levels are controlled by endocytosis and exocytosis from several compartments (Poincloux et al., 2009).	21247	21413
27798239	The increased localization of MT1-MMP to the plasma membrane, increased association with invasive protrusions, loss of colocalization in Rab5- and Rab7-positive compartments, and increased colocalization with exocytic Rab8 membranes indicate that loss of PI4KIIβ and the associated pool of TGN PI(4)P causes disequilibrium between the endolysosomal and exocytic trafficking routes controlling plasma membrane levels of MT1-MMP.	21414	21841
27798239	Our data support a model in which MT1-MMP traffic is directed away from the default endolysosomal pathway and forced into an exocytic pathway.	21842	21984
27798239	One possible consequence of reduced MT1-MMP traffic into the endolysosomal pathway is increased recycling.	21985	22091
27798239	Although we did not directly address this possibility, it remains likely because we also detected increased invadopodial localization of β1-integrin, a molecule known to be recycled through a pathway involving Rab8 and cotrafficked with MT1-MMP (Macpherson et al., 2014).	22092	22363
27798239	Of interest, the recent finding that PI4KIIα directs exocytic traffic of β1-integrin from endosomes to the plasma membrane when endosomal PI(3)P is lost (Ketel et al., 2016) suggests that endosomal PI(4)PPI4KIIα may play a role in β1-integrin delivery.	22364	22616
27798239	Further investigation is required to determine whether loss of PI(4)PPI4KIIβ results in an increase in PI(4)PPI4KIIα and whether this is accompanied by increased β1-integrin recycling.	22617	22801
27798239	Integrin traffic to the plasma membrane plays important roles in tissue organization and is known to be dependent on PI(3)P (Ribeiro et al., 2011).	22802	22949
27798239	Cross-talk between this PI monophosphate and the PI(4)P produced by the PI4KIIs is an unanswered question.The conversion of the minimally invasive HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines to an invasive phenotype and the fact that tumor suppressor genes map closely to the chromosomal location of the PI4K2B allele (Zheng et al., 2008) led us to perform database searches.	22950	23307
27798239	These showed that loss of heterozygosity of the PI4K2B allele and PI4KIIβ underexpression were associated with numerous cancers of epithelial origin.	23308	23457
27798239	PI4KIIβ underexpression was also associated with poorer patient survival; however, the low statistical power of the studies led to a relatively low probability value (p = 0.262).	23458	23636
27798239	Although we are cautious in drawing conclusions, we are aware that this finding may be highly significant and therefore speculate that PI4KIIβ acts as a metastasis suppressor by maintaining PI(4)P-dependent post-TGN traffic into the endolysosomal pathway.	23637	23892
27798239	The association of PI4KIIβ with relatively common human cancers (lung, breast, liver, pancreas, and others) warrants further investigation, particularly because of the possibility that this putative suppressor pathway could be rescued by inhibition of PI(4)P phosphatases acting at the TGN.It is notable that a developmental role for PI4KIIβ in zebrafish has been described (Wieffer et al., 2013).	23893	24290
27798239	The pathological process of tumor cell invasion has many similarities with important processes during embryogenesis along with neurite outgrowth and angiogenesis.	24291	24453
27798239	It is therefore possible that PI4KIIβ activity is subject to regulation controlling physiological invasion.	24454	24561
27798239	This hypothesis points to a PI(4)P-regulated switch that determines the decision between lysosomal degradation of cargoes and their traffic to the plasma membrane that may be fundamentally important in the intracellular traffic of key molecules such as integrins and matrix metalloproteinases that determine tissue remodeling during development.HeLa and MCF7 cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2.	24562	25095

27798239	Human recombinant EGF was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.	25908	25963
27798239	Unless otherwise stated, other reagents were from Sigma Aldrich.siRNA-resistant GFP-tagged PI4KIIα and hemagglutinin-tagged PI4KIIβ were generous gifts from Volker Haucke (Leibniz Institut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany).	25964	26200
27798239	mCherry and GFP-tagged CI-M6PR were kindly provided by Mihaela Anitei (Technische Universität, Dresden, Germany).We silenced PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ using ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools siRNA oligonucleotides (GE Healthcare Dharmacon).	26201	26426
27798239	Each comprised a mix of four siRNA duplexes targeting specific sequences within the named genes.	26427	26523
27798239	We also used an ON-TARGETplus nontargeting pool (D-001810-10-05) as control.	26524	26600
27798239	Gene silencing was confirmed by Western blotting of whole-cell lysates.	26601	26672
27798239	PI4KII-knockdown phenotypes were rescued using single siRNA duplexes and the ectopic expression of siRNA resistant plasmids as described previously (Mossinger et al., 2012; Wieffer et al., 2013).	26673	26868
27798239	Further details are given in the Supplemental Materials and Supplemental Table S2.Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA], 0.5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid [EGTA], 10 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mM Na3VO4) and 1× cOmplete Protease Inhibitor (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).	26869	27337
27798239	Protein content was determined using the Lowry method (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK), and lysates were solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, separated using SDS–PAGE, blotted, and probed with respective antibodies.	27338	27553
27798239	Blots were imaged on a FluorChem M Multifluor imaging system (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA) and analyzed by densitometry using its gel analysis function.Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed, and probed with antibodies of interest as previously (Minogue et al., 2006).	27554	27827
27798239	Unless otherwise stated, images were acquired using the 63×/1.4 numerical aperture lens on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.	27828	27955
27798239	Randomly chosen representative fields were selected and 12-bit images acquired using identical detector gain and offset settings.	27956	28085
27798239	Images were quantitatively analyzed for fluorescence intensities, pixel correlations, area measurements, and cell densities using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).	28086	28278
27798239	Full details are available in the Supplemental Materials.The ability of cells to degrade the extracellular matrix was analyzed using fluorescent gelatin matrix–coated culture dishes prepared according to Bowden et al. (1999).	28279	28504
27798239	Targeted or control siRNA-transfected cells were seeded onto FITC-gelatin–coated coverslips and cultured for 12–18 h. Matrix degradation was calculated as the total area of matrix degradation (black holes) per total cell area expressed as a percentage (full details are given in the Supplemental Materials).We used an established method (Kean et al., 2009).	28505	28862
27798239	Briefly, MCF-7 cells were reseeded onto coverslips thinly coated with collagen (5 μg/cm2) at 36 h posttransfection and grown in complete DMEM for 20 h at 37°C.	28863	29022
27798239	Cells were then serum starved for 4 h to facilitate internalization of MT1-MMP.	29023	29102
27798239	For trafficking of endogenous MT1-MMP, cells were pulsed with anti–MT1-MMP antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at 4°C.	29103	29225
27798239	Cells were subsequently fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized, and immunostained.For flow cytometry experiments, we induced internalization of MT1-MMP by serum starvation and stimulated surface expression as described.	29226	29450
27798239	Cells were lifted using FACS buffer (5 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], pH 7.4) and subsequent steps carried out at 4°C.	29451	29582
27798239	Cells were probed with rabbit anti–MT1-MMP (Abcam) for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and then labeled with anti–rabbit Alexa Fluor antibody.	29583	29727
27798239	Cells were analyzed using a FACS LSRII cell sorter (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK), and ∼10,000 cells were counted per sample.	29728	29851
27798239	Postacquisition analysis was performed using Flowjo software, version V10 (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR).This was performed in 8-μm-pore, collagen-coated Transwell chambers (Corning, Tewksbury, MA).	29852	30045
27798239	Cells were transfected with target or control siRNA in six-well plates and, after 48 h, resuspended in serum-free medium and seeded at 5 × 104 into the upper chamber of the Transwell.	30046	30229
27798239	Cells were allowed to migrate toward 10% FBS plus DMEM for 12 h. Migratory cells at the lower chamber were fixed and stained with Alexa 488–conjugated phalloidin, imaged using similar optical settings (20× Objective, Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope), and counted in five random fields using ImageJ.	30230	30530
27798239	Histograms represent relative invasion of the Transwell chamber, calculated as the number of cells counted at the lower chamber relative to the total number of cells seeded onto the upper chamber (details are give in the Supplemental Materials).Prism 5 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analysis.	30531	30843
27798239	Data are presented as mean ± SEM from at least three independent experiments.	30844	30921
27798239	Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s posttest at a 95% confidence interval.The cBIO Cancer Genomics Portal (http://cbioportal.org/; Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013) and Oncomine (Rhodes et al., 2004) are open access resources for cancer genomics data sets containing data from 69 cancer genomics studies with 17,177 samples (cBIO) and 715 data sets with 86,733 samples (Oncomine).	30922	31365
27798239	Heterozygous loss of the PI4K2B allele was analyzed in all cancers, as were copy number alterations in pancreatic cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma.	31366	31517
27798239	In addition, correlations of PI4KIIβ mRNA expression, recurrence, metastatic events, or overall survival in breast cancer cases were investigated.	31518	31664
26847345	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide.	0	69
26847345	Although early-stage, localized CRC is often curable by surgical resection, some of these patients will experience recurrent, metastatic disease.	70	215
26847345	Currently, the best predictor of risk is lymph node status.	216	275
26847345	There is, however, considerable interest in identifying mechanistically based, molecular markers to improve the ability to forecast individual risk of disease recurrence.	276	446
26847345	In a prior study, we sought to identify such markers by proteomic analysis of samples obtained by laser capture micro-dissection of tumor tissue from node-negative and node-positive patients.	447	638
26847345	Of these, transgelin, a 23 kDa actin binding protein, ranked the highest in a statistical analysis.	639	738
26847345	Transgelin, also known as SM22α, is an abundant protein in normal tissue.	739	812
26847345	It promotes podosome formation and contributes to cell motility in response to injury or inflammation [4, 5].	813	922
26847345	Transgelin knockout mice are viable and fertile, but exhibit reduced smooth muscle contractility [7, 8] and enhanced atherogenesis in a susceptible background.	923	1082
26847345	Perhaps because of its abundance, transgelin has been frequently identified in proteomic profiling studies of cancer.	1083	1200
26847345	Early studies showed that expression is down-regulated in early-stage cancer models [10, 11], leading to the idea that transgelin is a tumor suppressor (reviewed in).	1201	1367
26847345	However, proteomic studies of transgelin in human cancers often indicate up-regulation in aggressive, late-stage disease [13–16].	1368	1497
26847345	Several studies, although not all, have shown a correlation between higher tumor transgelin levels and aggressive behavior, advanced stage, or poor prognosis [1, 17–21].	1498	1667
26847345	Consistent with this, various studies have suggested an influence of transgelin on motility or invasiveness in cell-based models [1, 22, 23].	1668	1809
26847345	A recent review summarizes current understanding of transgelin in normal tissue and malignancy.	1810	1905
26847345	One hypothesis that fits with most of the experimental and clinical data is that transgelin is not a marker of cancer per se, but rather a marker of metastatic potential in advanced disease.	1906	2096
26847345	One way that transgelin may influence metastasis is through direct interaction with cytoplasmic actin.	2097	2199
26847345	There is also evidence that manipulation of transgelin expression levels affects the expression of other metastasis-related genes, suggesting a possible dual mechanism of action.	2200	2378
26847345	Here, we adopt an approach based on comparison of isogenic CRC cell populations that differ in transgelin expression but are otherwise identical.	2379	2524
26847345	We generated new isogenic cell pairs, in which low transgelin-expressing CRC cell lines were transfected with a transgelin cDNA vector to create high-expressing derivatives.	2525	2698
26847345	We also further characterized a previously created isogenic cell pair, in which high transgelin-expressing cells were stably transfected with miRNA to attenuate transgelin expression.	2699	2882
26847345	Overexpression in low-expressing cells and attenuation in high-expressing cells had reciprocal effects on cell behavior.	2883	3003
26847345	In addition, comprehensive gene expression profiling showed that increasing transgelin expression in a low-expressing background led to changes in expression of ~250 other mRNAs.	3004	3182
26847345	Thus, experimental manipulation of transgelin levels leads to wide-scale transcriptional reprogramming.	3183	3286
26847345	Previously, we described stable transfection of HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells with transgelin miRNA to create two independent cell line pairs that differ in transgelin protein and mRNA levels.	3287	3476
26847345	In both cases, lower transgelin expression was associated with reduced motility, invasiveness, and resistance to anoikis.	3477	3598
26847345	This phenotype could furthermore be reversed by transfection with miRNA-resistant transgelin cDNA.	3599	3697
26847345	To extend and confirm the results of the transgelin knockdown experiments, we tested a complementary approach, creating a new isogenic cell line model in which transgelin was overexpressed in CRC cells that express endogenous transgelin at very low levels.	3698	3954
26847345	We transfected RKO CRC cells, in which endogenous transgelin is nearly undetectable, with a transgelin cDNA and selected stable transfectants.	3955	4097
26847345	After selection, virtually all cells expressed a fluorescent transfection marker (Fig.	4098	4184
26847345	1a).	4185	4189
26847345	Immunoblotting showed high levels of transgelin protein in cells that received the transgelin cDNA (RKOTAGLN), whereas transgelin remained undetectable in cells that received an empty control vector (RKOCTRL) (Fig.	4190	4404
26847345	1b).	4405	4409
26847345	Measurement of the relative levels of transgelin mRNA by qPCR showed an increase of about 25-fold (Fig.	4410	4513
26847345	1c).	4514	4518
26847345	The overexpressed transgelin was distributed primarily in the cytoplasm, as indicated by immunofluorescence staining (Fig.	4519	4641
26847345	1d).	4642	4646
26847345	We investigated the phenotype of the newly created RKO cell pair using in vitro assays.	4647	4734
26847345	Transgelin overexpression led to a 2 to 3-fold increase in invasiveness in a Transwell assay (Fig.	4735	4833
26847345	2a).	4834	4838
26847345	There was also an increase in the ability to form colonies when plated at low density (Fig.	4839	4930
26847345	2b), and in the number and size of colonies in a soft-agar growth assay (Fig.	4931	5008
26847345	2c).	5009	5013
26847345	Differences were highly significant in all three assays (P < 0.01).	5014	5081
26847345	Interestingly, transgelin expression had essentially no effect on growth rate or cell cycle distribution under standard cell culture conditions (Fig.	5082	5231
26847345	2d, e), suggesting that transgelin expression primarily affects behaviors relevant to metastasis (such as invasiveness, clonogenicity, and anchorage-independent growth) rather than growth per se.	5232	5427
26847345	We next tested the behavior of isogenic cell pairs in a model of experimental metastasis.	5428	5517
26847345	RKOTAGLN or RKOCTRL cells were injected via the tail vein into scid mice.	5518	5591
26847345	We also tested the behavior of previously described HCT 116 cells stably transfected with a transgelin miRNA knockdown vector (HCT116 TAGLN-KD) or with empty control vector (HCT116CTRL) in the same assay.	5592	5796
26847345	Tumor burden in each experimental group was measured by quantitative histologic analysis.	5797	5886
26847345	Mice receiving RKOTAGLN cells had more tumors than those receiving RKOCTRL cells, and the tumors occupied a greater fraction of the lung area (Fig.	5887	6034
26847345	3A).	6035	6039
26847345	Similar results were seen with HCT116CTRL and HCT116TAGLN-KD cells (Fig 3B).	6040	6116
26847345	In both instances, the member of the isogenic pair that had higher transgelin levels also had a greater tumor burden.	6117	6234
26847345	Although transgelin levels affected the number and size of metastases, there were no consistent differences in tumor histology (Fig.	6235	6367
26847345	3c, d).	6368	6375
26847345	Immunostaining of HCT116-derived tumors with anti-transgelin antibody showed that tumors derived from the two cell populations retained their respective transgelin phenotypes in vivo, with no evidence of reversion (Fig.	6376	6595
26847345	3e).	6596	6600
26847345	We did note that injection with HCT116 TAGLN-KD cells resulted in an unexpected incidence tumors near the injection site, instead of or in addition to the lung metastases (6/10 with HCT116 TAGLN-KD versus 1/10 with HCT116CTRL).	6601	6828
26847345	Tumors near the injection site were not grossly evident in mice injected with the RKO cells.	6829	6921
26847345	Prior studies suggest that transgelin is capable of both activating and repressing genes involved in tumor progression [1, 25, 26], although only a small number of individual genes have been examined to date.	6922	7130
26847345	To define the full scope of transgelin-mediated gene regulation, we performed comprehensive gene expression profiling on RKOCTRL and RKOTAGLN cells using Affymetrix microarray technology.	7131	7318
26847345	Based on criteria of adjusted P value <0.05 and a minimum 2-fold change, 256 transcripts were significantly affected, with approximately equal numbers of transcripts increased and decreased (Fig.	7319	7514
26847345	4a).	7515	7519
26847345	The most significantly affected categories of genes were those involved in cytoskeletal and actin binding (Fig.	7520	7631
26847345	4b).	7632	7636
26847345	Other categories that were significantly affected included GTPase regulatory activities, other enzyme regulatory activities and identical protein binding (the ability to form homodimers or higher-order multimers).	7637	7850
26847345	Table 1 shows the ten most highly up-regulated and ten most highly down-regulated genes.	7851	7939
26847345	Interestingly, prior studies implicate a number of these in metastasis or cell motility (see Discussion).	7940	8045
26847345	To confirm the microarray results and investigate their generality, we performed qPCR analysis to independently determine mRNA levels for seven genes, chosen from Table 1 based on cancer relevance (see Discussion for details on the function of individual genes).	8046	8308
26847345	We performed the analysis using RNA from the RKO cells, which were used for microarray, and also from an isogenic cell pair derived from DLD-1 cells.	8309	8458
26847345	Like RKO, DLD-1 is a widely studied human CRC line with low endogenous transgelin levels.	8459	8548
26847345	Transgelin protein expression was undetectable by immunoblotting in cells stably transfected with empty control vector (DLD-1CTRL) and was greatly increased following transfection with the transgelin expression vector (DLD-1TAGLN) (Fig.	8549	8785
26847345	5a).	8786	8790
26847345	The effect of chronic transgelin expression in RKO and DLD-1 cells was strikingly similar and correlated well with the microarray data (Fig.	8791	8931
26847345	5b and Additional file 1: Table S1).	8932	8968
26847345	HOOK1, SDCCAG8, ENAH, and TNS1 were up-regulated in the presence of transgelin, with effect sizes ranging from 5-fold to more than one hundred-fold.	8969	9117
26847345	EMB, BCL11B, and PTPRD were down-regulated 3- to 60-fold.	9118	9175
26847345	The significance of these changes in gene expression will be taken up in the Discussion; all of the genes are related to the cytoskeleton or cancer, and concordant regulation by transgelin in two independent CRC lines suggests a general effect with a common mechanism.	9176	9444
26847345	We characterized a new isogenic pair of high and low transgelin-expressing cell populations.	9445	9537
26847345	In contrast to our previous study, where we knocked down expression in two high expressing CRC lines, here we increased transgelin expression in a low-expressing line.	9538	9705
26847345	The overexpressing variant showed gain of metastasis-related behaviors in cell-based assays.	9706	9798
26847345	Thus, overexpressing cells showed increased ability to invade Matrigel, an increased ability to form colonies when plated at low density, and more and larger colonies in soft agar.	9799	9979
26847345	The reciprocal effects of up-regulation and down-regulation further support the idea that transgelin levels are causally related to metastatic behavior.	9980	10132
26847345	Here, we show that experimental manipulation of transgelin expression levels affects the metastatic potential of CRC cells in vivo.	10133	10264
26847345	In the experimental metastasis assay, control HCT116 cells and RKO cells with stable overexpression of transgelin produced more and larger tumors in the lung than their isogenic, low transgelin-expressing counterparts.	10265	10483
26847345	The widely used tail vein assay provides a composite measure of the efficiency of sequential events required for metastasis, including survival of isolated cells in the bloodstream, extravasation into the lung, and subsequent colonization and proliferation to form observable tumors.	10484	10767
26847345	Each of these steps has a parallel counterpart that was previously measured in cell culture, including resistance to anoikis, invasiveness in a Transwell assay, and colony formation at low density, respectively.	10768	10979
26847345	Although a number of proteomic studies (but not all) have shown a correlation between transgelin levels and advanced stage disease and poor prognosis, data here imply a direct causal relationship between transgelin levels and metastatic potential in vivo.	10980	11235
26847345	In normal cells and tissue, transgelin interacts directly with the actin, influencing cell motility [3–5].	11236	11342
26847345	This mechanism may apply in cancer cells as well.	11343	11392
26847345	In addition to direct interaction with actin, transgelin may also influence cell phenotype by affecting gene regulation.	11393	11513
26847345	This idea is based on transgelin’s partial nuclear localization, its homology to transgelin 3, which has transcriptional regulatory activity, and other evidence [1, 25, 26].	11514	11687
26847345	To address the influence of transgelin on gene regulation in greater depth, we performed comprehensive gene expression profiling comparing low- and high-expressing RKO cells.	11688	11862
26847345	Altering transgelin levels significantly affected the expression of a set of ~250 other genes, with statistical overrepresentation of cytoskeletal and actin-binding proteins, together with various other regulatory genes.	11863	12083
26847345	The five most-highly upregulated genes in Table 1 are connected with cancer, and in some cases specifically with tumor metastasis.	12084	12214
26847345	HOOK1 (up-regulated 96-fold) interacts with microtubules and is up-regulated in breast cancer.	12215	12309
26847345	SDCCAG8 (up-regulated 86-fold) organizes the centrosome and is related to a colon cancer autoantigen.	12310	12411
26847345	ENAH (up-regulated 18-fold), which is the mammalian enabled homology and is also known as Mena, is a transcriptional target of the wnt/beta-catenin pathway.	12412	12568
26847345	It facilitates cell invasion via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent local accumulation of actin filaments.	12569	12680
26847345	Increased ENAH/Mena expression levels correlate with invasiveness of breast and salivary gland tumors[33, 34], and are also seen in colorectal cancer and in polyps with high grade dysplasia.	12681	12871
26847345	TNS1 (up-regulated 14-fold), which is also known as Tensin 1, has actin cross-linking activity and localizes to focal adhesions.	12872	13000
26847345	Prior studies show that increased expression of Tensin 1 correlates with tumor cell migration [36, 37].	13001	13104
26847345	A sialyltransferase (ST8SIA4) has been shown to promote metastatic dissemination in pancreatic cancer by interfering with E-cadherin dependent cell adhesion.	13105	13262
26847345	Of the most highly down-regulated genes, EMB (down-regulated 16-fold) is thought to mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix.	13263	13392
26847345	BCL11B (down regulated 12-fold) is a tumor suppressor that is widely mutated in acute lymphocytic leukemia and has recently been shown to be methylated, and thus likely down-regulated, in prostate cancers.	13393	13598
26847345	PTPRD (down-regulated 11-fold), a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in glioblastoma [42, 43], Ewing’s sarcoma, lung cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.	13599	13806
26847345	PTPRD has previously been shown to suppress colon cancer cell migration in cooperation with β-catenin/TCF signaling.	13807	13923
26847345	Based on an analysis of a more limited set of genes, we had previously hypothesized that transgelin regulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).	13924	14081
26847345	In one cell line, fibronectin and vimentin (mesenchymal markers) and occludin (an epithelial marker) were affected.	14082	14197
26847345	In another, only fibronectin was affected.	14198	14240
26847345	In the RKO model, however, neither these nor other markers of EMT were altered.	14241	14320
26847345	Thus the effect of transgelin on EMT, if any, appears to be cell-line specific.	14321	14400
26847345	It remains unclear whether the effect of transgelin on gene regulation occurs by a direct or indirect mechanism.	14401	14513
26847345	Transgelin localized partially in the nucleus of the CRC cells; it shares 85 % similarity to TAGLN3, which is believed to be a transcriptional regulator; Bioinformatic analysis using the DP-bind Web server (http://lcg.rit.albany.edu/dp-bind) identified several segments of transgelin as having high DNA-binding potential (data not shown); studies also suggests that nuclear actin-binding proteins participate widely in the transcription processes (reviewed in).	14514	14975
26847345	We were, however, unable, to detect direct association of transgelin with RNA polymerase II or chromatin (HMZ, YYF, and YL, unpublished results), which suggests that transgelin most likely works indirectly, through interaction with other transcriptional regulatory proteins, rather than by direct interaction with the polymerase or template.	14976	15317
26847345	The original impetus for the studies reported here was to identify biomarkers that could be quantified at the time of surgical resection and used to predict metastatic risk.	15318	15491
26847345	Transgelin is abundant in normal tissue and is not a marker of cancer per se.	15492	15569
26847345	In our work, however, it discriminated well between node-positive and node-negative CRC specimens.	15570	15668
26847345	Evaluation of potential biomarkers should ideally include evidence that they influence the biological process of interest; that is, adding or subtracting transgelin in a given context influences phenotypic behaviors associated with metastatic risk.	15669	15917
26847345	Combining the results presented with those of a previous study, we have created four isogenic pairs (HCT116, SW480, RKO, and DLD-1), three have been characterized with respect to in vitro phenotypes (HCT116, SW480, and RKO) and two (HCT116 and RKO) have been characterized in an animal model of experimental metastasis.	15918	16237
26847345	The combined results are consistent with a contribution of transgelin to metastatic potential.	16238	16332
26847345	Human CRC is characterized by genomic instability and variability, and caution is warranted in generalizing from results with individual cell lines.	16333	16481
26847345	However, laboratory findings provide a rationale for continuing to explore the potential of transgelin, perhaps in conjunction with other biomarkers, as a predictor of individual risk.	16482	16666
26847345	As noted earlier, proteomic studies of human cancer are not in universal agreement with respect to the role of transgelin, and it will be important to identify the root cause of the discrepancies, which could relate either to different patient populations or to technical factors.	16667	16947
26847345	Separately, the finding that a number of gene products are co-regulated with transgelin suggests that they may be attractive targets for drug therapy in advanced CRC.	16948	17114
26847345	The results support a hypothesis that transgelin expression levels influence metastatic potential in CRC cell lines, and this may occur in part due to altered expression of downstream target genes that affect cell motility.	17115	17338

26847345	Total RNA was isolated from triplicate cultures using the TRIzol method.	21640	21712
26847345	After passing a quality control measurement, RNA was amplified and labeled using the Affymetrix 3’ IVT Express kit and hybridized to the array for 16 hours.	21713	21869

20540798	Stroke is a heterogeneous multifactorial disorder, to which both the environmental and genetic factors contribute.	0	114
20540798	The phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene was identified as a stroke susceptibility.	115	195
20540798	Several studies tried to replicate this association in different populations but the results were conflicting.	196	306
20540798	The complex entity and heterogeneity of stroke might be responsible for the inconsistent findings among studies.	307	419
20540798	Given that atherosclerosis proceeds long before the occurrence of clinical ischemic event, using the severity of carotid atherosclerosis as a phenotype may reduce the complexity and improve the power to detect the PDE4D genetic effect.	420	655
20540798	Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaques have been shown to be good independent predictors for future vascular events.	656	782
20540798	Despite the fact that both phenotypes correlate well to the pathologically and clinically defined atherosclerosis, they represent distinct traits with unique determinants and relationships to atherosclerosis.	783	991
20540798	IMT is akin to a physical effect adapting to aging and hypertensive stress whereas plaque corresponds to a more pathogenic alternation in the vessel walls.	992	1147
20540798	Therefore, these two phenotypes can be used as independent surrogate markers in the genetic studies of atherosclerosis.	1148	1267
20540798	Sex-specific relationships between IMT and the environmental factors like triglyceride, smoking and physical activities have been demonstrated in the Tromsφ study.	1268	1431
20540798	In addition, the association between inflammatory markers and IMT progression is stronger in women than in men.	1432	1543
20540798	The lower incidence of cardiovascular disease in premenopausal women suggests a different susceptibility to atherosclerosis in men and women.	1544	1685
20540798	Accordingly, the genetic effect on IMT or plaque may be modified by sex.	1686	1758
20540798	Among the literature investigating the associations between the PDE4D gene and stroke, only one study included IMT and plaque as phenotypes of interest.	1759	1911
20540798	This study only enrolled participants between ages 50 and 65; thus their results may not generalize to the population at large.	1912	2039
20540798	In the present study, we sought to determine whether the PDE4D gene is involved in the pre-clinical atherogenic process, ranging from the early changes in the vessel morphology (i.e. IMT) to a later stage of atherosclerosis (i.e. plaque formation).	2040	2288
20540798	The SNP rs702553 at the PDE4D gene was selected because it conferred a risk to young ischemic stroke in our previous study.	2289	2412
20540798	To clarify the influence of sex on the relationship between the PDE4D gene and carotid atherosclerosis, we first performed the analyses in the overall data and then analyzed the data from men and women separately.	2413	2626
20540798	The study subjects were stroke- and myocardial infarction (MI)-free volunteers who participated in the health screening programs at the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital between January 2006 and December 2007.	2627	2840
20540798	A total of 1013 subjects were enrolled for carotid ultrasonography examinations.	2841	2921
20540798	To compare the genetic effect across the atherosclerotic phenotypes, we also used the previous young stroke data (including 190 cases and 211 age-matched controls) with an additional 532 control subjects who were younger than 45 years old.	2922	3161
20540798	These young subjects were recruited from the Kaohsiung Medical University and did not receive carotid ultrasound examinations.	3162	3288
20540798	All of the study participants were descendants of Han Chinese resided at southern Taiwan.	3289	3378
20540798	Demographic data and histories of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking were obtained from each study subject.	3379	3506
20540798	Blood pressure measurements were done using a calibrated standard aneroid sphygmomanometer (Omron; Vernon Hills, Illinois) after sitting for at least 5 minutes and the average values from two measurements were used.	3507	3722
20540798	A subject was defined as having hypertension if he had systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or was taking anti-hypertensive medications.	3723	3890
20540798	A subject was defined as having diabetes if he had fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dl or was taking hypoglycemic medications.	3891	4014
20540798	A subject was defined as having hyperlipidemia if he had serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) ≥ 240 mg/dl.	4015	4123
20540798	Overnight fasting venous blood was collected for biochemistry analyses and genetic studies.	4124	4215
20540798	Serum levels of TC were determined using standardized enzymatic procedures (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany).	4216	4322
20540798	A subject was defined as a smoker if he ever smoked (including current or past smoker).	4323	4410
20540798	All study protocols and methods were approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB).	4411	4503
20540798	The ultrasonic examinations were assessed using the Philips HD 11 ultrasonography system equipped with a 7.5 Hz to 10 Hz linear array transducer (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, Washington, US).	4504	4700
20540798	An experienced technician who was blinded to the patients' clinical data performed all the ultrasonic measurements.	4701	4816
20540798	Subjects were examined in supine position.	4817	4859
20540798	The transducer scanning direction was using anterior-oblique insonation.	4860	4932
20540798	The far walls of carotid IMT were visualized bilaterally and the IMT values were measured at the plaque-free area of the common carotid artery (CCA, 10 to 20 mm proximal to the tip of the flow divider), carotid bifurcation (Bif, tip of the flow divider and extending 10 mm proximally) and internal carotid artery (ICA, proximal 10 mm above the bulb) separately.	4933	5294
20540798	We used an automated computerized analyzing system (Philips Qlab quantification software) to improve the measurement accuracy.	5295	5421
20540798	This new computerized technique automatically detected the echo interfaces and manual corrections were performed when there was no automatic outlining of the lumen-intima or the media-adventia interfaces.	5422	5626
20540798	All the ultrasonic data were interpreted by a single neurologist (HF Lin).	5627	5701
20540798	The mean absolute difference and standard deviation (SD) between two measurements was 0.05 ± 0.04 mm.	5702	5803
20540798	Carotid plaque, defined as an area of focal protrusion into the lumen at least 50% greater than the surrounding wall thickness, was measured in 682 out of the 1013 participants.	5804	5981
20540798	The degree of plaque was graded using the following criteria: grade 0, no observable plaque; grade 1, one small plaque (<30% of the vessel diameter); grade 2, one medium plaque (30-50% of the vessel diameter) or multiple small plaques; grade 3, one large plaque (>50% of the vessel diameter) or multiple plaques with a least one medium plaque.	5982	6325
20540798	The plaque index was calculated by the summation of plaque grades from five segments of the carotid arteries bilaterally (proximal and distal CCA, Bif, ICA and extra-cranial carotid artery), which was a modified method based on the Sutton-Tyrrell's study.	6326	6581
20540798	Genomic DNA was isolated from the whole blood using Puregene kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Gentra, Research Triangle, NC).	6582	6721
20540798	Previously, we screened four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were implicated to be associated with stroke in the literature.	6722	6858
20540798	The four SNPs were rs12188950 (SNP45), rs702553 (SNP56), rs966221 (SNP83), and rs2910829 (SNP87).	6859	6956
20540798	We found that the SNP rs702553 was significantly associated with young ischemic stroke in the Taiwanese population.	6957	7072
20540798	In the present study, we further tested whether this SNP was also related to other atherosclerotic phenotypes.	7073	7183
20540798	Genotyping was performed by the Applied Biosystems TaqMan technology.	7184	7253
20540798	Briefly, PCR primers and two allelic-specific probes were designed to detect the specific SNP target.	7254	7355
20540798	The PCR reactions were performed in the 96-well microplates with an ABI 7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).	7356	7494
20540798	Allele discrimination was achieved by detecting fluorescence using its System SDS software version 1.2.3.	7495	7600
20540798	The genotype calling rate was 97.1%.	7601	7637
20540798	Genotype distribution was tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using the Goodness-of-fit test.	7638	7739
20540798	Two phenotypes (IMT and plaque index) were used as proxies for carotid atherosclerosis.	7740	7827
20540798	For carotid plaque, those with a plaque index ≥ four were defined as high-risk individuals, subjects with an index between one and three were defined as low-risk individuals, and those without any observable plaque (index = 0) were defined as reference individuals.	7828	8093
20540798	Conditional logistic regression and the chi-squared test were used to evaluate the difference in genotype distribution.	8094	8213
20540798	We analyzed both the continuous IMT data as well as the dichotomized IMT data.	8214	8292
20540798	For the dichotomized IMT data, subjects with IMT values above the sex-specific and age-adjusted mean plus one SD were defined as high-risk individuals, and the rest of study subjects were defined as reference individuals.	8293	8514
20540798	Logistic regression with adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking) were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk genotype.	8515	8739
20540798	For the continuous IMT data, age-adjusted IMT values were log-transformed to approximate the normal distribution.	8740	8853
20540798	ANOVA and Student's t-test were then used to compare the mean IMT values across different genotypes.	8854	8954
20540798	We analyzed the genetic effect on the overall data as well as the sex- specific genetic effect by stratifying the subjects into men and women.	8955	9097
20540798	The sex-genotype interaction was further evaluated by (1) adding an interaction term into the regression model, and (2) comparing the difference of odds ratios in men and women using Woolf's logit method and Z-test.	9098	9313
20540798	Since we tested the PDE4D effect on seven phenotypes (i.e. plaque index, dichotomized IMT data at three segments, continuous IMT values at three segments) and performed the overall and sex-stratification analyses (i.e. a total of 21 tests in Table three), Tukey's ad hoc correction was adopted for multiple testing correction.	9314	9640
20540798	To evaluate the genetic effect on stroke, logistic regression was used to estimate the OR for each genotype.	9641	9749
20540798	We also performed subgroup analyses stratified by sex.	9750	9804
20540798	All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software (version 13.0).	9805	9891
20540798	The demographic features of the study population are shown in Table 1.	9892	9962
20540798	The genotype distribution was in HWE.	9963	10000
20540798	The minor allele frequency of rs702553 in the present study was 0.41, which was quite close to those reported in the three independent Japanese populations (0.42-0.46).	10001	10169
20540798	Among the 1013 subjects with IMT data, men had significantly higher IMT values than women at any of the three carotid segments (p = 7.7 × 10-9 - 1.8 × 10-16; Table 2).	10170	10337
20540798	The average age-adjusted IMT values (mm) in men and women were 0.64 vs. 0.59 at CCA, 0.67 vs. 0.63 at Bif, and 0.54 vs. 0.48 at ICA.	10338	10470
20540798	The cutoff levels (mm) to define the high-risk and low-risk groups at CCA, Bif and ICA were 0.77, 0.80 and 0.64 respectively in men; and 0.69, 0.73, and 0.57 respectively in women.	10471	10651
20540798	Among the total study participants, data on plaque index was available for 682 subjects.	10652	10740
20540798	Up to 10.8% of the male subjects had a plaque index ≥ four; whereas 1.7% of the female subjects had a plaque index ≥ four (p = 1 × 10-7, Table 2).	10741	10887
20540798	There was a moderate association between the plaque index and the age-adjusted IMT value from each carotid segment (Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) = 0.24-0.35, p < 0.001).	10888	11066
20540798	The prevalence of the cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and smoking) was much higher in men than in women (all p values < 0.05, Table 2).	11067	11223
20540798	Sex remained as an independent determinant of IMT values in the multivariate regression no matter which carotid segment was analyzed (p = 0.001 - 5.5 × 10-12).	11224	11383
20540798	Three genetic models (assuming the rare allele having a dominant, recessive, or additive effect) were used to evaluate the associations between rs702553 and the atherosclerotic phenotypes.	11384	11572
20540798	The rare allele appeared to exert a recessive effect and the TT genotype was associated with increased IMT values and a higher plaque index (Table 3).	11573	11723
20540798	Using individuals with no plaque as the reference group, the TT genotype was over-represented in individuals with a plaque index ≥ four (OR = 3.1, nominal p = 0.034, corrected p = 0.15).	11724	11910
20540798	Actually, the TT genotype was only significantly related to the high plaque index (plaque index ≥ four) in men (OR = 5.9, nominal p = 0.008, corrected p = 0.036) but not in women.	11911	12090
20540798	There was no significant association between the SNP rs702553 and the low-risk group (plaque index = 1-3).	12091	12197
20540798	In the overall population, SNP rs702553 was not significant for IMT at any carotid segment.	12198	12289
20540798	For the dichotomized IMT data in men, the TT genotype had an OR of 2.1 (nominal p = 0.032) for a thicker CCA IMT in comparison to the A allele carriers.	12290	12442
20540798	However, the p value was not significant after Tukey's ad hoc correction (corrected p = 0.14).	12443	12537
20540798	The T allele was associated with an increased IMT at Bif (p = 0.078) or ICA (p = 0.588) in men, although the association was not statistically significant.	12538	12693
20540798	For women, the data was not significant for IMT at any carotid segment.	12694	12765
20540798	We first used regression analysis to evaluate the sex-differential effect of the PDE4D gene.	12766	12858
20540798	For CCA IMT, the existence of sex-genotype interaction was supported by a p value of 0.009 for the interaction term in the regression model.	12859	12999
20540798	There was a borderline significance for the sex-genotype interaction (p = 0.062) when plaque index was the phenotype of interest.	13000	13129
20540798	We further compared the odds ratios in men and women between SNP rs702553 and the various phenotypes (Figure 1).	13130	13242
20540798	For CCA IMT, the TT genotypes conferred a significantly higher odds ratio in men than in women (OR (95% CI) = 2.16 (1.16-4.02) and 0.5 (0.21-1.16) respectively, p = 0.003).	13243	13415
20540798	There was no significant difference in the odds ratios for men and women in other phenotypes.	13416	13509
20540798	The results from carotid atherosclerotic phenotypes were in concordance with the results observed in our previous PDE4D young stroke study where the TT genotype was over-represented in young stroke cases than in the controls (23.9% vs. 15.9%, p = 0.01, Table 1).	13510	13772
20540798	The TT frequency in the control subjects resembled that in the IMT study population who had no histories of stroke or MI.	13773	13894
20540798	Compared with the A allele carriers (AA + AT genotypes), the TT genotype conferred an increased risk for stroke in men (OR = 1.79, p = 0.025) but not in women (OR = 1.44, p = 0.27) (Figure 2).	13895	14087
20540798	The present study demonstrates a sex-differential effect of the PDE4D gene on CCA IMT and plaque.	14088	14185
20540798	The TT genotype at SNP rs702553 is associated with an increased risk not only for ischemic stroke but also for the preclinical carotid atherosclerosis.	14186	14337
20540798	The consistent genetic effect on various atherosclerotic phenotypes suggests that one of the major contributions of the PDE4D gene is to increase atherosclerosis.	14338	14500
20540798	Our results indicate that the influence of the PDE4D gene begins long before the ischemic infarct, and its genetic effect on stroke is at least partially attributed to the wall thickening and plaque formation in the carotid arteries.	14501	14734
20540798	In the present study, the pro-atherogenic effect of PDE4D is mainly present in men.	14735	14818
20540798	One of the strengths of the present study is using the intermediate phenotypes as proxies of the more complex clinical outcome (i.e. stroke).	14819	14960
20540798	To our knowledge, there was only one study investigating the PDE4D effect on carotid atherosclerosis.	14961	15062
20540798	Bevan et al. found a borderline significance for IMT but a negative result for plaque.	15063	15149
20540798	It should be noted that their study used the arbitrary cut off point of 1.8 mm of wall thickness to define the presence or absence of plaque; whereas we used both the size and the quantity of plaques to calculate the plaque index.	15150	15380
20540798	We used both IMT and plaque index to estimate the atherosclerosis severity because they measure different aspects of atherogenesis.	15381	15512
20540798	IMT mainly represents hypertensive hypertrophy of the vessel walls in response to systemic hypertension and aging.	15513	15627
20540798	In contrast, plaque probably reflects a later stage of atherosclerosis when lipid infiltration, inflammation, matrix over-production, endothelium dysfunction, and smooth muscle cell proliferation take place.	15628	15835
20540798	Our results showed that the PDE4D genetic effect is more prominent on plaque index than CCA IMT.	15836	15932
20540798	It implies that this gene plays a more important role in the pathological process than the physiological changes as IMT.	15933	16053
20540798	In addition, the modest correlation between plaque index and IMT supports that these two phenotypes represent different aspects of atherosclerotic process.	16054	16209
20540798	In the present study, the genetic effect of PDE4D is strongest in the CCA IMT, attenuated in the Bif IMT, and completely disappeared in the ICA IMT.	16210	16358
20540798	Genes with differential effects on different carotid segments have been reported previously.	16359	16451
20540798	One intriguing finding in the present study is the potential sex-differential effect of the PDE4D gene.	16452	16555
20540798	This sex-genotype interaction has not been reported in the PDE4D gene.	16556	16626
20540798	However, sex-specific effect has been demonstrated in other genes.	16627	16693
20540798	For examples, the endothelial NO synthase gene (NOS3) affects vascular stiffness in women but not in men.	16694	16799
20540798	The solute carrier family 2 member 9 (SLC2A9) gene accounts for a larger proportion of uric acid variation in women than in men.	16800	16928
20540798	Notably, 37.7% of our female subjects were below the age of 50 years.	16929	16998
20540798	They were still under the anti-atherosclerotic protection of estrogen, which might also partially explain the lack of PDE4D genetic effect on the female subjects.	16999	17161
20540798	Joakimsen et al. reported a low plaque prevalence in women younger than fifties and a linear escalation from 10% to 80% at their 4th to 7th decades.	17162	17310
20540798	Indeed, the fact that only 7 female subjects were in the high-risk group (plaque index ≥ 4) indicates that these women might be too healthy to reveal the PDE4D genetic effect.	17311	17486
20540798	The small sample size in the high-risk group also explains why a borderline significance was found for the sex-genotype interaction in plaque.	17487	17629
20540798	Despite recent studies in the Han Chinese and Korean showed significant associations between the PDE4D gene and certain stroke subtypes, the largest PDE4D association study conducted in the Asian population (including 2847 stroke cases and 4464 controls in Japan) showed a negative result.	17630	17919
20540798	The main finding of the present study is to demonstrate the PDE4D effect on preclinical carotid atherosclerosis.	17920	18032
20540798	Therefore, their findings in ischemic stroke may not be comparable to our results in IMT and plaque index.	18033	18139
20540798	We selected rs702553 at the PDE4D gene as the candidate locus based on our previous findings in the young stroke study.	18140	18259
20540798	This 5' SNP is located in a block that has been associated with a reduced expression of the PDE4D7 isoform in stroke patients.	18260	18386
20540798	In addition, differential expressions of the PDE4D isoforms have been found during the transformation process of vascular smooth muscle cells and monocytes.	18387	18543
20540798	These studies give a plausible explanation why the intronic SNP rs702553 may modulate IMT progression and plaque formation.	18544	18667
20540798	There are several limitations in the present study.	18668	18719
20540798	First, we only genotyped one SNP at the PDE4D gene and it may not be sufficient to stand for the overall PDE4D genetic effect.	18720	18846
20540798	Second, the present findings should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size in subgroup analyses.	18847	18965
20540798	Yet, the current sample size had a statistical power of 0.51-0.95 to detect a genetic effect of odds ratio 2 with disease prevalence ranged from 10% to 30% and an alpha level of 0.011 http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/gpc/.	18966	19192
20540798	Furthermore, we acknowledged that a significant threshold of nominal p less than 0.05 might lead to false positive results when several phenotypes were tested concurrently.	19193	19365
20540798	We presented both the nominal p values and the Tukey's ad hoc corrected p values.	19366	19447
20540798	The significance threshold represented a trade-off between avoidance of false positive associations while taking into account that a set of related phenotypes were tested in the present study.	19448	19640
20540798	We analyzed both continuous and dichotomized IMT data because a certain threshold may be needed in order to detect the atherogenic effect.	19641	19779
20540798	There was no consensus on the definition of abnormal IMT values and diverse cutoff points were used in different studies.	19780	19901
20540798	We selected mean plus one SD as the cutoff level to dichotomize thick and thin IMT to be comparable to a previous study which used per SD difference in IMT values to estimate the atherosclerotic risks.	19902	20103
20540798	We also divided the plaque index into three risk groups (index = 0, 1-3, ≥ 4) rather than treating it as a continuous variable for two reasons: (1) plaque index is not normally distributed and the majority of our study subjects (>60%) had no plaque, and (2) the size of plaque could be ambiguous under different insonation angles.	20104	20434
20540798	The present study demonstrates that the rs702553 at the PDE4D gene affects both the IMT progression and plaque formation in the carotid arteries.	20435	20580
20540798	Men have thicker IMT values, a worse plaque profile, and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors.	20581	20689
20540798	Sex may modify the relationships between the PDE4D genes and preclinical atherosclerotic phenotypes.	20690	20790
20540798	The lack of genetic effect in women warrants further investigation and replication.	20791	20874
28851297	The β-thalassemias are relevant hereditary hematological diseases caused by nearly 300 mutations of the β-globin gene, leading to low or absent production of adult β-globin and excess of α-globin content in erythroid cells, causing ineffective erythropoiesis and low or absent production of adult hemoglobin (HbA) [1–5].	0	320
28851297	Increase of the expression of γ-globin genes and high production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in β-thalassemia patients is widely accepted as associated with a milder or even asymptomatic disease [6–8].	321	520
28851297	In several cases, high HbF expressing β-thalassemia patients do not need transfusion regimen and, consequently, chelation therapy [6–8].	521	657
28851297	This well recognized finding has prompted researchers to develop efficient HbF inducers for treating β-thalassemia patients expressing low levels of HbF [9–14].	658	818
28851297	On the other hand, the search for HbF-associated polymorphisms (such as the XmnI, BCL11A and MYB polymorphisms) [15–19] has recently gained great attention, in order to stratify β-thalassemia patients with respect to expectancy of the first transfusion, need for annual intake of blood, response to HbF inducers (the most studied of which is hydroxyurea) [20–22].	819	1182
28851297	In consideration of the fact that several HbF-related polymorphisms probably act in synergy, the interest in finding novel HbF-related genetic biomarkers has remained high.	1183	1355
28851297	This field of investigation, in addition to a clear interest in diagnostics and prognostics, might bring novel therapeutic options, in the case the polymorphism(s) is (are) associated with novel therapeutic markers.	1356	1571
28851297	This field of research has identified several direct or indirect transcriptional repressors of γ-globin gene expression such as BCL11A, KLF1, MYB, Oct-1 [16–19].	1572	1733
28851297	In a recent paper Ju et al. identified a putative novel nuclear protein repressor of γ-globin gene transcription, LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone).	1734	1909
28851297	The LYAR DNA-binding motif (GGTTAT) was identified by performing CASTing (cyclic amplification and selection of targets) experiments.	1910	2043
28851297	Results of EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays confirmed that LYAR binds a DNA region corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region of the Aγ-globin gene.	2044	2252
28851297	Ju et al. formally demonstrated that LYAR is a strong repressor of human fetal globin gene expression in both K562 cells and primary human adult erythroid progenitor cells.	2253	2425
28851297	Interestingly, LYAR was found to directly interact also with the methyltransferase PRMT5 which triggers the histone H4 Arg3 symmetric dimethylation (H4R3me2s) mark.	2426	2590
28851297	Altogether, these data indicate that LYAR acts as a novel transcription factor that binds the γ-globin gene, and is essential for silencing the γ-globin gene.	2591	2749
28851297	The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of genetic variants in β-thalassemia patients potentially affecting the LYAR binding site and the possible association with the most common HbF-associated polymorphism, the XmnI polymorphism [18, 24, 25].	2750	3014
28851297	To this aim we focused our attention on β-thalassemic patients from the north-west Mediterranean area, in particular those carrying the β039 and β+IVSI-110 thalassemia mutations, allowing to compare β0- and β+-genotypes.	3015	3235
28851297	The genomic DNA from these patients was studied by full sequencing of both the Gγ- and Aγ-globin genes.	3236	3339
28851297	A total of 75 β-thalassemia patients were recruited for this study, including 31 β039/β039, 33 β039/β+IVSI-110, 9 β+IVSI-110/β+IVSI-110, one β0IVSI-1/β+IVSI-6 and one β039/β+IVSI-6 patient.	3340	3529
28851297	The β-thalassemia patients have been recruited at Ferrara Hospital and Rovigo Hospital.	3530	3617
28851297	The Declaration of Helsinki was followed for the collection of blood samples from β-thalassemia patients; furthermore, specific approvals by the Ethical Committees of Ferrara Hospital and Rovigo Hospital were obtained.	3618	3836
28851297	All the β-thalassemia patients duly signed the informed consent form before blood sampling.	3837	3928
28851297	The genomic DNA from β-thalassemia patients was extracted from 500 μL of whole blood using the QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described in Bianchi et al.. PCR amplification of β-, Aγ- or Gγ-globin genes and DNA sequencing methods used in this study have been previously described by Bianchi et al..	3929	4252
28851297	The nucleotide sequences of the PCR primers are reported in Table 1.	4253	4321
28851297	BMR Genomics (Padua, Italy) performed gene sequencing.	4322	4376
28851297	The two-phase liquid culture procedure was employed as previously described [26, 27].	4377	4462
28851297	The erythroid differentiation status of ErPCs was verified analyzing transferrin receptor (TrfR) and glycophorin A (GYPA) expression by FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) using the BD FACScan™ system (Becton, Dickinson & Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and anti-human CD71 (TrfR) FITC-conjugated antibody (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and anti-human CD235a (GYPA) antibody PE-conjugated (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH) as described elsewhere [28, 29].	4463	4936
28851297	Production of hemoglobins was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described elsewhere [11, 28].	4937	5057
28851297	The results reported in this paper are usually presented as average ± SD.	5058	5131
28851297	The one-way ANOVA (ANalyses Of VAriance between groups) software was used for compare statistical differences between groups.	5132	5257
28851297	The paired t test of the GraphPad Prism Software was used to obtain the p values.	5258	5339
28851297	Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05 (*) and highly significant when p < 0.01 (**) [28, 29].	5340	5463
28851297	In order to verify whether mutations affecting the LYAR-binding site of the Aγ-globin gene are present within our β-thalassemia patient population, sequencing of the Aγ-globin genes was performed using genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 β-thalassemia patients, including 31 β039/β039, 33 β039/β+IVSI-110, 9 β+IVSI-110/β+IVSI-110, one β0IVSI-1/β+IVSI-6 and one β039/β+IVSI-6 patient.	5464	5851
28851297	Examples of the sequencing results obtained are shown in Fig.	5852	5913
28851297	1a, which indicates that one (G->A) rs368698783 polymorphism was found in position +25 of the Aγ-globin gene, modifying the LYAR-binding sequence from 5′-GGTTAT-3′ to 5′-GATTAT-3′.	5914	6094
28851297	For this reason, we called this mutation rs368698783 Aγ(+25 G->A) (see its location in Fig.	6095	6186
28851297	1b).	6187	6191
28851297	In the examples reported in Fig.	6192	6224
28851297	1a, the representative homozygous (G/G), heterozygous (G/A) and homozygous mutated (A/A) genomic sequences are shown.	6225	6342
28851297	In addition, as indicated in the representative examples shown in Fig.	6343	6413
28851297	1a, the G/G genotype is linked to the XmnI(−/−) haplotype; in contrast the G/A and A/A Aγ(+25) genotypes are linked to XmnI(−/+) and XmnI(+/+) haplotypes, respectively.	6414	6582
28851297	Figure 1b shows the location of the mutation within the 5’UTR sequence of the Aγ-globin gene and the nucleotide change concerning the 5′-GGTTAT-3′ LYAR binding site proposed by Ju et al.	6583	6769
28851297	Notably, no other nucleotide variations affecting the LYAR-binding sequence were found in these 75 patients.	6770	6878
28851297	Moreover, no other mutations were found in the 607 bp and 613 bp sequenced regions of the Aγ-globin and Gγ-globin genes, respectively, with the exception of a 4 bp deletion residing in the promoter region of the Aγ-globin gene (HBG1: g.-225_-222delAGCA), found in three XmnI(−/−), Aγ(+25 G/G) β039/β+IVSI-110 patients.	6879	7197
28851297	In 16/75 patients (21%) this Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphism was found in the heterozygous (G/A) state, while the Aγ(+25) homozygous (A/A) state was found only in four patients.	7198	7369
28851297	While we cannot exclude the presence of other mutations in the Aγ-globin genes of sub populations of β-thalassemia patients, we can conclude that the Aγ(+25 G->A) concerning the rs368698783 polymorphism is the most frequent mutation affecting this Aγ-globin gene region within our population, well representative of the Mediterranean area.	7370	7709
28851297	Table 2 shows that in all the patients analyzed the Aγ(+25 G->A) rs368698783 polymorphism is strictly linked to the Gγ-XmnI polymorphism.	7710	7847
28851297	In fact all the 55 Gγ-XmnI(−/−) patients were found to be Aγ(+25 G/G).	7848	7918
28851297	In addition, all the 16 Gγ-XmnI(−/+) patients were found to be Aγ(+25 G/A) and the four Gγ-XmnI(+/+) patients were found to be Aγ(+25 A/A).	7919	8058
28851297	This very interesting distribution allows to hypothesize that the XmnI polymorphism, when present in this β-thalassemia patient population, is physically linked to the Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphism.	8059	8253
28851297	The results shown in Fig.	8254	8279
28851297	2 show that only one of the 9 β+IVSI-110/β+IVSI-110 patients was found to be Gγ-XmnI(−/+) and Aγ(+25 G/A) (11.1%).	8280	8394
28851297	The other patients were Gγ-XmnI(−/−) and Aγ(+25 G/G) (88.9%).	8395	8456
28851297	No patients exhibited a Gγ-XmnI(+/+) and Aγ(+25 A/A) combination.	8457	8522
28851297	By sharp contrast, in the β039/β+IVSI-110 cohort, the Gγ-XmnI(−/+) and Aγ(+25 G/A) patients were found to be 6 (18.2%), 27 being Gγ-XmnI(−/−) and Aγ(+25 G/G) (81.8%).	8523	8689
28851297	Also in this case no patients exhibited a Gγ-XmnI(+/+) and Aγ(+25 A/A) combination.	8690	8773
28851297	Finally, in the β039/β039 cohort the Gγ-XmnI(−/+) and Aγ(+25 G/A) patients were found to be 7 (22.6%), 20 being Gγ-XmnI(−/−) and Aγ(+25 G/G) (64.5%).	8774	8923
28851297	Unlike the β+IVSI-110/β+IVSI-110 and the β039/β+IVSI-110 cohorts, four β039/β039 patients exhibited a Gγ-XmnI(+/+) and Aγ(+25 A/A) combination (12.9%).	8924	9075
28851297	These data, when analyzed together with the data shown in Table 2, support the hypothesis that the Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms might be preferentially linked with the β039 thalassemia mutation.	9076	9280
28851297	To verify this hypothesis the family trees of all the available families with β-thalassemia patients carrying at least one β039-globin gene were analyzed with respect to β-globin genes and Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms.	9281	9509
28851297	Figure 3a shows the family trees of a β039/β+IVSI-6, two β039/β039 (out of three present in our cohort) and 5 β039/β+IVSI-110 patients (out of the 6 available).	9510	9670
28851297	The results obtained firmly demonstrate that in the β039/β+IVSI-6 family (Fe89) the Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms are linked to the β039 gene (Fig.	9671	9827
28851297	3a, upper left side of the panel).	9828	9862
28851297	In the two families with β039/β039 patients (Fig.	9863	9912
28851297	3a, upper middle side of the panel), one β039-globin gene (Fe29) and both β039-globin genes (Fe77) are associated with the Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms.	9913	10075
28851297	More importantly, when families with β039/β+IVSI-110 were considered, one (Fe11) was not informative (the genome of the mother was not available), while in patients Fe31, Fe34, Fe88 and Fe91 the β039 genotype was structurally linked to the Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms combination.	10076	10367
28851297	These polymorphisms were not associated with the β+IVSI-110 gene, as summarized in Fig.	10368	10455
28851297	3b.	10456	10459
28851297	These data clearly indicate that in the population analyzed the Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms cosegregate with the β039-globin gene mutation in the majority of the families of compound-heterozygous β0-thalassemia patients.	10460	10691
28851297	In order to verify possible relationships between the Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms configuration, 30 available β039/β039 patients were recruited, peripheral blood isolated, erythroid precursor cells (ErPCs) selected and erythropoietin (EPO)-induced as elsewhere reported [27, 28].	10692	10982
28851297	After 7 days of EPO treatment, the erythroid differentiation was confirmed by benzidine-staining (looking at hemoglobin production) and FACS analysis of transferrin receptor and glycophorin A expression, as reported elsewhere (data not shown).	10983	11226
28851297	After demonstration that more than 80% of the cells were benzidine, TrfR and GYPA positive, HPLC analysis was performed to quantify fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production.	11227	11393
28851297	Figure 4 (panels a and b) shows the representative HPLC profile of two ErPC lysates (arrowed in Fig.	11394	11494
28851297	4c), displaying a low (Fig.	11495	11522
28851297	4a) and high (Fig.	11523	11541
28851297	4b) HbF relative production.	11542	11570
28851297	All the data obtained are shown in Fig.	11571	11610
28851297	4c, in which the ErPCs are stratified with respect to the Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms configuration.	11611	11722
28851297	As clearly evident, a significant correlation can be observed between the Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms configuration and elevated production of HbF.	11723	11881
28851297	In fact the average HbF production by ErPCs from β039/β039, Gγ-XmnI(+/+) and Aγ(+25 A/A) patients was 66.1 ± 14.1%, a value significantly higher than those found in ErPCs from Gγ-XmnI(−/−) and Aγ(+25 G/G) or Gγ-XmnI(−/+) and Aγ(+25 G/A) patients.	11882	12128
28851297	This finding suggests that Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphisms should be present in both alleles for maximal potentiation of HbF production, even if not “per se” sufficient and probably acting with other “HbF modifiers”, since all the Gγ-XmnI(+/+) and Aγ(+25 A/A) patients did not carry any detectable alteration of the α-globin gene asset.	12129	12472
28851297	In any case, the cellular system here described might help to dissect genetic control of fetal-hemoglobin persistence and disease phenotypes, especially considering the possibility to access cellular biobanks from β-thalassemia patients stratified with respect to genotype, Gγ-XmnI and Aγ(+25) polymorphisms, enabling cryopreservation and usage of the cryopreserved and thawed cells for molecular biology studies.	12473	12886
28851297	Clinical observations have shown that increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate the severity of the disorders of β-hemoglobin, including β-thalassemia.	12887	13054
28851297	High HbF levels are associated with transcriptional effects on the γ-globin genes, which are associated with the biological activity of several transcription repressors, including MYB, BCL11A, Oct-1, KLF1 and others [16–19, 31–33].	13055	13286
28851297	A recent paper has pointed out the attention on a new putative repressor of the γ-globin gene, LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone), recognizing the Aγ-globin gene sequence 5′-GGTTAT-3′.	13287	13497
28851297	Interestingly, several alterations within this consensus sequence for LYAR are associated with a decrease binding efficiency.	13498	13623
28851297	At present, no extensive analysis of this sequence has been reported in β-thalassemia patients; no attempts have been made to verify a possible association with the major HbF associated polymorphism, the Gγ-globin-XmnI; finally, no extensive analysis has been reported on possible linkage with β0- and β+-globin gene mutations.	13624	13951
28851297	In this paper we report the sequencing of the Aγ-globin genes performed on genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 β-thalassemia patients, including 31 β039/β039, 33 β039/β+IVSI-110, 9 β+IVSI-110/β+IVSI-110, one β0IVSI-1/β+IVSI-6 and one β039/β+IVSI-6.	13952	14204
28851297	The major results of this paper are the following: (a) a G->A mutation at the level of the rs368698783 polymorphism is present in β-thalassemia patients in the 5’UTR sequence (+25) of the Aγ-globin gene, affecting the LYAR binding site 5′-GGTTAT-3′ sequence (Fig.	14205	14468
28851297	1); (b) no other mutations of the LYAR binding site were found; (c) this Aγ(+25 G->A) polymorphism is in complete linkage disequilibrium with a promoter variant of the Gγ-globin-gene (the XmnI polymorphism, rs7482144, C->T); (d) the Aγ(+25 G->A) and Gγ-globin-XmnI polymorphisms are linked with the β039-globin gene, but not with the β+IVSI-110-globin gene (Figs.	14469	14832
28851297	2 and 3).	14833	14842
28851297	Further genetic analysis in different β-thalassemia patient population is necessary (a) to extend this specific finding to other β0-thalassemia mutations and (b) to verify the link of Aγ(+25 G->A) and Gγ-globin-XmnI (C->T) polymorphisms with the β039-globin gene in a statistically more significant number of patients.	14843	15161
28851297	It is interesting to note that the Aγ(+25 G->A) rs368698783 polymorphism is expected to deeply alter the LYAR binding activity, thereby activating the Aγ-globin gene.	15162	15328
28851297	One possibility, which deserves to be verified in further studies, is that rs368698783, rather than the XmnI polymorphism, could be the physiologically (and even clinically) active variant in hemoglobinopathy patients carrying haplotypes including the XmnI(+) allele.	15329	15596
28851297	In respect to this point, our last conclusion is that the Aγ(+25 G->A) and Gγ-globin-XmnI polymorphisms might be associated with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells isolated from the β039/β039 thalassemia patients (Fig.	15597	15818
28851297	4), in agreement with several studies suggesting the association between XmnI polymorphism and high HbF production [18, 24, 34, 35].	15819	15951
28851297	On the other hand, as a potential explanation of our findings, we hypothesize that in β-thalassemia the Gγ-globin-XmnI/Aγ-globin-(G->A) genotype is frequently under genetic linkage with β0-thalassemia mutations, but not with the β+-thalassemia mutation here studied (i.e. β+IVSI-110).	15952	16236
28851297	One hypothesis is the very interesting possibility that this genetic combination has been selected within the population of the β0-thalassemia patients, due to its functional association with high HbF.	16237	16438
20534142	Proteolytic cleavage is an important step in the maturation of several hormones that are derived from inactive precursors.	0	122
20534142	One important enzyme that catalyzes this processing is prohormone convertase 1.	123	202
20534142	This protease is selectively expressed in neuronal and endocrine tissues and is active within dense core secretory granules.	203	327
20534142	Among its numerous substrates are key hormones and neuropeptides for the regulation of energy metabolism, including proopiomelanocortin, proglucagon, and proinsulin.	328	493
20534142	Patients with prohormone convertase 1 deficiency (MIM: #600955), a rare monogenic disease, suffer from childhood obesity, small intestinal absorptive dysfunction and various endocrine disturbances.	494	691
20534142	They develop hypoadrenalism, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and abnormal glucose homeostasis with elevated proinsulin levels due to insufficient prohormone processing.	692	859
20534142	Genome-wide linkage studies identified a genomic locus on chromosome 5q to be associated with obesity.	860	962
20534142	Among other genes, this locus harbors PCSK1, and associations of two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene (rs6232 and rs6235, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 5.4% and 27.3%, respectively) with obesity were reported.	963	1203
20534142	Since prohormone convertase 1 is involved in proinsulin conversion and thereby in insulin maturation as well as in body weight regulation, the present study examined the association of the putatively obesity-related SNPs rs6232 and rs6235 in PCSK1 with the prediabetic traits insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and glucose intolerance.	1204	1544
20534142	We studied 1498 non-diabetic subjects from southwestern Germany.	1545	1609
20534142	The participants were selected from the ongoing Tübingen Family Study which currently includes ~2000 individuals with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.	1610	1775
20534142	Selection was done based on the availability of all phenotype data used for the analyses.	1776	1865
20534142	Especially proinsulin levels for all time points during the OGTT were not available for all subjects in the cohort.	1866	1981
20534142	Most (68.5%) of these subjects had a family history of diabetes, i.e., at least one second-degree relative with type 2 diabetes.	1982	2110
20534142	Informed written consent was obtained from all participants and the local Ethics Committee approved the protocol.	2111	2224
20534142	The OGTT revealed that 73.0% of the non-diabetic participants had normal glucose tolerance, 10.0% had impaired fasting glycaemia, 9.6% had impaired glucose tolerance and 7.3% had impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance.	2225	2462
20534142	DNA from whole blood was isolated using a commercial DNA isolation kit (NucleoSpin, Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany).	2463	2581
20534142	Genotyping was performed using the TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA, USA).	2582	2674
20534142	The TaqMan genotyping reaction was amplified on a GeneAmp PCR system 7000 and fluorescence was detected on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems).	2675	2839
20534142	The genotyping success rates were 99.0% for rs6232 and 99.1% for rs6235.	2840	2912
20534142	The genotypes were verified in 50 randomly selected subjects by bidirectional sequencing, and both methods resulted in 100% identical results.	2913	3055
20534142	Both SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (rs6232 p = 0.1 and rs6235 p = 0.	3056	3134
20534142	7).	3135	3138
20534142	The SNPs were incompletely linked (D' = 0.887, r2 = 0.145).	3139	3198
20534142	After an overnight fast, subjects ingested a solution containing 75 g glucose at 08:00 hours.	3199	3292
20534142	Venous blood samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, and plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin concentrations were determined.	3293	3443
20534142	Clamp-derived insulin sensitivity was determined in a subgroup of 512 subjects by a hyperinsulinemic-eugylcemic clamp with measurement of glucose and insulin.	3444	3602
20534142	The test was performed as described earlier.	3603	3647
20534142	Plasma insulin and proinsulin were determined by commercial chemiluminescence assays for ADVIA Centaur (Siemens Medical Solutions, Fernwald, Germany).	3648	3798
20534142	Blood glucose was measured using a bedside glucose analyzer (glucose oxidase method; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH, USA).	3799	3937
20534142	The area under the curve (AUC) AUCIns30/AUCGlc30 was calculated as (Ins0 + Ins30)/(Glc0 + Glc30).	3938	4035
20534142	First-phase insulin was determined from the OGTT as described earlier by calculating 1283 + 1.829 × Ins30 - 138.7 × Glc30 + 3.772 × Ins0.	4036	4173
20534142	AUC of glucose, insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin during the OGTT were calculated according to the trapezoid method as: 0.5 × (c0/2 + c30 + c60 + c90 + c120/2) with c = concentration.	4174	4357
20534142	HOMAIR was calculated as (Glc0 × Ins0 × 2)/45.	4358	4404
20534142	Insulin sensitivity during the OGTT was estimated as proposed by Matsuda and DeFronzo: ISI = 10,000/√(Glc0·Ins0·Glcmean·Insmean).	4405	4534
20534142	Unless otherwise stated, data are given as arithmetic means ± SEM.	4535	4601
20534142	Data were logarithmically transformed prior to statistical analysis.	4602	4670
20534142	Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using χ2 test.	4671	4723
20534142	Differences in anthropometrics and metabolic parameters between genotypes were tested using multivariate linear regression analysis.	4724	4856
20534142	PCSK1 SNP rs6235 and SNP rs6232 were examined under both an additive (add) and a dominant inheritance model (dom).	4857	4971
20534142	However, only the dominant inheritance model was interpreted for SNP rs6232 because of this SNP's low MAF of 6% (only 5 participants were homozygous for the minor allele).	4972	5143
20534142	All data were adjusted for gender and age.	5144	5186
20534142	The glucose concentrations and insulin sensitivity indices were additionally adjusted for BMI, and proinsulin concentrations and insulin secretion parameters were additionally adjusted for OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity index and BMI.	5187	5423
20534142	Differences with a p-value < 0.05 were considered to indicate nominal associations.	5424	5507
20534142	After correction for the two unlinked SNPs tested and the endpoints anthropometrics, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity (according to Bonferroni), results with values of p < 0.0085 were considered statistically significant.	5508	5739
20534142	The JMP 7.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) statistical software package was used.	5740	5821
20534142	Using two tailed t-test, the study was sufficiently powered (1-beta ≥ 0.8) to detect an effect size of 15% for SNP rs6235 and 22% for SNP rs6232 (dominant inheritance model, p = 0.05).	5822	6006
20534142	Power calculations were performed using G*power 3.0 software available at http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/aap/projects/gpower/.	6007	6139
20534142	The observed MAF for SNP rs6235 was 25.8% (reported 27.3%) and for rs6232 6.0% (reported 5.4%).	6140	6235
20534142	After appropriate adjustment, both minor alleles of the PCSK1 SNPs rs6232 and rs6235 were neither associated with BMI nor with weight-related traits, like waist circumference and total body fat (all p ≥ 0.07, tables 1 + 2).	6236	6459
20534142	The frequency of obesity (BMI < 30 versus BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) in our cohort was not influenced by the risk alleles (all p ≥ 0.4).	6460	6585
20534142	None of the SNPs revealed association with fasting proinsulin concentrations (all p ≥ 0.1, tables 1 + 2).	6586	6691
20534142	However, upon glucose ingestion, subjects carrying the minor alleles showed an association with higher proinsulin concentrations (rs6232 nominally associated, pdom = 0.0104; rs6235 significantly associated with AUCProins, padd = 0.0018; adjusted effect sizes 10/8%; tables 1 + 2) and nominally lower proinsulin-to-insulin conversion (AUCProins/AUCins) compared to those with the major allele (rs6232, pdom = 0.0094; rs6235, padd = 0.0090; adjusted effect sizes 21/8%; tables 1 + 2, figure 1A+1D) and this finding was consistent when adjusting for insulin sensitivity or not.	6692	7266
20534142	Both variants were not associated with differences in insulin secretion (all indices used p ≥ 0.08, tables 1 + 2), and SNP rs6235 was furthermore neither associated with glucose nor with insulin levels during the OGTT (all p ≥ 0.2, figure 1B and 1C).	7267	7517
20534142	In addition to these findings, the minor allele of SNP rs6232, but not that of SNP rs6235, was significantly associated with decreased 120-min blood glucose (pdom = 0.0003, table 1, figure 2) and nominally associated with decreased fasting insulin levels (pdom = 0.0297, table 1).	7518	7798
20534142	Insulin sensitivity derived from the OGTT was significantly increased (pdom = 0.0010, adjusted effect size 15%, table 1, figure 2) and insulin resistance derived from fasting state (HOMAIR) was accordingly nominally decreased in carriers of the minor allele (pdom = 0.0232, table 1 and figure 2).	7799	8095
20534142	The effect on OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity remained significant even after adjustment for gender, age, BMI, AUCProins/AUCIns, and first-phase insulin secretion (pdom = 0.0033).	8096	8276
20534142	To confirm that the association with insulin sensitivity did not solely reflect altered insulin levels due to impaired prohormone processing, we analyzed insulin sensitivity measured by exogenous administration of insulin during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.	8277	8540
20534142	Again, SNP rs6232, but not SNP rs6235 was associated with significantly increased insulin sensitivity (pdom = 0.0047; adjusted effect size 19%; table 1).	8541	8694
20534142	To analyze subjects with low risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus versus those with a high risk, we stratified for family history of diabetes.	8695	8833
20534142	This stratification did not produce consistent results, probably due to the limited power of the subgroups.	8834	8941
20534142	In our cohort, the reported association of the common variants rs6232 and rs6235 within the PCSK1 gene with BMI and obesity could not be replicated.	8942	9090
20534142	This is most likely explained by the limited power of our study to detect relatively small effect sizes of the SNPs on BMI and obesity.	9091	9226
20534142	The effect sizes detectable in our study were as small as 15%, and for the established obesity risk locus FTO an effect size of about 10% could be demonstrated.	9227	9387
20534142	In the present study, we found that the minor alleles of both candidate SNPs in the PCSK1 gene are associated with significantly higher glucose-stimulated proinsulin levels indicating reduced proinsulin conversion, while insulin secretion was unaffected.	9388	9642
20534142	These findings were not altered by adjustment for insulin sensitivity.	9643	9713
20534142	Basal proinsulin levels were unaffected by the variants in PCSK1.	9714	9779
20534142	Thus, under basal conditions the enzyme cleaves sufficient amounts of proinsulin.	9780	9861
20534142	However, in the state of much higher secretory demands following a glucose load, proinsulin levels and proinsulin-to-insulin ratios were increased in carriers of both SNPs and this points to insufficient insulin maturation.	9862	10085
20534142	Both SNPs in the PCSK1 gene alter the amino acid sequence of the protein.	10086	10159
20534142	SNP rs6232 changes asparagine to aspartic acid (N221D) in the catalytic domain and leads to a 10% reduction of activity, while SNP rs6235 substitutes serine by threonine (S690T) without any effect on the enzymatic activity.	10160	10383
20534142	Reduced enzymatic activity due to SNP rs6232 can plausibly explain this observation, though the mechanism is less clear in the case of the other SNP, rs6235.	10384	10541
20534142	The substituted amino acid by that variation could possibly influence binding of regulators of the enzyme's activity, its localization within the β-cell, or the available number of prohormone convertase 1 molecules via altered stability.	10542	10779
20534142	All these effects could theoretically influence prohormone conversion.	10780	10850
20534142	Although both PCSK1 SNPs affect proinsulin levels, they do not alter insulin secretion after glucose stimulation.	10851	10964
20534142	Thus, the enzyme does not represent the rate-limiting step in insulin secretion which is in contrast to SNPs in diabetes risk genes which influence both proinsulin conversion and insulin secretion.	10965	11162
20534142	Furthermore, the putative obesity risk allele of SNP rs6232 was unexpectedly associated with increased insulin sensitivity (fasting, OGTT-derived, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-clamp derived) and reduced 120-min glucose levels independently of BMI and proinsulin conversion.	11163	11439
20534142	The similar findings with different independent measurements of insulin sensitivity as well as the inverse influence on 120-min blood glucose argue against a mere statistical type 1 error.	11440	11628
20534142	Since only SNP rs6232 in the PCSK1 gene, the one that decreases the enzyme's catalytic activity, influences insulin sensitivity, independently of BMI and proinsulin conversion, and since there is a long list of potential substrates of the prohormone convertases, it seems reasonable to speculate that the enzyme also cleaves factors that modulate insulin sensitivity (e.g. BNDF).	11629	12008
20534142	In most cases, obesity is associated with insulin resistance.	12009	12070
20534142	However, a proportion of overweight/obese persons display a phenotype of obesity with is metabolically benign and characterized by high insulin sensitivity.	12071	12227
20534142	Since the minor allele of SNP rs6232 was associated with higher insulin sensitivity in our study and with obesity in a large metaanalysis including more then 13,000 subjects, we hypothesize that this allele may promote a kind of obesity, which is more benign.	12228	12487
20534142	Increased proinsulin levels are reported to be a marker of insulin resistance.	12488	12566
20534142	Interestingly, for carriers of PCSK1 SNP rs6232 it is the other way round: Those with higher proinsulin concentrations during the OGTT have also increased insulin sensitivity.	12567	12742
20534142	Similar findings are reported in another publication where insulin resistance was associated with enhanced proinsulin processing in subjects with normal glucose tolerance.	12743	12914
20534142	Hence, increased proinsulin concentration can not generally be seen as a marker of insulin resistance.	12915	13017
20534142	Our study was underpowered to detect the previous reported associations of the PCSK1 variants with obesity.	13018	13125
20534142	The associations with proinsulin conversion and insulin sensitivity found in this study clearly need replication in other cohorts, in particular, the unexpected association of SNP rs6232 with insulin sensitivity.	13126	13338
20534142	Furthermore, efforts should also be undertaken to identify prohormone convertase 1 substrates that alter insulin sensitivity and to further characterize these mechanisms.	13339	13509
20534142	Studies on the molecular level could additionally help to answer the question how PCSK1's SNP rs6235 influences proinsulin levels without changing the enzyme's activity.	13510	13679
20534142	In conclusion, our data suggest that the common genetic variants rs6232 and rs6235 within PCSK1 determine glucose-stimulated proinsulin conversion, but not insulin secretion.	13680	13854
20534142	In addition, rs6232, encoding the mutation N221D, influences glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity independently of BMI and proinsulin concentrations.	13855	14011
27184800	Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with a relatively broad spectrum, is a medically-approved treatment efficacious against advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other types of solid tumours.	0	196
27184800	In addition to its inhibitory effect on RAF and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) kinases, it is increasingly clear that sorafenib possesses other biochemical activities that might contribute to its anti-oncogenic efficacy.	197	438
27184800	Identification of specific biomarkers that could be used for the analysis of the contribution of each mode of action is needed in order to understand how sorafenib exerts its antioncogenic activity, and to allow for eventual repurposing and personalization of the prescription of this drug in clinics.	439	740
27184800	Recently, we and others reported that sorafenib is an inducer of oxidative stress [4–7], eventually leading to the occurrence of a new form of regulated necrosis, called ferroptosis, in various human cancer cell lines established from HCC and other solid tumours [5–9].	741	1010
27184800	Ferroptosis is a form of necrosis characterized by membrane lipid peroxidation [10, 11].	1011	1099
27184800	Interestingly, the ability of sorafenib to induce ferroptosis is not shared by other, clinically-approved kinase inhibitors, and is therefore probably unrelated to its inhibitory action on its essential target kinases.	1100	1318
27184800	The ability of sorafenib to induce ferroptosis might be partially explained by its ability to interfere with the function of the Xc(-) membrane transporter, a membrane transporter for the amino-acid cystine, a rate-limiting precursor for the synthesis of Glutathione (GSH).	1319	1592
27184800	In addition to depleting the intracellular GSH levels, sorafenib increases the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HCC cells [4, 9].	1593	1750
27184800	Interestingly, Coriat et al. found high levels of advanced oxidation products of proteins (AOPP), a marker of oxidative stress, in the serum of HCC patients treated with sorafenib.	1751	1931
27184800	While the findings of Coriat et al. suggest that this new mode of action of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells might be relevant to the clinical setting, AOPP do not constitute a specific marker and their measurement is not easily standardized [12, 13].	1932	2200
27184800	The identification of new biomarkers that would directly reflect the activity of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells is therefore awaited.	2201	2353
27184800	Metallothioneins (MT) are a family of small intracellular proteins that are ubiquitously expressed by eukaryotic cells and are characterized by a common structure and a high content of the amino-acid Cysteine [14, 15].	2354	2572
27184800	In humans, MTs are encoded by 17 genes defining four groups (MT1-MT4).	2573	2643
27184800	The first group, called MT1, is the largest and consists of 13 members.	2644	2715
27184800	Members of this group are important regulators of the homeostasis of zinc and copper ions, and play a role in the defence mechanisms of eukaryotic cells against heavy metals such as Cadmium.	2716	2906
27184800	MT1 also represent an important cellular defence against oxidative stress in various cell types.	2907	3003
27184800	Multiple alterations of the expression of individual isoforms of MT1 have been reported in solid tumours, some of which may be associated with the patient’s prognosis.	3004	3171
27184800	Individual isoforms of MT1 have also been reported to modulate the response of tumour cells to chemotherapeutic agents [17–19].	3172	3299
27184800	There is however little literature regarding the regulation and the possible role that MT1 might play in cancer cells exposed to targeted therapies, such as sorafenib.	3300	3467
27184800	In order to explore the response of HCC cells to sorafenib, we examined the transcriptome of Huh7 cells exposed to sorafenib (10 μM, 9 h) with genome-wide microarrays.	3468	3635
27184800	Interestingly, of the 35 genes that were found to be overexpressed by more than 3-fold upon sorafenib exposure, six were members of the MT1 family (Fig.	3636	3788
27184800	1a, see Additional file 1: Table S1).	3789	3826
27184800	Quantitative PCR confirmed the induction of these six genes (MT1B, MT1G, MT1E, MT1L, MT1M and MT1H), confirming the results of the microarray (Fig.	3827	3974
27184800	1b).	3975	3979
27184800	Immunoblot analysis also confirmed the induction of MT1 at the protein level (Fig.	3980	4062
27184800	1c).	4063	4067
27184800	These findings prompted us to examine the regulation of MT1 in cancer cells exposed to sorafenib.	4068	4165
27184800	The analysis of the threshold cycle (Ct) suggested that the MT1G gene was one of the most abundant isoforms of the MT1 family at the mRNA level in Huh7 cells.	4166	4324
27184800	Since MT1G was also one of the isoforms whose expression was most strongly induced by sorafenib, we centred our analysis on the regulation of this isoform.	4325	4480
27184800	We examined the effect produced by sorafenib in a panel of cancer cell lines originating from different types of human tumours (Fig.	4481	4613
27184800	1d).	4614	4618
27184800	Sorafenib was found to induce a robust increase in the levels of the mRNA encoding MT1G in the human cell lines Hep3B and BxPC3 established from HCC and Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, respectively (Fig.	4619	4817
27184800	1d).	4614	4618
27184800	In the other cells, the induction was either statistically-significant but of low amplitude (ACHN, NCIH) or absent (HCT116, PANC1, primary human hepatocytes) (Fig.	4823	4986
27184800	1d).	4614	4618
27184800	In each cell line, except for Huh7 cells, we observed that sorafenib had little effect on cell viability.	4992	5097
27184800	In Huh7 cells, overnight exposure to 10 μM sorafenib reduced cell viability by 15 %, shown by trypan blue exclusion.	5098	5214
27184800	The loss of viability never exceeded 5 % in the other cell lines (data not shown).	5215	5297
27184800	The effect of sorafenib on MT1G mRNA was therefore unrelated to its effect on cell viability.	5298	5391
27184800	In Huh7 cells, the induction of the MT1G mRNA was robust, and the effect produced by sorafenib was even superior to that of ZnCl2, the inducer of reference of MT1, in terms of potency for the induction of MT1G (Fig.	5392	5607
27184800	1e).	5608	5612
27184800	A similar pattern of induction was found with the MT1B mRNA (see Additional file 1: Figure S1).	5613	5708
27184800	We wondered whether other chemical inhibitors of kinases, applied at pharmacological concentrations, would induce an increase in the expression levels of MT1G mRNA (Fig 1f).	5709	5882
27184800	The following chemical inhibitors were applied to Huh7 cells: erlotinib (1 μM), directed against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), vemurafenib (10 μM), directed against the BRAF kinase, selumetinib (1 μM), directed against the kinases MEK1/2, and rapamycin (1 μM), directed against the kinase mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR).	5883	6224
27184800	None of these inhibitors increased the expression of MT1G in Huh7 cells (Fig.	6225	6302
27184800	1f).	5878	5882
27184800	In order to explore the possibility that oxidative stress might play a role in the overexpression of MT1 induced by sorafenib, Huh7 cells were treated with deferoxamine (DFX), an iron chelator reported to protect cancer cells from oxidative stress and ferroptosis by preventing the formation of potent oxidants [5, 10] before being exposed to sorafenib (Fig.	6308	6666
27184800	2a).	6667	6671
27184800	We found that DFX reduced the levels of MT1G mRNA in Huh7 cells exposed to sorafenib (10 μM, 18 h) (Fig.	6672	6776
27184800	2a).	6667	6671
27184800	In order to directly address the possibility that sorafenib might regulate the levels of MT1G via its ability to interfere with the transport of the amino-acid cystine, we preincubated Huh7 cells with N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC), a chemical precursor of cysteine and a potent antioxidant, before treatment with sorafenib (Fig.	6782	7104
27184800	2b).	7105	7109
27184800	We found that NAC radically prevented the increase in MT1G expression induced by sorafenib (Fig.	7110	7206
27184800	2b).	7105	7109
27184800	Comparable results were obtained with MT1B (see Additional file 1: Figure S2).	7212	7290
27184800	In order to further examine the impact of cystine transport inhibition on the regulation of MT1G, we applied sulfasalazine, a chemical inhibitor of the membrane transporter Xc(-) structurally-unrelated to sorafenib to Huh7 cells.	7291	7520
27184800	Sulfasalazine increased MT1G mRNA levels at a pharmacologically-active concentration of 300 μM, an effect that was blocked by NAC (Fig.	7521	7656
27184800	2c).	7657	7661
27184800	These findings pointed to oxidative stress and cysteine metabolism as playing a possible role in the regulation of MT1 gene expression in cancer cells exposed to sorafenib.	7662	7834
27184800	In order to identify the minimal region of MT1G promoter able to confer sorafenib inducibility, four constructs encompassing various portions of the MT1G promoter were introduced upstream of the gene encoding the enzyme luciferase.	7835	8066
27184800	Each reporter construct was transfected into Huh7 cells, and cells were subsequently exposed to sorafenib (Fig.	8067	8178
27184800	3a).	8179	8183
27184800	All constructions encompassing 133 nucleotides upstream of the transcription starting site conferred a strong, close to 10-fold inducibility by sorafenib (Fig.	8184	8343
27184800	3a).	8179	8183
27184800	Interestingly, this region of the promoter contains an Antioxidant Response Element (ARE).	8349	8439
27184800	We verified that this sequence confers redox control over the transcription of the MT1G gene by testing the effect of NAC on luciferase activity measured with the 1-133 construct (Fig.	8440	8624
27184800	3b).	8625	8629
27184800	Addition of NAC abolished the increase in Luciferase activity observed with sorafenib on the 1-133 construct, showing a redox-dependent regulation of this region of the MT1G promoter.	8630	8813
27184800	Antioxidant Response Elements (ARE) are cis-acting elements that are recognized by the transcription factor NRF2, reported to play an essential role in the coordination of the transcriptional response of eukaryotic cells exposed to conditions of oxidative stress.	8814	9077
27184800	Interestingly, sorafenib greatly increased the expression levels of NRF2 in Huh7 cells, and NAC abolished this increase (Fig.	9078	9203
27184800	3c).	9204	9208
27184800	In order to definitely establish the role of NRF2 in the regulation of the MT1G gene in cells exposed to sorafenib, we used RNA interference against NRF2.	9209	9363
27184800	Small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against NF2E2 was applied to Huh7 cells and was found to reduce the levels of NRF2 to 50 % of its control values (data not shown).	9364	9533
27184800	Compared to control conditions, it prevented the induction of MT1G observed upon exposure of Huh7 cells to sorafenib (10 μM, 18 h) (Fig.	9534	9670
27184800	3d).	9671	9675
27184800	The findings demonstrated a NRF2-dependent regulation of the transcription of the MT1G gene in cancer cells exposed to sorafenib.	9676	9805
27184800	In order to explore the significance of MT1 induction in cancer cells exposed to sorafenib, we knocked-down the expression of MT1G in Huh7 cells (Fig.	9806	9956
27184800	4a).	9957	9961
27184800	A siRNA that targets MT1G was found to abolish the induction of the corresponding mRNA in Huh7 cells exposed to sorafenib (Fig.	9962	10089
27184800	4a).	9957	9961
27184800	In the corresponding conditions, we did not detect any effect of MT1G on the expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, reflecting the impact of sorafenib on the RAF kinases (Fig.	10095	10275
27184800	4b).	10276	10280
27184800	We also did not find any difference in the expression levels of the protein PCNA (Proliferating cell nuclear antigen) or caspases, suggesting that neither cell proliferation nor apoptosis levels were significantly impacted by MT1G (Fig.	10281	10517
27184800	4b, data not shown).	10518	10538
27184800	A direct measurement of the levels of ferroptosis induced by sorafenib, performed by comparing the % LDH released in control- or siMT1G-treated Huh7 cells also failed to reveal any significant difference (Fig.	10539	10748
27184800	4c).	10749	10753
27184800	Cells with low levels of MT1G also displayed similar properties in clonogenic growth upon exposure to increasing concentrations of sorafenib (Fig.	10754	10900
27184800	4d), further suggesting the lack of an important modulatory effect of MT1G on the response of these cells to sorafenib.	10901	11020
27184800	In order to explore the clinical relevance of our findings, we carried out short-term culture of tumour explants prepared from five HCC tumours (Fig.	11021	11170
27184800	5a).	11171	11175
27184800	Tumour samples were obtained from five patients undergoing surgical resection with curative intent (see Additional file 1: Table S2).	11176	11309
27184800	The tumours were prepared as thin slices and maintained for 18 h in the presence of sorafenib in order to examine its effect on MT1G mRNA expression levels.	11310	11466
27184800	A more than two-fold increase in MT1G mRNA upon exposure to sorafenib (10 μM, 18 h) was seen in two out of the five HCC tumours (Fig.	11467	11600
27184800	5a).	11171	11175
27184800	Next, we measured the protein levels of MT1 in the serum of two cohorts of patients with HCC.	11606	11699
27184800	The clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in the Additional file 1: Table S3.	11700	11794
27184800	The first cohort consisted of 20 patients with HCC treated with sorafenib (Fig.	11795	11874
27184800	5b).	11875	11879
27184800	For each patient, serum samples were obtained before and 4 to 24 weeks after the onset of treatment with sorafenib.	11880	11995
27184800	Using an ELISA kit that measures the presence of all isoforms of MT1, we found that serum levels of MT1 significantly increased in the serum of patients with HCC treated with sorafenib (median value before sorafenib: 1225 pg/mL; median value after sorafenib: 1353 pg/mL, p < 0.05 using paired Wilcoxon test).	11996	12304
27184800	At the individual level, 7 out of the 20 patients in this exploratory cohort presented a more than three-fold increase in MT1 upon sorafenib treatment.	12305	12456
27184800	In order to examine the possibility that the induction of MT1 might partially reflect the exposure of tumour cells to sorafenib, we examined the serum trough concentration of sorafenib measured in individual patients (Fig.	12457	12679
27184800	5c).	12680	12684
27184800	Serum concentrations of sorafenib were highly heterogeneous among the patients, with a more than 80-fold difference between the minimum and the maximum concentrations (min.	12685	12857
27184800	concentration: 0.5 μM; max.	12858	12885
27184800	: 41.3 μM; median: 7.1 μM).	12885	12912
27184800	However, we found no significant difference in terms of induction of MT1 in the population with low concentrations of sorafenib (i.e. the patients with serum concentrations below the median) and the population with high concentrations of sorafenib (i.e. above the median): in these two groups, the median values calculated for the ratio MT1 after/before sorafenib were 2.05 and 1.22, respectively (p = 0.40 using Mann-Whitney).	12913	13340
27184800	To examine the clinical impact of MT1, serum levels of MT1 and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analysed in a second cohort of 55 patients with HCC treated with sorafenib.	13341	13542
27184800	We performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis comparing PFS and OS in the groups with the lowest and highest induction of MT1 upon sorafenib treatment (based on the calculation of the ratio of MT1 before/MT1 after sorafenib treatment, and using the median value as cut-off) (Fig.	13543	13813
27184800	5d, e).	13814	13821
27184800	This analysis revealed that the group of patients presenting with the highest induction of MT1 had a tendency toward a reduced PFS compared to the group with the lowest induction (Median PFS: 93 days vs 136 days, p = 0.08 using Log-rank test, Fig.	13822	14069
27184800	5d).	14070	14074
27184800	Strikingly, the group of patients presenting with the highest induction of MT1 had a significantly reduced OS compared to the group with the lowest induction (Median overall survival: 237 days vs 456 days, respectively; p < 0.05 using Log-rank test) (Fig.	14075	14330
27184800	5e).	14331	14335
27184800	No statistically-significant difference were found between the two groups in terms of clinical characteristics (Age, Sex, Child Pugh score, etiology of cirrhosis, or presence of metastasis) (data not shown).	14336	14543
27184800	We concluded that high induction of MT1 in the serum was indicative of poor prognosis in HCC patients treated with sorafenib.	14544	14669
27184800	In the present study, we identify MT1 as a potential new biomarker reflecting the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells.	14670	14812
27184800	We confirm and extend the conclusions of the previous studies that revealed that sorafenib is able to induce oxidative stress in various cancer cells, in vitro and in animal models [4–9].	14813	15000
27184800	Using a combination of pharmacological and molecular approaches we showed that the transcription factor NRF2, an essential regulator of redox metabolism in eukaryotic cells, is activated upon exposure of cancer cells to sorafenib.	15001	15231
27184800	We identified a region of 133 bp, located immediately upstream of the transcription start site in the promoter of MT1G, that constitutes the minimal region able to confer transcriptional inducibility by sorafenib.	15232	15445
27184800	This region of the promoter contains an ARE, known to constitute a recognition site for NRF2 [21, 22].	15446	15548
27184800	In full agreement with these observations, we showed that pharmacological anti-oxidants, such as NAC, or the knock-down of NRF2 prevented the induction of MT1G induced by sorafenib.	15549	15730
27184800	Interestingly, we observed no induction of MT1G in primary human hepatocytes, and a striking specificity was also observed when sorafenib was compared with a panel of other clinically-approved kinase inhibitors in terms of ability to induce MT1G.	15731	15977
27184800	Our study therefore identifies MT1G as a gene whose expression levels reflect the specific effect of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells.	15978	16129
27184800	Redox metabolism of cancer cells is an essential facet of tumour physiology and a major determinant of cancer cell fate during tumour development and in the therapeutic context [24–26].	16130	16315
27184800	The NRF2 transcription factor is an essential coordinator for the regulation of the expression of the main genes and molecules with antioxidant function in eukaryotic cells.	16316	16489
27184800	Exome sequencing of human HCC tumours revealed the presence of somatic mutations that activate NRF2 in a substantial fraction of HCC [27–29].	16490	16631
27184800	Recently, the NRF2 status was directly reported to modulate the response of HCC cells to sorafenib.	16632	16731
27184800	In HCC cells with low levels of NRF2 achieved through RNA interference, sorafenib was found to induce ferroptosis with a higher efficacy.	16732	16869
27184800	These findings suggest that the NRF2 status could be an important determinant of the response of sorafenib, though it is presently partially unclear which target genes could mediate this effect of NRF2.	16870	17072
27184800	In the present study, we did not observe a modulatory role of MT1G on the clonogenic growth of HCC cells or their susceptibility to ferroptosis, a new form or regulated oxidative necrosis.	17073	17261
27184800	At this stage, it must however be pointed out that functional redundancy between the isoforms of MT1, and the choice of the genetic background used to explore the role of MT1G may explain the lack of a phenotype.	17262	17474
27184800	More studies are required to address the role of MT1 in solid tumours, especially in the context of therapeutic targeting.	17475	17597
27184800	Our analyses performed using tumour explants and serum samples obtained from cancer patients treated with sorafenib demonstrate the clinical applicability of MT1 as a biomarker.	17598	17775
27184800	Compared to the previous report by Coriat et al. presenting a first clinical analysis centred on the measurement of serum levels of AOPP, our study brings three important additional pieces of information: i) Firstly, the measurement of MT1 provides a more specific and standardizable analysis for the study of the effects of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells than AOPP; ii) Secondly, our study highlights the existence of important individual heterogeneity in terms of the ability of sorafenib to activate the transcription of the MT1 genes.	17776	18333
27184800	Tumour-intrinsic determinants at least partially account for this heterogeneity, since we observed that human cancer cell lines and individual tumour explants present great differences in their induction of MT1G mRNA upon exposure to sorafenib.	18334	18578
27184800	Based on our results demonstrating the role of oxidative metabolism in the regulation of MT1G, it is tempting to speculate that this patient heterogeneity might at least partially reflect individual differences in the effects of sorafenib on the oxidative metabolism of cancer cells in different tumours.	18579	18883
27184800	Whether these differences are related to tumour genotype and the presence of somatic mutations of NRF2 [27–29] is an interesting possibility, but further studies are required to address these possibilities; iii) thirdly, HCC patients with the highest induction of MT1 have reduced overall survival under sorafenib treatment, suggesting the possibility that the alteration of the redox metabolism of cancer cells might be detrimental to HCC patients receiving sorafenib.	18884	19353
27184800	These conclusions might at first-look appear to be in contrast with the work by Coriat et al. and the in vitro studies that recently highlighted the remarkable ability of sorafenib to induce ferroptosis [5–7].	19354	19563
27184800	A possible explanation might be that the serum levels of AOPP and the markers of ferroptosis reflect intense oxidative damage induced by sorafenib, while the present study explored the transcriptional regulation of MT1 in cancer cells, and therefore the impact of sorafenib at lower, sub-cytotoxic concentrations.	19564	19877
27184800	Whether such an effect of sorafenib could limit its anti-oncogenic activity, perhaps by activating specific oncogenic signal transduction cascades in tumour cells [30, 31], is an interesting possibility that deserves further study.	19878	20109
27184800	Our findings further establish the remarkable ability of sorafenib to alter the redox metabolism of some, but not all cancer cells.	20110	20241
27184800	We show that MT1 constitute a biomarker adapted for exploring the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells.	20242	20368

27184800	Transfection was performed using the Genjet reagent, as indicated by the provider (Tebu-Bio).	21755	21848
27184800	Luciferase activity was measured on a CentroLB 960 Microplate Luminometer (Berthold).	21849	21934
27184800	All values were normalized according to the protein concentration of the extracts, and a fold induction was calculated by comparing control vs sorafenib conditions.	21935	22099
27184800	We have previously reported the use of short-term culture of tumour explants for the exploration of the individual sensitivity of HCC tumours to sorafenib.	22100	22255

28368423	Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a spectrum of morphologically, phenotypically, and genetically distinct lymphomas with ~85% of B lymphocyte lineage.	0	154
28368423	Overexpression of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC is associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor overall survival, regardless of the B-NHL subtype (1–4).	155	320
28368423	Dysregulated Myc expression in primary murine B cells drives cellular transformation and lymphomagenesis and is necessary for both human and murine lymphoma maintenance (5–7).	321	496
28368423	Signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR) in the absence of antigenic stimulation is important for normal B cell differentiation and survival (8, 9).	497	648
28368423	Additionally, ligation of the BCR induces a cascade of phosphorylation events and activation of multiple kinases, including the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), leading to MAPK and NF-κB activation and a gene expression signature enriched for MYC-induced genes (10–12).	649	950
28368423	Independently of BTK, SYK can activate an alternative pro-survival pathway through PI3K/AKT (13).	951	1048
28368423	Aberrant or chronic BCR signaling is commonly observed in B-NHL and contributes to lymphoma growth and survival, but the mechanisms for this remain incompletely understood (14–16).	1049	1229
28368423	Targeting the BCR pathway by silencing signaling proteins has deleterious effects on lymphoma cells with chronic BCR activation (14), and pharmacologic inhibition of BTK by ibrutinib has shown encouraging results in the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-NHL (17–19).	1230	1497
28368423	Recent studies in human lymphoma cell lines identified components of the BCR pathway as possible MYC transcriptional targets (20).	1498	1628
28368423	Additionally, the MYC-regulated miRNA cistron miR-17~92 was reported to influence BCR signaling in lymphoma cell lines (21).	1629	1753
28368423	Although these studies suggest a link between MYC overexpression and BCR signaling in lymphoma, the relationship between MYC and BCR signaling in non-transformed B lymphocytes was unknown.	1754	1942
28368423	Therefore, we investigated BCR signaling in pre-malignant B cells.	1943	2009
28368423	We determined the levels of activated forms of multiple components of the BCR signaling pathway were increased both at rest and following ligation of the BCR in primary B cells overexpressing Myc.	2010	2206
28368423	Myc overexpressing B cells were less sensitive to Btk inhibition by ibrutinib, and off-target effects of ibrutinib were also identified.	2207	2343
28368423	These studies highlight the relationship between Myc overexpression and pro-survival signaling, identify a means by which Myc drives lymphomagenesis, and provide insight into treatment strategies for patients with lymphoma expressing high levels of MYC protein.	2344	2605
28368423	To investigate the influence of Myc on BCR signaling prior to cellular transformation, spleens were harvested from Eμ-myc transgenic mice, which overexpress Myc specifically in B cells ((5) and Supplemental Fig S1), before the development of lymphoma.	2606	2857
28368423	Spleens from wild-type littermates served as controls.	2858	2912
28368423	Basal activity of BCR signaling proteins was interrogated in IgM+, CD19+ splenic B cells by intracellular phospho-flow cytometry (schematic Fig 1A).	2913	3061
28368423	Unstimulated B lymphocytes from Eμ-myc mice demonstrated significantly increased levels of phospho-Btk (36% elevated, p=0.0179), phospho-Plcγ2 (48% and 40% elevated at Y759 and Y1217, p=0.0013 and 0.0050, respectively), and phospho-Erk1/2 (56% elevated, p=0.0007) compared to wild-type B cells (Fig 1B).	3062	3365
28368423	Levels of phospho-CD79α and phospho-Syk were also increased in unstimulated Eμ-myc splenic B cells (28% and 9% elevated, respectively; Fig 1B), but differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.07 and p=0.12, respectively).	3366	3599
28368423	Therefore, Myc overexpression alone increased basal signaling of several proteins in the BCR pathway in primary, non-transformed B cells.	3600	3737
28368423	Ligation of the BCR activates signaling of the pathway above basal levels (22).	3738	3817
28368423	To determine whether Myc expression affects activated BCR signaling, we ligated the BCR with anti-IgM F(ab’)2.	3818	3928
28368423	At intervals after BCR ligation, proteins in the BCR pathway were evaluated by intracellular phospho-flow cytometry.	3929	4045
28368423	We detected robust activation of proteins that are activated early following IgM ligation (e.g., CD79α, Syk, Btk, and Plcγ2) in both Eμ-myc and wild-type splenic B cells (Fig 1C).	4046	4225
28368423	Although the activation curves were similar in Eμ-myc and wild-type cells, with 2–4 fold increases in each phospho-protein following ligation of the BCR, there were notable differences.	4226	4411
28368423	Specifically, although basal levels of activated CD79α were statistically equivalent in Eμ-myc and wild-type B cells, there was a sharp increase in phospho-CD79α in Eμ-myc cells that significantly exceeded that of wild-type cells at 5 (p=0.0041), 10 (p=0.0115), 30 (p=0.0065), and 60 minutes (p=0.0055) following BCR ligation (upper left, Fig 1C).	4412	4759
28368423	Phospho-CD79α peaked within 30 minutes in Eμ-myc B cells at a level 2.8-fold above the baseline.	4760	4856
28368423	In contrast, phospho-CD79α peaked later in wild-type B cells, achieving a level 2.6-fold above baseline 60 minutes after BCR ligation (upper left, Fig 1C).	4857	5012
28368423	Additionally, although activation of Syk in Eμ-myc B cells paralleled that of wild-type B cells (middle left, Fig 1C), the levels of activated downstream proteins phospho-Btk (bottom left, Fig 1C) and phospho-Plcγ2 (Y1217) (middle right, Fig 1C) started and remained significantly higher in Eμ-myc B cells over 60 minutes after BCR ligation.	5013	5354
28368423	Levels of phospho-Plcγ2 (Y759) were slightly higher in Eμ-myc cells until 30 minutes following BCR ligation and then decreased at a faster rate than wild-type cells (upper right, Fig 1C).	5355	5542
28368423	Together these data indicate Myc overexpression altered the activation of critical BCR signaling proteins in non-transformed B cells following BCR ligation resulting in augmentation of BCR signaling.	5543	5742
28368423	Although phospho-Erk1/2 levels in Eμ-myc B cells were constitutively higher (52–81% higher) than in wild-type cells, we did not detect an expected increase in phospho-Erk levels following BCR ligation in either genotype (bottom right, Fig 1C).	5743	5986
28368423	Other known BCR downstream effector proteins, including NF-κB and p38MAPK, exhibited similar results (Supplemental Fig S2).	5987	6110
28368423	Because multiple signals converge on downstream effector proteins, we postulated their activation is likely to be tightly regulated by phosphatases and thus, more difficult to detect.	6111	6294
28368423	To further investigate Erk phosphorylation, we added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) after BCR ligation to transiently inactivate protein tyrosine phosphatases and allow accumulation of phosphorylated Erk.	6295	6493
28368423	Phospho-Erk1/2 levels increased nearly 5-fold in both Eμ-myc and wild-type splenic B cells 10 minutes after BCR ligation and addition of H2O2 (top left, Fig 2A).	6494	6655
28368423	Phosphatases typically recover from H2O2 inactivation resulting in reduced phospho-protein levels by 30 minutes (23).	6656	6773
28368423	However, we observed in repeated experiments phospho-Erk1/2 levels in Eμ-myc B cells declined more slowly compared to wild-type B cells in the presence of H2O2, remaining above baseline and nearly 50% higher than wild-type levels 30 minutes after BCR ligation.	6774	7034
28368423	Therefore, Erk1/2 activity is differentially regulated in B cells that overexpress Myc, resulting in constitutively higher phospho-Erk1/2 levels and sustained signaling following BCR ligation.	7035	7227
28368423	We also evaluated other proteins in the BCR signaling pathway in the presence of H2O2.	7228	7314
28368423	Addition of H2O2 alone caused minimal accumulation of phosphorylated proteins in either genotype.	7315	7412
28368423	However, following BCR ligation, H2O2 augmented activation of CD79α, Syk, Btk, and Plcγ2, which peaked by 10 minutes and returned to near baseline levels by 30 minutes in both genotypes, and again levels were significantly higher in Eμ-myc B cells.	7413	7661
28368423	For example, following BCR ligation and addition of H2O2, phospho-CD79α and phospho-Plcγ2 (Y759) levels in Eμ-myc B cells increased 10- and 11-fold, respectively, as compared to 7- and 9- fold in wild-type B cells and resulted in significantly higher peak phospho-protein levels at 10 minutes [p=0.0013 for CD79α and p=0.0150 for Plcγ2 (Y759)] (middle, Fig 2A).	7662	8023
28368423	Although phospho-Syk and phospho-Plcγ2 (Y1217) levels increased 5- and 7-fold, respectively in B cells of both genotypes 10 minutes after BCR ligation and addition of H2O2 (bottom, Fig 2A), peak phospho-protein levels were significantly higher in Eμ-myc B cells compared to wild-type [p=0.0012 for Syk and p=0.0154 for Plcγ2 (Y1217)].	8024	8358
28368423	Additionally, the phospho-Btk levels were significantly higher in Eμ-myc cells (p=0.0001) 10 minutes after BCR ligation and H2O2 addition (upper right panel, Fig 2A), even though phospho-Btk increased nearly 25-fold in wild-type B cells compared to 11-fold in Eμ-myc cells.	8359	8632
28368423	Histograms of fluorescence in B cells from a representative experiment illustrate increased phospho-protein levels 10 minutes after BCR ligation and/or H2O2 addition by a shift of the curves to the right and return toward baseline by 30 minutes (Fig 2B).	8633	8887
28368423	These data provide additional evidence that untransformed Myc overexpressing B cells have increased basal BCR signaling and that Myc further increases BCR signaling upon receptor ligation.	8888	9076
28368423	Following BCR ligation, Syk phosphorylates tyrosine-551 of Btk, which prompts autophosphorylation of tyrosine-223 in Btk (24).	9077	9203
28368423	Ibrutinib covalently binds Btk near the ATP binding domain to irreversibly inhibit Btk activity (25).	9204	9305
28368423	Given the robust activation of Btk in Eμ-myc B lymphocytes following BCR ligation, we postulated ibrutinib would be a potent inhibitor of Btk activation in B cells that overexpressed Myc.	9306	9493
28368423	We first evaluated basal levels of phospho-Btk (Y223) in splenic B cells treated with increasing concentrations of ibrutinib.	9494	9619
28368423	Treatment with ibrutinib induced equivalent dose-dependent decreases in basal levels of phospho-Btk in wild-type and Eμ-myc B cells (Fig 3A), with a 38% decrease using 12.5 μM ibrutinib and a 58% decrease with 62.5 μM ibrutinib.	9620	9848
28368423	After BCR stimulation, there was a greater reduction in phospho-Btk levels in Eμ-myc B cells compared to wild-type cells, with 12.5 μM ibrutinib achieving 42% reduction in phospho-Btk in Eμ-myc B cells, but only 26% reduction in wild-type cells (Fig.	9849	10099
28368423	3B).	10100	10104
28368423	Nevertheless, absolute levels of phospho-Btk remained higher in Eμ-myc B cells than in wild-type cells over the range of ibrutinib concentrations (Fig.	10105	10256
28368423	3B).	10100	10104
28368423	Notably, the level of phospho-Btk in 12.5 μM ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc B lymphocytes was analogous to the level of phospho-Btk in untreated wild-type cells 10 minutes after BCR ligation (p = 0.54; Fig.	10262	10462
28368423	3B).	10100	10104
28368423	We also investigated downstream of Btk by assessing basal and BCR stimulated levels of phospho-Plcγ2 (Y759) and phospho-Erk1/2 in the presence of ibrutinib.	10468	10624
28368423	Ibrutinib treatment led to dose-dependent decreases in phospho-Plcγ2 (Y759) in unstimulated B cells and B cells after BCR ligation (Supplemental Fig S3A and B).	10625	10785
28368423	Ibrutinib did not affect basal levels of phospho-Erk (T203/Y205) even in the presence of H2O2 (Supplemental Fig S3C), but potently reduced stimulated phospho-Erk levels (Supplemental Fig S3D).	10786	10978
28368423	Importantly, at any concentration of ibrutinib, levels of phospho-Btk, phospho-Plcγ2, and phospho-Erk remained higher in Eμ-myc B cells than in wild-type.	10979	11133
28368423	Therefore, Myc overexpression renders B cells relatively resistant to Btk inhibition by ibrutinib.	11134	11232
28368423	Based on its mechanism of action and reported specificity for Btk inhibition (25), we expected ibrutinib would inhibit Btk phosphorylation and consequently, phosphorylation of downstream components of BCR signaling (e.g., Plcγ2 and Erk1/2; Fig 1A).	11233	11481
28368423	While treatment with ibrutinib (12.5 μM) reduced phospho-Btk levels in IgM-ligated Eμ-myc B cells by 47%, these levels were equivalent to the IgM-stimulated phospho-Btk levels in wild-type B cells that did not receive ibrutinib (MFI 255 versus 194, respectively, p=0.11) (Fig 4A, 3rd bar versus last bar).	11482	11787
28368423	Ibrutinib (12.5 μM) had little effect on basal levels of phospho-Plcγ2 (Y759) in both genotypes (Fig 4B, 0 min DMSO versus 0 min ibrutinib).	11788	11928
28368423	However, the levels of phospho-Plcγ2 (Y759) after BCR ligation remained ~50% higher in ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc B cells than ibrutinib-treated wild-type cells (MFI 93 versus 60, respectively, p=0.0016, Fig 4B last two bars), and this level in ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc B cells was analogous to the level of phospho-Plcγ2 (Y759) in IgM-stimulated wild-type B cells that had not been treated with ibrutinib (MFI 95, p=0.42; Fig 4B, 3rd bar versus last bar).	11929	12383
28368423	Absolute levels of phospho-Erk and phospho-Plcγ2 (Y1217) were significantly higher in Eμ-myc B cells than in wild-type B cells, but we did not detect an increase in activation following BCR ligation or an effect of ibrutinib in the absence of H2O2 (Fig 4C and Supplemental Fig S4A, respectively).	12384	12680
28368423	We again utilized H2O2 to better visualize the effects of ibrutinib on phospho-Erk1/2.	12681	12767
28368423	As we observed previously with addition of H2O2, Erk1/2 activation was detectable 10 minutes after BCR ligation and persisted in Eμ-myc cells beyond that in wild-type cells (Fig 4D).	12768	12950
28368423	Treatment with ibrutinib attenuated activation of Erk1/2 in both genotypes, but phospho-Erk1/2 levels remained higher in the Eμ-myc B cells at every time evaluated (Fig 4D, p=0.0008, 0.0522, and 0.0413 at 0, 10, and 30 minutes, respectively).	12951	13193
28368423	H2O2 also accentuated the differences between Eμ-myc and wild-type B cells upon ibrutinib treatment when evaluating Plcγ2.	13194	13316
28368423	Phospho-Plcγ2 (Y759) in ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc B cells was 1.3-fold and 4.2-fold greater than in ibrutinib-treated wild-type cells at 10 and 30 minutes, respectively, after BCR ligation and addition of H2O2 (p=0.0201 and p=0.0013, respectively, Fig 4E).	13317	13572
28368423	The absolute levels of phospho-Plcγ2 (Y759) in ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc B cells were statistically equivalent to levels in wild-type cells that were not treated with ibrutinib (MFI 116000 and 113250, respectively, at 10 min, p=0.39; MFI 34402 and 31520, respectively, at 30 minutes, p=0.28) (Fig 4E, dashed line with square symbol versus solid line with circle symbol).	13573	13942
28368423	Levels of phospho-Plcγ2 (Y1217) also remained higher in Eμ-myc cells than in wild-type B cells despite ibrutinib treatment (Supplemental Fig S4B).	13943	14089
28368423	Thus, as predicted, ibrutinib blunted the phosphorylation of Plcγ2 and Erk1/2; however, more complete inhibition was evident in wild-type B cells.	14090	14236
28368423	We also evaluated the effect of ibrutinib on the BCR pathway upstream of Btk (Fig 1A), originally as a negative control, as ibrutinib is a Btk-specific inhibitor and should not alter signaling upstream of Btk (25).	14237	14451
28368423	Unexpectedly, in both wild-type and Eμ-myc B cells, CD79α and Syk phosphorylation was also inhibited by ibrutinib (Fig 5A and 5B).	14452	14582
28368423	There was little effect on basal levels of phospho-CD79α with ibrutinib treatment (Fig 5A, first two bars versus 5th and 6th bars), but a pronounced reduction was evident in BCR stimulated cells (~30% reduction in both genotypes) (Fig 5A, 2nd and 3rd bars versus last two bars).	14583	14861
28368423	As with Btk, BCR stimulated phospho-CD79α levels were similar in ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc B cells and wild-type B cells that were not ibrutinib-treated (Fig 5A, 3rd bar versus last bar, p=0.506).	14862	15057
28368423	Treatment with ibrutinib (12.5 μM) reduced basal and BCR-stimulated phospho-Syk levels in both genotypes, with a 48% reduction in phospho-Syk levels in wild-type cells and a 34% decrease in Eμ-myc cells 30 minutes after BCR ligation (Fig 5B, 3rd bar versus 7th bar and 4th bar versus last bar, respectively).	15058	15366
28368423	Dose titration experiments indicated that even 0.0025 μM ibrutinib caused significant reductions in basal phospho-Syk in wild-type (9.3% reduction, p=0.0263) and Eμ-myc B cells (10.3% reduction, p=0.0188) (Supplemental Fig S5A).	15367	15595
28368423	Higher concentrations of ibrutinib (0.25 μM for wild-type, p=0.1367 and 0.03125 μM for Eμ-myc, p=0.0044) were required to achieve 10% reductions in phospho-Syk after BCR ligation (Supplemental Fig S5B).	15596	15798
28368423	These data indicate ibrutinib treatment inhibits more than just Btk activation in B cells.	15799	15889
28368423	To determine whether ibrutinib inhibits phosphorylation of CD79α and Syk directly or by a feedback loop with Btk or downstream effector molecules, we first evaluated total Btk levels in wild-type B cells after ibrutinib treatment.	15890	16120
28368423	Ibrutinib treatment did not alter total Btk levels in B cells (top panel, Fig 5C).	16121	16203
28368423	We also evaluated B cells from Btk-null mice, which do not express Btk protein ((26, 27) and Fig 5C, top panel).	16204	16316
28368423	In BCR ligated Btk−/− B cells, ibrutinib treatment did not affect phosphorylation of CD79α (middle panel, Fig 5C), whereas there was significantly reduced phosphorylation of Syk (bottom panel, Fig 5C).	16317	16518
28368423	Interestingly, levels of activated CD79α and Syk following BCR ligation were significantly higher in Btk−/− B cells than wild-type B cell controls.	16519	16666
28368423	In addition, Btk−/− B cells were more sensitive to Syk inhibition by ibrutinib than wild-type B cells, as evidenced by a 26% reduction in phospho-Syk 10 minutes after ligation of the BCR in ibrutinib-treated Btk−/− B cells but only 11% reduction in phospho-Syk levels in wild-type B cells (p=0.0015).	16667	16967
28368423	Additionally, dose-dependent decreases in phospho-Syk levels in Btk−/− B cells were similar to wild-type and Eμ-myc B cells (Supplemental Fig S6A).	16968	17115
28368423	Finally, Myc levels were evaluated in wild-type and Eμ-myc B cells and shown to not be affected by ibrutinib treatment in either genotype (Supplemental Fig S6B), indicating the inhibition of signaling upstream of Btk by ibrutinib was not due to a reduction in Myc.	17116	17380
28368423	Together these results imply that direct off-target effects are likely responsible for the reduction in phospho-Syk detected in B cells treated with ibrutinib.	17381	17540
28368423	The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated following ligation of the BCR by cross-talk with kinases such as Syk (Fig 1A and (13)).	17541	17662
28368423	Thus, we evaluated the effect of Myc overexpression on activation of Akt and ribosomal S6 kinases by evaluating phosphorylation of threonine-308 and serine-473 of Akt and ribosomal protein S6 (S6RP), respectively.	17663	17876
28368423	In both Eμ-myc and wild-type B cells, small increases in phospho-Akt (T308) occurred quickly following BCR ligation (left panel, Fig 6A), and returned to baseline within 30 minutes, whereas no significant changes were detected in phospho-Akt (S473) (middle panel, Fig 6A).	17877	18149
28368423	Notably, levels of phospho-Akt (T308 and S473) were constitutively higher in Eμ-myc B cells compared to wild-type B cells (Fig 6A).	18150	18281
28368423	Following ligation of the BCR, phosphorylation of S6RP increased similarly in Eμ-myc and wild-type B cells over 60 minutes (right panel, Fig 6A), but diverged by 180 minutes, when higher levels of phospho-S6RP were detected in Eμ-myc B cells compared to wild-type cells (p=0.0562).	18282	18563
28368423	Although H2O2 has little direct effect on serine/threonine phosphatases, it can indirectly impact them through upstream tyrosine kinases (28); consequently, we evaluated both phospho-Akt sites following addition of H2O2.	18564	18784
28368423	Addition of H2O2 immediately after BCR ligation further accentuated the early increase in phospho-Akt (T308) (left panel, Fig 6B) and revealed a BCR ligation-induced increase in phospho-Akt (S473) that was not evident in absence of H2O2 (middle panel, Fig 6B).	18785	19045
28368423	H2O2 had minimal effect on detection of phospho-S6RP in wild-type B cells, but allowed a slight accumulation of phospho-S6RP in Eμ-myc cells (right panel, Fig 6B), suggesting altered regulation of S6-kinases in Myc overexpressing cells.	19046	19282
28368423	We also assessed whether ibrutinib affected Akt phosphorylation.	19283	19347
28368423	Treatment with ibrutinib reduced basal and BCR-stimulated phospho-Akt (T308) in Eμ-myc and wild-type B cells, but absolute levels were higher in ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc cells than in untreated wild-type cells (left upper panel, Fig 6C).	19348	19585
28368423	Upon exposure to H2O2, proportionally larger reductions in phospho-Akt (T308) occurred in ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc B cells, but again the levels remained higher in ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc cells compared to wild-type cells that were not treated with ibrutinib (left lower panel, Fig 6C).	19586	19873
28368423	Phosphorylation of Akt (S473) was not affected by ibrutinib treatment in either genotype in the absence or presence of H2O2 (upper and lower middle panels, Fig 6C).	19874	20038
28368423	Ibrutinib treatment significantly inhibited basal and BCR-stimulated phosphorylation of S6RP in both Eμ-myc and wild-type B cells in the absence (upper right panel, Fig 6C) and presence (lower right panel, Fig 6C) of H2O2.	20039	20261
28368423	Again, phospho-S6RP levels remained higher in ibrutinib-treated Eμ-myc cells than wild-type B cells and were similar to levels in untreated wild-type B cells.	20262	20420
28368423	Together these data indicate Myc overexpression activates PI3K/Akt signaling and that ibrutinib has previously unappreciated effects beyond Btk inhibition.	20421	20576
28368423	Myc is required for the growth and survival of B cell lymphomas, and its overexpression is frequently selected for in these malignancies (7).	20577	20718
28368423	Genetically engineered mice showed Myc overexpression induces B cell transformation, solidifying Myc as a driver of B cell lymphoma (5).	20719	20855
28368423	However, the cellular mechanisms by which Myc dysregulation induces B cell transformation had not been fully explored.	20856	20974
28368423	Our study focused on cell signaling and revealed that prior to cellular transformation, Myc overexpression alone led to increased signaling through pro-growth and survival pathways, including the BCR and PI3K/Akt pathways.	20975	21197
28368423	There was significantly increased basal activation of Btk, Plcγ2, Erk1/2, and Akt in non-transformed, primary splenic B cells from Eμ-myc mice compared to wild-type littermates.	21198	21375
28368423	Moreover, our data show these Myc-mediated increases in signaling cannot be fully inhibited with ibrutinib, which has clinical implications.	21376	21516
28368423	Ligation of the BCR prompts phosphorylation of downstream kinases and effector molecules, such as Syk, Btk, Plcγ2, and Erk1/2, as well as components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in normal B lymphocytes (Fig 1A).	21517	21723
28368423	Following BCR ligation in B cells from Eμ-myc mice, we detected more robust activation of CD79α, Btk, and Plcγ2.	21724	21836
28368423	Additionally, levels of phospho-Erk1/2 and phospho-Akt were constitutively higher in B cells from Eμ-myc mice.	21837	21947
28368423	Increased BCR signaling is reported to contribute to B cell lymphoma development (29).	21948	22034
28368423	Finally, as evidenced by increased levels of phospho-S6RP 180 minutes after BCR ligation, Myc overexpression led to sustained activity of ribosomal S6-kinases, which are important regulators of cell growth and metabolism.	22035	22256
28368423	Although we detected high levels of activated Erk1/2 and p38MAPK in B cells from Eμ-myc mice, we were unable to detect further activation in either genotype following BCR ligation.	22257	22437
28368423	Consequently, we utilized H2O2, which allowed phosphorylated proteins to accumulate, and as such, we were able to detect BCR-induced increases in phospho-Erk and phospho-p38MAPK, implying these kinases are tightly regulated.	22438	22662
28368423	Although phosphatases that regulate upstream proteins in the BCR pathway had rebounded by 30 minutes after H2O2 addition, phospho-Erk1/2 levels remained elevated, suggesting phosphatases that regulate Erk activation are more sensitive to H2O2 inhibition.	22663	22917
28368423	Furthermore, altered regulation of Erk1/2 activation in Eμ-myc B cells allowed for higher basal and more sustained BCR-stimulated Erk signaling.	22918	23062
28368423	Levels of phospho-p38MAPK were also higher in Eμ-myc B cells compared to wild-type.	23063	23146
28368423	These results are consistent with our previous report that Myc overexpression was sufficient to induce Ras/MAPK signaling (30).	23147	23274
28368423	Together these data indicate Erk1/2 and p38MAPK are involved in BCR signaling and are regulated by mechanisms that are different than upstream kinases.	23275	23426
28368423	Activation of BCR signaling leads to a transcriptional program that is enriched for MYC and MYC-induced genes (10, 11).	23427	23546
28368423	Additionally, genomic studies in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines identified CD79β and SYK as potential transcriptional targets of MYC (20), and the MYC-regulated miR-17~92 cluster augments signaling through the BCR in transformed lymphoma cells (21).	23547	23793
28368423	These reports together with our data suggest a feed-forward loop, whereby MYC expression increases BCR signaling, which further amplifies MYC activation, and so on.	23794	23958
28368423	Importantly, our data indicate that such a feed-forward mechanism is not dependent on oncogenic transformation, as Myc overexpression alone augmented both basal and stimulated signaling by multiple proteins in the BCR signaling cascade in non-transformed B cells.	23959	24222
28368423	Aberrant activation of BCR and PI3K/Akt signaling has been demonstrated in B-NHL.	24223	24304
28368423	Prolonged or continuous signaling via the BCR pathway and reduced sensitivity to negative regulation have been identified in various lymphoid malignancies (14, 16, 31, 32).	24305	24477
28368423	Our data indicate that elevated Myc levels likely contribute to this increased signaling.	24478	24567
28368423	Moreover, since inhibition of BCR activation in vitro by genetic or pharmacologic means has proven deleterious to lymphoma growth and survival (14, 16, 33, 34), pharmacologic inhibition has been an attractive prospect for drug development.	24568	24807
28368423	Indeed, ibrutinib is efficacious in the treatment of indolent B-NHL (17–19); however, a subset is refractory to ibrutinib.	24808	24930
28368423	We determined that hyperactivation of BCR signaling by Myc confers relative resistance to Btk inhibition by ibrutinib.	24931	25049
28368423	While ibrutinib did reduce phosphorylation and activation of Btk in Myc overexpressing B cells, absolute levels of activated Btk and downstream proteins Plcγ2 and Erk1/2 remained higher following ibrutinib treatment than the levels in untreated wild-type B cells.	25050	25313
28368423	Our studies predict that B-NHL with increased MYC expression may be less likely to respond to ibrutinib specifically and possibly BCR inhibition more generally.	25314	25474
28368423	While MYC expression in indolent lymphomas is not routinely evaluated, it may be worthwhile if ibrutinib treatment is being considered.	25475	25610
28368423	Furthermore, although aberrant BCR signaling has been demonstrated in aggressive large cell lymphomas, ibrutinib therapy has not been as successful (17).	25611	25764
28368423	We postulate that differential responses to ibrutinib treatment may correlate with MYC expression, recognizing that MYC overexpression is associated with more aggressive lymphoma phenotypes.	25765	25955
28368423	We observed treatment with ibrutinib impaired activation of Btk and downstream signaling molecules, but also reduced activation of upstream signaling proteins CD79α, Syk, and Akt in both Myc overexpressing and wild-type B cells.	25956	26184
28368423	These results were unexpected, since ibrutinib is reported to be highly specific for Btk (25, 35).	26185	26283
28368423	Ibrutinib did not affect SYK phosphorylation in a previous report, but only tyrosine-352 was interrogated (34), whereas SYK activation is complicated by phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues, the roles of which have not been fully elucidated (36, 37).	26284	26543
28368423	Nevertheless, tyrosine-352 is believed to lie in a regulatory domain, whereas tyrosine-525/526 are in the activation loop and are autophosphorylated upon ligation of the BCR (37), and reportedly are better predictors of SYK activity in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (38).	26544	26815
28368423	Therefore, we evaluated phosphorylation of the murine homologous residues, tyrosine-519/520.	26816	26908
28368423	Data showed inhibition of Syk phosphorylation by ibrutinib occurred in Myc overexpressing and wild-type B cells in a dose-dependent manner.	26909	27048
28368423	This inhibition was also observed in Btk−/− B cells, indicating it is an off-target effect rather than the result of a regulatory feedback loop.	27049	27193
28368423	Therefore, the ibrutinib-mediated reduction in phospho-Akt and phospho-S6RP we detected may be secondary to Syk inhibition, as Syk activates PI3K/Akt signaling following BCR ligation (13).	27194	27382
28368423	These unexpected findings could provide an alternative explanation for the increased bleeding risk in patients treated with ibrutinib, which has been previously linked to ineffective collagen-evoked signaling in platelets (39, 40).	27383	27614
28368423	Phosphorylation of SYK (Y525) is associated with platelet activation and thrombus formation in the setting of sheer stress (41).	27615	27743
28368423	Therefore, inhibition of SYK by ibrutinib may lead to ineffective thrombosis and bleeding.	27744	27834
28368423	Our results expand understanding of the role of Myc in cell signaling and indicate Myc overexpression alone is sufficient to cause aberrant activation of pro-growth and survival signaling that likely contributes to lymphomagenesis.	27835	28066
28368423	Our data have significant clinical implications for targeting the BCR pathway in human lymphomas that highly express MYC.	28067	28188
28368423	Additionally, we showed off-target effects of ibrutinib on Syk that may explain some side effects of ibrutinib therapy.	28189	28308
28368423	Furthermore, the relative resistance to Btk inhibition by ibrutinib in cells that overexpress Myc suggest MYC expression may serve as a therapeutic biomarker.	28309	28467
28368423	Male C57Bl/6 Eμ-myc mice (5) were mated to C57Bl/6 females to generate transgenic and nontransgenic littermates.	28468	28580
28368423	C57Bl/6 Btk−/− mice (26) and C57Bl/6 wild-type controls were provided by Dr. Peggy Kendall (Vanderbilt University Medical Center).	28581	28711
28368423	Spleens were harvested from mice 4–6 weeks of age, prior to lymphoma development.	28712	28793
28368423	All mouse studies were in accordance with state and federal guidelines and were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.	28794	28945
28368423	The protocol was modified from Irish, et al (42).	28946	28995
28368423	Briefly, following disaggregation and red blood cells lysis, 1×107 splenocytes/ml in culture medium were incubated at 37C for 60 minutes.	28996	29133
28368423	For assessment of upstream BCR signaling proteins, culture medium was DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).	29134	29240
28368423	For Erk, p38MAPK, Akt, and S6RP assessment, FBS was reduced to 2.5% for the 3 hour kinetic experiments or 0% for shorter experiments.	29241	29374
28368423	BCR signaling was stimulated by ligation of IgM with 10 μg/ml anti-mouse IgM F(ab’)2 fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch).	29375	29495
28368423	For some experiments, splenocytes were pretreated for 1 hour with ibrutinib (Selleckchem) or DMSO (control).	29496	29604
28368423	In indicated experiments, H2O2 (550 μM) was added immediately after BCR ligation.	29605	29686
28368423	Cells were fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde (10 minutes, room temperature) at one time after intervals following IgM ligation.	29687	29813
28368423	Cells were incubated with anti-IgM and anti-CD19 antibodies, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X (5 minutes, 4C), and then incubated with phospho-specific antibodies in PBS, 3% FBS, 15 mM sodium azide.	29814	30012
28368423	In some cases unconjugated phospho-specific antibodies were used, followed by AlexaFluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) for 30 minutes at room temperature.	30013	30201
28368423	For a list of antibodies used see Supplemental Table S1.	30202	30258
28368423	Fluorescence was measured on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer, and data was analyzed with FlowJo software.	30259	30361
28368423	Unless otherwise stated, values represent mean ± SEM, and paired t-test was used for comparisons.	30362	30459
28346429	Angiogenesis is the physiological process whereby new blood vessels are formed from preexisting vessels.	0	104
28346429	It is crucial for growth, development, and postnatal organ repair.	105	171
28346429	Angiogenesis also contributes to several pathological conditions, including cancer, by supplying nutrients and oxygen to maintain aggressive growth.1 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling plays an essential role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis.2 The VEGF family consists of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and placenta growth factor.	172	533
28346429	VEGF-A, first described as a vascular permeability factor,3 binds to its cell-surface receptors including VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2 and neuropilin-1/2 on endothelial cells (ECs).	534	719
28346429	This binding dimerizes and authophosphorylates the receptor and starts the signaling cascades required for EC proliferation and migration.4 VEGF-A plays a critical role in angiogenesis; VEGF-A–knockout mice are lethal embryonically because of abnormal vascular development.5 Although VEGF-A (hereafter VEGF) is well known to regulate angiogenesis, how it is regulated remains poorly understood.	720	1114
28346429	VEGF expression is regulated at many levels including transcription, translation and mRNA stability.6,7 Under various conditions, VEGF is upregulated by transcriptional factors such as specificity protein 1 (Sp1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1.8 Sp1 has 785 amino acids and regulates VEGF expression by binding to GC-rich motifs within the promoter.9 Sp1 downregulation reduces tumor vascularization,8 so it may play an anti-tumor role.	1115	1603
28346429	Given the important roles of VEGF in angiogenesis, a complete understanding of its regulation is significant to elucidate the process of angiogenesis.	1604	1754
28346429	Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase and ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells.	1755	1861
28346429	It was first identified in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome as a tumor suppressor.10,11 LKB1 can phosphorylate the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family of proteins, including 14 members, and play an important role in energy metabolism and cell polarity.12,13 Many LKB1-knockout mouse models have been generated to further elucidate the in vivo roles.14 We previously showed that LKB1 overexpression inhibits endothelial tube formation,15 which suggests that LKB1 is anti-angiogenic.	1862	2360
28346429	However, the detailed mechanism for this formation is unknown.	2361	2423
28346429	In this study, we used endothelium-specific LKB1-knockout mice (LKB1endo−/−)16 to show that LKB1 deletion in ECs promoted tumor growth by increasing tumor angiogenesis.	2424	2592
28346429	Because LKB1-deficient mice exhibit abnormal VEGF expression,17 we determined whether LKB1 deletion in the endothelium would affect VEGF levels.	2593	2737
28346429	Primary lung ECs from WT and LKB1endo−/− mice were isolated and cultured.	2738	2811
28346429	Levels of two important endothelial markers, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin), were checked, with no change between WT and LKB1endo−/− cells (Fig.	2812	3014
28346429	1A), which suggests no phenotypic changes in cells.	3015	3066
28346429	VEGF protein and mRNA levels were increased in LKB1endo−/− ECs (Fig.	3067	3135
28346429	1A and 1B).	3136	3147
28346429	Furthermore, serum VEGF levels were increased in LKB1endo−/− mice (Fig.	3148	3219
28346429	1C) and the mice showed more VEGF-positive staining in endothelium on immunohistochemistry (Fig.	3220	3316
28346429	1D).	3317	3321
28346429	Hence, endothelial LKB1 deletion increased VEGF levels in ECs.	3322	3384
28346429	VEGF is also a vascular permeability factor,18 so we evaluated the effect of LKB1 deletion on vascular permeability.	3385	3501
28346429	To quantify vascular leakage, mice were injected with Evans blue.	3502	3567
28346429	The amount of dye leaked was greater in tissues including the kidney, liver, lung, and skin from LKB1endo−/− than WT mice (Fig.	3568	3695
28346429	1E), which suggests that endothelial LKB1 deletion results in increased vascular permeability.	3696	3790
28346429	As well, aortas from WT and LKB1endo−/− mice were examined to identify possible ultrastructural changes.	3791	3895
28346429	Tight junctions between LKB1endo−/− ECs were significantly smaller and wider than those between WT cells (Fig.	3896	4006
28346429	1F).	4007	4011
28346429	The mean length of tight junctions in ECs from LKB1endo−/− mice was 52% of that from WT mice (Fig.	4012	4110
28346429	1G), which further confirmed the phenotype of hyperpermeability in LKB1endo−/− mice.	4111	4195
28346429	Microalbuminuria is a marker of endothelial hyperpermeability and dysfunction,19 and it can be determined by measuring the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR).	4196	4358
28346429	Urinary ACR was significantly higher in LKB1endo−/− than WT mice (Fig.	4359	4429
28346429	1H), so LKB1endo−/− mice exhibit microalbuminuria and hyperpermeability.	4430	4502
28346429	To show the architecture of cell–cell contact, we used ZO-1 immunostaining of WT and LKB1endo−/− ECs.	4503	4604
28346429	LKB1endo−/− cells showed increased permeability (Fig.	4605	4658
28346429	1I).	4659	4663
28346429	The morphological structure of glomerulus from WT and LKB1endo−/− mice analyzed by H&E staining showed LKB1endo−/− mice with glomerular enlargement in the kidney (Fig.	4664	4831
28346429	1J and Supplementary Fig.	4832	4857
28346429	1).	4858	4861
28346429	Taken together, LKB1 deletion increases VEGF level and permeability.	4862	4930
28346429	To address whether the loss of endothelial LKB1 affects tumor growth and vascular permeability, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) or B16F10 melanoma cells were implanted in the backs of WT and LKB1endo−/− mice, then tumor growth was monitored for 14 days, and tumors were excised; LLC tumors grew faster in LKB1endo−/− than WT mice (Fig.	4931	5261
28346429	2A).	5262	5266
28346429	Similarly, B16F10 melanoma tumors grew faster in LKB1endo−/− than WT mice (Fig.	5267	5346
28346429	2B).	5347	5351
28346429	To detect the vascular permeability in LLC tumors, FITC-labeled dextran was injected: the area of extravasated dextran was increased in LLC tumors from LKB1endo−/− mice (Fig.	5352	5526
28346429	2C).	5527	5531
28346429	In addition, Evans blue was injected into mice, and samples were quantified spectrophotometrically.	5532	5631
28346429	Evans-blue content was greater for LLC tumors from LKB1endo−/− than WT mice (Fig.	5632	5713
28346429	2D).	5714	5718
28346429	Tumor permeability can be quantified by using macromolecular tracers, such as fibrin/fibrinogen staining.20 Fibrinogen staining was greater for LLC tumors from LKB1endo−/− than WT mice (Fig.	5719	5909
28346429	2E).	5910	5914
28346429	Hence, tumors implanted in LKB1endo−/− mice feature increased growth and microvascular permeability.	5915	6015
28346429	To determine which cell type-derived VEGF contributes to the different tumor growth in WT and LKB1endo−/− mice, we stained LLC tumors from WT and LKB1endo−/− mice for VEGF and found no difference in VEGF staining between the mice (Supplementary Fig.	6016	6265
28346429	2A).	5262	5266
28346429	Then we detected EC- or macrophage-derived VEGF levels by co-staining CD31 or CD68 and VEGF.	6271	6363
28346429	CD31 and VEGF but not CD68 and VEGF co-staining was significantly increased in tumors from LKB1endo−/− mice (Supplementary Fig.	6364	6491
28346429	2B and 2C), which suggests that EC-derived VEGF contributes to the different tumor growth in WT and LKB1endo−/− mice.	6492	6609
28346429	Moreover, we implanted LLC cells into the backs of WT and macrophage-specific LKB1 knockout (LKB1macro−/−) mice for 14 days.	6610	6734
28346429	As expected, LLC tumors from WT and LKB1macro−/− mice did not differ in size (Supplementary Fig.	6735	6831
28346429	2D), so macrophage-derived VEGF is unlikely the major factor for aberrant tumor growth observed in tumor-implanted LKB1endo−/− mice.	6832	6964
28346429	Tumor angiogenesis was evaluated with an antibody to the endothelial-specific marker CD31.	6965	7055
28346429	The vasculature was more dense for LKB1endo−/− than WT LLC tumors (Fig.	7056	7127
28346429	3A).	7128	7132
28346429	Quantification of CD31-positive areas suggested increased angiogenesis in LLC tumors from LKB1endo−/− than WT mice (Fig.	7133	7253
28346429	3A).	7128	7132
28346429	To evaluate the effect of endothelial LKB1 on tumor growth for a longer time, LLCs were implanted in WT and LKB1endo−/− mice.	7259	7384
28346429	After 28 days, LLC tumors were still larger in LKB1endo−/− than WT mice (Fig.	7385	7462
28346429	3B).	7463	7467
28346429	CD31 staining revealed more vascularization in LKB1endo−/− than WT tumors (Fig.	7468	7547
28346429	3C).	7548	7552
28346429	Then, we examined tumor cell proliferation with an antibody to Ki-67 antigen.	7553	7630
28346429	Ki-67 staining was greater in tumors from LKB1endo−/− than WT mice (Fig.	7631	7703
28346429	3D).	7704	7708
28346429	To detect apoptosis in tumors, we detected cleaved Caspase-3 level and found no significant difference in level between LKB1endo−/− and WT tumors (Fig.	7709	7860
28346429	3E), which suggests that endothelial LKB1 deletion did not affect tumor cell apoptosis.	7861	7948
28346429	Hence, LKB1endo−/− tumors may grow faster due to increased angiogenesis.	7949	8021
28346429	Because LKB1 knockout increased VEGF levels in the endothelium, we determined whether the VEGF-neutralizing antibody could affect tumor growth in LKB1endo−/− mice.	8022	8185
28346429	Injection of the VEGF-neutralizing antibody decreased serum VEGF level (Fig.	8186	8262
28346429	4G) and tumor growth in WT and LKB1endo−/− mice (Fig.	8263	8316
28346429	4A); the IgG control antibody had no effect.	8317	8361
28346429	Immunofluorescence with CD31 revealed that LKB1 deletion increased the vascular density of LLC tumors, and VEGF-neutralizing antibody treatment reduced the vascular density (Fig.	8362	8540
28346429	4B).	8541	8545
28346429	Therefore, LKB1 inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth via a VEGF-mediated autocrine pathway.	8546	8639
28346429	To address whether tumor angiogenesis and growth were mediated by an LKB1/VEGF paracrine pathway, LLC and B16F10 cells were infected with control or LKB1 shRNA lentivirus to silence LKB1, then implanted into WT mice.	8640	8856
28346429	At the same time, mice were intravenously injected with the neutralizing monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody or control antibody.	8857	8980
28346429	LKB1 silencing in B16F10 or LLC cells resulted in VEGF overexpression (Fig.	8981	9056
28346429	4H) and enhanced tumor growth (Fig.	9057	9092
28346429	4C and 4E).	9093	9104
28346429	However, injection with the VEGF-neutralizing antibody reduced LLC and B16F10 tumor growth (Fig.	9105	9201
28346429	4C and 4E).	9093	9104
28346429	Immunofluorescence assay with CD31 revealed that LKB1 loss increased the vascular density of LLC and B16F10 tumors, and treatment with the VEGF-neutralizing antibody decreased the vascular density (Fig.	9214	9416
28346429	4D and 4F).	9417	9428
28346429	Thus, LKB1/VEGF also regulates tumor angiogenesis and growth via a paracrine pathway.	9429	9514
28346429	LKB1 deletion increased VEGF levels and permeability.	9515	9568
28346429	Because vascular permeability contributes to the angiogenesis process in vivo,21 we assessed whether LKB1 deletion affects angiogenesis.	9569	9705
28346429	The vascular system of the mouse retina provides a useful model to study angiogenesis.22 We examined the developing retinal vasculature of WT and LKB1endo−/− mice and found accelerated retinal vasculature outgrowth at P6 in LKB1endo−/− pups (Fig.	9706	9952
28346429	5A).	9953	9957
28346429	In addition, LKB1endo−/− retinas had more branch points, filopodia-containing tip cells and dilated vessels than WT retinas (Fig.	9958	10087
28346429	5B).	10088	10092
28346429	To detect retinal protein leakage, we injected 70-kDa FITC-dextran into mice via the tail vein.	10093	10188
28346429	Protein leakage was increased in the retinas of LKB1endo−/− mice (Fig.	10189	10259
28346429	5C), which was further confirmed by Evans-blue content measurement (Fig.	10260	10332
28346429	5D).	10333	10337
28346429	To test whether LKB1 regulates angiogenesis via VEGF, we silenced VEGF in WT and LKB1endo−/− ECs, then examined cell proliferation.	10338	10469
28346429	The proliferation of LKB1-deficient cells was increased, and VEGF knockdown restored the proliferation of LKB1endo−/− cells to normal conditions (Fig.	10470	10620
28346429	5F).	10621	10625
28346429	In addition, results from wound healing assay suggested that LKB1 deletion enhanced cell migration, which could be inhibited by VEGF silencing (Fig.	10626	10774
28346429	5G, Supplementary Fig.	10775	10797
28346429	3).	10798	10801
28346429	To study the effect of acute knockdown of LKB1 on angiogenesis, HUVECs were transfected with control or LKB1 shRNA lentivirus to silence LKB1, then cell proliferation and migration was examined.	10802	10996
28346429	Similar to LKB1-deficient lung ECs, LKB1 knockdown increased VEGF expression, cell proliferation and migration (Supplementary Fig.	10997	11127
28346429	4).	11128	11131
28346429	To detect whether re-expression of LKB1 could rescue the phenotype in LKB1-deficient cells, LacZ or LKB1 plasmid was transfected into WT and LKB1endo−/− ECs, then cell proliferation and migration was examined.	11132	11341
28346429	LKB1 deletion increased VEGF level released from ECs, and re-expression of LKB1 reduced VEGF level (Fig.	11342	11446
28346429	5I).	11447	11451
28346429	As expected, re-expression of LKB1 decreased the over-proliferation and -migration observed in LKB1endo−/− cells (Fig.	11452	11570
28346429	5J and 5K).	11571	11582
28346429	To further confirm whether LKB1 regulation of endothelial proliferation and migration depends on VEGF, we transfected control or VEGFR2 siRNA into WT or LKB1endo−/− cells, then examined cell proliferation and migration.	11583	11802
28346429	VEGFR2 knockdown rescued the phenotype of over-proliferation and -migration observed in LKB1endo−/− mice (Fig.	11803	11913
28346429	5M and 5N).	11914	11925
28346429	Hence, LKB1 deficiency enhances angiogenic processes, including cell proliferation and migration, by increasing VEGF level.	11926	12049
28346429	To explore how LKB1 regulates VEGF expression, LKB1-deficient A549 lung cancer cells were transfected with LKB1 or LacZ plasmid; VEGF mRNA level was decreased with LKB1 transfection (Fig.	12050	12237
28346429	6A).	12238	12242
28346429	To assess how LKB1 regulates VEGF transcription, we generated four luciferase plasmids progressively truncated for the mouse VEGF promoter (Fig.	12243	12387
28346429	6B).	12388	12392
28346429	LKB1 transfection repressed luciferase activities in all truncated constructs (Fig.	12393	12476
28346429	6C), which suggests that the responsive element, regulated by LKB1, is located within the small and proximal fragment spanning from –150 base pairs to the transcription start site.	12477	12657
28346429	Moreover, the LKB1 kinase-dead mutant plasmid (D194A) inhibited VEGF expression (Fig.	12658	12743
28346429	6C), so LKB1 kinase activity may not be required for VEGF inhibition.	12744	12813
28346429	The Sp1-responsive element is localized at the region between −150 base pairs and the transcription start site of the VEGF promoter.	12814	12946
28346429	Therefore, LKB1 may regulate VEGF expression through Sp1.	12947	13004
28346429	AMPK activity was decreased in LKB1endo−/− cells.16 To determine whether AMPK is involved in the regulatory activity of LKB1 in VEGF expression, VEGF-luc plasmids were transfected into WT and LKB1endo−/− cells, followed by AICAR (AMPK activator) treatment.	13005	13261
28346429	AICAR did not change the VEGF expression (Fig.	13262	13308
28346429	6D), which suggests that AMPK is not involved in the regulatory activity of LKB1 in VEGF transcription.	13309	13412
28346429	To determine whether LKB1 can bind to Sp1, HEK293T cells were transfected with WT LKB1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Sp1 plasmid.	13413	13548
28346429	Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with IgG or anti-LKB1 antibody, then examined by western blot analysis with anti-GFP antibody.	13549	13680
28346429	LKB1 bound to Sp1 (Fig.	13681	13704
28346429	6E).	13705	13709
28346429	This finding was further confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with cell lysates transfected with WT Sp1 and GFP-LKB1 (Fig.	13710	13842
28346429	6F).	13843	13847
28346429	To further determine the association of LKB1 and Sp1 in ECs, mouse lung EC lysates were immunoprecipitated with IgG or anti-LKB1 antibody, then examined by western blot analysis with anti-Sp1 antibody.	13848	14049
28346429	LKB1 was able to bind to Sp1 under physiological conditions (Fig.	14050	14115
28346429	6G).	14116	14120
28346429	The colocalization of LKB1 and Sp1 was observed in the nuclei of ECs (Fig.	14121	14195
28346429	6H).	14196	14200
28346429	However, LKB1 overexpression did not change Sp1 levels (Fig.	14201	14261
28346429	6I).	14262	14266
28346429	Overall, these data indicate that LKB1 negatively regulates VEGF expression.	14267	14343
28346429	To map their binding domains, we constructed different truncated Sp1 and LKB1 plasmids (Fig.	14344	14436
28346429	7A).	14437	14441
28346429	When the truncated Sp1 plasmids were co-transfected with LKB1 into HEK293T cells, only the C-terminal domain of Sp1 could bind to LKB1 (Fig.	14442	14582
28346429	7B).	14583	14587
28346429	However, Sp1 could not bind to the truncated LKB1 plasmids (data not known), which suggests that full-length LKB1 is required for its binding to Sp1.	14588	14737
28346429	To detect whether LKB1 can affect the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter, LacZ, WT or D194A LKB1 plasmid was transfected into A549 cells, and ChIP was performed.	14738	14900
28346429	Both WT and D194A LKB1 inhibited Sp1 binding to the VEGF promoter (Fig.	14901	14972
28346429	7C).	14973	14977
28346429	In ECs, ChIP assay showed more Sp1 binding with VEGF promoter in LKB1endo−/− ECs (Fig.	14978	15064
28346429	7D).	15065	15069
28346429	In addition, LKB1endo−/− ECs were transfected with LacZ plasmid, WT or D194A LKB1 plasmids followed by DNA ChIP assay.	15070	15188
28346429	Compared with LacZ, both WT and D194A plasmid inhibited Sp1 to bind with VEGF promoter (Fig 7E), which suggests that the kinase activity of LKB1 is not required in regulating Sp1 binding to the VEGF promoter in ECs.	15189	15404
28346429	In addition, LKB1 inhibited VEGF promoter activity in control siRNA-transfected A549 cells but could not inhibit VEGF expression in Sp1-deficient cells (Fig.	15405	15562
28346429	7F), which suggests that LKB1 inhibits VEGF expression via Sp1.	15563	15626
28346429	Moreover, mutation of the Sp1 element completely abolished the LKB1-mediated repression of the VEGF promoter (Fig.	15627	15741
28346429	7G).	15742	15746
28346429	Overall, these results demonstrate that LKB1 negatively regulated VEGF expression by competitively binding Sp1.	15747	15858
28346429	In mammals, two splice variants of LKB1 are expressed because of alternate use of 3′-exons.	15859	15950
28346429	The long form is the main form widely expressed in tissues, whereas the short form has a unique 39-residue format instead of the last 63 residues in the long form and is a minor form in most tissues but is highly expressed in haploid spermatids.23,24 In our Cre/LoxP system, both LKB1 isoforms could be deleted in the endothelium.	15951	16281
28346429	Our study is the first to show that EC-specific LKB1 knockout in mice increased VEGF levels, thus increasing angiogenesis and tumor growth.	16282	16421
28346429	In WT ECs, LKB1 bound to the VEGF transcription factor Sp1 and decreased VEGF level.	16422	16506
28346429	However, in LKB1-deficient ECs, the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter was increased, and VEGF level, angiogenesis, and tumor growth were enhanced (Fig.	16507	16660
28346429	7H).	16661	16665
28346429	Moreover, treatment with VEGF-neutralizing antibody decreased angiogenesis and tumor growth in LKB1endo−/− mice.	16666	16778
28346429	Thus, LKB1 plays a critical role in regulating VEGF expression via Sp1 to maintain normal angiogenesis.	16779	16882
28346429	VEGF expression can be regulated by many transcription factors such as Sp1.8 Sp1 can directly interact with the E3 ligase pVHL, thereby inhibiting Sp1 binding to the VEGF promoter.25 In addition, p53 can form a complex with Sp1 to inhibit its binding with the VEGF promoter.26 VEGF mRNA levels in LKB1−/− embryos at embryonic day (E) 8.5 and E9.5 are elevated, so LKB1 negatively regulates VEGF expression under normal conditions.18 A recent study reported that LKB1 overexpression decressed Sp1 level, thereby downregulating VEGF.27 However, we found that LKB1 did not alter Sp1 protein levels (Fig.	16883	17483
28346429	6I).	14262	14266
28346429	We demonstrate that LKB1 could bind to Sp1 and inhibit its binding to the VEGF promoter, which may explain why LKB1 overexpression is significantly associated with a decrease in microvessel density28 and LKB1 loss enhances the vascularity of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome polyps.29 Besides affecting VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, LKB1 can affect other endothelial functions such as decreasing eNOS activity with its deletion.16 Knockdown of LKB1 with shRNA significantly lowers VEGF, so tumor cells are important sources of VEGF.	17489	18009
28346429	Beside tumor cells, other cells including macrophages and ECs can be potential sources of VEGF.	18010	18105
28346429	To determine the relative contributions of ECs versus macrophages, we first co-stained VEGF with ECs (CD31) or macrophages (CD68).	18106	18236
28346429	As expected, we found a strong co-staining of CD31 and VEGF in LKB1endo−/− mice, with no difference of CD68 and VEGF co-staining in LKB1endo−/− and WT mice.	18237	18393
28346429	To further determine the contributions of macrophage-derived VEGF, LLC cells were implanted in WT and macrophage-specific LKB1 knockout (LKB1macro−/−) mice.	18394	18550
28346429	As expected, LLC tumors from WT and LKB1macro−/− mice did not differ in size, which suggests that macrophage-derived VEGF did not contribute to the tumor growth in LKB1endo−/− mice.	18551	18732
28346429	Findings from this study may have broad implications beyond cardiovascular diseases.	18733	18817
28346429	Because the generation of blood supply in tumor is a rate-limiting step for tumor growth, any therapy for normalizing LKB1 expression or activity will suppress intra-tumoral microvessel formation, which will lead to limiting the supply of circulating blood that is crucial for tumor growth.	18818	19108
28346429	Indeed, anti-angiogenic therapy has been found effective in preclinical cancer studies, and numerous anti-angiogenic agents are being clinically evaluated.	19109	19264
28346429	Notably, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved several anti-angiogenic drugs that target the VEGF signaling pathway.	19265	19392
28346429	In summary, this study identified the molecular mechanism of increased angiogenesis and tumor growth with LKB1 deficiency.	19393	19515
28346429	LKB1 loss triggered the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter, thereby enhancing VEGF expression.	19516	19611
28346429	The development of therapeutic agents that target LKB1 in the treatment of pathological angiogenesis and tumor progression should be considered.	19612	19756
28346429	The generation and characteristics of endothelium-specific LKB1-knockout mice (LKB1endo−/−) and macrophage-specific LKB1-knockout mice (LKB1macro−/−) were previously described.16,30 The animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with a 12-hr light/dark cycle with food and water freely available.	19757	20070
28346429	At least 5 mice in each group were used in the animal study.	20071	20131
28346429	A neutralizing monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody (2G11-2A05, Bio-legend) or an isotype-matched control (RTK2758) was injected intravenously at 100 μg twice weekly, starting on the day of tumor implantation.	20132	20334
28346429	All experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of Georgia State University.	20335	20447
28346429	A total of 1 million Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) or B16F10 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into the backs of male WT or LKB1endo−/− mice (6-8 weeks old).	20448	20612
28346429	Tumors developed for 14 or 28 days and were measured every 2 days with use of calipers to assess tumor volume (length × height × width × 0.5236).	20613	20758
28346429	In addition, LLC or B16F10 cells were infected with control or LKB1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles to silence LKB1, then implanted into WT mice.	20759	20919
28346429	A549 cells or ECs were transfected with the VEGF promoter-driven firefly luciferase plasmid, thymidine kinase promoter-driven renilla luciferase construct, and the β-galactosidase (LacZ) control or LKB1 construct by using the 4D-Nucleofecto System (LONZA, Walkersville, MD).	20920	21194
28346429	At 24 hr after transfection, luciferase activity was measured by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI).	21195	21331
28346429	Data are presented as mean ± SE.	21332	21364
28346429	After confirming the normal distribution of data by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, differences between two groups were analyzed by Student t test.	21365	21509
28346429	Assuming α = 0.5, β = 0.90, and a ratio of (expected effect size)/ (expected standard deviation) = 1.20, we needed at least 5 samples per group.	21510	21654
28346429	P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.	21655	21704
26411452	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer‐related death in Western men [Siegel et al., 2012].	0	142
26411452	In 56% of primary tumors and in almost all tumor metastases, androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed and deregulated [Taylor et al., 2010].	143	282
26411452	Therefore, AR signaling has been both a main target for therapy and a focus in research for understanding the molecular mechanisms of PCa development and progression.	283	449
26411452	AR regulates a wide variety of genes involved in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis.	450	554
26411452	Recently, the identification of AR targets in both PCa cell lines and tumor tissues has been greatly extended by high‐throughput techniques, such as gene expression profiling and chromatin‐immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with microarray analysis or DNA sequencing (ChIP‐seq) [Lin et al., 2009; Massie et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2013].	555	894
26411452	These approaches enable the identification of key signal pathways, as well as clarification of the changes of AR signaling during PCa tumorigenesis and progression.	895	1059
26411452	A discovery of great importance disclosed by genetic analysis of prostate tumors was the identification of gene rearrangements involving the promoter regions of androgen‐regulated genes.	1060	1246
26411452	Most frequent among these genetic alterations in PCa are fusions of ETS transcription factor genes to 5′‐regions of AR‐regulated genes, which results in androgen‐stimulated overexpression of ETS proteins [Tomlins et al., 2005].	1247	1474
26411452	Among a variety of fusion genes in PCa, the TMPRSS2‐ERG fusion is the most common one with a prevalence of 40%–70% in primary tumors [Schaefer et al., 2013].	1475	1632
26411452	ERG overexpression was reported to increase stemness of prostate tumor cells [Casey et al., 2012]; however, the full functional importance and clinical implications of the fusion gene remain to be unraveled.	1633	1840
26411452	Interestingly, ERG was also found to inhibit transactivation of the AR via direct and indirect mechanisms, thus modulating AR signaling in ERG fusion gene‐positive cancers [Yu et al., 2010].	1841	2031
26411452	Despite extensive studies on the AR transcriptome and cistrome, these have been largely focused on LNCaP cells, which do not harbor a TMPRSS2‐ERG fusion gene.	2032	2190
26411452	There is a need, therefore, to study the deregulated AR signaling in fusion gene‐positive PCa tumor cells.	2191	2297
26411452	Genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely applied to identify the association of common genetic variants with cancer risk.	2298	2434
26411452	Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genetic loci such as 8q24, 22q13 and 17q12 were reported to be linked to PCa susceptibility, early onset of the disease, and tumor aggressiveness [Witte, 2007; Levin et al., 2008; Salinas et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2009; Eeles et al., 2009; Gudmundsson et al., 2009; Takata et al., 2010; Schumacher et al., 2011; Eeles et al., 2013; Al Olama et al., 2014; Berndt et al., 2015; Helfand et al., 2015].	2435	2926
26411452	Although little is known about the functional aspect of risk SNPs, some studies showed cancer SNPs predominately present in multiple putative regulatory elements [Sille, et al., 2012].	2927	3111
26411452	SNPs in the promoter of the KLK3 gene, encoding the commonly used PCa marker protein prostate‐specific antigen (PSA), were reported to increase serum PSA and PSA promoter activity [Cramer et al., 2003], whereas a C→ T substitution of SNP rs10993994:C>T in the 5′ region of the PCa‐suppressor gene MSMB was shown to affect gene expression level [Chang et al., 2009].	3112	3477
26411452	By combining GWAS susceptibility genes with expression profiling studies, genes involved in cytoskeleton and cell adhesion were found to be overrepresented among the PCa risk genes [Gorlov et al., 2009].	3478	3681
26411452	This finding indicates the feasibility to identify causal variants that regulate the candidate genes and the molecular mechanisms of tumor risk modulation by integrating high‐throughput datasets, for example, GWAS and gene expression profiling.	3682	3926
26411452	In this study, by coupling AR ChIP‐seq and microarray expression profiling of androgen‐regulated genes, we identified multiple AR regulatory elements (AREs) in the TMPRSS2‐ERG fusion gene‐positive DUCaP PCa cells and identified a novel auxiliary AR‐binding motif enriched in the vicinity of canonical androgen response elements.	3927	4255
26411452	Correlation with GWAS data revealed enrichment of PCa risk SNPs in AR‐binding sites (ARBSs).	4256	4348
26411452	A common SNP, rs11891426:T>G, which is in moderately high‐linkage disequilibrium with the GWAS SNPs rs2292884:A>G and rs7584330:A>G, was found located within one of the auxiliary ARE motifs within the ARBS in the seventh intron of the MLPH gene (OMIN accession number: *606526).	4349	4627
26411452	We further showed that the variant allele of rs11891426:T>G is negatively correlated with melanophilin (MLPH) expression.	4628	4749
26411452	A higher protein expression in prostate tissues of cancer patients was associated with a favorable PCa risk profile, suggesting a causal relationship between PCa development and progression with modulation of MLPH expression.	4750	4975
26411452	Human PCa cell lines LNCaP and PC‐3 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA).	4976	5051
26411452	DUCaP was a generous gift from Dr. Jack Schalken (Center for Molecular Life Science, The Netherlands).	5052	5154
26411452	LNCaP cells were originally derived from a lymph node metastasis of a PCa patient (Horoszewicz et al., 1983).	5155	5264
26411452	Their AR harbors a point mutation in the ligand‐binding domain, leading to a promiscuous receptor activated by estrogens, progestins, and by flutamide in addition to androgens [Kokontis et al., 1991].	5265	5465
26411452	DUCaP PCa cells were obtained from a dura mater metastasis of a PCa patient [Lee et al., 2001] and harbor a TMPRSS2‐ERG gene rearrangement (found in 50%–70% of all prostate tumors).	5466	5647
26411452	These cells express a high level of wild‐type AR.	5648	5697
26411452	LNCaP and DUCaP cells are both androgen sensitive, whereas PC‐3 cells, originally isolated from a bone metastasis of a PCa patient [Kaighn et al., 1979], do not express AR and are androgen unresponsive [Sampson et al., 2013].	5698	5923
26411452	Introduction of AR into PC‐3 cells through transient transfection of an expression vector, however, restores AR signaling and response to androgens.	5924	6072
26411452	LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (PAA, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA), 2 mM l‐glutamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 2.5 g/l d‐glucose (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES, and 1 mM Na‐Pyruvat (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).	6073	6328
26411452	PC‐3 and DUCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 2 mM l‐glutamine.	6329	6413
26411452	Before steroid hormone treatment cells were held in phenol‐red‐free RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran‐treated fetal calf serum (CCS; Fisher) for up to 3 days.	6414	6614
26411452	Stimulation with 1 nM of the synthetic androgen R1881 or vehicle was performed for the indicated durations.	6615	6722
26411452	Patients’ tissue samples for DNA, RNA, and protein analysis were obtained from the Prostate Cancer Bioresource of the Department of Urology, Innsbruck Medical University.	6723	6893
26411452	The clinical samples have been collected within the framework of the Tyrolean prostate cancer early detection program [Bartsch et al., 2008].	6894	7035
26411452	Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Innsbruck Medical University (Study AM 3174 and amendment 2).	7036	7211
26411452	All samples were obtained from patients with biopsy‐proven, clinically localized PCa, who were at least 40 years old and who had received no previous PCa therapy.	7212	7374
26411452	A total of 126 patients were enrolled in the study.	7375	7426
26411452	For 108 cases, DNA genotyping was performed, mRNA expression was determined in 77 cases, and 68 cases were available for immunohistochemistry analysis.	7427	7578
26411452	Patients’ variables such as age, total PSA, percent‐free PSA, prostate tumor volume, and clinical and histological tumor characteristics are recorded in Table 1.	7579	7740
26411452	ChIP‐seq was performed as described [Bu et al., 2013].	7741	7795
26411452	AR antibodies used for ChIP were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) and Upstate (PG‐21, UB 06‐680).	7796	7894
26411452	Rabbit IgG was used as antibody control.	7895	7935
26411452	After adjustment to steroid hormone‐free condition, DUCaP cells were treated with 1 nM R1881 or vehicle control and cells were harvested at different time points and subjected to ChIP.	7936	8120
26411452	The enrichment of AR to its target genes at different time points was monitored by normal or qPCR amplification of well‐established AR target sites, for example, the AR enhancer in the PSA gene promoter (F: 5′‐GGGGTTTGTGCCACTGGTGAG‐3′ and R: 5′‐GGGAGGCAATTCTCCATGGTTC‐3′).	8121	8393
26411452	AR enrichment was highest after 1 hr of hormone treatment and this time point was chosen for CHIP‐seq analysis.	8394	8505
26411452	Samples including appropriate control samples (vehicle control, IgG control ± androgen) were prepared once and DNA was immunoprecipitated and purified.	8506	8657
26411452	After a quality check using qPCR as described above, DNA samples were used for library preparation and sequenced on a Solexa platform (Illumina Genome Analyzer II; Illumina, San Diego, CA).	8658	8847
26411452	Raw sequencing data were analyzed by the Illumina analysis pipeline software and reads were aligned to the unmasked human reference genome (NCBI v36, hg18) using Bowtie [Langmead et al., 2009].	8848	9041
26411452	All reads that mapped to simple tandem repeats [Benson, 1999] or duplicated regions >1,000 bp were discarded.	9042	9151
26411452	MACS tool (v1.4) was used to identify AR‐enriched regions in a genome‐wide manner in comparison to control IgG‐enriched regions [Zhang et al., 2008].	9152	9301
26411452	AR‐enriched regions in androgen‐treated samples were compared with control vehicle‐treated samples to identify androgen‐dependent AR‐binding peaks.	9302	9449
26411452	The AR‐binding peaks with −10log10 P values more than 50 were counted as ARBSs.	9450	9529
26411452	If an ARBS occurred within 50 kb upstream or downstream of a gene start site or within the body of a gene, we regarded that gene as a potential AR target gene.	9530	9689
26411452	ChIP‐seq data have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession Nr.	9690	9769
26411452	GSE70679).	9770	9780
26411452	DUCaP or LNCaP cells were steroid starved for 3 days before treatment with 1 nM R1881 or equivalent ethanol for 8 or 24 hr.	9781	9904
26411452	Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	9905	10014
26411452	Biological triplicate (24‐hr treatment) and duplicate (8‐h treatment) RNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix HuGene‐1.0 st v1 expression arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) [Irizarry et al., 2003] in the Core Facility of the Medical University of Innsbruck.	10015	10269
26411452	Raw microarray data were preprocessed in R (http://www.r‐project.org) using the RMA algorithm and the custom CDF HuGene10stvs1_Hs_ENSG version 12 [Smyth, 2004].	10270	10430
26411452	Raw and preprocessed microarray data have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession Nr.	10431	10533
26411452	GSE63693).	10534	10544
26411452	Significance for differential expression was estimated using the moderated t‐test and the resulting P values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg correction method [Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995].	10545	10782
26411452	Probe sets with a B‐H‐corrected P value ≤ 0.05 were considered to represent androgen‐regulated genes.	10783	10884
26411452	MEME (version 4.70) was run with default options, allowing detected motif sites to be on forward or reverse strand (‐revcomp).	10885	11011
26411452	A file of 100 bp sequences centered around the binding peaks of 5,571 ARBSs of the 1,490 AR primary targets was used as the input to the program.	11012	11157
26411452	Novelty of the detected motifs was determined based on comparison of the motifs against those in JASPAR using TomTom [Gupta et al., 2007].	11158	11296
26411452	This study utilized the high‐performance computational capabilities of the Biowulf Linux cluster at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (http://biowulf.nih.gov).	11297	11470
26411452	SNPs reported to be associated with PCa (P value <5×10−8) were obtained from the NHGRI GWAS catalog (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies, accessed Dec 31, 2011) and defined as GWAS index SNPs.	11471	11660
26411452	Linked SNPs were identified as those that have ≥specified r 2.	11661	11723
26411452	For simulation analysis, r 2 = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7 were used, whereas r 2 ≥ 0.5 was chosen for further analysis of SNPs linked with the index SNPs based on the genotypes of the 1000G project (phase 1, v3).	11724	11927
26411452	For analysis of GWAS SNPs enrichment in the AR ChIP‐seq peaks, 10,000 random sets of simulated ChIP‐seq peaks, matching chromosome, and size of the actual peaks were picked across the genome.	11928	12119
26411452	The number of the index and linked SNPs in the random regions was counted and compared against the observed one in ChIP‐seq peaks.	12120	12250
26411452	A permutation P value was estimated using Wilson score interval [Wilson, 1927] to quantify the significance of enrichment of the index and linked SNPs overlapping the ARBSs compared with the ones identified in simulated peaks.	12251	12477
26411452	Firefly luciferase reporter vectors harboring the ARBS of the MLPH gene, with the major T allele of SNP rs11891426:T>G, were constructed according to the procedures previously described [Bu et al., 2013].	12478	12682
26411452	Briefly, the MLPH ARBS was PCR amplified using primers F: 5′‐ TATCCAACACACGGGCTGAT ‐3′ and R: 5′‐ AGCTTTGGGGATTTCATTTCA ‐3′, purified and first ligated to the PCR fragment cloning vector PSC‐B (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and then inserted into the KpnI/SacI sites of the PGL3 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI).	12683	13032
26411452	The minor G allele counterpart of the reporter vector or mutations of the two putative androgen‐responsive elements (AREs) were generated using the QuikChange II site‐directed (Agilent) or the Q5 site‐directed mutagenesis (NEB, Ipswich, MA) kits.	13033	13279
26411452	Primers used for mutagenesis were 5′‐CAGCTCCCTGCTGCCAGCCTGGGG for G allele alteration, 5‐GCTTCCAGCCTGGGGTGCGTTCTGCACGCCTCCCTGAAATG for mutation of AR binding motif 3 and 5′‐GCCAGCCCACAGCGTTCTGCACGCAGCCTGGGGTGGGAC for mutation of AR‐binding motif 2.	13280	13528
26411452	AR‐negative PC‐3 cells were seeded at a density of 50% confluence in a 96‐well plate.	13529	13614
26411452	On the next day, they were transfected with 40 ng of AR expression vector PSG5‐AR together with 40 ng of the firefly reporter vectors harboring either the wild‐type ARBS or a mutated counterpart and 4 ng of renilla luciferase normalization control vector (PGL4.73; Promega).	13615	13889
26411452	AR‐positive DUCaP cells were seeded at a density of 175,000 cells per well in 24‐well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg per well of one of the firefly reporter vectors and a SV40 promoter‐driven renilla luciferase normalization control vector.	13890	14134
26411452	One day following transfection, cells were treated with 1 nM R1881 for 48 hr, followed by cell lysis and quantification of luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega).	14135	14329
26411452	Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase control activity.	14330	14412
26411452	Total RNA was extracted from carefully macrodissected benign and malignant areas of frozen tissue sections derived from radical prostatectomy specimens (n = 77), using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).	14413	14642
26411452	RNA concentrations and purity were determined spectrophotometrically.	14643	14712
26411452	Reverse transcription was performed on 500 ng of total RNA using the iScript select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio‐Rad, Hercules CA) and random hexamer primers (Promega).	14713	14876
26411452	qPCR control samples for monitoring assay insensitivity for DNA contaminations were prepared by omitting reverse transcriptase during cDNA synthesis.	14877	15026
26411452	Quantitative PCR (40 cycles) was performed in triplicates using 8 ng total RNA equivalents of cDNA for each 10 μl reaction.	15027	15150
26411452	Samples without cDNA and reverse transcription control samples were included to control for unspecific signals.	15151	15262
26411452	The following primer/probe combination or Taqman assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used: AR: 5′‐AGGATGCTCTACTTCGCCCC‐3′ (fwd), 5′‐ACTGGCTGTACATCCGGGAC‐3′ (rev), 5′‐TGGTTTTCAATGAGTACCGCATGCACA‐3′ (probe), MLPH: Hs00225445_m1; TBP: Hs00427620_m1.	15263	15523
26411452	Target gene expression was normalized against the reference housekeeping gene TBP.	15524	15606
26411452	Standard curves for each PCR assay were generated with a serially diluted calibrator sample (cDNA mix of three benign and three malignant tissue sections, 100, 20, 2, 0.2, 0.02 ng RNA equivalents).	15607	15804
26411452	The relative expression ratio (R) was computed based on assay efficiency of target gene and reference gene and the Ct deviation of each sample to the calibrator sample using the following formula: R = (E target ⋀ΔC target[calibrator – sample])/(E reference ⋀ΔCtreference[calibrator – sample]) (Pfaffl, 2001).	15805	16113
26411452	Genomic DNA was isolated from carefully macrodissected benign and malignant areas of frozen tissue sections (n = 108) using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH).	16114	16282
26411452	DNA concentrations and purity were determined spectrophotometrically.	16283	16352
26411452	SNP analysis was performed in triplicate on 3 ng/μl DNA using the 7900HT‐Real Time PCR System.	16353	16447
26411452	SNP genotyping assays (GenXpress, Vösendorf, Austria) designed against reference sequences rs11891426:T>G, rs2292884:A>G, rs7584330:A>G were applied.	16448	16597
26411452	Calling rate was 97.87%.	16598	16622
26411452	Protein expression in malignant and nonmalignant (benign) PCa tissue was analyzed using a tissue microarray (TMA).	16623	16737
26411452	For the TMA construction, formalin‐fixed and paraffin‐embedded (FFPE) human tissue samples derived from radical prostatectomy (n = 68) were selected.	16738	16887
26411452	From each prostate specimen, three cancer and three benign tissue cores were punched and assembled in a TMA using a manual tissue arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI).	16888	17065
26411452	A double immuostaining was performed on 5 μm sections using antibodies directed against cytokeratin 5/6 and α‐methylacyl‐CoA racemase (AMACR) or MLPH and AR on a Discovery‐XT staining device (Ventana, Tucson, AZ).	17066	17279
26411452	Target antibodies and concentrations used were as follows: anti‐cytokeratin 5/6 1:300, anti‐AMACR 1:300 (#M7237, #M3616; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), anti‐MLPH 1:200 (HPA014685; Sigma), and anti‐AR 1:400 (#3165‐1; Abcam, Cambridge, UK).	17280	17513
26411452	Images were acquired using an Axio Imager Z2 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and TissueFAXS software (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria) and MLPH and AR immunostaining intensity analysis was performed using the HistoQuest IHC analysis software (TissueGnostics) under the supervision of an experienced uropathologist (GS).	17514	17835
26411452	Cytokeratin 5/6/AMACR stains were used to control assignment of benign and malignant tissue areas.	17836	17934
26411452	For each TMA spot, the mean intensity and percentage of positively stained cells were evaluated and a score was calculated by multiplying those two values.	17935	18090
26411452	The mean immunointensity score value for each patient was calculated as the average of the three tissue cores, stratified according to cancer and benign tissue.	18091	18251
26411452	The GraphPad Prism 5 (Graph Prism Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) software package was used for statistical analysis.	18252	18366
26411452	Numerical data are presented as the mean and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments.	18367	18473
26411452	The differences of the relative luciferase activities between the reporter vectors harboring wild‐type and mutated sequences were calculated using the unpaired t‐test.	18474	18641
26411452	Differences of MLPH expression levels according to different tissue types, genotypes, as well as patients’ variables and tumor characteristics (age, total PSA, % free PSA, histopathological grade and stage, tumor volume, tumor percentage, and PSA recurrence) were analyzed using the Welch‐corrected unpaired t‐test.	18642	18957
26411452	The Pearson's test was used to calculate the correlation of AR and MLPH protein or mRNA expression and the Chi‐square test to estimate differences of the distribution of MLPH genotypes among subgroups of patients.	18958	19171
26411452	P values of ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant and are indicated in graphs as *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, and ***P ≤ 0.001.	19172	19303
26411452	In this study, we used DUCaP cells as a model to investigate the AR‐regulated transcriptional program in PCa cells.	19304	19419
26411452	This cell line expresses a high level of wild‐type AR, which mimics AR upregulation seen in the majority of androgen‐refractory PCa [Edwards et al., 2003].	19420	19575
26411452	Furthermore, it harbors a TMPRSS2‐ERG gene rearrangement found in 40%–70% of prostate tumors [Schaefer et al., 2013].	19576	19693
26411452	Overexpression of the encoded ERG fusion protein was reported to modulate AR signaling [Yu et al., 2010].	19694	19799
26411452	The dynamics of androgen‐dependent AR enrichment to its target genes was monitored at different time points (0, 20 min, 1, 4, and 18 hr) following R1881 treatment by PCR or qPCR amplification of a PSA enhancer fragment from isolated ChIP‐DNA.	19800	20042
26411452	As expected, androgen treatment induced a recruitment of AR to the target site.	20043	20122
26411452	Highest enrichment was seen at the early time points (20 min and 1 hr) and it decreased afterwards (4 and 18 hr; Supp.	20123	20241
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S1).	20247	20251
26411452	One hour androgen treatment was therefore chosen as the time point for the identification of genome‐wide ARBS by ChIP‐deep sequencing analysis.	20252	20395
26411452	AR ChIP‐seq of androgen‐stimulated DUCaP cells identified 39,156 ARBSs.	20396	20467
26411452	The MACS P values of the AR binding peaks are shown in Supp.	20468	20528
26411452	Figure S2A.	20529	20540
26411452	In vehicle‐treated DuCaP cells only one ARBS in the CDK12 gene proximal promoter was identified.	20541	20637
26411452	Further validation using independent ChIP samples could not confirm this site, indicating a false‐positive ChIP‐seq signal (data not shown).	20638	20778
26411452	These results indicated the dependence on androgen stimulation for receptor activation and genomic targeting by the AR.	20779	20898
26411452	The DUCaP genomic ARBSs were compared with Lin's ChIP‐seq dataset of PC3‐AR cells [Lin et al., 2009].	20899	21000
26411452	Of the 4,165 ARBSs identified in PC3‐AR cells, 2,804 (67%) overlapped with our dataset and a further comparison with Massie's ChIP‐seq data of LNCaP cells [Massie et al., 2011] revealed 8,899 of 11,054 (80.5%) overlapping ARBSs.	21001	21229
26411452	Of the 51,811 total VCaP cell line binding sites published in the same study, 29,823 (58%) were in common with the DUCaP ARBSs.	21230	21357
26411452	These results support the presence of common AR genomic‐targeted sites even in distinct molecular subtypes of PCa.	21358	21472
26411452	To identify those ARBSs that are actively involved in transcription, we first integrated the DUCaP genomic AR sites with DNaseI hypersensitivity chromatin sites across a range of cell types (table wgEncodeRegDnaseClustered V1 of http://genome.ucsc.edu; UW ENCODE).	21473	21737
26411452	Fifty‐nine percent (23,155) of the 39,156 ARBSs overlapped with this marker for transcriptionally active chromatin.	21738	21853
26411452	We next defined potential AR target genes based on the distance to ARBSs.	21854	21927
26411452	Regulatory sites targeted by AR can reside quite a distance upstream from the transcription start sites of target genes or lie within the gene regions [Jariwala et al., 2007; Massie et al., 2011].	21928	22124
26411452	Therefore, we considered a gene to be an AR target if it was located within a 50‐kb distance to an ARBS or an ARBS was located within the gene.	22125	22268
26411452	A total of 19,123 UCSC annotated genes fulfilled these criteria.	22269	22333
26411452	Notably, well‐known androgen‐regulated genes such as KLK3, FKBP5, and TMPRSS2 [Cleutjens et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2007; Makkonen et al., 2009) were called by our analysis algorithm (Fig.	22334	22522
26411452	1A).	22523	22527
26411452	The androgen‐induced transcriptional program was determined in DUCaP cells using Affymetrix gene array expression profiling.	22528	22652
26411452	Androgen‐regulated genes were identified following 8 and 24 hr of androgen stimulation.	22653	22740
26411452	The early time point was chosen in an attempt to identify the primary AR response genes.	22741	22829
26411452	Using a BH‐corrected P value cutoff of ≤0.05, a total of 2,879 and 6,308 out of the 17,837 genes probed on the microarray were regulated upon androgen stimulation of 8 and 24 hr, respectively.	22830	23022
26411452	Two thirds of genes regulated after 8 hr (65%, 1,871 genes) were also modulated in the same direction after 24 hr of treatment (Fig.	23023	23155
26411452	1B).	23156	23160
26411452	The majority of genes regulated at either time point harbor ARBSs (8 hr: 76%, 24 hr: 70%) indicating that AR binding is a prerequisite for androgen‐mediated regulation in most of these genes (Fig.	23161	23357
26411452	1C).	23358	23362
26411452	Considering both time points, 1,873 genes were regulated in the same direction, either up or down (Fig.	23363	23466
26411452	1B; Supp.	23467	23476
26411452	Table S1).	23477	23487
26411452	When these genes were integrated with the genomic AR target site genes, 80% of them (1,490 genes) overlapped indicating that these are primary AR target genes (Fig.	23488	23652
26411452	1C; Supp.	23653	23662
26411452	Table S1).	23477	23487
26411452	One‐third of the 1,490 primary AR target genes (478) overlapped with androgen‐regulated genes harboring ARBSs in PC3‐AR cells (Wang et al., 2009).	23674	23820
26411452	The comparison with Massie's list of androgen‐regulated genes in LNCaP cells showed an overlap of only 91 genes (6%).	23821	23938
26411452	We cross‐validated androgen stimulation of gene expression in LNCaP cells using Affymetrix gene array analysis under the same conditions as for DuCaP cells.	23939	24095
26411452	Of 740 genes regulated after 8 hr, 607 (82%) were also modulated in the same direction after 24 hr (Fig.	24096	24200
26411452	1D).	24201	24205
26411452	Less than half of these (247, 44%) overlapped with DUCaP primary genes (Fig.	24206	24282
26411452	1E), which is significantly less than the percentage of shared ARBSs, which showed an overlap of 80.5%.	24283	24386
26411452	These divergences among different AR‐positive cell lines indicate that AR binding is not the only key player determining androgen‐dependent gene expression.	24387	24543
26411452	Rather, different cell lines seem to display distinct AR primary target genes despite a high conformity of common ARBSs.	24544	24664
26411452	To answer the question whether the distance of ARBSs relative to the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of genes affects androgen regulation, we compared the distribution of ARBS–TSS distances in the DuCaP 1,490 androgen‐regulated primary AR target genes with the distances in all the other genes containing ARBSs.	24665	24978
26411452	The pattern of distribution is similar in both sets: the ARBSs are preferentially enriched in close proximity to the TSSs of the genes and distances are independent of androgen regulation (Supp.	24979	25173

26411452	S2B).	25179	25184
26411452	In addition, the ARBSs are also relatively evenly distributed at distal enhancer regions within 25 kb upstream or downstream of the TSS.	25185	25321
26411452	This result is in agreement with several other reports that ARBSs are not limited to the proximal promoter immediately upstream of the TSS [Jariwala et al., 2007; Takayama et al., 2007; Wang, et al. 2007; Waltering et al., 2009].	25322	25551
26411452	We further characterized the 5,571 ARBSs of the 1,490 AR primary targets and searched for common sequence motifs and putative androgen‐responsive elements.	25552	25707
26411452	Using MEME [Bailey et al., 2009], we took 100 bp sequences centered at the ARBS peaks to identify potential ARE motifs.	25708	25827
26411452	Three motifs are consistently found in high frequency across different parameter settings with an incidence of 622, 1,085, and 971 for motif 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Fig.	25828	26000
26411452	2A).	26001	26005
26411452	Among them, TomTom [Gupta et al., 2007] comparison showed that only motif 3 has a high level of similarity to a consensus ARE, namely, Ar (id MA0007.1; [Roche et al., 1992]) in the JASPAR database (http://jaspar.binf.ku.dk) (Fig.	26006	26235
26411452	2A), which is described in the Transfac database as well (id V$AR_01) (http://www.gene‐regulation.com/pub/databases.html).	26236	26358
26411452	The other two motifs are not associated with any known AREs in both databases.	26359	26437
26411452	Fourteen percent of motif 1 (n = 87) and 13.7% of motif 2 (n = 149) are within 100 bp distance to a motif 3.	26438	26546
26411452	Considering the random coincidence rates that estimated 1.9% coenrichment for motif 1 and 3, and 3.3% for motif 2 and 3, respectively, this indicates a nonrandom clustering of the motifs.	26547	26734
26411452	An analysis of the distance of the motifs to the TSS of the nearest genes shows that motif 2 is preferentially enriched around TSSs, followed by motif 3, whereas motif 1 seems to be randomly distributed in the genetic context (Supp.	26735	26967
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S2C).	26973	26978
26411452	The recent advances in GWAS have greatly extended our knowledge of genetic loci related to human disease risk and genetic traits.	26979	27108
26411452	SNPs associated with a disease or a phenotype are enriched within noncoding functional elements such as transcription factor‐binding sites [Ortiz‐Barahona et al., 2010; ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2012].	27109	27318
26411452	We asked the question whether PCa risk loci colocalize with ARBSs.	27319	27385
26411452	For that purpose, GWAS PCa risk index SNPs and their linked SNPs were retrieved from the NHGRI GWAS catalog ([Hindorff et al., 2009], http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies) and linked to ARBSs.	27386	27574
26411452	Of the 48 GWAS index PCa risk SNPs and their 3,917 linked SNPs (r 2≥0.5 defined by the 1000G project phase 1, v3), 80 were found to be localized in ARBSs (Supp.	27575	27735
26411452	Table S2).	27736	27746
26411452	We recognized a SNP to be overlapping with an ARBS if it was located anywhere in the binding peak region called by the peak calling software MACS.	27747	27893
26411452	Simulation of random ChIP‐seq peaks showed that the observed ChIP‐seq peaks are highly enriched with GWAS risk SNPs and their linked SNPs, as none of 10,000 simulated sets of random peaks across the genome achieved more than the observed number of risk SNP overlaps (permutation P value 0.00024, Wilson score 95%, confidence interval 0–0.00038; Supp.	27894	28244
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S3).	28250	28254
26411452	Different r 2 cutoffs (0.7 and 0.2) in the analysis showed the same level of enrichment of GWAS SNPs in ARBSs.	28255	28365
26411452	This indicates a nonrandom enrichment of GWAS PCa risk index and linked SNPs in ARBSs.	28366	28452
26411452	Integration of the GWAS risk and linked SNPs with the ARBSs of the 1,490 primary AR target genes revealed 20 SNPs localized in ARBSs of five androgen‐regulated genes (Table 2).	28453	28629
26411452	Among them, the SNP rs11891426:T>G (G is the risk allele) is located within the putative AR‐binding motif 2 of the respective ARBS in the 7th intron of the MLPH gene (OMIN accession number: *606526).	28630	28829
26411452	Exchanging T→G abolishes the motif 2.	28830	28867
26411452	In addition, this MLPH–ARBS contains a putative motif 3 ARE, just in 11 bp distance from the motif 2 element (Fig.	28868	28982
26411452	3).	5261	5264
26411452	rs11891426:T>G has a r 2 of 0.37 with the reported PCa risk SNP rs7584330:A>G (G is risk allele) (Kote‐Jarai, et al., 2011a) and a r 2 of 0.53 with rs2292884:A>G (G is risk allele), another PCa risk SNP [Haiman et al., 2011] (Supp.	28987	29218
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S4).	29224	29228
26411452	Although MLPH is in close proximity to the PCa‐associated SNPs, a possible molecular mechanism for disease causality has not yet been reported.	29229	29372
26411452	These findings prompted us to further investigate the influence of the two ARE motifs and their resident SNP rs11891426:T>G on MLPH gene regulation.	29373	29521
26411452	The MLPH gene expression was enhanced upon androgen treatment for 24 hr by 2.2‐fold in LNCaP cells and 1.8‐fold in DuCaP cells according to our gene array expression data.	29522	29693
26411452	In order to analyze the functional importance of the novel AR‐binding motif 2 and the canonical motif 3 within the ARBS on AR transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter vectors harboring motifs 2 and 3, and its flanking sequences (illustrated in Supp.	29694	29948
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S5) were constructed and mutations that abolish motifs 2 or 3 were introduced as well.	29954	30040
26411452	In AR‐positive DUCaP cells, androgen treatment significantly induced the reporter gene containing the MLPH major allele ARBS element (MLPHwt‐T) over nonstimulated cells (49‐fold induction; Fig.	30041	30234
26411452	2B).	25180	25184
26411452	Mutation of motif 3 in the ARBS completely abolished the androgen regulation of the reporter gene, whereas destruction of motif 2 did not, and even increased androgen regulation (125‐fold induction; Fig.	30240	30443
26411452	2B).	25180	25184
26411452	This result indicated the prerequisite of ARE motif 3 for androgen regulation, whereas motif 2 seems to modulate androgen regulation by motif 3.	30449	30593
26411452	To investigate the effect of the minor G allele in the putative risk SNP rs11891426:T>G on androgen regulation, the reporter vector containing G at position 10 of ARE motif 2 was constructed (Supp.	30594	30791
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S4).	29224	29228
26411452	In PC‐3 cells, in which androgen regulation was re‐established by AR overexpression, androgen treatment induced the wild‐type T reporter gene significantly by 6.4‐fold, whereas the risk allele G reporter gene was induced by 4.5‐fold only (Fig.	30802	31045
26411452	3A).	31046	31050
26411452	In DUCaP cells, similar differences, although less significant, were seen (Fig.	31051	31130
26411452	3B).	31131	31135
26411452	This result indicated that the presence of the risk G allele in the ARE motif 2 attenuates AR‐dependent regulation of MLPH gene expression.	31136	31275
26411452	The link of the risk G allele of rs11891426:T>G with reduced AR transactivation activity in vitro prompted us to further study the association of the SNP genotype with MLPH expression in PCa tissues.	31276	31475
26411452	We genotyped rs11891426:T>G, as well as two associated SNPs, rs7584330:A>G and SNP rs2292884:A>G, in prostate tissue DNA samples of 108 PCa patients.	31476	31625
26411452	For the majority of cases, paired benign and tumor DNA samples were available and the genotypes were identical in all paired samples.	31626	31759
26411452	The detected minor allele frequencies were 13% for rs11891426:T>G, 21% for rs2292884:A>G, and 21% for rs7584330:A>G.	31760	31876
26411452	In order to correlate the expression of MLPH with the distinct SNP allele, MLPH immunohistochemistry analysis was carried out employing a TMA containing benign and tumor tissue cores of radical prostatectomy specimens obtained from 68 patients.	31877	32121
26411452	Of 52 of them, the genotype was also available.	32122	32169
26411452	Overall, 126 benign or cancer tissue samples originating from these 68 patients, each sample represented by three tissue cores, were analyzed by IHC and mean immunoreactivity scores were calculated for each case and used for statistical analysis.	32170	32416
26411452	MLPH protein immunoreactivity was significantly lower in samples harboring a rs11891426:T>G risk G allele (G/G n = 1, T/G n = 19) compared with those harboring the nonrisk T allele (T/T n = 77; P = 0.019; Fig.	32417	32626
26411452	4A).	32627	32631
26411452	This confirmed the finding of the in vitro reporter gene assay that the risk G allele may attenuate gene expression (Fig.	32632	32753
26411452	3A).	31046	31050
26411452	Furthermore, the tissue samples with one or two risk G alleles (A/G n = 23 or G/G n = 3) in SNP site rs2292884:A>G, a GWAS index SNP that has an r 2 of 0.53 with rs11891426:T>G, also showed a significantly lower expression of the protein when compared with tissue samples with two major A alleles (n = 71, P = 0.0021; Fig.	32759	33081
26411452	4A).	32627	32631
26411452	The difference was less significant with regard to different alleles of the second GWAS index SNP rs7584330:A>G, which has a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0.37 with rs11891426:T>G (G/G n = 6 and A/G n = 24 vs. G/G n = 67, P = 0.057; Fig.	33087	33325
26411452	4A).	32627	32631
26411452	Overall, there was no significant difference in the expression of MLPH protein in benign (Ben; n = 65) compared with cancer (Ca; n = 61) tissues (Fig.	33331	33481
26411452	4B).	33482	33486
26411452	However, in both tissue types, MLPH immunoreactivity was lower in cases with the rs11891426:T>G G (risk) allele when compared with the T allele, with a statistically significant difference for the benign tissue type (P = 0.020; Fig.	33487	33719
26411452	4C).	33720	33724
26411452	A similar expression pattern of MLPH was also found for the rs2292884:A>G SNP (P = 0.0084 in benign, P = 0.058 in tumor tissue; Fig.	33725	33857
26411452	4D).	33858	33862
26411452	For rs7584330:A>G, a lower expression was only evident in tumor tissue (P = 0.047; Fig.	33863	33950
26411452	4E).	33951	33955
26411452	To further confirm the influence of AR on MLPH expression, we correlated the expression of AR and MLPH proteins in the prostate tissues and found a significant positive correlation of immunoreactivities (r = 0.548, P < 0.0001; Fig.	33956	34187
26411452	4F).	34188	34192
26411452	In addition, we investigated the effect of the SNP genotypes on MLPH mRNA expression in prostate tissues by qRT‐PCR.	34193	34309
26411452	Overall, different alleles of rs11891426:T>G, rs2292884:A>G, and rs7584330:A>G were not associated with significantly different mRNA expression levels (Supp.	34310	34467
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S6A).	34473	34478
26411452	A stratification into benign and cancer‐derived RNA samples showed decreased mRNA expression associated with the minor allels of rs11891426:T>G, rs2292884:A>G, and rs7584330:A>G in cancer tissues; however, a close to statistical significance was obtained only with rs2292884:A>G (Supp.	34479	34764
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S6B–D).	34770	34777
26411452	Again, there was a significant positive correlation of MLPH and AR mRNA levels (r = 0.265, P = 0.001; Supp.	34778	34885
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S6E).	34891	34896
26411452	Different to protein levels, MLPH mRNA levels in tumor (n = 77) were significantly higher compared with benign tissues (n = 74) (Supp.	34897	35031
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	S6F).	35037	35042
26411452	An analysis of the correlation of MLPH genotypes and disease characteristics revealed an association of the AG and GG genotypes of rs7584330:A>G with lower pathological stages (pT2 vs. pT3 and pT4; P = 0.021).	35043	35252
26411452	All other genotypes showed no significant association with any clinicopathological parameters (Supp.	35253	35353
26411452	Table S3).	35354	35364
26411452	In order to further investigate a possible role of MLPH in PCa, we correlated MLPH expression with clinical characteristics and clinical outcome.	35365	35510
26411452	Higher MLPH immunoreactivity in radical prostatectomy specimens was associated with lower Gleason scores (Gleason score ≤3+4 vs. ≥4+3; Fig.	35511	35650
26411452	5A) and with lower pathological stages (pT2 vs. pT3 and pT4; Fig.	35651	35716
26411452	5B), whereby the latter failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.1).	35717	35792
26411452	A significant higher protein expression was also associated with lower relative tumor mass (tumor mass <10% vs. ≥10%), although the expression level was not associated with tumor volume itself (Fig.	35793	35991
26411452	5C and D).	35992	36002
26411452	In line with these observations, higher immunoreactivity scores were found in patients without a biochemical (PSA) tumor recurrence (statistically significant in benign samples, close to significance in all samples; Fig.	36003	36223
26411452	5E), and in patients with a lower serum PSA (≤4 vs. > 4 ng/ml; Fig.	36224	36291
26411452	5F).	36292	36296
26411452	Higher expression was also associated with younger age at tumor diagnosis (≤60 vs. >60 years; Fig.	36297	36395
26411452	5G), whereas no association was observed with % free PSA (>13.05% vs. ≤13.05%; Fig.	36396	36479
26411452	5H).	36480	36484
26411452	With regard to MLPH mRNA expression differences, no parameter used for patient stratification showed a significant association (Supp.	36485	36618
26411452	Fig.	20242	20246
26411452	7A–H).	36624	36630
26411452	Solely within several stratification groups, the expression level was significantly higher in tumor compared with benign tissue.	36631	36759
26411452	Taken together, the pattern of MLPH expression reveals higher protein levels mainly associated with lower risk tumor parameters thus indicating a tumor‐suppressive function of this protein in PCa.	36760	36956
26411452	Using ChIP‐seq, we profiled genome‐wide androgen‐dependent ARBSs in DUCaP cells, which harbor a TMPRSS2‐ERG gene rearrangement, a genetic alteration found in 40%–70% of prostate tumors [Rubin et al., 2011; Schaefer et al., 2013].	36957	37186
26411452	A total number of 39,156 ARBSs were detected in the DUCaP cells, which is markedly higher than the number of binding sites found in the LNCaP cell line and comparable to the binding sites identified in the VCaP cells, a bone‐metastasis counterpart of DUCaP derived from the same patient [van Bokhoven et al., 2003; Massie et al., 2011].	37187	37523
26411452	Higher expression levels of AR in DUCaP and VCaP cells were proposed to be responsible for a higher number of genomic binding sites.	37524	37656
26411452	This is in line with increasing numbers of ARBSs in LNCaP cells manipulated to express higher levels of AR [Urbanucci et al., 2012].	37657	37789
26411452	Despite different numbers of ARBSs and different molecular characteristics of LNCaP and DUCaP cells, more than 80% of the LNCaP ARBSs overlapped with DUCaP‐binding sites, indicating that AR binding to chromatin target sites is mainly dependent on genomic sequences and less on the molecular cell characteristics.	37790	38102
26411452	Interestingly, of the 19,123 genes with ARBSs, only 1,490 were actually identified as primary AR target genes in DUCaP cells upon their uniform regulation after 8 and 24 hr of androgen stimulation.	38103	38300
26411452	Although there is a high degree of overlap of genes harboring ARBSs in different AR‐positive PCa cell lines, the concordance of actually androgen‐regulated genes among different cellular models is much smaller.	38301	38511
26411452	For example, less than half of the LNCaP genes we found androgen‐regulated in our gene array analysis were also androgen regulated in the DUCaP cells, suggesting a more pronounced influence of molecular properties and cellular phenotype on the actually androgen‐regulated gene set.	38512	38793
26411452	The distribution of ARBSs in DUCaP cells is similar in both androgen‐responsive and androgen‐unresponsive genes, indicating that other mechanisms, for instance, location of ARBS‐harboring genes in regions of either active or inactive chromatin, play a crucial role in addition.	38794	39071
26411452	Several interacting transcription factors that interrupt AR signaling might also account for this unexpected finding.	39072	39189
26411452	The TMPRSS2‐ERG fusion gene present in DUCaP cells was reported to disrupt AR signaling [Yu et al., 2010], and forkhead protein FoxA1 can modulate AR function through either pioneering or masking the pathway [Sahu et al., 2011].	39190	39418
26411452	A comparative analysis of all ARBSs in the authentic AR primary target genes, identified three dominant AR‐binding motifs, two of them, termed motif 2 and 3, are enriched around the transcription start sites of nearby target genes.	39419	39650
26411452	These two motifs also tend to cluster with each other.	39651	39705
26411452	Motif 3 is highly similar to a known motif bound by AR (MA0007.1), whereas motif 2 is a potential novel AR‐binding motif.	39706	39827
26411452	By analyzing the activity of this novel motif in an ARBS located in an intron of the MLPH gene, where it is 11 bases distant to a motif 3 element, we found that motif 2 alone could not mediate androgen regulation.	39828	40041
26411452	It seems to be an auxiliary AR motif and play a modulatory role, fine‐tuning AR signaling.	40042	40132
26411452	Investigating an involvement of PCa risk SNPs in modulating AR signaling, we found that PCa GWAS SNPs and their proxies are highly over‐represented in the identified ARBSs.	40133	40305
26411452	We have chosen rs11891426:T>G located in the novel auxiliary motif 2 in the MLPH AR enhancer to test the functional impact of this SNP in modulating AR transcriptional activity on the respective gene.	40306	40506
26411452	Reporter gene assays showed a reduced AR transactivation activity when the major T allele was changed to the risk G allele, corroborating the role of this SNP and its host motif 2 in modulating AR regulation of MLPH expression.	40507	40734
26411452	This role is similar to another SNP located in the TMPRSS2 enhancer that also reduces AR transactivation [Clinckemalie et al., 2013].	40735	40868
26411452	These findings indicate a potential function of PCa risk SNPs to promote tumorigenesis via modulating AR signaling.	40869	40984
26411452	In agreement with the enrichment of PCa risk SNPs in ARBSs, recent efforts to prioritize genetic variants for downstream functional evaluation by overlapping risk SNPs with epigenetic marks and expression quantitative trait loci analysis identified genetic variants of which a majority is localized within promoter and enhancer regions [Han et al., 2015].	40985	41340
26411452	In a similar approach, Al Olama et al. (2015) defined a new index risk SNP in the MLPH gene, rs11891348:T>G, which is even closer to rs11891426:T>G in the ARBS than the old index SNP rs2292884:A>G.	41341	41538
26411452	Genotype–phenotype association analysis of rs11891426:T>G in benign and malignant prostate tissues revealed reduced expression of MLPH in the presence of a risk G allele.	41539	41709
26411452	This is consistent with the reporter assay result, indicating that this SNP is negatively modulating androgen regulation of MLPH expression.	41710	41850
26411452	Previous GWAS studies have identified two PCa susceptibility loci at 2q37.3 with the two SNPs, rs2292884:A>G and rs7584330:A>G, located either within or next to the MLPH gene [Haiman et al., 2011; Kote‐Jarai et al., 2011a, 2011b; Schumacher et al., 2011].	41851	42106
26411452	The risk G allele of rs2292884:A>G, which has a stronger linkage disequilibrium with rs11891426:T>G compared with rs7584330:A>G, also strongly correlated with reduced MLPH gene expression in human prostates.	42107	42314
26411452	Along with the evidence of rs11891426:T>G as a putative risk SNP within the MLPH‐ARBS and the correlation of MLPH and AR expression in prostate tissue at protein and mRNA level, these data further imply a predisposition to PCa via modulating MLPH gene expression.	42315	42578
26411452	MLPH is a member of the exophilin subfamily of Rab effector proteins, an interaction partner of the small Ras‐related GTP‐ases Rab27A and Rab27B on one hand and of the motor protein myosin on the other [Fukuda et al., 2002].	42579	42803
26411452	The complex MLPH/Rab27/myosin is required for the polarized transport of melanosomes along the actin cytoskeleton in melanocytes [Matesic et al., 2001], for the pigmentation of the hair and skin [Menasche et al., 2000] and for the secretion pathway [Fukuda, 2013].	42804	43068
26411452	Little is known about a possible functional impact in carcinogenesis or tumor progression.	43069	43159
26411452	Dysregulation of MLPH was found in several types of tumors, for example, lung cancer, meningiomas, and breast cancer [Fevre‐Montange et al., 2009; Pio et al., 2010; Thakkar et al., 2010; Molina‐Pinelo et al., 2014].	43160	43375
26411452	A very recent study found association of expression of MLPH (and some other genes) with nearby SNPs in prostate tissue [Penney et al., 2015].	43376	43517
26411452	In non‐small cell lung cancer MLPH mRNA was identified as a target of differentially expressed miRNAs [Molina‐Pinelo et al., 2014].	43518	43649
26411452	Interestingly, MLPH was found to be significantly overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer suggesting a regulation of this protein by estrogen hormones [Thakkar et al., 2010].	43650	43847
26411452	In our study, we found both androgen regulation in PCa cells and significant positive correlations of MLPH and AR mRNAs and proteins in benign and malignant prostate tissue implying AR involvement in MLPH regulation in vivo.	43848	44072
26411452	Most interestingly, correlation of MLPH expression to clinicopathological variables of patients revealed a clear correlation of higher expression with a favorable risk profile, including lower Gleason grades, lower pathological stages, smaller relative tumor mass, absence of biochemical tumor recurrence, and lower serum PSA.	44073	44399
26411452	Solely, the correlation with lower patients’ age at diagnosis does not fit into this line.	44400	44490
26411452	Taken together, the expression pattern of MLPH points toward a tumor‐suppressive function of MLPH, which is weakened in the presence of a rs11891426:T>G risk G allele by attenuation of androgen and AR‐regulated expression of MLPH.	44491	44721
26411452	Our work took advantage of next‐generation sequencing for genome wide profiling of ARBSs in the DUCaP PCa cell line that represents tumors harboring ERG gene rearrangements.	44722	44895
26411452	We deciphered a possible regulatory mechanism of a PCa GWAS candidate gene, MLPH, and its link to the androgenome.	44896	45010
26411452	The mechanism of MLHP regulation in benign and malignant prostate tissues identified a highly likely causative SNP, rs11891426:T>G, around 50 kb away from the originally associated PCa risk index SNPs.	45011	45212
26411452	Higher expression of MLPH in the prostate tissue of cancer patients with a favorable risk profile provides evidence for a tumor‐suppressive function of this protein.	45213	45378
26411452	Collectively, our study reveals that identifying the plausible causative SNP for a complex disease requires careful functional assessment of each SNP around the GWAS index SNPs.	45379	45556
26411452	Further work is needed to clarify in‐depth its role in disease development and the function of MLPH in benign and malignant prostate cells.	45557	45696
26411452	Disclosure statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.	45697	45763
20949073	Premature termination codons (PTCs) are usually associated with severe phenotypes.	0	82
20949073	However, mild disease outcomes can occur by at least three different mechanisms.	83	163
20949073	First, translation can be initiated at an internal start codon located downstream from the PTC.	164	259
20949073	Second, PTCs can trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a pathway that protects the cell from aberrant transcripts.	260	380
20949073	Third, nonsense-associated alternative splicing (NAS) can remove the exon harboring the PTC.	381	473
20949073	Subtle changes in alternative splicing events have recently been reported at particular tandem acceptor splice sites, NAGNAG sites (where N represents any nucleotide)–.	474	642
20949073	The use of the intron proximal or distal splice site results in the production of two distinct isoforms distinguished by three nucleotides (NAG).	643	788
20949073	This alternative splicing could result in the creation or deletion of a stop codon.	789	872
20949073	The latter event would thus constitute another mechanism of PTC removal, but has never been described in human pathophysiology.	873	1000
20949073	Splice events at short-distance tandem sites are widespread and contribute to transcriptome and proteome complexity.	1001	1117
20949073	NAGNAG acceptor motifs are present in 30% of human genes and several studies based on computational analysis using expressed sequence tag (EST) databases showed that at least 5% of human genes contain an experimentally confirmed NAGNAG tandem site.	1118	1366
20949073	A subtle splice event associated with Stargardt's disease 1, in which a mutation in the ABCA4 gene produced an indel of one amino acid in 50% of the transcripts from one patient, has been described.	1367	1565
20949073	Nonetheless, the involvement of mutations that alter tandem sites have not been extensively studied in disease.	1566	1677
20949073	Therefore, to explore further the effect of mutations located within a NAGNAG acceptor motif, we studied the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR).	1678	1851
20949073	Querying the Tandem Splice Site DataBase (TassDB), a comprehensive online database dedicated to recognizing tandem acceptor sites, identified two NAGNAG motifs in CFTR.	1852	2020
20949073	Mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a cAMP-regulated Cl− channel located at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, cause cystic fibrosis (CF).	2021	2171
20949073	CF is the most common severe autosomal recessive genetic disorder in Caucasians and affects the physiology of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, reproductive organs, and sweat glands.	2172	2354
20949073	Mutations in the CFTR gene induce a continuum of phenotypes ranging from mild manifestations with isolated features such as congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), or nasal polyposis, to severe disease symptoms.	2355	2584
20949073	Therefore, CF is a good model to identify novel modifier mechanisms.	2585	2653
20949073	Here, we show that alternative splicing at a tandem acceptor site removes a premature UAG stop codon and leads to synthesis of a functional protein.	2654	2802
20949073	This novel PTC removal mechanism explains the mild phenotype detected in several patients.	2803	2893
20949073	In this study, we focused on the rare E831X mutation (2623G>T) which affects the first nucleotide of exon 14a which forms part of one of the two NAGNAG acceptor sites detected in the CFTR gene.	2894	3087
20949073	We had the opportunity to study a consanguineous family of Turkish origin which included three patients (Figure 1A) homozygous for the E831X mutation (Figure 1B).	3088	3250
20949073	To evaluate the functional consequences of this mutation in a tandem splice motif, we performed transcript analysis on epithelial cells obtained from patient III10 (Figure 1A) by nasal brushing, which is the least invasive technique and provides the most reliable cells to study CFTR mRNA.	3251	3540
20949073	Mutations that generate PTCs can reduce the steady-state level of mRNA via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).	3541	3646
20949073	Total RNA from nasal epithelial cells of patient III10 was first quantified to evaluate the amount of CFTR transcripts.	3647	3766
20949073	Quantitative analysis by real-time PCR was normalized to that of keratin 18 (KRT18), a marker of ciliated and secretory epithelial cells,.	3767	3905
20949073	The results clearly showed that the level of CFTR mRNA was reduced by half in the sample from patient III10 compared to three control samples (48%±9% compared to WT, Figure 2A), showing that the CFTR mRNAs were subject to NMD.	3906	4132
20949073	To evaluate the mRNA pattern associated with the 2623G>T mutation, a semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed and the products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis.	4133	4310
20949073	In control samples, two peaks could be detected: a major peak corresponding to the full-length mRNA (97%±0.5%) and a minor peak corresponding to exon 14a skipping (3%±0.5%) (Figure 2B), a feature of CFTR splicing that has been described previously.	4311	4559
20949073	In the patient III10 sample, a more complex pattern appeared, with the presence of three distinct peaks (Figure 2B) that were subsequently identified by sequencing: a major peak corresponding to exon 14a skipping (76%±2%) (Figure 2B and 2C) and two additional peaks corresponding to a full-length mRNA containing the stop codon (16%±2%) and an mRNA lacking these three nucleotides (8%±0.8%) (Figure 2B and 2D).	4560	4970
20949073	Hence, the 2623G>T substitution induced two effects: a reduced level of full-length mRNA containing the stop codon by NMD and the generation of additional mRNA isoforms.	4971	5140
20949073	These mRNAs were identified as an mRNA lacking exon 14a, a full-length mRNA containing the premature UAG stop codon, and a third mRNA lacking the three nucleotides encoding the UAG stop codon.	5141	5333
20949073	To investigate whether the alternative splicing was due to the 2623G>T mutation, we constructed a hybrid minigene containing CFTR exon 14a and approximately 400 nucleotides of its flanking intronic regions.	5334	5540
20949073	After transfection in the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, RT-PCR samples were separated by capillary electrophoresis analysis and isoforms were identified by sequencing.	5541	5718
20949073	As in the direct transcript analysis, the wild-type construct revealed a low level of exon 14a skipping (7%±0.8%).	5719	5833
20949073	The 2623G>T substitution increased exon 14a skipping up to 92%±2%.	5834	5900
20949073	In addition, two peaks could be detected corresponding to full-length mRNA (7%±2%) and to the isoform lacking three nucleotides (0.8%.±0.5%) (Figure 3A and 3C).	5901	6061
20949073	To focus on these two lower abundance isoforms, a reverse primer within exon 14a was used to amplify mRNAs containing exon 14a specifically.	6062	6202
20949073	A single peak was detected in mRNA obtained from cells transfected with the wild-type construct, whereas two peaks were detected in mRNA from cells transfected with the 2623G>T construct.	6203	6390
20949073	The major peak corresponded to full-length mRNA containing the UAG stop codon (88%±0.5%) and the mRNA in the minor peak lacked these three nucleotides (12%±0.5%) (Figure 3B and 3C).	6391	6572
20949073	The ratio between these two isoforms was comparable using either reverse primer.	6573	6653
20949073	The relative amounts of the three isoforms differed from the amounts measured for endogenous CFTR, but the minigene construct containing the mutated exon 14a sequence reproduced the in vivo splicing pattern.	6654	6861
20949073	Therefore, the single nucleotide substitution (2623G>T) is the main determinant of alternative splicing at this site.	6862	6979
20949073	Recognition of the 3′ splice site upstream of exon 14a generates full-length mRNA leading to synthesis of the entire CFTR protein.	6980	7110
20949073	The CFTR channel is composed of two transmembrane spanning domains, two nucleotide binding folds, and a regulatory domain (R domain).	7111	7244
20949073	The regulatory domain is encoded by exon 13 (orange) and exon 14a encodes the region linking the regulatory domain to the seventh transmembrane segment (blue) (Figure 4A).	7245	7416
20949073	The 2623G>T mutation which occurs at the first base of exon 14a induced multiple splicing defects, including exon skipping.	7417	7540
20949073	An mRNA lacking exon 14a encodes a protein missing the linker domain between the R domain and the seventh transmembrane segment (CFTR-del831-873, Figure 4B).	7541	7698
20949073	In addition to the full-length mRNA containing the UAG stop codon, alternative splicing at the NAGNAG site generated an mRNA lacking this stop codon.	7699	7848
20949073	The resulting proteins would be either truncated after the regulatory domain (CFTR-E831X, Figure 4C) or missing one amino acid (CFTR-ΔE831, Figure 4D), respectively.	7849	8014
20949073	The processing of CFTR can be assessed by examining its glycosylation state.	8015	8091
20949073	Western blot analysis of wild-type CFTR protein, transiently (Figure 5A, left panels) or stably (Figure 5A, right panel) expressed in HEK293 cells, revealed two bands.	8092	8259
20949073	The diffuse band of 170 kDa (band C) corresponds to the mature, fully glycosylated protein and the thin band of approximately 140 kDa (band B) represents the core-glycosylated immature CFTR.	8260	8450
20949073	Similar analysis of transiently expressed CFTR-del831-873 revealed a unique thin band indicating a maturation defect (Figure 5A, higher left panel) that was further investigated using an N-Glycosidase F assay (Figure S1).	8451	8672
20949073	After enzymatic treatment of CFTR-WT, both bands B and C were converted to the lower apparent molecular weight non-glycosylated band A. CFTR-del831-873 was not affected by the enzymatic treatment, indicating an absence of glycosylation of this protein, thus identifying the first naturally occurring non-glycosylated CFTR mutant.	8673	9002
20949073	Stably expressed CFTR-E831X protein was detected as a single band at the expected size (Figure 5A, right panel), while transiently expressed CFTR-ΔE831 showed a normal maturation profile with the presence of both bands B and C (Figure 5A, lower left panel).	9003	9260
20949073	Immunostaining of transiently transfected HeLa cells confirmed a processing defect in both the CFTR-del831-873 and CFTR-E831X mutant proteins as they could only be detected in intracellular compartments close to the nucleus, whereas both CFTR-WT and CFTR-ΔE831 showed clear cell surface staining (Figure 5B).	9261	9569
20949073	Finally, functional assays showed the absence of CFTR-dependent anion transport in cells expressing either CFTR-del831-873 or CFTR-E831X.	9570	9707
20949073	In contrast, a high level of anion transport was observed with CFTR-WT and CFTR-ΔE831, in accordance with the biochemical and immunocytochemical results above (Figure 5C and 5D).	9708	9886
20949073	Therefore, we conclude that CFTR-ΔE831 represents the functional form accounting for the mild phenotype observed within this family.	9887	10019
20949073	CF was suspected in the first year of life in patient III10 (Figure 1A) due to recurrent bronchitis, and this was confirmed by a positive sweat test (70 mmol/L).	10020	10181
20949073	The patient was tested and found to be homozygous for the nonsense mutation E831X.	10182	10264
20949073	After familial study, CF was diagnosed in his 18-year-old sister (III5), who also had a positive sweat test and the same genotype.	10265	10395
20949073	However, the two siblings, now aged 13 and 30, are in good health with no evidence of pancreatic insufficiency, and have normal lung function tests.	10396	10544
20949073	The female patient married her first cousin who was found to be an E831X carrier.	10545	10626
20949073	Their son (IV1) is homozygous for the E831X mutation.	10627	10680
20949073	Now 5 years of age, he presents with a positive sweat test (74 mmol/L), but yearly clinical assessments are normal (Table 1).	10681	10806
20949073	Interestingly, this mutation was first described in a female CF patient carrying the severe missense substitution G551D on the other allele.	10807	10947
20949073	E831X was considered as a severe mutation because she presented with meconium ileus at birth, a neonate pulmonary infection and an elevated sweat test.	10948	11099
20949073	Given our results, we requested yearly clinical assessments, which indicated no pulmonary exacerbation, an almost normal chest radiograph, moderate pancreatic insufficiency and normal abdominal ultrasound.	11100	11305
20949073	Thus, her clinical outcome was better than expected at birth.	11306	11367
20949073	This mutation was also reported in two 13-year-old male twins of Turkish origin carrying an in-frame deletion on the other allele (591del18).	11368	11509
20949073	These twins had persistent nasal polyps and elevated sweat tests, but no pancreas or lung involvement.	11510	11612
20949073	Subsequently, E831X was reported to be the allele present in cohorts of men with CBAVD and mild to severe mutations, such as ΔF508, for the other allele–.	11613	11767
20949073	These clinical observations and our data bring the deleterious nature of the E831X mutation into question; but how can the minor functional CFTR-ΔE831 isoform lead to such mild phenotypes?	11768	11956
20949073	The minimal level of CFTR mRNA required to maintain normal function differs between organs, with the vas deferens being the most sensitive tissue.	11957	12103
20949073	CFTR-ΔE831 mRNAs did not appear to reach this threshold in all tissues, leading to mild phenotypes such as nasal polyposis or CBAVD in compound heterozygotes.	12104	12262
20949073	In the nasal epithelial cells of patient III10, mRNAs encoding functional CFTR-ΔE831 were estimated at 8%.	12263	12369
20949073	As total CFTR transcripts were reduced to 48% compared to WT levels, this amount can be corrected down to 4%, a level comparable to previous studies associated with mild lung disease,.	12370	12554
20949073	However, the relative level of each transcript may differ between patients, as the same PTC has been shown to elicit NMD with variable efficiency in CF nasal epithelial cells, thus reducing the amount of full-length mRNA containing the stop codon.	12555	12802
20949073	The intron 13/exon 14a boundary, illustrated in Figure 6, shows the presence of a proximal acceptor site in the intron and a distal acceptor site in the exon, typical of a NAGNAG motif.	12803	12988
20949073	The use of the proximal or distal acceptor site is regulated by multiple factors.	12989	13070
20949073	First, the strength of the acceptor site depends on the site itself (CAG>TAG>AAG), the polypyrimidine tract, and the branch point sequences.	13071	13211
20949073	In addition, the branch point sequence-to-NAGNAG region in the 3′ tandem splice site was shown to participate in 3′ splice-site selection.	13212	13350
20949073	This selection could also be modulated by RNA-binding proteins because exonic or intronic splicing enhancer (ESE, ISE) and silencer (ESS, ISS) sites have been described as overabundant in the vicinity of tandem 3′ splice sites compared to constitutively spliced exons.	13351	13619
20949073	Lastly, the nucleotides composing the NAGNAG acceptor site are also tightly implicated in the recognition of either the proximal or distal splice site.	13620	13771
20949073	NAGNAG acceptor sites have been classified with respect to their splicing plausibility.	13772	13859
20949073	Plausible sites allow the use of both acceptor sites, whereas implausible ones allow the use of a single site.	13860	13970
20949073	The 2623G>T substitution converts the NAGNAG acceptor motif from an implausible CAGGAG (use of the proximal site) into a plausible CAGTAG motif (use of either proximal or distal splice sites).	13971	14163
20949073	Therefore, the mutation would favor the use of the distal splice site, resulting in bypass of the PTC and explaining the mechanism leading to an mRNA lacking three nucleotides (Figure 6).	14164	14351
20949073	In silico analysis using software dedicated to analyzing NAGNAG motifs (BayNAGNAG) predicted a shift in the probability of using both the proximal and distal acceptor sites from 0.2% to 81.2%, consistent with our in vivo results (Table 2).	14352	14591
20949073	The first description of a disease-causing mutation in a NAGNAG splice site was reported in the ABCA4 gene, before the description of the NAGNAG motif by Hiller et al. in 2004.	14592	14768
20949073	This mutation (2588G>C) was shown to produce two isoforms leading to either an indel of Gly863 or to a missense defect, Gly863Ala, by shifting the NAGNAG motif from an implausible sequence (TAGGAG) into a plausible sequence (TAGCAG).	14769	15002
20949073	Similarly, in silico analysis predicted an increase in the probability of using either distal or proximal acceptor sites from 0.1% to 57.7% (Table 2).	15003	15153
20949073	Our study demonstrated that disease-causing mutations in NAGNAG are predictive of alternative splicing, as previously proposed for single nucleotide polymorphisms in NAGNAG acceptors.	15154	15337
20949073	Therefore, in the absence of mRNA samples, such splicing events could be anticipated by in silico analysis.	15338	15445
20949073	The removal of a deleterious PTC could apply to many genes, as the configuration we have described is frequent in the human genome.	15446	15577
20949073	Indeed, NAGGAG represents the most frequent NAGNAG motif recognizable upstream of a coding exon.	15578	15674
20949073	Querying the TassDB retrieved 4882 occurrences of the NAGGAG motif with GAG in a coding exon, representing 4597 genes.	15675	15793
20949073	Among these NAGGAG motifs, 52.2% (n = 2551) are in intron phase 0, a configuration that leads to the first amino acid of the exon being a Glu, as shown in this study.	15794	15960
20949073	We can therefore hypothesize that bypass of a deleterious PTC could occur when similar GAG to TAG mutations affect one of the 2551 NAGGAG motifs within the human genome.	15961	16130
20949073	In addition to contributing to proteome plasticity, alternative splicing at tandem 3′ acceptor sites can also result in in vivo removal of a premature UAG stop codon.	16131	16297
20949073	This feature differentiates the UAG stop codon from UAA or UGA and may help explain phenotype/genotype discrepancies.	16298	16415
20949073	The novel PTC removal mechanism would be expected to lead to mild phenotypes, with the deletion of a single amino acid being potentially less deleterious than a truncating mutation.	16416	16597
20949073	This study also emphasizes the biological significance of alternative splicing at tandem acceptor sites in the context of disease-causing mutations.	16598	16746
20949073	Subtle splicing events could be considered simply as noise tolerated by the cell; however, considering point mutations at NAGNAG acceptor sites clearly provides evidence of their functional relevance.	16747	16947
20949073	Alternative splicing at these acceptor sites could define a novel phenotype-modifying mechanism buffering deleterious nonsense mutations.	16948	17085
20949073	Overall, this study highlights the importance of thoroughly characterizing the molecular defects in patients with milder than expected phenotypes.	17086	17232
20949073	Indeed, such molecular studies can reveal naturally occurring mechanisms where modifier genes or epigenetic factors have been suspected to have an effect.	17233	17387
20949073	Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the local ethics committee approved the study.	17388	17486
20949073	Cells obtained from nasal brushings were immediately transferred into RNA-Later buffer (Qiagen) and total RNA was purified as recommended by the manufacturer using QiaQuick Spin columns (Qiagen).	17487	17682
20949073	Two independent RT-PCR assays were performed with 400 ng of total RNA for each sample (Applied Biosystems).	17683	17790
20949073	CFTR and KRT18 primers and probes (TaqMan FAM/NFQ-MGB probe format) were designed by Applied Biosystems.	17791	17895
20949073	PCR reactions contained the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay Mix, TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, no AmpErase UNG, and 1 µl cDNA (or 1 µl of DNase/RNase free water for the No Template Control) in a final volume of 20 µl.	17896	18113
20949073	Samples were placed in 96-well plates and amplified in an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).	18114	18230
20949073	Amplification conditions were 10 min at 95.0°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95.0°C and 1 min at 60.0°C.	18231	18339
20949073	All reactions were run in triplicate and each sample was run in two QPCR assays.	18340	18420

20126413	Grade IV glioma, also called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most common primary malignant brain tumor with about 16,000 new diagnoses each year in the United States.	0	172
20126413	While the number of cases is relatively small, comprising only 1.35% of primary malignant cancers in the US, GBMs have a one-year survival rate of only 29.6%, making it one of the most deadly types of cancer.	173	381
20126413	Recent clinical studies demonstrate improved survival with a combination of radiation and Temozolomide chemotherapy, but median survival time for GBM patients who receive therapy is only 15 months.	382	579
20126413	Due to its highly aggressive nature and poor therapeutic options, understanding the genetic etiology of GBM is of great interest and therefore, GBM has been selected as one of the three initial cancer types to be thoroughly studied in the TCGA program.	580	832
20126413	To that end, numerous cell line models of GBM have been established and used in vast numbers of studies over the years.	833	952
20126413	It is well recognized that cell line models of human disorders, especially cancers, are an important resource.	953	1063
20126413	While these cell lines are the basis of substantial biological insight, experiments are currently performed in the absence of genome-wide mutational status as no cell line that models a human disease has yet had its genome fully sequenced.	1064	1303
20126413	Here, we have sequenced the genome of U87MG, a long established cell line derived from a human grade IV glioma used in over 1,700 publications.	1304	1447
20126413	A wide range of biological information is known about this cell line.	1448	1517
20126413	The U87MG cell line is known to have a highly aberrant genomic structure based on karyotyping, SKY, and FISH.	1518	1627
20126413	However, these methods neither provide the resolution required to visualize the precise breakpoint of a translocation event, nor are they generally capable of identifying genomic microdeletions (deletions on the order of a megabase or less in size) in a whole genome survey of structural variation.	1628	1926
20126413	SNP genotyping microarrays can be used to detect regions of structural variation in the forms of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number (CN) based on probe intensity, but do not reveal chromosomal joins.	1927	2136
20126413	To assess the genomic stability of U87MG, the genome was genotyped by Illumina Human 1M-Duo BeadChip microarray.	2137	2249
20126413	In spite of being cultured independently for several years, the regions of LOH and the CN state of our U87MG genome matched exactly with data retrieved from the Sanger COSMIC database for U87MG, which had been assayed on an Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0.	2250	2517
20126413	This suggests that although U87MG bears a large number of large-scale chromosomal aberrations, it has been relatively stable for years and is not rapidly changing.	2518	2681
20126413	This suggests that prior work on U87MG may be reinterpreted based on the whole genome sequence data presented here.	2682	2797
20126413	The first draft of the consensus sequence of the human genome was reported in 2001,.	2798	2882
20126413	The first individual human diploid sequence was sequenced using capillary-based Sanger sequencing.	2883	2981
20126413	Since then, a few additional diploid human genomes have been published utilizing a variety of massively parallel sequencing techniques to sequence human genomes to varying degrees of coverage, variant discovery, and quality typically costing well over $200,000 and several machine months of operation–.	2982	3284
20126413	For the sequencing of U87MG, we utilized ABI SOLiD technology, which uses a ligation-based assay with two-base color-encoded oligonucleotides that has been demonstrated to allow highly accurate single nucleotide variant (SNV) and insertion/deletion (indel) detection.	3285	3552
20126413	Additionally, long mate-paired genomic libraries with a mean insert size of 1–2kb allowed higher clone coverage of the genome, which improved our ability to identify genomic structural variations such as interchromosomal translocations and large deletions.	3553	3809
20126413	While longer insert sizes would improve resolution of some structural variants, during genomic shearing the highest density of large fragments occurs at 1.5kb, allowing a sufficiently complex library to be generated from only 10 micrograms of genomic DNA while still being well powered to identify structural variations.	3810	4130
20126413	Here, we demonstrate that aligning the two-base color-encoding data with BFAST software and decoding during alignment allows for highly sensitive detection of indels, which have in the past been difficult to detect by short read massively parallel sequencing.	4131	4390
20126413	For cancer sequencing, it is important to assess not only SNVs, but indels, structural variations and translocations, and it is preferable to extract this information from a common assay platform.	4391	4587
20126413	A major characteristic of the U87MG cell line that differentiates it from the samples used in other whole genome sequencing projects published thus far is its highly aberrant genomic structure.	4588	4781
20126413	Due to its heavily rearranged state, we thoroughly and accurately assessed each of these major classes of mutations and demonstrated that small indels, large microdeletions and interchromosomal translocations are actually the major categories of mutations that affect known genes in this cancer cell line.	4782	5087
20126413	These analyses provide a model for other genome sequencing projects outside major genome centers of how to both thoroughly sequence and assess the mutational state of whole genomes.	5088	5269
20126413	From ten micrograms of input genomic DNA, we performed two and a half full sequencing runs on the ABI SOLiD Sequencing System, for a total of five full slides of data.	5270	5437
20126413	Utilizing the ABI long mate-pair protocol, we produced 1,014,984,286 raw 50bp mate-paired reads (101.5Gb).	5438	5544
20126413	In some cases the bead was recognized by the imaging software for only one read, thereby producing an additional 120,691,623 single end reads (6.0Gb).	5545	5695
20126413	In aggregate, we generated a total of 107.5Gb of raw data (Table 1).	5696	5764
20126413	We also performed an exon capture approach designed to sequence the exons of 5,253 genes (10.7Mb) annotated in the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) V38, Cancer Gene Census, Cancer Genome Project Planned Studies and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM gene list using a custom-created Agilent array.	5765	6111
20126413	This approach used the Illumina GAII sequencing system to sequence captured DNA fragments using a paired end sequencing protocol.	6112	6241
20126413	This resulted in 9,948,782 raw 76bp paired end reads (1.51Gb), and a mean base coverage of 29.5×.	6242	6339
20126413	These reads were used to calculate concordance rates with the larger whole genome sequence dataset.	6340	6439
20126413	The Blat-like Fast Accurate Search Tool (BFAST) version 0.5.3 was used to align 107.5Gb of raw color space reads to the color space conversion of the human genome assembly hg18 from University of California, Santa Cruz (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/bigZips/, based on the March 2006 NCBI build 36.1).	6440	6758
20126413	Duplicate reads, typically from the same initial PCR fragment during genomic library construction, were inevitable and accounted for 16.4% of the total aligned data.	6759	6924
20126413	These were removed using the alignment filtering utility in the DNAA package (http://dnaa.sourceforge.net).	6925	7032
20126413	A total of 390,604,184 paired end reads (39.06Gb), 266,635,829 (13.33Gb) unpaired reads, and 62,336,824 (3.12Gb) single end reads were successfully mapped to a unique location in the reference genome with high confidence for a total of 55.51Gb of aligned sequence (Table 1).	7033	7307
20126413	For the exon capture dataset, we uniquely aligned 8,142,874 paired end reads (1.2Gb) and 1,097,000 (83Mb) unpaired reads for a total of 1.32Gb of raw aligned sequence (Table 2).	7308	7485
20126413	Using the ABI SOLiD reads, we identified small insertions and deletions (indels), single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and structural variants such as large-scale microdeletions and translocation events.	7486	7687
20126413	The exon capture Solexa reads were used to validate SNVs identified in the SOLiD sequencing.	7688	7780
20126413	The overall pattern of base sequence coverage from the shotgun reads changes across the genome, and as expected is highly concordant with the copy number state as determined by Illumina 1M Duo and Affymetrix 6.0 SNP analysis (Figure 1).	7781	8017
20126413	Regions of two normal copies, such as chromosome 3, showed even base sequence coverage across their entire length (12.4 reads/base, excluding centromeric and telomeric regions which are not represented accurately in hg18).	8018	8240
20126413	Meanwhile, regions with one-copy state according to the SNP chip, such as the distal q-arm of chr11 and the distal p-arm of chr6, show about half the base sequence coverage (7.2 reads/base) as a predicted two-copy region.	8241	8462
20126413	Likewise, predicted three-copy state regions, such as the distal q-arm of chr13, show about 1.5 times the base sequence coverage of a predicted two-copy region.	8463	8623
20126413	A complete deletion spanning the region on chromosome 9 that includes the CDKN2A gene is also seen in both the SNP chip and ABI SOLiD base sequence coverage.	8624	8781
20126413	These data show at a very large scale that sequence placement is generally correct and supports the copy number state calls from the array based data.	8782	8932
20126413	Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions ranging from 1 to 20 bases (indels) were identified from the alignment data using the MAQ consensus model as implemented in the SAMtools software suite.	8933	9154
20126413	SAMtools produced variant calls, zygosity predictions, and a Phred-scaled probability that the consensus is identical to the reference.	9155	9290
20126413	To improve the reliability of our variant calls, variants were required to have a Phred score of at least 10 and further needed to be observed greater than or equal to 4 but less than 60 times and at least once on each strand.	9291	9517
20126413	In total, we identified 2,384,470 SNVs meeting our filtering criteria.	9518	9588
20126413	Of these, 2,140,848 (89.8%) were identified as exact matches to entries in dbSNP129.	9589	9673
20126413	Exact matches had both the variant and observed alleles in the dbSNP entry, allowing for the discovery of novel alleles at known SNP locations.	9674	9817
20126413	In total, 243,622 SNVs (10.2%) were identified as novel events not previously recorded in dbSNP 129.	9818	9918
20126413	This rate of novel variant discovery is consistent with other whole human normal genome sequences of European ancestry relative to dbSNP.	9919	10056
20126413	These SNVs were further characterized based on zygosity predictions from the MAQ consensus model, separating SNVs into homozygous or heterozygous categories (Table 3).	10057	10224
20126413	The observed diversity value for SNVs (θSNV, number of heterozygous SNVs/number of base pairs) across autosomal chromosomes was 4.4×10−4, which is generally consistent with the normal human genome variation rate.	10225	10437
20126413	For small (<21bp) insertions and deletions, 191,743 events were detected with 116,964 not previously documented in dbSNP 129.	10438	10563
20126413	The same criteria as used for SNVs was used for determining if an indel was novel and they were further classified as homozygous or heterozygous using the SAMtools variant caller (Table 4).	10564	10753
20126413	The observed diversity value (θindel, number of heterozygous indels/number of base pairs) across autosomal chromosomes was 0.38×10−4.	10754	10887
20126413	A subset of 38 variants meeting genome-wide filtering criteria, including a 20-base deletion, was tested by PCR and Sanger sequencing with 34 being validated.	10888	11046
20126413	In summary, 85.2% of SNVs (23/27), and 100% of small insertions (3/3), deletions (4/4), translocations (3/3) and microdeletions (1/1) were validated in this manner (Table S1).	11047	11222
20126413	While this is a small sample, it demonstrates an overall low false positive rate.	11223	11304
20126413	The size distribution of indels identified in U87MG is generally consistent with previous studies on coding and non-coding indel sizes in non-cancer samples–.	11305	11463
20126413	Small deletion sizes ranged from 1 to 20 bases in size and their distribution approximates a power law distribution in concordance with previous findings (Figure 2A).	11464	11630
20126413	There is a small deviation from the power law distribution with an excess of 4-base indels in U87MG's non-coding regions (Figure 2A, red bars),.	11631	11775
20126413	A similar trend is seen with insertions in non-coding sequence with the maximum observed insertion size of 17 bases (Figure 2B, red bars).	11776	11914
20126413	The maximum insertion size observed is less than the maximum deletion size because it is easier to align longer deletions than it is to align insertions.	11915	12068
20126413	Some small insertions and deletions are likely to be larger than the upper limit of 17 and 20 bases actually observed, but the 50-base read length limits the power to align such reads directly.	12069	12262
20126413	In coding regions, there is a bias towards events that are multiples of 3-bases in length that maintain the reading frame despite variant alleles, suggesting that many of these are polymorphisms (Figure 2A-deletions, Figure 2B-insertions, blue bars).	12263	12513
20126413	In non-coding regions, only 10.8% of indels are a multiple of 3 bases in size, while in coding regions, 27.0% are 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 bases in size.	12514	12660
20126413	This trend is expected based on past observations of non-cancer samples,.	12661	12734
20126413	Observed SNV base substitution patterns were consistent with common mutational phenomena in both coding sequences and genome wide.	12735	12865
20126413	As expected, the predominant nucleotide substitution seen in SNVs is a transition, changing purine for purine (A<->G) or pyrimidine for pyrimidine (C<->T).	12866	13021
20126413	Previous studies have observed that two out of every three SNPs are transitions as opposed to transversions, and we observed that 67.4% of our SNVs were transitions, while 32.6% were transversions, a 2.07∶1 ratio.	13022	13235
20126413	(Figure 3) However, in coding regions, there appears to be an increase in C->T/G->A transitions and a decrease in T->C/A->G transitions, whereas genome-wide these transitions were approximately equivalent.	13236	13441
20126413	To assess the coverage depth of the U87MG genome sequence, we followed Ley at al. and required detection of both alleles at most positions in the genome.	13442	13595
20126413	We utilized the Illumina 1M-Duo BeadChip to find reliably sequenced positions in the genome with an understanding that this may lead to bias towards more unique regions of the genome.	13596	13779
20126413	In order to best use the SNP genotyping array data, we included only those regions that are diploid based on normal frequency of heterozygous calls and copy number assessment.	13780	13955
20126413	This effectively permitted us to use the heterozygous calls for assessing accuracy of the short read data for variant calling (Figure 1).	13956	14093
20126413	Only SNPs both observed to be heterozygous and that the Illumina genotyping chip called ‘high quality’ were used, which provided a total of 219,187 high quality heterozygous SNPs for comparison.	14094	14288
20126413	99.71% of these were sequenced at least once.	14289	14334
20126413	After applying variant detection filtering criteria (see Materials and Methods) and assessing concordance between the sequence calls and genotyping array calls, 93.71% of the genome was sequenced at sufficient depth to call both alleles of the diploid genome.	14335	14594
20126413	This is roughly equivalent to the likelihood of sufficient sampling of the whole genome when repeats and segmental duplications are excluded.	14595	14736
20126413	Notably, a variant allele was observed at every position called heterozygous by SNP chip, while a reference allele was observed at 201,414 (97.94%) positions.	14737	14895
20126413	In other words, the SNV detection algorithm uniformly miscalled the homozygous variant allele.	14896	14990
20126413	Filtering for quality causes a bias toward identifying SNVs at sites that have higher coverage.	14991	15086
20126413	That said, after SNV quality filtering, diploid coverage of the cytogenetically normal portions of the genome was 10.85× for each allele, which is clearly adequate for calling over 90% of the base variant positions on each allele at high accuracy.	15087	15334
20126413	Because the positions of the genome included on SNP arrays is not a random sampling of the genome, we also assessed mapping coverage genome-wide.	15335	15480
20126413	Of all bases in the haploid genome, 78.9% of the whole reference genome was covered by at least one reliably placed read.	15481	15602
20126413	Of that portion of the genome, 91.9% of all bases were effectively sequenced based on passing variant calling filters (Phred>10, >4× coverage, <60× coverage).	15603	15761
20126413	Thus, a total of 72.5% of the whole genome was sequenced, including repeats and duplicated regions, which is typical of short sequence shotgun approaches.	15762	15916
20126413	10.9Mb of genomic sequence was targeted consisting of the amino acid encoding exons of 5,235 genes and were sequenced to a mean coverage of 30× using the Illumina GAII sequencer.	15917	16095
20126413	Given the larger variability of coverage from the capture data, only a subset of these bases (8.5Mb) was evaluable to determine the false positive variant detection rate from the complete genomic sequence data.	16096	16306
20126413	This region contained 1,621 SNPs present in dbSNP129.	16307	16360
20126413	Within the 8.5Mb of common and well-covered sequence in the genomic sequence data and the capture sequence, there were 1,780 SNVs called from the genomic sequence.	16361	16524
20126413	The same non-reference allele was concordantly observed at 1,631 positions within the capture data.	16525	16624
20126413	At 149 positions, the non-reference allele was not observed in the capture data, but the reference allele was detected.	16625	16744
20126413	However, the mean coverage at these 149 positions was significantly lower than that of the other 1,631 positions (p = 0.0003), suggesting that the non-reference allele was not adequately covered and is under called in the capture data.	16745	16980
20126413	Moreover, of the 1,621 dbSNPs in the region, the capture adequately covered only 1,515.	16981	17068
20126413	In these data there was a bias for the pull down data to under observe the non-reference allele (Figure S1).	17069	17177
20126413	The 106 dbSNP positions detected in the ABI whole genome sequence dataset were observed to all call the reported alternate allele from dbSNP.	17178	17319
20126413	In theory, if these were errors, then non-reference base calls should be randomly distributed to the three alternate base calls.	17320	17448
20126413	Thus, no discrepancies are reliably identified within the dbSNP overlap when a variant was called in the ABI genomic sequence data.	17449	17580
20126413	There were a total of 100 novel SNVs detected in the ABI genomic sequence dataset that were also very well evaluated in the Illumina pull down data with at least 20 high quality Illumina reads, such that the ABI sequence could be well validated.	17581	17826
20126413	Of these, 2 of the 100 discovered variants in the genomic sequence dataset were not observed in the Illumina pull down sequencing dataset.	17827	17965
20126413	Thus, of the entire 8.5mb interval there are 2 unconfirmed variants for an estimated false positive error rate of about 3×10−7 for the whole interval.	17966	18116
20126413	Alternatively viewed, there were 100 novel SNVs, with a 2% error rate in those novel positions.	18117	18212
20126413	Thus, the de novo false discovery rate may be as high as 2%.	18213	18273
20126413	Extrapolating to the whole set of 243,622 novel SNVs, we expect up to 4,872 false positives SNVs.	18274	18371
20126413	These observations are roughly concordant with a sampling of 37 novel SNVs (not in dbSNP) in the whole genome set selected for testing by Sanger sequencing.	18372	18528
20126413	Of these, 34 out of 37 (92%) were validated.	18529	18573
20126413	There are now several publicly available complete genomes sequenced on next generation platforms.	18574	18671
20126413	We compared the SNVs discovered in U87MG to two of these published genomes: the James D. Watson genome and the first Asian genome (YanHuang).	18672	18813
20126413	Further, we simultaneously compared each of these to dbSNP version 129.	18814	18885
20126413	Compared with dbSNP, 10.2% of U87MG SNVs, 9.5% of Watson SNVs, and 12.0% of YanHuang SNVs were not present within dbSNP (Figure 4).	18886	19017
20126413	As U87MG was derived from a patient of Caucasian ancestry, which is confirmed by genotyping, it is unsurprising to see a higher overlap with dbSNP for U87MG than for YanHuang.	19018	19193
20126413	Between the three genomes themselves, 44.7% of U87MG SNVs overlapped with Watson SNVs while 60.0% of SNVs were in common with YanHuang SNVs.	19194	19334
20126413	Only 8.5% of dbSNP SNVs were shared between Watson and U87MG, while 11.3% of them were shared between YanHuang and U87MG.	19335	19456
20126413	Thus, there is not a substantially higher amount of SNVs in the U87MG cancer genome relative to normal genomes.	19457	19568
20126413	We utilized the predictable insert distance of mate-paired sequence fragments to directly observe structural variations in U87MG.	19569	19698
20126413	Our target insert size of 1.5kb gave us a normal distribution of paired end insert lengths ranging from 1kb to 2kb with median around 1.25kb and mean around 1.45kb in the actual sequence data (Figure S2).	19699	19903
20126413	We identified 1,314 large structural variations, including 35 interchromosomal events, 599 complete homozygous deletions (including a large region on chromosome 9 containing CDKN2A/B, which commonly experience homozygous deletions in brain cancer), 361 heterozygous deletion events, and 319 other intrachromosomal events (Table 5).	19904	20235
20126413	The 599 complete microdeletions summed up to approximately 5.76Mb of total sequence, while the 361 heterozygous microdeletions summed to 5.36Mb of total sequence.	20236	20398
20126413	Most of the microdeletions were under 2kb in total size.	20399	20455
20126413	Because of the high sequence coverage and mate pair strategy each event was supported by an average of 138 mate pair reads.	20456	20579
20126413	Mispairing of the mate pairs did occur occasionally due to molecular chimerism in the library fabrication process, but such reads occur at a low frequency (<1/40 of the reads).	20580	20756
20126413	Thus, the true rearrangement/deletion events were highly distinct from noise in well-mapped sequences.	20757	20859
20126413	Interchromosomal events included translocations and large insertion/deletion events where one part of a chromosome was inserted into a different chromosome, sometimes replacing a segment of DNA.	20860	21054
20126413	All together, these structural variations show a highly complex rearrangement of genomic material in this cancer cell line (Figure 5).	21055	21189
20126413	All identified structural variants are summarized in Table S2.	21190	21252
20126413	We note as well that even when breakpoints are within genome-wide common repeats there can be sufficient mapping information to reliably identify the translocation breakpoint (Figure S3).	21253	21440
20126413	The thirty-five interchromosomal events often coincided with positions of copy number change based on the average base coverage (Figure 5).	21441	21580
20126413	Figure 6 shows two interchromosomal events between chromosomes 2 and 16.	21581	21653
20126413	The events on chromosome 16 are less than 1kb apart while those on chromosome 2 are about 160kb apart.	21654	21756
20126413	Based on the average base coverage, there appears to be a loss of genomic material between the event boundaries on their respective chromosomes, shifting from two to one copy.	21757	21932
20126413	Although we are unable to determine the origin of such an event, it appears that there was an interchromosomal translocation between chromosomes 2 and 16 with a loss of the DNA between the identified regions on each chromosome.	21933	22160
20126413	A subset of 3 translocations were confirmed by amplifying DNA from the breakpoint-spanning region by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing by dideoxy Sanger sequencing (Table S1).	22161	22343
20126413	Each confirmed the predicted breakpoint to within 100 nucleotides of the correct position.	22344	22434
20126413	In a subset of cases, unmapped short read fragments could be identified from the shotgun short read data that span the breakpoint and are concordant at base resolution with Sanger sequencing of PCR amplified product spanning the breakpoint The SNVs and indels identified in U87MG were assessed for their potential to affect protein-coding sequence.	22435	22783
20126413	We considered variants predicted to be homozygous and to affect the coding sequence of a gene through a frameshift, early termination, intron splice site, or start/stop codon loss mutation as causing a complete loss of that protein.	22784	23016
20126413	We chose to focus on homozygous null mutations for two major reasons.	23017	23086
20126413	First, this is an interesting set of genes that we can predict from the whole genome data are non-functional within this commonly used cell line.	23087	23232
20126413	Although heterozygous mutations can certainly affect gene products in multiple ways, it is difficult to assess their effect from genomic data alone.	23233	23381
20126413	Second, by cross-referencing such null mutations with known regions of common mutation in gliomas we can pick out specific candidates that are of interest to the glioma community.	23382	23561
20126413	Of the 2,384,470 SNVs and 191,743 small indels in U87MG, a total of 332 genes are predicted to have loss-of-function, homozygous mutations as a consequence of small variants (Table S3).	23562	23747
20126413	Of these, 225 genes contained variants matching alleles annotated in dbSNP (version 129), while 107 contained novel variants not observed in dbSNP.	23748	23895
20126413	We further divided these homozygous mutant genes by variant type.	23896	23961
20126413	Of genes mutated by SNVs, 146 contained variants present in dbSNP while only 8 were knocked out by variants not in dbSNP.	23962	24083
20126413	The ratio of known SNPs causing loss-of-function mutations to total known SNPs (146/2,140,848 = 6.82×10−5) was not significantly different from the ratio of novel SNVs causing loss-of-function mutations over total novel SNVs (8/243,622 = 3.28×10−5; p = 0.04).	24084	24343
20126413	This indicates that many of the possible de novo point mutations may indeed be rare inherited variants made homozygous by chromosomal loss of the normal allele.	24344	24504
20126413	In contrast to the trend in SNVs, small indels that homozygously mutated genes were more often novel.	24505	24606
20126413	There were 79 genes predicted homozygously mutated by indel variants reported in dbSNP while 99 were predicted mutated by novel indels.	24607	24742
20126413	Despite this trend, however, there was not a significant enrichment of deleterious indels among the novel indels (99/191,743 = 5.16×10−4) compared to the known indels (79/116,964 = 6.75×10−4; p = 0.08) This suggests that the difference in ratios of novel versus documented SNVs (8 vs. 146) and indels (99 vs. 79) is the result of compositional bias in dbSNP129, which contains a far greater number of SNPs compared to indels.	24743	25168
20126413	We also assessed the structural variants in U87MG for whether or not they were likely to affect a gene.	25169	25272
20126413	Two different criteria were used to determine if translocations and microdeletions impacted a coding region, both predicted to produce an aberrant or nonfunctional protein.	25273	25445
20126413	Using the UCSC known gene database, we identified 35 genes affected by interchromosomal translocations, 145 affected by complete deletions, 91 affected by heterozygous deletions and 166 affected by other intrachromosomal translocations (Table 4).	25446	25692
20126413	Interchromosomal translocation events were significantly enriched for occurring at positions where they would affect genes with 32 out of 35 events (91.4%) occurring within 1kb of a gene (p<0.0001), while only 44.1% of the reference genome is within 1kb of a known gene.	25693	25963
20126413	In total, intrachromosomal events did not display this enrichment with 145/319 (45.5%) falling within 1kb of a gene (p = 0.67).	25964	26091
20126413	However, we ran a set of simulations to assess whether microdeletions were enriched to overlap exons because we noted that 585 of our 599 complete microdeletions were less than 10kb in length with a mean size of 1.8kb.	26092	26310
20126413	We ran 100,000 simulations randomly placing 600 microdeletions of 2kb lengths and determined how many times a microdeletion spanned an exon.	26311	26451
20126413	In this way, we demonstrated that complete (homozygous) microdeletions under 10kb in size spanned exons slightly more often than by chance with a simulated p-value of .046.	26452	26624
20126413	Similar assessment of microdeletions greater than 10kb in size did not find evidence of enrichment.	26625	26724
20126413	These findings suggest that small microdeletions may preferentially occur within genes as opposed to being randomly distributed across the genome, but the signal is not strong from the available data.	26725	26925
20126413	Genes affected by structural variations are summarized in Table S4.	26926	26993
20126413	The annotation tool DAVID was used to further examine the biological significance of the list of likely knockout mutations (including genes affected by SNVs, indels, microdeletions and translocation events) using the EASE analysis module.	26994	27232
20126413	After gene ontology (GO) analysis, 18 GO terms were nominally enriched and associated with the mutated gene with a p-value < = 0.01 (Table S5).	27233	27376
20126413	These GO enrichments include cell adhesion (GO:0007155 and GO:0022610), membrane (GO:0044425), and protein kinase regulator activity (GO:0019887).	27377	27523
20126413	The list of genes was also compared to the list of cancer-associated genes maintained by the Cancer Gene Census project (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/).	27524	27691
20126413	For SNVs and small indels, eight were observed in the census list, but this is not unexpected given the large number of mutations found in this cell line (p = 0.21).	27692	27857
20126413	Two CGC genes were affected by complete microdeletions (CDKN2A and MLLT3), and one gene each was affected by heterozygous microdeletions (IL21R) and interchromosomal translocations (SET).	27858	28045
20126413	These included genes previously annotated as mutated in instances of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia (TCRA and MLLT3), glioma (PTEN), endometrial cancer (PTEN), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (CLTCL1), prostate cancer (ETV1 & PTEN), Ewing sarcoma (FLI1 and ETV1), desmoplastic small round cell tumor (FLI1), acute lymphocytic leukemia (FLI1 and MLLT3), clear cell sarcoma (FLI1), sarcoma (FLI1), myoepithelioma (FLI1), follicular thyroid cancer (PAX8), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (IL21R), acute myelogenous leukemia (SET), fibromyxoid sarcoma (CREB3L2), melanoma (XPC), and multiple other tumor types (PTEN and CDKN2A).	28046	28658
20126413	We also explored the overlap of genes with mutations in GBMs according to the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with those we predicted are homozygously loss-of-function mutated in U87MG (Table S5).	28659	28850
20126413	Seven genes mutated in U87MG by SNVs or indels were also found mutated within the TCGA sample (PTEN, LTF, KCNJ16, ABCA13, FLI1, MLL4, DSP).	28851	28990
20126413	This overlap is not statistically significant (p = 0.16).	28991	29048
20126413	Ten additional genes overlapped, including two genes mutated by interchromosomal translocations (CNTFR, ELAVL2), three genes mutated by intrachromosomal translocations (ANXA8, LRRC4C, ALDH1A3), and five by homozygous microdeletions (CDKN2A, CDKN2C, MTAP, IFNA21, TMBIM4).	29049	29320
20126413	Finally, in order to place the homozygous mutations of U87MG in context relative to GBM mutational patterns as a whole, the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) method was applied to 293 glioblastoma samples with genome wide copy number information available from the TCGA.	29321	29622
20126413	This yielded a list of significant, commonly deleted regions present across glioblastomas as a group and highlights genes commonly mutated in GBMs.	29623	29770
20126413	These data indicate that all or parts of chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, and 22 are commonly deleted within GBMs as a group.	29771	29900
20126413	In total, these regions comprise 915,306,764 bases, covering roughly 30 percent of the genome.	29901	29995
20126413	In order to highlight genes homozygously mutated in U87MG that are within the regions of common loss, we cross-referenced these lists and found that 62/332 (19%) are within the GISTIC defined regions.	29996	30196
20126413	This does not suggest a significant overlap of homozygously mutated genes in U87MG with commonly deleted regions, but those mutated genes that do overlap may be of increased relevance to cancer.	30197	30391
20126413	Two of the 62 genes are also in the Cancer Gene Census: PTEN and TCRA.	30392	30462
20126413	We propose that a subset of the genes mutated in U87 within these commonly deleted regions may be the specific targets of mutation and should be assessed on larger sample sets.	30463	30639
20126413	(Table S5 and Figure S4).	30640	30665
20126413	Reported individual human genome sequencing projects using massively parallel shotgun sequencing with alignment to the human reference genome clearly indicate the practicality of individual whole genome sequencing.	30666	30880
20126413	However, the monetary cost of data generation, data analysis issues, and the time it takes to perform the experiments have remained substantial limitations to general application in many laboratories.	30881	31081
20126413	Here we demonstrate enormous improvements in the throughput of data generation.	31082	31161
20126413	Using a mate-pair strategy and only ten micrograms of input genomic DNA, we generated sufficient numbers of short sequence reads in approximately 5 weeks of machine operation with a total reagent cost of under $30,000.	31162	31380
20126413	We believe this makes U87MG the least expensive published genome sequenced to date signaling that routine generation of whole genomes is feasible in individual laboratories.	31381	31554
20126413	Further, the two-base encoding strategy employed within the ABI SOLiD system is a powerful approach for comprehensive analysis of genome sequences and, in concert with BFAST alignment software, is able to identify SNVs, indels, structural variants, and translocations.	31555	31823
20126413	Of particular interest in whole-genome resequencing studies such as this one is how much raw data must be produced to sequence both alleles using a shotgun strategy.	31824	31989
20126413	Here, 107.5Gb of raw data was generated.	31990	32030
20126413	Of this, 55.51Gb was mapped to unique positions in the reference genome.	32031	32103
20126413	In effect, this results in a mean base coverage of 10.85× per allele within non-repetitive regions of the genome.	32104	32217
20126413	Repetitive regions are of course undermapped, as their unique locations are more difficult to determine.	32218	32322
20126413	This level of oversampling is adequate for high stringency variant calling (error rate less than 5×10−6) at 93.71% of heterozygous SNP positions.	32323	32468
20126413	There may be some biases in library generation resulting in bases that are not successfully covered even if they are relatively unique, but solutions to this may be found in performing multiple sequencing runs with varied library designs, as suggested in other studies.	32469	32738
20126413	With rapid advances in the generation of massively parallel shotgun short reads, one of the major computational problems faced is the rapid and sensitive alignment of greater than 1 billion paired end reads needed to resequence an individual genome.	32739	32988
20126413	We demonstrate a practical solution using BFAST, which was able to perform fully gapped local alignment on the two-base encoded data to maximize variant calling in less than 4 days on a 20-node 8-core computer cluster.	32989	33207
20126413	Comparing U87MG SNVs with the James Watson and YanHuang genome projects' SNVs displays differences in SNV detection between the three projects.	33208	33351
20126413	Being derived from a Caucasian individual, U87MG and James Watson are expected to share more SNVs than U87MG and YanHuang.	33352	33474
20126413	However, when we compared SNVs between U87MG and these two genomes, more SNVs were actually shared between U87MG and YanHuang.	33475	33601
20126413	Meanwhile, the YanHuang project called significantly more SNVs in total than both our U87MG sequencing project and the James Watson project.	33602	33742
20126413	These results stress that utilizing different sequencing platforms (U87MG-ABI SOLiD, James Watson-Roche 454, YanHuang-Illumina Solexa), alignment tools (U87MG-BFAST, James Watson-BLAT, YanHuang-SOAP) and analytical approaches results in finding different quantities of SNVs.	33743	34017
20126413	The higher genomic coverage in our U87MG sequence relative to James Watson and the increased sensitivity of BFAST relative to BLAT and SOAP were counted on to find highly robust variants.	34018	34205
20126413	This is particularly important when sequencing a cancer genome because of the interest in finding novel cancer mutations as opposed to common polymorphisms.	34206	34362
20126413	The genomic sequence demonstrates global differences in variant type across the coding and non-coding portions of the human genome.	34363	34494
20126413	By increasing the sensitivity of indel detection, we revealed that small indels have mutated genes at a higher rate than SNVs.	34495	34621
20126413	A larger proportion of the indels identified are predicted to cause a protein coding change compared to SNVs (178/191,743 indels vs. 154/2,384,470 SNVs).	34622	34775
20126413	In U87MG, there is a relative increase in 4-base indels genome-wide, which has been observed in other normal genomes– (Figure 2, red bars).	34776	34915
20126413	However, indels found in coding regions exhibit a bias toward events that are multiples of 3-bases in length (Figure 2, blue bars) presumably selected to maintain reading frame.	34916	35093
20126413	Thus, many of these events are likely to be polymorphisms and not disease related genomic mutations.	35094	35194
20126413	Similarly, the nucleotide substitution frequencies demonstrate a bias in coding regions compared to non-coding.	35195	35306
20126413	Two-thirds of the substitutions were transitions genome-wide, as expected, but there was an enrichment of CG->TA transitions in coding regions (Figure 3).	35307	35461
20126413	It is well established that the most common source of point mutations and SNPs in primates is deamination of methyl-cytosine (meC), causing transition to a thymine (T),, and there is circumstantial evidence of that in U87MG's genome as well.	35462	35703
20126413	The resolution of genome-wide chromosomal rearrangements is substantially improved by the mate-pair strategy, coupled with sensitive and independent alignment of the short 50-base reads (Figure 5).	35704	35901
20126413	Based on published SKY data, we anticipated 7 interchromosomal breakpoints.	35902	35977
20126413	However, whole-genome mate-paired sequence data revealed the precise chromosomal joins of 35 interchromosomal events, which account for previously observed chromosomal abnormalities in U87MG but at additional finer scale resolution (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7).	35978	36241
20126413	The translocation events were enriched in genic regions with 32/35 (91.4%) occurring within 1kb of genes.	36242	36347
20126413	A weaker, but still noticeable enrichment over genes occurs with microdeletions as well, which are generally missed by other experimental techniques like DNA microarrays.	36348	36518
20126413	Thus, within the overall mutational landscape of this cancer cell line, translocations and structural variants preferentially occurred over genes, supporting a model where cancer mutations occur via structural instability rather than novel point mutations.	36519	36775
20126413	Delving into the functional effects of the mutations in U87MG through gene ontology and cross-referencing the literature, we found a large number of known and predicted cancer mutations present in the cell line.	36776	36987
20126413	There is always a concern when dealing with a cancer cell line that mutations will be more related to its status as a cell line than to the cancer it was derived from.	36988	37155
20126413	While this remains a concern, the large number of predicted and known cancer genes present in U87MG suggests other genes mutated in it have relevance to cancer as well.	37156	37324
20126413	Using GISTIC to find regions with common deletions in glioma samples, we highlight 60 genes that are mutated in U87MG and are located in regions that are commonly deleted in GBMs that are not included within the Cancer Gene Census list as potential candidate mutational targets in GBMs (Table S5).	37325	37622
20126413	Cancer cell lines are commonly used as laboratory resources to study basic molecular and cellular biology.	37623	37729
20126413	It is clearly preferable to have complete genomic sequence for these valuable resources.	37730	37818
20126413	U87MG is the most commonly studied brain cancer cell line and is highly cytogenetically aberrant.	37819	37916
20126413	While this made the sequencing and mutational analysis more challenging, it serves as a model for future cultured cell line genomic sequencing.	37917	38060
20126413	Through custom analyses, we found that the mutational landscape of the U87MG genome is vastly more complicated than we would have expected based on the variants discovered in previously published genomes.	38061	38265
20126413	It is our hope that the increased genomic resolution presented here will direct researchers and clinicians in their work with this brain cancer cell line to create more effective experiments and lead to a greater ability to draw meaningful conclusions in the future.	38266	38532
20126413	The NCBI reference genome (build 36.1, hg18, March 2006), genome annotations, and dbSNP version 129 were downloaded from the UCSC genome database located at http://genome.ucsc.edu.	38533	38713
20126413	A local mirror of the UCSC genome database (hg18) was used for the subsequent analysis of variants using included gene models and annotations.	38714	38856
20126413	The Watson genome variants were downloaded from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (http://jimwatsonsequence.cshl.edu) with bulk data files available from ftp://jimwatsonsequence.cshl.edu/jimwatsonsequence/.	38857	39059
20126413	The YanHuang variants were downloaded from the Beijing Genomics Institute at Shenzhen (http://yh.genomics.org.cn/) with bulk data files available from http://yh.genomics.org.cn/download.jsp.	39060	39250
20126413	U87MG cells were ordered from ATCC (HTB-14) and cultured in a standard way.	39251	39326
20126413	Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured U87MG cells using Qiagen Gentra Puregene reagents.	39327	39416
20126413	DNA was stored at −20C until library generation.	39417	39465
20126413	Long-Mate-Paired Library Construction: The U87MG genomic DNA 2× 50bp long mate-paired library construction was carried out using the reagents and protocol provided by Applied Biosystems (SOLiD 3 System Library Preparation Guide).	39466	39695
20126413	A similar protocol was reported previously.	39696	39739
20126413	Briefly, 45ug of genomic DNA was fragmented by HydroShear (Digilab Genomic Solutions Inc) to 1.0–2.5kb.	39740	39843
20126413	The fragmented DNA was repaired by the End-It DNA End-Repair Kit (Epicentre).	39844	39921
20126413	Subsequently, the LMP CAP adaptor was ligated to the ends.	39922	39980
20126413	DNA Fragments between 1.2–1.7kb were selected by 1.0% agarose gel to avoid concatamers and circularized with a biotinylated internal adaptor.	39981	40122
20126413	Non-circularized DNA fragments were eliminated by Plasmid-Safe ATP-Dependent DNase (Epicentre) and 3ug of circularized DNA was recovered after purification.	40123	40279
20126413	Original DNA nicks at the LMP CAP oligo/genomic insert border were translated into the target genomic DNA about 100bp by nick translation using E. coli DNA polymerase I. Fragments containing the target genomic DNA and adaptors were cleaved from the circularized DNA by single-strand specific S1 nuclease.	40280	40584
20126413	P1 and P2 adaptors were ligated to the fragments and the ligated mixture was used to create two separate libraries with 10 cycles of PCR amplification.	40585	40736
20126413	Finally, 250–300bp fragments were selected to generate mate paired sequencing libraries with average target genomic DNA on each end around 90bp by excision from PAGE gel and use as emulsion PCR template.	40737	40940
20126413	Templated Beads Preparation: The templated beads preparation was performed using the reagents and protocol from the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 Templated Beads Preparation Guide).	40941	41133
20126413	SOLiD 3 Sequencing: The 2×50b mate-paired sequencing was performed exactly according to the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 System Instrument Operation Guide and using the reagents from Applied Biosystems.	41134	41334
20126413	We used an array pull-down capture strategy established in our lab.	41335	41402
20126413	An Agilent custom array for capturing 5,253 “cancer-related” genes was designed through Agilent e-array system (www.agilent.com).	41403	41532
20126413	Only the amino acid encoding regions were targeted with 60mer oligos spaced center-to-center 20–30bp.	41533	41634
20126413	The probes were randomly distributed across two separate 244K arrays.	41635	41704
20126413	The library for cancer gene capture sequencing was generated following the standard Illumina paired-end library preparation protocol.	41705	41838
20126413	5ug of genomic DNA was used for the starting material and 250–300bp fragments were size-selected during the gel-extraction step.	41839	41967
20126413	In the last step, 18 cycles of PCR were performed in multiple tubes to yield 4ug of product and mixed with 50ug of Human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), 52ul of Agilent 10× Blocking Agent, 260ul of Agilent 2× Hybridization Buffer and 10× molar concentration of unpurified Illumina paired-end primer pairs custom made according to the sequences provided by Illumina (Oligonucleotide sequences, 2008, Illumina, Inc: available on request from Illumina).	41968	42410
20126413	The mix was then diluted with elution buffer for the final volume of 520ul and then incubated at 95°C for 3 min and 37°C for 30min.	42411	42542
20126413	490ul of the hybridization mix was added to the array and hybridized in the Agilent hybridization oven (Robins Scientific) for 65 hrs at 65°C, 20rpm.	42543	42692
20126413	After hybridization, the array was washed according to the Agilent wash procedure A protocol.	42693	42786
20126413	The second wash was extended to 5 minutes to increase the wash stringency.	42787	42861
20126413	After washing, the array was stripped by incubating it in the Agilent hybridization oven at 95°C for 10min, 20rpm with 1.09× Titanium Taq PCR Buffer (Clonetech).	42862	43023
20126413	After the incubation and collection of the solution, 4 tubes of PCR were performed with each tube containing 96ul of the collected solution, 1ul of dNTPs (10mM each), 1ul of Titanium Taq (Clonetech) and Solexa primers, 1ul each.	43024	43252
20126413	15 cycles of PCR was performed at the following condition: 30sec at 95°C, (10 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 65°C, 30 sec at 72°C)×18 cycles, 5 min at 72°C and hold at 4°C.	43253	43417
20126413	The amplified product was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit and eluted in 30ul of EB.	43418	43514
20126413	After confirming the size of the amplicon on 2% agarose gel and measuring the concentration, the amplicon was diluted to 10nM, the working concentration for cluster generation.	43515	43691
20126413	The Illumina flowcell was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and the Genome Analyzer was run using standard manufacturer's recommended protocols.	43692	43852
20126413	The image data produced were converted to intensity files and were processed through the Firecrest and Bustard algorithms (1.3.2) provided by Illumina to call the individual sequence reads.	43853	44042
20126413	We used Blat-like Fast Accurate Search Tool version 0.5.3 (BFAST http://bfast.sourceforge.net) to perform sequence alignment of the two-base encoded reads off the ABI SOLiD to the NCBI human reference genome (build 36.1).	44043	44264
20126413	Utilizing the local alignment algorithm included in BFAST, we were able to simultaneously decode the short reads, while searching for color errors (encoding errors), base changes, insertions, and deletions.	44265	44471
20126413	We found candidate alignment locations (CALs) for each end independently.	44472	44545
20126413	We utilized ten indexes to be robust to up to six color errors, equating to a 12% per-read error rate: 1111111111111111111111 111110100111110011111111111 10111111011001100011111000111111 1111111100101111000001100011111011 111111110001111110011111111 11111011010011000011000110011111111 1111111111110011101111111 111011000011111111001111011111 1110110001011010011100101111101111 111111001000110001011100110001100011111 We also set parameters to use only informative keys when looking up reads in each index (BFAST parameter -K 8), and to ignore reads with too many CALs aggregated across all indexes (BFAST parameter -M 384).	44546	45170
20126413	If reads mapped to greater than 384 locations, then they were categorized as ‘unmapped’.	45171	45259
20126413	We then performed local alignment for each of the returned CALs, simultaneously decoding the read from color space searching for color errors (encoding errors), base changes, insertions, and deletions.	45260	45461
20126413	We choose the “best scoring” alignment, accepting an alignment only if it was at least the equivalent edit distance of two color errors away from the next best alignment.	45462	45632
20126413	This is approximately similar to a ‘mapping quality’ of 20 or better from the MAQ program output, for reference.	45633	45745
20126413	We removed duplicate reads using the alignment filtering utility found in DNAA (http://dnaa.sourceforge.net).	45746	45855
20126413	For single-end and mate-paired reads where only one end mapped, we removed duplicates based on reads having identical stat positions.	45856	45989
20126413	For mate-paired reads, we removed duplicates where both ends had the same start position.	45990	46079
20126413	Illumina generated sequence was aligned to the NCBI human reference genome (build 36.1) using BFAST with the following parameters applied.	46080	46218
20126413	Each end of the fragment library was mapped independently to identify CALs, utilizing ten indexes to be robust to errors and variants in the short (typically 36bp) reads: 1111111111111111111111 1111101110111010100101011011111 1011110101101001011000011010001111111 10111001101001100100111101010001011111 11111011011101111011111111 111111100101001000101111101110111 11110101110010100010101101010111111 111101101011011001100000101101001011101 1111011010001000110101100101100110100111 1111010010110110101110010110111011 We also set parameters to use only informative keys when looking up reads in each index (BFAST parameter -K 8), and to ignore reads with too many CALs aggregated across all indexes (BFAST parameter -M 1280).	46219	46942
20126413	We then performed a standard local alignment for each CAL.	46943	47001
20126413	Reads were declared mapped if a single unique best scoring alignment was identified within the genome.	47002	47104
20126413	Duplicate reads were filtered out in the same manner as for the ABI SOLiD data.	47105	47184
20126413	To find SNVs including SNPs and small indels, we assumed the MAQ consensus-calling model utilizing the implementation in SAMtools.	47185	47315
20126413	We used a value of 0.0000007 for the prior of a difference between two haplotypes (-r parameter).	47316	47413
20126413	This was chosen based on ROC analysis of a test dataset (data not shown).	47414	47487
20126413	Structural variations were detected using custom algorithms designed to comprehensively search for groups of mate-pair reads with aberrant paired-end insert size distributions that are consistently identifying a unique structural variant in the genome.	47488	47740
20126413	We utilized the “dtranslocations” utility in the DNAA package (http://dnaa.sourceforge.net) for the primary structural variation candidate search.	47741	47887
20126413	The utility first selected all pairs for which each end is uniquely mapped to a single location in the human genome and for which the mate-pair reads are not positioned in the expected size range relative to the consensus genome.	47888	48117
20126413	Then we filter out false positives that are not consistent with a chromosomal difference on an allele.	48118	48220
20126413	Briefly, the genome was divided into 500-base bins sequentially stepped 100-bases apart from their start positions.	48221	48336
20126413	Each bin was then paired with other bins on the basis of containing similar ‘mismapped’ mate-pair reads.	48337	48441
20126413	The aberrant mate-paired reads were defined as reads that were mapping less than 1000 or greater than 2000 bases apart within the reference genome sequence, which is selected based on the insert size distribution calculated from the aggregate dataset (Figure S2).	48442	48705
20126413	These were then rank-ordered based on the number of mate-pairs meeting criteria, and the destination bin with the most reads within it was paired with a given source bin to create a ‘binset’.	48706	48897
20126413	Binsets containing less than 4 reads were filtered out, removing 98.3% of the candidates based on having too little evidence supporting them.	48898	49039
20126413	The resulting list of filtered binsets was then scanned for clusters of binsets.	49040	49120
20126413	Binset clusters are groups of binsets where the source bins occur within 2000 bases of each other and the destination bins occur within 2000 bases of each other.	49121	49282
20126413	Redundant binsets were combined and those binset clusters that contain too few (less than 9 binsets spanning at least 1000 bases) or too many binsets (greater than 29 binsets spanning at most 3000 bases—higher is impossible given our insert size distribution) were removed as artifacts.	49283	49569
20126413	The resulting binset clusters represent the reads immediately flanking structural breakpoint events.	49570	49670
20126413	This detection process is currently being automated as Breakway (http://breakway.sourceforge.net), but was done using custom scripts at the time of analysis.	49671	49828
20126413	The structural variations were then separated into interchromosomal and intrachromosomal events.	49829	49925
20126413	Intrachromosomal events of less than 1Mb are assessed for deletion status by averaging base coverage within the bounds of the event and comparing it to base coverage 200kb outside the event on both sides.	49926	50130
20126413	Those that have average interior base coverage less than 25% of the average exterior base coverage are classified as “complete” deletions.	50131	50269
20126413	Those with average interior base coverage between 25% and 75% that of average exterior base coverage are classified as “heterozygous deletions” (deletions of at least one copy of the region, but with at least one copy remaining).	50270	50499
20126413	Variant calls from the SAMtools pileup tool were first loaded into a SeqWare QueryEngine database and subsequently filtered to produce BED files.	50500	50645
20126413	This filtering criteria required that a variant be seen at least 4 times and at most 60 times with an observation occurring on each strand at least once.	50646	50799
20126413	For SNVs we further enforced the criteria that SNVs should only be called in reads lacking indels and the last 5 bases of the reads were also ignored.	50800	50950
20126413	This reduced the likelihood that spurious mismappings were used to predict SNVs and eliminated the lowest quality bases from consideration.	50951	51090
20126413	For small indels (<21bp) we enforced a slightly different filter by requiring that any reads supporting an indel were only allowed to contain one contiguous indel and these reads were not considered if the indel occurred on either the beginning or end of the read.	51091	51355
20126413	These criteria, like the SNV criteria, were used to reduce the likelihood of using mismapped reads or locally misaligned reads in the variant calling algorithm.	51356	51516
20126413	The elimination of reads with indels at the beginning or end of the read was intended to remove potential alignment artifacts caused by ambiguous gap introduction due to lack of information at the ends to guide proper alignment.	51517	51745
20126413	Together, these filtering criteria reduced the likelihood that sequencing errors were identified as SNV or indel variants.	51746	51868
20126413	We used scripts available in the BFAST toolset and SeqWare Pipeline to filter and annotate the variant calls.	51869	51978
20126413	Variants passing these filters were further annotated by their overlap with dbSNP version 129.	51979	52073
20126413	Variants were required to share the same genomic position as a dbSNP entry along with matching the allele present in the database to be considered overlapping.	52074	52233
20126413	Mapping to dbSNP allowed us to filter out known SNPs from de novo variants.	52234	52309
20126413	Filtered SNV and indel variants were then analyzed for their affect within the genome that is annotated with gene models.	52310	52431
20126413	This analysis used scripts from the SeqWare Pipeline project and gene models downloaded from the UCSC hg18 human genome annotation database.	52432	52572
20126413	Six different gene model sets from hg18 were considered: UCSC genes (knownGene), RefSeq genes (refGene, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq), Consensus Coding Sequence genes (ccdsGene, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS), Mammalian Gene Collection genes (mgcGenes, http://mgc.nci.nih.gov), Vertebrate Genome Annotation genes (vegaGene, http://vega.sanger.ac.uk), and Ensembl genes (ensGene, http://www.ensembl.org).	52573	52985
20126413	Each variant was evaluated for overlap with genes from each of the 6 gene models.	52986	53067
20126413	If overlap was detected the variant was examined and tagged with one or more of the following terms depending on the nature of the event: “utr-mutation”, “coding-nonsynonymous”, “coding-synonymous”, “abnormal-ref-gene-model-lacking-stop-codon”, “abnormal-ref-gene-model-lacking-start-codon”, “frameshift”, “early-termination”, “inframe-indel”, “intron-splice-site-mutation”, “stop-codon-loss”, and/or “start-codon-loss”.	53068	53488
20126413	The variant was also tagged with the gene symbol and other accessions to facilitate lookups.	53489	53581
20126413	This information was loaded into a SeqWare QueryEngine database to allow for querying and filtering of the variants as needed.	53582	53708
20126413	Genes affected by structural variations were assessed in two ways depending on the structural variation type.	53709	53818
20126413	For interchromosomal translocation events, a gene was considered “affected” when either end of an interchromosomal translocation event fell in a genic region (including the entire coding region plus 1kb up- or down-stream of the gene's coding region).	53819	54070
20126413	The same criteria were used for all intrachromosomal translocation events.	54071	54145
20126413	For events that were classified as complete or heterozygous deletions, a gene was considered affected if all or part of a coding exon was deleted.	54146	54292
20126413	Homozygous SNVs, small indels, large deletions, and translocation events for variants that included predicted coding sequence changes were tallied.	54293	54440
20126413	This became a reference list of variants with serious homozygous mutations that likely completely disrupted, or “knocked out”, the normal function or synthesis of the target protein.	54441	54623
20126413	For the SNVs and small indels, a “knockout” variant was defined as a homozygous call by the SAMtools variant caller where the variant was predicted by the SeqWare Pipeline scripts to change coding sequence with one or more of the following annotations: “early-termination”, “frameshift”, “intron-splice-site-mutation”, “start-codon-loss”, and/or “stop-codon-loss”.	54624	54988
20126413	The “early-termination” event represented a stop codon introduced upstream of the annotated stop codon.	54989	55092
20126413	The “frameshift” represented an indel that resulted in a shifting of the reading frame of the gene resulting in, typically, early termination and non-sense coding sequence.	55093	55265
20126413	The “intron-splice-site-mutation” referred to a mutation in the two consensus splice site intronic bases flanking exons (GT at the 5′ splice site and AG at the 3′ splice site).	55266	55442
20126413	Finally, “stop-codon-loss” and “start-codon-loss” simply refer to variants that interrupt the stop or start codons.	55443	55558
20126413	We chose to not include “coding-nonsynonymous” and “inframe-indel” annotations in this list of knocked out variants because, while potentially serious as these mutations are, they are not guaranteed to result in an unexpressed or non-functional protein.	55559	55812
20126413	However, homozygous frameshift, early termination, splice site, and stop/start codon loss mutations are very likely to interrupt a gene's expression and translation to functional protein.	55813	56000
20126413	As described above, large microdeletions that removed all or part of an exon and interchromosomal translocation events that fell within 1kb of a gene's coding region were also classified as mutated genes.	56001	56205
20126413	Once suspect knockout variants were identified, a mapping process was used to translate one or more variants to the gene symbol.	56206	56334
20126413	This mapping allowed us to condense multiple variants affecting multiple gene models to a more abbreviated list of gene symbols likely to be affected by these knockout mutations.	56335	56513
20126413	The mapping from variants to gene symbols used variants identified with gene models from the refGene and the knownGene tables in the UCSC hg18 database and mapped these variants to gene symbols using queries against the name field of the knownGene table and the alias field of the kgAlias table.	56514	56809
20126413	The UCSC table browser was used to accomplish these queries and map the knownGene identifiers to gene symbols via the kgXref table.	56810	56941
20126413	A similar approach was used for homozygous large-scale microdeletions and translocation events.	56942	57037
20126413	The list of knockout genes was uploaded to the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, version 2008) to identify enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms–.	57038	57219
20126413	Overlap with GO terms from the biological process, cellular component, and molecular function ontologies were considered.	57220	57341
20126413	The default parameters were used and a p-value cutoff of < = 0.01 was considered significant.	57342	57435
20126413	The overlap between the Cancer Gene Census genes and those identified as knockouts in U87MG were compared.	57436	57542
20126413	The Cancer Gene Census project is an ongoing effort to catalog genes with mutations that have been implicated in cancer.	57543	57663
20126413	It is a highly curated list that includes annotations for each gene including tumor types, class of mutations, and other genetic properties.	57664	57804
20126413	We used the gene symbol list from the September 30th, 2009 complete working list, which includes 412 gene symbols.	57805	57919
20126413	The overlap between mutations in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and those identified as knockouts in U87MG was analyzed.	57920	58040
20126413	TCGA is an ongoing effort to understand the molecular basis of cancer through large-scale copy number analysis, expression profiling, genome sequencing, and methylation studies among other techniques.	58041	58241
20126413	It provides information on mutations found by Sanger sequencing on many patient samples.	58242	58330
20126413	For glioblastoma this includes sequence data aberrations detected in 158 patient samples and 1,177 genes.	58331	58436
20126413	The Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) method was used to find significant areas of deletion in 293 samples from the TCGA.	58437	58589
20126413	The GISTIC technique was designed to identify and analyze chromosomal aberrations across a set of cancer samples, based on the amplitude of the aberrations as well as the frequency across samples.	58590	58786
20126413	This approach produced a series of commonly deleted regions across the set of TCGA GBMs.	58787	58875
20126413	To calculate the areas of deletion, we used 293 Affymetrix SNP 6.0 samples segmented using the GLAD SNP analysis module.	58876	58996
20126413	Default parameters of GISTIC were used.	58997	59036
20126413	GISTIC produces peak limits, wide peak limits, and in addition broader region limits.	59037	59122
20126413	These commonly deleted broader regions were then scanned for predicted knockout genes in U87MG.	59123	59218
20126413	The distribution of small indel sizes was examined for both deletions and insertions.	59219	59304
20126413	Indels classified as affecting coding-sequence by the SeqWare Pipeline (see above) were compared to those outside coding regions.	59305	59434
20126413	Raw counts were collected, recalculated as percents of total, and compared directly.	59435	59519
20126413	Similarly, nucleotide substitution frequency was examined for SNVs from U87MG both genome-wide and only in coding regions.	59520	59642
20126413	Once binned appropriately, the SNV nucleotide substitutions were counted, tallied in a table, and graphed as percents of total.	59643	59770
20126413	Variants from the Watson and Yan Huang genome were downloaded from each respective project from the following URLs: ftp://jimwatsonsequence.cshl.edu/jimwatsonsequence/watson-454-snp-v01.txt.gz and http://yh.genomics.org.cn/do.downServlet?file=data/snps/yhsnp_add.gff.	59771	60038
20126413	These files contained variant calls for each genome along with annotations describing the variant as novel or occurring in dbSNP.	60039	60168
20126413	The Watson genome only contained SNV calls so our comparison was limited to just SNVs.	60169	60255
20126413	The Yan Huang genome also contained calls indicating heterozygous or homozygous.	60256	60336
20126413	However, a variant was considered to match between genomes regardless of zygosity state.	60337	60425
20126413	We compared the overlap of the U87MG genome, dbSNP and each of these genomes in turn.	60426	60511
20126413	SNVs from U87MG that were considered for comparison had to meet our criteria; variants had to be observed at least 4 times, at most 60 times, at least once per strand, and with a minimum phred score of 10.	60512	60717
20126413	SNVs in the three-way comparison were said to match if the position and allele matched between the genomes.	60718	60825
20126413	If both variants matched between U87MG and the other genome and one was annotated in dbSNP, then the other was considered in dbSNP as well.	60826	60965
20126413	If neither contained annotations from dbSNP the variant was considered novel.	60966	61043
20126413	A similar process was carried out for variants distinct to each genome.	61044	61115
20126413	The results were recorded as Venn diagrams showing the overlap between dbSNP, U87MG, and the Watson or Yan Huang genome.	61116	61236
20126413	Genomic DNA from U87MG was submitted to the Southern California Genotyping Consortium to be run on the Illumina Human 1M-Duo BeadChip, which consists of 1,199,187 probes scattered across the human genome.	61237	61441
20126413	The Illumina Beadstudio program was used to analyze the resulting intensity data.	61442	61523
20126413	Loss of heterozygosity was determined by analyzing B-allele frequency as determined by the Beadstudio program.	61524	61634
20126413	Normal two-copy regions of the genome are represented by long stretches of probes with B-allele frequencies of 0, 0.5 or 1.	61635	61758
20126413	Regions of LOH, on the other hand, deviate from this pattern significantly.	61759	61834
20126413	Copy number was determined by looking at probe intensity.	61835	61892
20126413	Primers for validation were designed by targeting regions immediately flanking the event predicted by our whole genome sequence analysis using the Primer3 tool (http://frodo.wi.mit.ed/primer3/).	61893	62087
20126413	Polymerase chain reaction was performed following standard protocols using Finnzymes Phusion Hot-Start High Fidelity polymerase.	62088	62216
20126413	Products were run on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and product purity and size was assessed by staining with ethidium bromide.	62217	62344
20126413	Sanger sequencing was performed at the UCLA Genotyping and Sequencing core facility using an ABI 3730 Capillary DNA Analyzer.	62345	62470
20126413	Sequence trace files were analyzed using Geospiza FinchTV.	62471	62529
20126413	Validation status and PCR primers are listed in Table S1.	62530	62587
20126413	Intensities, quality scores, and color space sequence for the genomic sequence of U87 SOLiD were uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive under the accession SRA009912.1/Sequence of U87 Glioblastoma Cell-line.	62588	62794
20126413	Intensities, quality scores, and nucleotide space sequence for the exon capture U87 Illumina sequence were also uploaded to the Short Read Archive under the same accession.	62795	62967
20126413	For both datasets, alignment files have been uploaded to the Short Read Archive as additional analysis results.	62968	63079
20126413	Variant calls for both datasets are available via a SeqWare QueryEngine web service at http://genome.ucla.edu/U87.	63080	63194
20126413	This tool allows for querying the variants using a variety of search criteria including coverage, mutational consequence, gene symbol, and others.	63195	63341
20126413	SeqWare QueryEngine produces results in both BED and WIG format making it compatible with the majority of genome browsers such as the UCSC genome and table browsers.	63342	63507
20126413	Variant data will be uploaded to SRA as metadata along with the raw sequences.	63508	63586
20126413	For the whole genome SOLiD alignment, small indels (<21bp), SNVs, large deletions, and translocation events can be queried.	63587	63710
20126413	For the exon capture Illumina alignment, small indels and SNVs can be queried.	63711	63789
20126413	Most software used for this project is open-source and freely available.	63790	63862
20126413	We created two software projects that were instrumental in the analysis of the U87MG data: BFAST and SeqWare.	63863	63972
20126413	The color- and nucleotide-space alignment tool BFAST can be downloaded from http://bfast.sourceforge.net and many of our alignment filtering as well as the primary step in structural variation detection can be found in the DNAA package at http://dnaa.sourceforge.net.	63973	64240
20126413	The SeqWare software project was used throughout the analysis of variant calls.	64241	64320
20126413	We used the SeqWare LIMS tool for sample tracking, the SeqWare Pipeline analysis programs for annotating variants with dbSNP status and mutational consequence predictions, and SeqWare QueryEngine was used to database and query variant calls and annotations.	64321	64578
20126413	This software and documentation can be downloaded from http://seqware.sourceforge.net.	64579	64665
24477591	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis almost at every stage.	0	104
24477591	Their participation is already noticeable at the stage of promotion of the endothelial dysfunction and is often evident during the development and destabilization of the atherosclerotic plaque.	105	298
24477591	NADPH oxidases are considered as the main source of superoxide anion (O2 −) in the cardiovascular system.	299	404
24477591	They are multicomponent enzymes composed of the membrane-bound cytochrome b558 (catalytic NOX protein and p22phox) and many auxiliary cytoplasmic subunits for different types of NOX proteins.	405	596
24477591	NOX proteins differ in their tissue distribution and regulation of the activity and expression [1, 2].	597	699
24477591	The expression of NOX1, NOX2, NOX4 and NOX5 was demonstrated in endothelial cells as well as vascular smooth muscle cells.	700	822
24477591	The most important role in the vascular production of O2 − is assigned to NADPH oxidases containing the NOX2 protein, which is most strongly expressed in phagocytic cells.	823	994
24477591	p22phox is a common and constant element of NADPH oxidases complexes containing NOX1–NOX4 proteins, and plays a key role in the cytochrome b558 stabilization and is necessary to the initiation of O2 − production by NOX1–NOX4 proteins.	995	1229
24477591	p22phox is encoded by the CYBA (light chain of cytochrome b558, cytochrome b245 alpha) gene (16q24).	1230	1330
24477591	A significant number of genetic polymorphisms has been reported both in the exons and non-coding sequences, especially in the promoter region of CYBA [2, 3].	1331	1488
24477591	For some of them an impact on the CYBA expression and the superoxide production by NADPH oxidases was suggested.	1489	1601
24477591	The −930A>G polymorphism (rs9932581:A>G) is one of the promoter polymorphisms, located at the nucleotide position −930 from the ATG codon.	1602	1740
24477591	This polymorphism is situated in the potential binding site of C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein) transcription factors.	1741	1865
24477591	It was speculated that the −930A>G polymorphism modulates the activity of the CYBA promoter, and therefore transcriptional activity of CYBA, through the differential allele-dependent binding of C/EBP.	1866	2066
24477591	The −930G allele was the one that increased the affinity of C/EBP to the promoter.	2067	2149
24477591	A functional analysis revealed that the −930G allelic CYBA promoter has a 30 % higher (P < 0.05) gene expression than the −930A allelic promoter.	2150	2295
24477591	However, the studies on the functional impact of the −930A>G polymorphism on the NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production often revealed conflicting results.	2296	2458
24477591	In some studies, especially those conducted in hypertensive individuals [5, 6], the −930G allele was related to an increased O2 − production.	2459	2600
24477591	In other cases, it did not affect the superoxide synthesis at all [7–9].	2601	2673
24477591	These discrepancies may result from intra- and inter-individual variability in the NADPH oxidase activity, different methods of O2 − measurements and the use of different cell lines in the experiments.	2674	2875
24477591	Association studies of the −930A>G polymorphism with cardiovascular diseases are numerous.	2876	2966
24477591	To date, the −930G allele was considered as a genetic marker associated with hypertension in the Spanish population [4, 6] and Japanese males.	2967	3109
24477591	In the present work, we tried to analyze a possible association between the −930A>G polymorphism and coronary artery disease and to analyze potential interactions of CYBA alleles and traditional risk factors of atherosclerosis and CAD.	3110	3345
24477591	We studied 480 subjects.	3346	3370
24477591	Group 1: 240 patients with angiographically proven premature CAD, 72 women and 168 men, aged 27–55 years (mean 44.55 ± 6.09).	3371	3496
24477591	Group 2: 240 blood donors (BD) including 70 women and 170 men, aged 27–55 years (mean 43.88 ± 8.21).	3497	3597
24477591	CAD subjects were selected from (1) patients admitted to the 1st Department and Clinic of Cardiology at the Upper Silesian Centre of Cardiology in Katowice; (2) patients admitted to the 1st Department of Cardiac Surgery at the Upper Silesian Centre of Cardiology in Katowice.	3598	3873
24477591	Patients were classified for the study by the same cardiologist.	3874	3938
24477591	Controls were recruited from the Regional Centre of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment in Katowice and the Regional Centre of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment in Raciborz.	3939	4112
24477591	Following nationwide recommendations of the Polish Centres of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment, blood samples were obtained only from subjects with systolic blood pressure (BP) <140 and diastolic BP <90 on the day of blood collection.	4113	4349
24477591	All subjects were Polish Caucasians, inhabitants of Upper Silesia.	4350	4416
24477591	Inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of the medical interview, diagnosis and evaluation as well as criteria for CAD, MI and traditional risk factors were described previously.	4417	4597
24477591	The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice (Poland) and all subjects gave written informed consents.	4598	4760
24477591	Total serum cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-chol) and triacylglycerols (TG) were measured by enzymatic methods (commercial Analco kit, Warsaw, PL).	4761	4915
24477591	LDL-cholesterol (LDL-chol) levels were calculated according to the Friedewald formula in subjects with TG levels below 4.4 mmol/l.	4916	5046
24477591	Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes using the MasterPure genomic DNA purification kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, USA).	5047	5190
24477591	The −930A>G polymorphism of the CYBA gene was genotyped using the TaqMan® Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA).	5191	5350
24477591	The total volume of 20 μl of reaction mix included: 10 μl of TaqMan® Genotyping Master Mix (Cat.# 4371355), 1 μl of probe (TaqMan® Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay, Cat.# 4351376, C_11291925_10), 1 μl of DNA template (15 ng/μl) and 8 μl of deionized water.	5351	5608
24477591	The probe was diluted with the TE buffer (1:1) before the reaction.	5609	5676
24477591	The polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed according to the manufacturer’s specifications.	5677	5782
24477591	Genotyping was performed using the 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).	5783	5865
24477591	Data were analyzed using Statistica 10.0 (STATSOFT, Tulusa, OK, USA) and SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., NC, USA) software.	5866	5986
24477591	Normality of distribution was checked by Shapiro–Wilk test and then a comparison of quantitative data was performed by Mann–Whitney U test (for variables with non-normal distribution) or the student’s t test (for variables with normal distribution).	5987	6236
24477591	Allele frequencies were deduced from the genotype distribution.	6237	6300
24477591	Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested in all groups by a χ 2 test.	6301	6367
24477591	Comparisons of genotypes and alleles frequencies between cases and control subjects were performed by a χ 2 test.	6368	6481
24477591	When the number of subjects in the sample was lower than ten the Fisher’s correction was used.	6482	6576
24477591	Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.	6577	6627
24477591	Odds ratios (OR) as well as their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were computed using an univariate analysis (2 × 2 tables) and a multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, sex and traditional risk factors of coronary artery disease.	6628	6881
24477591	Risk ratio values (95 % CI) were used when the number of individuals in any of the analyzed subgroups was 0.	6882	6990
24477591	The effective sample size and statistical power of association analyzes were computed using Epi Info™ 7.1.1.0 developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).	6991	7163
24477591	Pearson’s correlation coefficients between CYBA variants and clinical and biochemical parameters were calculated.	7164	7277
24477591	To determine possible synergistic/antagonistic interactions between CYBA genotypes and traditional risk factors of CAD, the 4 × 2 table approach of biological interactions was used.	7278	7459
24477591	The synergy measures in an additive model were used to interpret the amount of interaction.	7460	7551
24477591	The interaction of the −930G allele with the respective factor was analyzed and AA homozygous subjects, not exposed to any specific risk factor, were used as a reference group (00 code).	7552	7738
24477591	They were compared with subgroups of subjects exposed to only one of the factors (01—only traditional, 10—only genetic) and with a subgroup exposed to both factors (11 code).	7739	7913
24477591	Odds ratio values, obtained from 4 × 2 table comparisons, were used for a calculation of the synergy index (SI).	7914	8026
24477591	The SI is a ratio of the observed effect with the joint exposure to genetic and traditional factors (OR11) divided by the effect predicted for the joint exposure assuming additivity of the effects observed in the presence of either a traditional or genetic factor (OR01 and OR10).	8027	8307
24477591	No interaction corresponds to SI = 1, whereas SI > 1 can be interpreted as a measure of relative increase and SI < 1 of decrease in the effect among those exposed to both factors.	8308	8487
24477591	The following formula of SI was used:SI=OR11-1/OR01-1+OR10-1, 95 % CI for SIes were calculated using the SAS program described by Lundberg et al.. An analysis of additive effects of traditional risk factors and CYBA genotypes was also performed in a standard univariate and multivariate logistic regression model.	8488	8801
24477591	These were used to compare the frequency of carriers of the −930G allele or AA homozygotes exposed to traditional risk factor between CAD and blood donors groups.	8802	8964
24477591	Clinical and biochemical parameters of patients and controls are shown in Table 1.	8965	9047
24477591	There were 72.1 % cases who had suffered from MI (n = 173) and 60.4 % patients with critical stenoses (>90 %) in coronary vessels (n = 145).	9048	9188
24477591	CAD patients showed an increased level of TC, LDL cholesterol and TG, and a higher BMI value.	9189	9282
24477591	The level of HDL cholesterol was significantly lower in CAD patients.	9283	9352
24477591	The high value of the OR for hypertension (Table 1) resulted from the fact that, according to the nationwide recommendations of Polish Centres of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment, the blood samples were obtained only from blood donors with systolic BP less than 140 and diastolic BP less than 90 mmHg on the day of blood collection.	9353	9687
24477591	Genotype frequencies were compatible with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in both groups.	9688	9776
24477591	Data from genotyping of the −930A>G polymorphism are shown in Table 2.	9777	9847
24477591	Frequencies of the −930G allele carriers (GG+AG genotypes) were significantly higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.007).	9848	9974
24477591	Results of logistic regression analysis confirmed that the −930G allele carrier state was a risk factor for CAD in the analyzed population (OR 2.03).	9975	10124
24477591	The power of test was 77 %, with a 95 % two-sided confidence level.	10125	10192
24477591	The −930A>G polymorphism was associated with CAD also after adjustment for traditional risk factors like sex, age, TC, LDL-chol, HDL-chol, TG, BMI (qualitative variable), diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking status, hypertension and familial history of CAD.	10193	10450
24477591	The results of multivariate analysis were: for the −930G allele carrier state: OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.17–4.20, P = 0.015, for the AA genotype: OR 0.45, 95 % CI 0.24–0.86, P = 0.015.	10451	10628
24477591	There was no correlation between genotype variants of the −930A>G polymorphism and MI or the severity of atherosclerosis estimated on the basis of the number of coronary stenoses or critical arterial occlusions observed during a coronary angiography (data not shown).	10629	10896
24477591	In the next step, we analyzed potential associations of respective genotypes and classical risk factors of CAD using the Pearson’s correlation model and we showed that the −930G allele carrier state was correlated with overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25) (r = 0.36, P = 0.04) and the AA genotype with cigarette smoking (r = 0.22, P = 0.03).	10897	11231
24477591	Other tested parameters such as serum lipid levels, age, gender, a familial history of CAD, hypertension and diabetes mellitus did not correlate with genotypic variants of the CYBA gene polymorphism (data not shown).	11232	11448
24477591	Further statistical analyzes focused on interactions of the CYBA −930A>G polymorphism variants and the two classical risk factors of CAD.	11449	11586
24477591	We found a synergistic effect of the −930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25) and cigarette smoking (Table 3).	11587	11704
24477591	Overweight/obese −930G carriers had an increased risk of CAD (OR 6.03, P < 10−6) compared with AA homozygous subjects with overweight/obesity (OR 2.50, P = 0.08) and −930G allele carriers with BMI < 25 (OR 1.44, P = 0.28).	11705	11927
24477591	Estimated CAD risk was about 160 % greater than that predicted by assuming additivity of the effects (SI = 2.59).	11928	12041
24477591	We also found that the −930G allele increased the risk of CAD associated with an exposure to cigarette smoking (Table 3).	12042	12163
24477591	The observed effect was about 40 % greater than that predicted from the effects’ additivity (SI = 1.39).	12164	12268
24477591	We confirmed the obtained results using an additive model of association.	12269	12342
24477591	Overweight/obese −930G allele carriers (n = 135 in CAD group, n = 56 in BD group) were more frequent in the CAD group (56.3 vs. 23.3 %, P < 10−10).	12343	12490
24477591	The power of this comparison was 99 with 99.9 CI.	12491	12540
24477591	The frequency of overweight/obese −930A allele carriers (n = 11 in CAD group, n = 11 in BD group) did not differentiate groups of patients and blood donors (4.6 vs. 4.6 %, P = 1.00).	12541	12723
24477591	Similar tendency was observed in the case of cigarette smoking.	12724	12787
24477591	Smokers carrying the −930G allele (n = 119 in CAD group, n = 54 in BD group) were more frequent in the patients group (49.6 vs. 22.5 %, P < 10−10).	12788	12935
24477591	The power of this test was 99 (99.9 CI).	12936	12976
24477591	Figure 1 shows OR values obtained from these comparisons in a univariate analysis (Fig.	12977	13064
24477591	1).	3594	3597
24477591	In the present study the overweight/obesity was a risk factor only in carriers of the −930G allele (Fig.	13069	13173
24477591	1a).	13174	13178
24477591	Similarly, the risk of CAD associated with cigarette smoking was significantly lower in AA homozygotes than in −930G allele carriers (Fig.	13179	13317
24477591	1b).	13318	13322
24477591	Both SI values as well as the results of additive association analyses indicate that overweight/obesity and cigarette smoking increase the risk of CAD especially in the −930G allele carriers.	13323	13514
24477591	Finally, we compared BMI values between AA homozygotes and −930G allele carriers in both patients and controls (Table 4), and we have shown that the BMI values differentiated only −930G allele carriers (P = 0.0004), while were almost identical in AA homozygotes from the groups of patients and controls (P = 0.98).	13515	13829
24477591	BMI values of patients carrying the −930G allele correlated with triglycerides levels (r = 0.36, P = 0.002) and negatively correlated with HDL levels (r = −0.24, P = 0.015).	13830	14003
24477591	Interestingly, these correlations were not observed in carriers of the −930G allele from the control group.	14004	14111
24477591	In the present study we showed that the −930G allele carrier state of the CYBA −930A>G polymorphism is associated with premature coronary artery disease.	14112	14265
24477591	To date, there was only one study analyzing the association of the −930A>G polymorphism with CAD conducted on the Austrian population.	14266	14400
24477591	Surprisingly, the authors found that the −930G allele was prevalent in the control group (P = 0.045).	14401	14502
24477591	It seems that the observed contradictions resulted mainly from differences such as ethnicity and inclusion/exclusion criteria between Polish and Austrian populations.	14503	14669
24477591	Both CAD patients as well as controls of the Austrian study were younger and not age matched (P < 0.001), in contrast to the Polish groups.	14670	14809
24477591	The groups were not numerous (n = 100 for CAD patients, n = 200 for controls) and, it should also be added, that such a low frequency of −930G allele carriers (76.5 % in Austrian CAD group) was not observed in any of the major studies on the −930A>G polymorphism.	14810	15073
24477591	We did not find any associations of the analyzed polymorphism with hypertension.	15074	15154
24477591	However, hypertension seems to be one of the main ways by which the −930G allele affects vascular functioning, according to the current state of knowledge [4–6, 10].	15155	15320
24477591	There are also other probable mechanisms of actions of the −930G allele, independent from hypertension like insulin resistance mediation and influence on the vascular wall structure, which will be discussed below.	15321	15534
24477591	It was shown that the −930G allele influences the expression of CYBA, especially in hypertensive subjects.	15535	15641
24477591	CYBA mRNA levels were higher in GG than AA/AG hypertensives (P < 0.05).	15642	15713
24477591	No differences in CYBA mRNA levels were found between genotypes of normotensive subjects.	15714	15803
24477591	Additionally, the superoxide production was increased only in hypertensive GG subjects but not in GG homozygous normotensives [5, 6].	15804	15937
24477591	Interestingly, a more recent study demonstrated that the −930A>G polymorphism may be a determinant of peripheral and central pressures also in normotensive individuals.	15938	16106
24477591	Finally, the −930A>G polymorphism was reported to be associated with hypertension in the Spanish population [4, 6] and Japanese males.	16107	16241
24477591	We also found a synergistic effect of the −930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25) on CAD risk.	16242	16344
24477591	The results of alternative, logistic regression model analysis showed that overweight/obesity is a risk factor for CAD only in carriers of the −930G allele.	16345	16501
24477591	We also observed that BMI values differentiated only carriers of the −930G allele from the groups of patients and controls, while they were almost identical in AA homozygotes.	16502	16677
24477591	There are many interactions between NADPH oxidases and overweight/obesity.	16678	16752
24477591	Fortuno and colleagues demonstrated that phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity was increased in obese subjects (P < 0.05) and was related to preclinical atherosclerosis in this condition.	16753	16936
24477591	Also animal studies have provided interesting results of diet-induced obesity on the NADPH oxidases activity and expression of its subunits.	16937	17077
24477591	In the study conducted on obese rats, NOX4 expression was increased by three-fold in the aorta.	17078	17173
24477591	Additionally, upregulations of p22phox and p47phox in the adipose tissue as well as NOX4, p22phox, and p47phox in kidney were observed.	17174	17309
24477591	Very recent studies on mice provided evidence that dietary obesity increased both vascular and hepatic NADPH oxidase activity, which was associated with an enhanced expression of NOX2 [19, 20], p22phox and p47phox.	17310	17524
24477591	Another aspect of linking the NADPH oxidases with overweight/obesity is the impact of free radicals on insulin resistance condition.	17525	17657
24477591	The study of Sukumar et al. identified NOX2 as a central molecule in insulin resistance-mediated oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction.	17658	17797
24477591	They demonstrated that higher levels of O2 − in insulin-resistant endothelial cells were inhibited by gp91ds-tat (NOX2 inhibitor).	17798	17928
24477591	Double transgenic mice with endothelial-specific insulin resistance and deletion of NOX2 showed a reduced O2 − production and an improved vascular function.	17929	18085
24477591	These findings were complemented by results of another study.	18086	18147
24477591	Aortic vessels from obese mice after middle age had significant increases in NOX2 expression and ROS production, which were accompanied by a reduced insulin receptor expression.	18148	18325
24477591	Interestingly, there are presumptions that the −930G allele of the CYBA polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance in obese adult humans (P < 0.05).	18326	18482
24477591	In the present work we also found that the risk of CAD associated with cigarette smoking was significantly higher in −930G allele carriers than in AA homozygotes.	18483	18645
24477591	Many studies demonstrated the role of NADPH oxidases in the promotion of cigarette smoking-dependent oxidative stress.	18646	18764
24477591	NADPH oxidases were activated by many water-soluble components of cigarette smoke [23, 24].	18765	18856
24477591	Short exposure of human and animal endothelial cells to cigarette smoke extracts resulted in a large increase in O2 − production, which was inhibited by several NOX inhibitors.	18857	19033
24477591	An increased NADPH oxidase activity was observed among others in the ventricular remodeling induced by tobacco smoke exposure.	19034	19160
24477591	The −930A>G CYBA polymorphism was also analyzed in the context of an association between cigarette smoking and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis.	19161	19350
24477591	The −930G allele modified the strength of the association between cigarette smoking and IMT in young healthy adults.	19351	19467
24477591	The differences in the mean and maximal IMT were most significant in subjects with the GG genotype, borderline significant for the GA genotype, and nonsignificant for the AA genotype.	19468	19651
24477591	GG homozygotes had a higher mean and maximal IMT compared with the carriers of the A allele among smokers (P = 0.021, P = 0.012, respectively).	19652	19795
24477591	In our previous studies we showed associations of other CYBA gene polymorphisms with smoking, namely the 242C>T polymorphism and the 640A>G polymorphism.	19796	19949
24477591	Carriers of 242T and 640G alleles were particularly at risk of the effects of exposure to tobacco smoke.	19950	20054
24477591	It should be mentioned that there was no independent association of the analyzed polymorphisms with CAD, neither in these studies nor in the study on genetically related Slovenian population, where the C242T polymorphism was not associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type two diabetes.	20055	20359
24477591	Although the results of the current meta-analysis have indicated that the 242T allele carriers have a marginal CAD risk increase (21 %) but only among Caucasians.	20360	20522
24477591	These two functional polymorphisms are not in linkage disequilibrium with −930A>G.	20523	20605
24477591	It is however possible that the latter also affects the susceptibility to CAD, especially in smokers.	20606	20707
24477591	A limitation of the present study is the fact that the analyses were performed on multiple subgroups with a relatively small number of participants.	20708	20856
24477591	Neither did we analyze the activity of NADPH oxidases nor the expression of p22phox.	20857	20941
24477591	The relatively low frequency of hypertension in the control group (2.3 %) should also be discussed here as a potentially interfering factor.	20942	21082
24477591	Such a low incidence may result from two main reasons.	21083	21137
24477591	The first are the guidelines of the Polish Centres of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment, according to which the blood samples can be obtained only from patients with systolic BP less than 140 and diastolic BP less than 90 mmHg, on the day of blood collection.	21138	21398
24477591	The second reason may be the recruitment criteria, which excluded donors with a familial history of CAD.	21399	21503
24477591	This could have led to a further decrease in the observed incidence of hypertension.	21504	21588
24477591	It is possible, however, that the frequency of hypertension is underestimated in this group, especially in the context of research conducted in a different group of Polish blood donors, where the frequency of hypertension exceeds 50 %.	21589	21824
24477591	In comparison, the frequency of hypertension in the general Polish population is in the range 30–45 % due to heterogeneous results of numerous epidemiological studies.	21825	21992
24477591	We do not think, however, that the declared low incidence of hypertension in the control group has influenced the outcome of the present study.	21993	22136
24477591	Underestimating of hypertension frequency would affect the results of association studies on hypertension.	22137	22243
24477591	However, we did not analyze such a relationship in our study, but the association of the −930A>G polymorphism and coronary artery disease.	22244	22382
24477591	In summary, we found that the −930A>G polymorphism is associated with coronary artery disease in the Polish population.	22383	22502
24477591	The synergistic effects of this polymorphism with overweight/obesity and cigarette smoking increase the risk of CAD, and the −930G allele carriers are particularly at risk of consequences of obesity and tobacco smoke exposure.	22503	22729
24442316	The liver contains a myriad of network of vessels, including microvascular system, nourishing the parenchymal cells.	0	116
24442316	The hepatic sinusoid is unique, dynamic microvascular structure that serves as the principal site of exchange between the blood and the perisinusoidal space.	117	274
24442316	Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are the major cell types in hepatic sinusoid, with the characteristic of fenestration in cell and endothelial matrix, the latter is called as “endothelial basement membrane”, which in normal liver consists of non-fibril-forming collagen including type IV collagen and proteoglycan and glycoproteins.	275	617
24442316	This normal endothelial matrix is critical for maintaining the differentiated functions of resident liver cells such as hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells and LSECs, etc.	618	789
24442316	LSECs injury occurred early when the liver suffered the insults, since it was exposed to higher blood levels than systematic concentrations toxins, while many toxins or metabolites absorbed from gastrointestinal tract were taken up into portal venous blood.	790	1047
24442316	In addition, the detachment of LSECs from endothelial matrix plate was critical component of injuries, while the inflammatory cells could improve matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) secretion at earlier liver injury and led to LSECs detachment.	1048	1296
24442316	Recently, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is becoming an increasingly popular form of complementary medicine in western countries.	1297	1430
24442316	Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.)	1431	1457
24442316	Sacc., as a well-known tonic herb in TCM, is a highly valued fungus in China as playing an important role in regulating the disorder of biological activity.	1458	1614
24442316	In recent years, cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis (CMCS) was successfully developed and widely used as the alternative of natural Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.)	1615	1775
24442316	Sacc.	1458	1463
24442316	Accumulated evidences from both animal and human studies indicated that Cordyceps sinensis was capable of anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammation.	1782	1924
24442316	Furthermore, it acted as an anti-tumor, anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, insecticidal and anti-bacterial compound.	1925	2043
24442316	In our previous studies, CMCS showed superior effects of anti-liver injury.	2044	2119
24442316	Simultaneously, it was able to decreasing the injury and phenotype shift of LSECs.	2120	2202
24442316	In the study, we observed the effect of CMCS on hepatic sinusoid in liver injury, including LSECs phenotype, basement membrane and matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) activities, in order to investigate CMCS action mechanism against liver injury.	2203	2453
24442316	Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), d-galactosamine (D-GalN) and 1,10-phenanthroline were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. All other chemicals and solvents were of the highest grade commercially available.	2454	2649
24442316	The powder of CMCS (1.0 kg), were provided from Shanghai Sundise Chinese Medicine Technology Development Co., Ltd, and were extracted successively three times with 6 l of water under reflux, and the combined extract were concentrated under vacuum at 50 °C and then dried by lyophilization to afford the extraction of CMCS (150 g).	2650	2980
24442316	The end extraction contained 150 mg/ml of CMCS drug.	2981	3033
24442316	The quantitative analyses of active compounds were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which performed on Waters2695 systerm (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA), equipped with an Waters PDA2996 analyzer.	3034	3261
24442316	Alliance software was used for the data analysis and the result was shown in Fig.	3262	3343
24442316	1.	2670	2672
24442316	Male BABL/c mice weighing 18-22 g, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) level, were provided by Sino-British SIPPR/BK Lab Animals (Shanghai, China).	3347	3487
24442316	They were housed in a room under controlled temperature (22–25 °C), humidity (46-52 %), and lighting (12-hour artificial light and dark cycle), with free access to tap water and mouse chow.	3488	3677
24442316	The standard diet pellets contained not less than 20 % protein, 5 % fibers, 3.5 % fats, and 6.5 % ash and vitamins mixture.	3678	3801
24442316	This experiment was conducted according to the local ethical guidelines (Shanghai University of TCM, Shanghai, China).	3802	3920
24442316	All the mice were randomly divided into four experimental groups: normal control (n = 8), model control (n = 12), CMCS treatment (n = 10) and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group (n = 9).	3921	4107
24442316	Mice in normal control and model control were administered orally by gavage with distilled water once a day, for four consecutive days at a dose of 4 ml/kg of body weight, respectively.	4108	4293
24442316	Mice in CMCS treatment group were treated orally with CMCS at a daily dose of 120 mg/kg of body weight at the same time, which was equivalent to 10 times of the 60 kg adult dose.	4294	4472
24442316	In 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1,10-phenanthroline twice a day, for four consecutive days at a daily dose of 25 ml/kg of body weight.	4473	4657
24442316	1,10-phenanthroline was used as the positive control medicine and its dosage was based on our previous trial experiment.	4658	4778
24442316	On the fourth day, 1 h after the last intragastrical administration, the normal control group was received intraperitoneal injections of saline at a dose of 2 ml/kg of body weight.	4779	4959
24442316	The other mice were received intraperitoneal injections of LPS and D-GalN at the dose of 10 μg/kg and 900 mg/kg of body weight respectively.	4960	5100
24442316	All mice were sacrificed 7 h after the last injection.	5101	5155
24442316	Measurement of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities were measured by using SpectraMax-M5 Multifunctional microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, California, USA) according to the manufacture’s instructions.	5156	5425
24442316	Liver function tests kits were supplied by Nanjing Jian Cheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China).	5426	5530
24442316	Hepatic homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 r/min for 20 min at 4 °C.	5531	5602
24442316	Supernatants were immediately collected and assayed for enzyme activities.	5603	5677
24442316	Levels of antisuperoxideanion (ASAFR), hydroxyl free radical (·OH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were assayed according to the protocols of kits purchased from NanJing Jian Cheng Bioengineering Institute.	5678	5939
24442316	All these parameters were expressed by gram protein which was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol using bovine serum albumin as a standard.	5940	6167
24442316	Liver specimens were fixed in 10 % formaldehyde solution and dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, embedded in paraffin blocks, and cut into 4 μm thick slices.	6168	6328
24442316	Slices for histopathological examination were stained by using standard procedure of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and silver, respectively.	6329	6467

24442316	Sections were washed three times with water, and subsequently Nuclei was counterstained by adding Hoechst (Beyotime, Haimen, China).	12424	12556
24442316	Gelatinase activity in situ was visualized using Olympus fluorescent microscopy.	12557	12637
24442316	Western blot analyses were performed essentially as described.	12638	12700
24442316	Snap-frozen liver tissues were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 % NP-40, 0.1 % SDS, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF and 1× complete mini (Roche).	12701	12884
24442316	Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4 °C for 15 min to separate cytosolic-enriched supernatant from nuclei- and membrane-enriched pellets.	12885	13027
24442316	Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay kit mentioned above.	13028	13111
24442316	Equal amount of proteins were separated by 10 % SDS gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under denaturing and non-reducing condition, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.	13112	13283
24442316	Even transfer was confirmed by staining with 0.2 % Ponceau Red S in 3 % trichloroacetic acid.	13284	13377
24442316	Membranes were blocked with 5 % nonfat milk in TBST (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 % Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h, incubated with primary antibody ICAM-1(1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and VCAM-1 (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at 4 °C overnight, respectively.	13378	13674
24442316	After washing with TBST, blots were incubated with horseradish-coupled secondary antibody in wash buffer.	13675	13780
24442316	Signals were developed with the immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quantified using a ChemiDoc image analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).	13781	14021
24442316	All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).	14022	14080
24442316	Differences between the groups were assessed by nonparametric One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the least significant difference (LSD) post hoc tests.	14081	14246
24442316	Statistical significance was taken at the p < 0.05 level.	14247	14304
24442316	In order to evaluate the effect of CMCS on LPS/D-GalN induced acute liver injury, serum levels of ALT and AST were determined.	14305	14431
24442316	After LPS/D-GalN treatment, serum ALT and AST activities significantly elevated in mice (Table 1).	14432	14530
24442316	In the vicinity of hepatic lesions, particularly alongside the lesion border, pronounced apoptotic bodies, necrotic and cytolytic hepatocytes with widely mononuclear cell infiltration were shown in the model mice (Figs.	14531	14750
24442316	2b, 3).	14751	14758
24442316	Obviously, CMCS treatment group significantly decreased the elevated levels of ALT and AST activities (Table 1), ameliorated liver inflammation (Fig.	14759	14908
24442316	2c) and alleviated hepatocellular apoptosis in extent (Fig.	14909	14968
24442316	3) in comparison to the LPS/D-GalN treated group.	14969	15018
24442316	Mice treated with 1,10-phenanthroline showed weak hepatic lesions alongside the central vein, with few apoptotic hepatocytes (Fig.	15019	15149
24442316	3).	14755	14758
24442316	Liver tissues in normal control showed intact scaffold structure with black continuous reticular fibers paralleled the hepatic cords (Fig.	15154	15292
24442316	4a).	15293	15297
24442316	Obviously, liver sections of model mice exhibited severe broken hepatic scaffold structure (Fig.	15298	15394
24442316	4b) with fragmentized silver nitrate deposits scattering in hepatic tissue.	15395	15470
24442316	By contrast, CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment maintained hepatic scaffold structure in extent, respectively (Fig.	15471	15600
24442316	4c, d).	15601	15608
24442316	Herein, we observed the electron micrograph of the LSECs and vWF expression in liver tissue, aiming to survey the potential effect of CMCS on protecting liver sinusoid endothelial cell.	15609	15794
24442316	SEM and TEM revealed the protective effects of CMCS on LPS/D-GalN induced LSECs injury, respectively.	15795	15896
24442316	Generally, fenestrations, with laminar extensions containing abundant rounded pores were organized in sieve plates (Fig.	15897	16017
24442316	5a) and LSECs were lack of basement membrane, exhibiting very thin and flattened cellular expansions with distally laminal-shaped endochylema (Fig.	16018	16165
24442316	6a) in control mice.	16166	16186
24442316	Besides, levels of vWF in model mice expressed much higher than that of in the normal control (Fig.	16187	16286
24442316	7A-a, A-b).	16287	16298
24442316	After LPS/D-GalN treatment, larger pores of LSECs were exhibited in model mice (Fig.	16299	16383
24442316	5b).	16384	16388
24442316	Meanwhile, red blood cells (RBCs) from sinusoidal lumen overflowed through haemorrhagia regions of severe lesioned LSECs (Fig.	16389	16515
24442316	6b).	16516	16520
24442316	CMCS was demonstrated relatively to reduce the amplification of the pores and to relieve the broken structures of basement membrane, with the mildly lesion and small amounts of haemorrhagia (Fig.	16521	16716
24442316	5c).	16717	16721
24442316	Similarly, 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group showed smaller pores than that of the model control group (Fig.	16722	16832
24442316	5d).	16833	16837
24442316	Furthermore, LSECs from mice treated with 1,10-phenanthroline demonstrated relatively unbroken hepatic scaffold structure (Fig.	16838	16965
24442316	6d) Coincidentally, vWF, a golden marker of endothelial function, was virtually increased in CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group, respectively(Fig.	16966	17132
24442316	7A-c, A-d).	17133	17144
24442316	In order to evaluate endogenous antioxidant defense, hepatic oxidant/antioxidant system was examined.	17145	17246
24442316	Levels of tissue ASAFR, ·OH, SOD and GST in mice receiving LPS/D-GalN were significantly higher than those of in the normal control group while tissue MDA levels were significantly lower (Table 2).	17247	17444
24442316	When compared with the model control group, levels of tissue ASAFR, ·OH, SOD and GST of mice receiving CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline were lower than those of the model group, respectively.	17445	17632
24442316	In CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group, levels of MDA were significantly decreased, respectively.	17633	17739
24442316	In order to understand the effects of CMCS upon the expression and activity of gelatinases in hepatic tissues, we examined the hepatic MMP-2/9 activities by gelatin zymography (Fig.	17740	17921
24442316	8a, b) and in situ fluorescent zymography (Fig.	17922	17969
24442316	8c) respectively.	17970	17987
24442316	The results illustrated significantly lower MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in the normal control group compared with those of the model control group (Fig.	17988	18139
24442316	8b).	18140	18144
24442316	By contrast, mice treated with CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly inhibited activities of MMP-2/9 respectively (Fig.	18145	18269
24442316	8b).	18140	18144
24442316	Interestingly, MMP-9 activities and active MMP-2 in CMCS treatment group expressed about two-folder higher than that of in 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group (Fig.	18275	18439
24442316	8b).	18140	18144
24442316	Western blot analysis (Fig.	18445	18472
24442316	9a, b) showed protein expressions of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 respectively.	18473	18541
24442316	Expressions of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were significantly increased in model mice while CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline could decrease the protein expressions of those.	18542	18701
24442316	Graphic values were represented as the densities of ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 versus GAPDH (%) (Fig.	18702	18793
24442316	9c).	18794	18798
24442316	Oftentimes, the role of microvascular system in liver injury pathobiology is neglected, although heterogeneous disturbances in portal blood flow have profound consequences on organ function and dysfunctions.	18799	19006
24442316	Actually, the LSECs, a main cell type of hepatic microvascular system or sinusoids, play a pivot role in maintaining structure and function of the liver.	19007	19160
24442316	Recent documents demonstrated that LSECs not only were the primary targets of drugs, pharmacological agents and other pathological disturbances, but also might be the initial stimulus for hepatic fibrogenesis.	19161	19370
24442316	Bacterial LPS, the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, could induce intrahepatic inflammation to produce various proinflammatory cytokines by activation of Kupffer cells.	19371	19570
24442316	D-GalN, as a specific hepatotoxic agent, was used to increase the susceptibility to the lethal effects of endotoxin.	19571	19687
24442316	In the present study, LPS and D-GalN intoxication caused obvious acute liver injury in mice, demonstrated by the elevated serum ALT and AST activities, obvious liver inflammation lesion, widely vWF expressions and scaffolds structure broken among sinusoids, etc.	19688	19950
24442316	However, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline (MMPs inhibitor) could ameliorate the liver injury compared to the model control, evidenced by the decreasing levels of serum liver function, attenuating the inflammation with widely mononuclear cell infiltration, apoptotic bodies, necrotic and cytolytic hepatocytes in liver.	19951	20265
24442316	Furthermore, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline could maintain the hepatic scaffold structure from breaking.	20266	20368
24442316	Significantly, CMCS treatment could inhibit the expression of vWF with increased level, which might be an original finding in the liver disease and the study of its mechanism.	20369	20544
24442316	It indicated that CMCS had potential effects against acute liver injury as well as hepatic microvasculature damage.	20545	20660
24442316	Remarkably, 1,10-phenanthroline acted as a better role in protecting hepatocytes and hepatic scaffold structure than CMCS.	20661	20783
24442316	LSECs, as the major cell types of microvasculature, are very sensitive to toxins from circulation.	20784	20882
24442316	In the normal liver, LSECs were located on the hepatic sinusoid walls, with un-continuous matrix membrane under LSECs (scaffold structure) and fenestrations among cytoplasm.	20883	21056
24442316	LSECs constitutively expressed the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which along with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), were up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli either in a direct manner or by mediators released from stimulated Kupffer cells.	21057	21320
24442316	Once acute liver injury occured, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were consequently up-regulated on the endothelial surface, mediating the transmigration of leukocytes into the liver parenchyma.	21321	21500
24442316	More importantly, the fenestrations became large and endothelial matrix was broken, which would lead to dysfunctions of microcirculations.	21501	21639
24442316	In the study, the model mice had larger pores were presented in LSECs under SEM and damaged endothelial matrix under TEM observation, with a lot of haemorrhagia and broken scaffold structure stained by silver solution under light scope, and increased expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.	21640	21923
24442316	However, we found that both CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline could restore the fenestration, decrease haemorrhagia in sinusoids, attenuate scaffold structure damage, and down-regulate the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.	21924	22140
24442316	These results indicated that CMCS might have the effects of protecting LSECs from liver injury and keep the structural integration of hepatic sinusoids.	22141	22293
24442316	LSECs injury was associated with its detachment from matrix membrane, which was mainly regulated by MMP-2/9.	22294	22402
24442316	In our study, 1,10-phenanthroline, an MMPs inhibitor, was selected as the positive control.	22403	22494
24442316	As expected, CMCS could decrease the expressions and activities of MMP-2/9 of model mice, which demonstrated that CMCS down-regulated MMP-2/9 activities, and protected endothelial matrix degradation, resulting in protection of LSECs detachment and injury.	22495	22750
24442316	Besides, LSECs are very vulnerable to oxidative stress, in the experiment, the hepatic lipid peroxidation in the model mice was obviously demonstrated by decreased SOD and GSH but increased MDA etc., while in CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group, levels of MDA were decreased and ASAFR, ·OH, SOD and GST were increased significantly, respectively.	22751	23106
24442316	All these data revealed that anti-oxidation might be another action mechanism of CMCS against LSECs injury.	23107	23214
24442316	In the study, we also found that 1,10-phenanthroline could relieve the acute liver injury by down-regulating levels of serum liver functions, protecting hepatocyte from lesion, resisting oxidative stress, etc., suggesting this MMP inhibitor might had potential application in LPS/D-GalN induced acute liver injury.	23215	23529
24442316	LPS alone or combined with D-GalN could induce the liver injuries with complicated mechanism.	23530	23623
24442316	In addition to peroxidative stress and MMP-2/9 regulation, it could mediate the TLR-4 and NF-κB signaling pathway, inhibit the expression of vWF with increased level, and result in regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAME-1 expression and LSEC injury.	23624	23865
24442316	In the current study, we focused on the effects of CMCS on LSECs in acute injured liver, and the action mechanisms relating to MMP-2/9 activities as well as liver peroxidation.	23866	24042
24442316	Whether CMCS could regulate LPS induced TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway remains unknown, this possible underlying molecular action mechanisms of CMCS will be our future investigation.	24043	24223
24442316	CMCS is effective on alleviating LSECs damage and restoring microvasculature integration in acute liver injured mice induced by LPS/D-GalN.	24224	24363
24442316	Its action mechanism was associated with down-regulation of MMP-2/9 and protection of peroxidation in injured liver.	24364	24480
26991973	The coordinated determination of cell fate during the transformation of pluripotent stem cells to specialized body cells is crucial for the development of higher organisms.	0	172
26991973	Intercellular communication between stem cells and their immediate derivatives is a common motif in this context (Seuntjens et al., 2009; Doma et al., 2013).	173	330
26991973	However, how stem cell properties are controlled without strict determination by cell lineage and how directionality of tissue production is achieved in these cases is unknown.	331	507
26991973	Plants are extraordinary in this regard, because cell fate is constantly readjusted allowing indeterminate increase in body size by the constant formation of new tissues.	508	678
26991973	Stem cells facilitating longitudinal growth of organs are embedded in protective niches located at shoot and root tips, called the shoot and root apical meristems (SAM and RAM) (Heidstra and Sabatini, 2014).	679	886
26991973	Although the orientation of cell divisions is tightly controlled in cases such as the Arabidopsis RAM, divisions in apical meristems of higher plants are often random (Heimsch and Seago, 2008; Aichinger et al., 2012).	887	1104
26991973	In contrast, lateral growth of roots and shoots predominantly depends on strictly oriented cell divisions in the cambium, a bifacial meristem producing secondary vascular tissue (Brackmann and Greb, 2014).	1105	1310
26991973	Interestingly, although plant meristems are anatomically distinct, limited numbers of comparative studies have shown commonalities in their regulation (Sarkar et al., 2007; Stahl et al., 2013; Zhou et al. 2014), suggesting the existence of common motifs promoting plant stem cell attributes.	1311	1602
26991973	One set of regulatory components found in all plant stem cell niches is composed of specific members of the LRR‐RLK family, their ligands belonging to the CLAVATA3/ESR‐RELATED peptide (CLEp) family and members of the WUSCHEL‐RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) transcription factor family (Lenhard and Laux, 2003; DeYoung et al., 2006; Hirakawa et al., 2008, 2010; Ogawa et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2010; Depuydt et al., 2013).	1603	2015
26991973	In the SAM, binding of the CLE peptide CLAVATA3 (CLV3p) to the LRR‐RLK CLV1 inhibits transcription of the stem cell promoting WUSCHEL (WUS) transcription factor gene (Schoof et al., 2000; Ogawa et al., 2008).	2016	2224
26991973	In turn, the WUS protein moves from the center of the meristem to the apical stem cells to activate CLV3 expression, thus completing a feedback loop that balances stem cell proliferation (Mayer et al., 1998; Yadav et al., 2011; Daum et al., 2014).	2225	2472
26991973	In the RAM, CLV1 acts together with the receptor kinase ARABIDOPSIS CRINKLY4 (ACR4) to inhibit the WOX5 transcription factor gene maintaining root stem cells (Sarkar et al., 2007; De Smet et al., 2008; Stahl et al., 2009, 2013).	2473	2701
26991973	In this case, CLE40p is most likely produced in differentiated root tip cells and binds to CLV1, which is expressed in the distal stem cells (Sarkar et al., 2007; Stahl et al., 2009, 2013; Guo et al., 2010).	2702	2909
26991973	While regulatory mechanisms underlying stem cell homeostasis in the two apical meristem types (SAM and RAM) have been studied intensively, it is not well understood how proliferation of the stem cells in lateral meristems, for instance the cambium, is controlled.	2910	3173
26991973	Only a positive regulatory cascade has been found there: The CLE41/44p is generated in differentiated phloem cells, a cambium‐derived vascular tissue produced toward the organ periphery (distally).	3174	3371
26991973	From there it moves to the stem cells within the cambium where it binds to the LRR‐RLK PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM (PXY, also known as TDR).	3372	3515
26991973	Thereby, CLE41/44p inhibits differentiation of xylem, the vascular tissue produced toward the organ center (proximally) (Fisher and Turner, 2007; Hirakawa et al., 2008; Etchells and Turner, 2010; Kondo et al., 2014).	3516	3732
26991973	In addition, the binding enhances expression of WOX4, another member of the WOX transcription factor family, which in turn promotes cambial cell divisions (Hirakawa et al., 2010; Suer et al., 2011; Etchells et al., 2013).	3733	3954
26991973	The distinct directionality of the CLE41/PXY‐dependent signaling seems to provide spatial information for instructing the almost strictly periclinal (parallel to the organ surface) orientation of cell divisions in the cambium (Etchells and Turner, 2010).	3955	4209
26991973	However, considering the bifacial character of the cambium, a more complex system for providing spatial and directional information than the unidirectional CLE41/PXY system may be predicted to act in the cambium zone.	4210	4427
26991973	Furthermore, in analogy to the apical meristems, a negative regulation for cambium homeostasis is to be expected.	4428	4541
26991973	Although several LRR‐RLKs have been detected to be expressed associated with the cambium in woody species (Wang et al., 2015), no such negative regulation has been characterized to date.	4542	4728
26991973	Thus, it is unclear how strictly bidirectional tissue production is achieved and how the regulatory networks that are involved are spatially organized to produce such a tightly controlled system.	4729	4924
26991973	Here, we use fluorescent promoter reporters to show that the LRR‐RLK MORE LATERAL GROWTH1 (MOL1) is expressed in the distal domain of the cambium.	4925	5071
26991973	Histological and genetic analyses demonstrate that MOL1 contributes to stem cell homeostasis within the cambium and niche organization and that PXY and WOX4 act epistatically to MOL1.	5072	5255
26991973	MOL1 is closely related to PXY but by swapping the promoters of these genes we found that PXY and MOL1 are not interchangeable.	5256	5383
26991973	Interestingly, MOL1 is able to replace CLV1 in the SAM but this does not hold true for PXY.	5384	5475
26991973	We also show that MOL1 represses stress‐related hormonal signaling pathways that positively influence cambium activity.	5476	5595
26991973	Altogether, we identify MOL1 as a member of a predicted intercellular communication cascade acting antagonistically to the CLE41/PXY/WOX4 cascade and connecting distinct niche areas.	5596	5778
26991973	This signaling module is functionally relevant for the dynamics of the anatomically complex cambium and, thus, provides scenarios for the evolution of plant stem cell niches.	5779	5953
26991973	As MOL1 was an excellent candidate for representing a negative signaling cascade repressing cambium activity (Agustí et al., 2011b), we set out to analyze the role of the MOL1 gene in cambium regulation.	5954	6157
26991973	To determine spatial organization of MOL1 activity in the cambium area, we generated Arabidopsis lines carrying a proMOL1:YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (YFP) reporter harboring MOL1 promoter regions sufficient to fully complement the mol1 mutant phenotype when driving MOL1 expression (see below).	6158	6452
26991973	The reporter was combined with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)‐based reporters driven by the promoters of PXY or APL, which are active in the predicted stem cells within the cambium or in the differentiated phloem, respectively (Agustí et al., 2011a).	6453	6703
26991973	Analysis of laterally growing stems showed that the MOL1 promoter was mostly active distally to the area of proPXY:CFP activity (Figure 1a–f) and overlapped with proAPL:CFP activity (Figure 1g–l), but also included APL‐negative developing phloem cells and phloem parenchyma (Figure 1g,h).	6704	6992
26991973	A similar arrangement of activity domains was found in hypocotyls from seedlings and mature plants and in primary vascular bundles from inflorescence stems (Figure S1a–g).	6993	7164
26991973	These expression patterns together with the observation that cambium activity is enhanced in mol1 mutants (Agustí et al., 2011b) suggested that MOL1 either represses stem cell divisions or, alternatively, regulates the transition of cambium stem cells to phloem cells delivered toward the organ periphery.	7165	7470
26991973	To decide between both possibilities, we first examined the expansion of secondary vascular tissues in mature mol1‐1 mutant (Agustí et al., 2011b) hypocotyls.	7471	7629
26991973	The overall hypocotyl diameter was increased in mol1‐1 compared with wild type, with an increase in both phloem and xylem production (Figure 2a,e,f).	7630	7779
26991973	This alteration was similar to the increase in lateral growth in the inflorescence stem (Figure 2b,g,h).	7780	7884
26991973	To verify that tissue extension is a good proxy for the number of cells within these tissues we prepared new samples and counted the number of cells along the line of measurement in the inflorescence stem.	7885	8090
26991973	This analysis showed that mol1‐1 not only displayed a significantly larger extension of the interfascicular cambium‐derived tissues (Figure 2b,g,h), but that there are indeed more cells within these regions (Figure S1h).	8091	8311
26991973	In contrast with mol1‐1 mutants, expression of MOL1 fused to YFP under the control of the strong and ubiquitous CaMV 35S promoter (Benfey and Chua, 1990) led to a reduction in the amount of phloem and xylem cells in the hypocotyl (Figure 2c,i,j) and a reduction in lateral growth at the base of the inflorescence stem (Figure 2d,k,l).	8312	8646
26991973	In addition, the production of well aligned files of compact cells derived from cambial divisions was strongly reduced in the inflorescence stem (Figure 2k,l).	8647	8806
26991973	Furthermore, cambium cells were poorly organized and often absent in mature hypocotyls (Figure 2i,j), indicating that enhanced and/or ectopic MOL1 activity alters the organization of the cambium zone and that MOL1 negatively regulates cambium attributes.	8807	9061
26991973	Consistent with the latter conclusion, enhanced tissue production in mol1‐1 mutants was not observed when these mutants also carried wox4‐1, or pxy‐4 mutations, which diminish cambium activity (Fisher and Turner, 2007; Suer et al., 2011) (Figure 2b,m–p) but do not alter MOL1 mRNA abundance on the organ level (Agustí et al., 2011b; Suer et al., 2011; Etchells et al., 2012) (Dataset S1).	9062	9450
26991973	This favors the conclusion that WOX4 and PXY act epistatically to MOL1 and that MOL1 acts on a fully functional cambium.	9451	9571
26991973	Collectively, these observations argue for a primary role of MOL1 in repressing the division rate of cambium stem cells.	9572	9692
26991973	In order to determine whether MOL1 has additional effects on plant growth outside the cambium we counted the primary rosette leaves to gauge floral transition and measured the fresh weight of the aerial parts at the same growth stage as was analyzed above.	9693	9949
26991973	This analysis revealed a small but statistically significant delay in floral transition of mol1‐1 mutants (Figure 3a).	9950	10068
26991973	In addition, mol1‐1 mutants were slightly heavier than wild type plants (Figure 3b).	10069	10153
26991973	However, the time until plants reached 15 to 20 cm shoot height was almost identical (49.1 days for wild type and 50.8 days for mol1‐1), indicating that these differences most likely were due to changes in growth rate, rather than the length of the growth period.	10154	10417
26991973	In spite of these changes the overall morphology of mol1‐1 mutants did not appear to be different to wild type plants (Figure 3c,d).	10418	10550
26991973	These findings were in line with a role of MOL1 predominantly in cambium regulation and underlined the specificity of the observed effects.	10551	10690
26991973	Supporting this conclusion, the anatomy of primary vascular bundles was not altered in mol1‐1 mutants (Figure S1i,j) and a β‐glucuronidase (GUS)‐based transcriptional proMOL:GUS reporter demonstrated an activity of MOL1 exclusively in the mature vascular system harboring an established cambium‐like stem cell niche (Figure S1k–o).	10691	11022
26991973	To see whether there is a direct interaction between MOL1 and the positively acting PXY/CLE41/WOX4 signaling cascade, we compared transcriptional profiles of mol1‐1 and wild type from the bottom‐most centimeter of inflorescence stems harboring a secondary tissue conformation (Sehr et al., 2010).	11023	11319
26991973	Consistent with increased lateral growth in mol1‐1 mutants, we identified genes linked to the stress‐related ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling pathways, which are positively associated with lateral stem growth (Love et al., 2009; Sehr et al., 2010; Etchells et al., 2012), to be more expressed in mol1‐1 (Figure S2a and Dataset S1).	11320	11655
26991973	Particularly striking was the observation that 20% (38/190) of genes that are upregulated in mol1‐1 are also upregulated in pxy mutants, including several ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) transcription factor genes which partly compensate the loss of PXY activity (Etchells et al., 2012), (Figure S2b and Dataset S1).	11656	11971
26991973	In contrast, CLE41, WOX4 or PXY were not found to be differentially expressed.	11972	12050
26991973	These findings were confirmed by qRT‐PCR analysis (Figure 3e,f) and by analyzing proWOX4:YFP and proPXY:YFP promoter reporters which did not display an altered pattern of activity when comparing wild type and mol1‐1 mutant backgrounds (Figure S2c).	12051	12299
26991973	Analysis of transcriptomes from the second elongated internode, with primary tissue conformation, revealed just 16 genes, again not including PXY, CLE41 or WOX4, to be significantly (adjusted P‐value <0.1) changed in mol1‐1 (Dataset S1).	12300	12537
26991973	In addition to supporting the idea of a role of MOL1 predominantly in the regulation of lateral growth, these observations imply that MOL1 does not directly repress PXY, CLE41 or WOX4 gene activities.	12538	12738
26991973	Importantly, although the extracellular domain of PXY is the most similar one to the extracellular domain of MOL1 within the Arabidopsis proteome (Figure 4a) both LRR‐RLKs were not able to functionally replace each other when their respective promoters were swapped (Figure 4b–k).	12739	13019
26991973	This was although all transgenes were actively expressed (Figure S3a–d).	13020	13092
26991973	In contrast, a proMOL1:MOL1 transgene was able to fully complement the mol1‐1 mutant phenotype and a proPXY:PXY transgene partly restored cambium dynamics in pxy‐4 mutant backgrounds (Figure 4b–k).	13093	13290
26991973	This finding suggests that both MOL1 and PXY act in distinct signaling cascades.	13291	13371
26991973	To investigate whether MOL1 activity in the distal cambium domain is essential, we expressed MOL1 under the control of the PXY promoter in wild type and in mol1‐1 mutants.	13372	13543
26991973	Interestingly, we observed severe disorganization of the cambium in some cases (n = 1/7 for proPXY:MOL1 in wild type and 2/6 for proPXY:MOL1 in mol1‐1) (Figure 4l–o) underlining the importance of a proper spatial organization of MOL1 for organized cambium activity.	13544	13809
26991973	More generally, our observations underline the importance of a MOL1 and PXY‐dependent regulation of distinct regulatory programs in discrete cambium domains.	13810	13967
26991973	To see whether MOL1 is able to act as a general repressor of stem cell activity, we expressed MOL1 under the control of the CLV1 promoter in clv1‐20 mutants (Durbak and Tax, 2011) (Figure S4).	13968	14160
26991973	We found that MOL1 rescued the petal number defect of clv1‐20 mutants in a similar manner as CLV1 itself (Figure 5a–e).	14161	14280
26991973	In contrast, when we expressed PXY under the control of the CLV1 promoter (Figure S4), we found that the primary apical meristem was prematurely terminated and numerous axillary inflorescence stems developed (Figure 5f).	14281	14501
26991973	This showed that MOL1 and CLV1, two LRR‐RLKs negatively influencing meristem activity, are able to replace each other in the SAM, while PXY behaves differently in this context.	14502	14678
26991973	Regulation of stem cell activity is a paradigm for cell fate determination in multicellular organisms (Sanchez Alvarado and Yamanaka, 2014).	14679	14819
26991973	Due to the lack of cell motility and of fixed cell lineages in plants, the spatial arrangement of the signaling networks that are involved is essential for creating a cellular environment promoting stem cell properties.	14820	15039
26991973	Here we identified MOL1 as a negative regulator of cambium activity acting antagonistically to the CLE41/PXY/WOX4 cascade.	15040	15162
26991973	We revealed that the expression domain of MOL1 is strongly associated with the radial tissue organization within the cambium area suggesting that MOL1 represents an intercellular communication module that is important for stem cell homeostasis within the cambium.	15163	15426
26991973	In contrast with the SAM and RAM, for which negative regulatory feedback loops via LRR‐RLK/CLE cascades are well characterized (Schoof et al., 2000; Stahl et al., 2009, 2013; Daum et al., 2014), only local regulators acting positively on cambium stem cell activity were previously known (Fisher and Turner, 2007; Hirakawa et al., 2008, 2010; Etchells and Turner, 2010).	15427	15796
26991973	Based on its influence on both phloem and xylem production, the epistasis of WOX4 and PXY to MOL1 and its capacity to replace CLV1 in the SAM, we identified MOL1 as a negative regulator of cambium homeostasis.	15797	16006
26991973	We also show that it is expressed in the distal cambium domain including differentiated phloem cells and mostly distinct from the PXY activity domain.	16007	16157
26991973	Similarly to the RAM (Bennett and Scheres, 2010), the cambium delivers cells in opposite directions, in this case, by strongly favoring periclinal cell divisions along the longest cell axis.	16158	16348
26991973	In light of these tightly controlled dynamics, reciprocal signaling cascades connecting the central stem cells with their progenitors and providing positional and directional information can be expected.	16349	16552
26991973	CLE41p is produced in the phloem and travels to the central cambium domain where it promotes cambium activity via PXY and WOX4 (Hirakawa et al., 2008; Etchells et al., 2012).	16553	16727
26991973	Although MOL1 and the positive cambium regulators CLE41 and CLE44 seem to be expressed in similar domains (Hirakawa et al., 2008; Etchells and Turner, 2010), neither CLE41 nor CLE44 transcript accumulation was detectably altered in mol1‐1 mutants arguing against a MOL1‐dependent non‐cell autonomous regulation of cambium activity by influencing CLE41/44 transcription.	16728	17097
26991973	This view is also supported by our finding that WOX4, whose activity is stimulated by CLE41, is not altered in mol1‐1 mutants (Hirakawa et al., 2010).	17098	17248
26991973	Of note, the finding that WOX4 activity is not altered in mol1‐1 is in contrast to our previous analysis during which we detected higher WOX4 mRNA levels in stems from mol1 mutants (Agustí et al., 2011b).	17249	17453
26991973	We propose that enhanced WOX4 activity was previously detected due to an enhanced acropetal progression of cambium initiation along the stem in mol1 mutants leading to an altered overall anatomy with more cambium‐related cells in analyzed stem fragments, but not due to an enhanced WOX4 activity at a given position.	17454	17770
26991973	In addition, because PXY and MOL1 are not able to replace each other when expressed in the respective expression domains, we suggest that two largely independent signaling cascades exist in the cambium acting antagonistically in functional terms and, potentially, in their spatial directionality of intercellular signaling.	17771	18094
26991973	Although the three BARELY ANY MERISTEM (BAM1‐3) LRR‐RLKs have partly opposing functions to CLV1 in the SAM (DeYoung et al., 2006; Deyoung and Clark, 2008), counteracting LRR‐RLKs/CLE cascades with a prominent spatial specificity have not been observed in apical plant stem cell niches in which tissue production is not strictly bidirectional.	18095	18437
26991973	Thus, it is possible that the spatial contrast of the PXY/CLE41 cascades with MOL1 reflects the necessity for a radial communication between cambium‐related tissues during lateral growth.	18438	18625
26991973	Interestingly, ERF transcription factor genes that are expressed in the central cambium domain and known to promote lateral stem growth downstream of WOX4 and PXY (Etchells et al., 2012) are more active in mol1‐1 mutants.	18626	18847
26991973	Because these stress‐related signaling components are more active, even in primary mol1 stems in which tissue anatomy is not altered, it is possible that MOL1 primarily acts on cambium activity by repressing ethylene signaling independently of WOX4 and PXY.	18848	19105
26991973	Cambium activity results in the expansion of peripheral organ tissues and mechano‐sensitive stress signaling has been suggested to play a major role in the coordination of tissue dynamics (Ko et al., 2004; Sehr et al., 2010).	19106	19331
26991973	The current view is that lateral meristems, like the cambium, evolved after the apical meristems and allowed plants to adapt to a plethora of ecological niches on land (Rowe and Speck, 2005; Spicer and Groover, 2010; Hirakawa and Bowman, 2015).	19332	19576
26991973	The diversification and adjustment of signaling networks involved in apical meristem regulation during the evolution of lateral plant growth, in particular CLE/LRR‐RLK signaling modules seem to have been essential for this major breakthrough in the establishment of a broad range of different plant growth forms (Miwa et al., 2009).	19577	19909
26991973	The identification of MOL1 as being important for cambium regulation and the spatial association with this particular stem cell niche suggests that they belong to a regulatory program diversified to regulate lateral plant growth.	19910	20139
26991973	Its specific capacity to replace CLV1 in the SAM further demonstrates a functional similarity between the regulatory systems in both stem cell niches.	20140	20290
26991973	Thus, the establishment of a complex spatial organization of signaling components might have been instrumental for developing a novel stem cell niche with a strict demand for directionality of tissue production.	20291	20502

26991973	All fluorescent reporter proteins were targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the appropriate target sequences (Haseloff et al., 1997).	22575	22717
26991973	For MOL1 promoter constructs, initially two genomic fragments (1296 bp upstream of the start codon and 490 bp downstream of the stop codon) were inserted between NotI and ApaI sites of pGreen0229 or pGreen0029 (Hellens et al., 2000) resulting in pMS40 and pMS94, respectively.	22718	22994
26991973	The open reading frames of YFP–ER or GUS were then inserted into restrictions sites introduced between the two genomic fragments in pMS40 (resulting in pNG1 and pMS92, respectively) and the MOL1 open reading frame was inserted into pMS94 (resulting in pMS95).	22995	23254
26991973	For proMOL1:PXY (pKG49), the same strategy was used except that in this case pGreenII0179 served as a backbone.	23255	23366

26991973	Measurements were made blind to sample identity.	24109	24157
26991973	RNA in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (Greb et al., 2003).	24158	24244
26991973	For probe synthesis, PCR products (Table S1) generated using cDNA as a template were cloned into the pGEM‐T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and used as a template for transcription from the T7 or SP6 promoter.	24245	24457
26991973	MOL1 and PXY probes were described before (Agustí et al., 2011b).	24458	24523
26991973	Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol® (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.	24524	24652
26991973	For RNA sequencing, total RNA was isolated from the bottom‐most centimeter of the elongated inflorescence stem of 20 cm tall plants or from above the first node.	24653	24814
26991973	Library preparation and Deep RNA sequencing comparing wild type and mol1‐1 mutants with two replicates each in which RNA from two plants was pooled (single‐end, 50 bp reads, at least 27.5 million aligned fragments for each sample) was performed at the Vienna Biocenter Core Facilities GmbH (VBCF) (Vienna, Austria).	24815	25130
26991973	RNA sequencing of samples from above the first node comparing wild type, mol1 used three replicates per genotype and each replicate contained RNA pooled from two or three plants.	25131	25309
26991973	Each replicate produced at least 37 million aligned reads (single read 50 bp).	25310	25388
26991973	HiSeq machines (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) were used in all cases.	25389	25458
26991973	All reads were aligned using CLC Genomics Work Bench 7 (CLC bio, Denmark).	25459	25533

24014394	Mitochondrial complex III (cIII; ubiquinol–cytochrome c reductase, bc1 complex, E.C.1.10.2.2) catalyzes the transfer of electrons from coenzyme Q to cytochrome c (cyt c).	0	170
24014394	The energy liberated by this reaction sustains the translocation of four protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), which contributes to the formation of the electrochemical potential (ΔP).	171	372
24014394	Complex III is composed of 11 subunits.	373	412
24014394	Cytochrome b (cyt b) is the only cIII subunit encoded by a mtDNA gene, whereas the remaining 10 are encoded by nuclear DNA genes.	413	542
24014394	Several other nuclear genes are required for the proper formation and function of cIII [Crivellone et al., 1988].	543	656
24014394	The assembly of cIII in mammalian cells is a still poorly understood process, including the very mechanisms leading to the module-based, stepwise formation of the mature enzyme, the exact subunit composition of the assembly intermediates, and the complete set of specific cIII assembly factors.	657	951
24014394	We report here the identification of the first LYRM7/MZM1L pathogenic mutation in a patient with early onset, severe encephalopathy and lactic acidosis.	952	1104
24014394	LYRM7 (LYR motif containing 7) gene product is the human ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein MZM1 (Mitochondrial-Zinc-Maintenance 1); in both organisms, this protein is a cIII assembly factors that participates in the incorporation of the Rieske Fe–S protein into nascent cIII [Atkinson et al., 2011; Sánchez et al., 2013].	1105	1441
24014394	The proband was one of four siblings born from Moroccan first-cousin parents; two of them are both alive and well, whereas one has isolated, static mental delay.	1442	1603
24014394	The patient was born at the 39th week of gestation after uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery.	1604	1698
24014394	Weight at birth was 2.8 kg (5–10 percentile).	1699	1744
24014394	Her development was normal during the first 20 months of life, when she manifested rapidly progressive weakness with reduced spontaneous motor activity and alertness, and polypnea.	1745	1925
24014394	The laboratory tests showed anemia (hemoglobin 7.3 g/dl, n.v. 13–16) associated with low plasma iron (15 mg/dl, n.v. > 50), treated by iron supplementation.	1926	2082
24014394	At 21 months, during an infectious episode with fever, the patient developed acute, severe dyspnea and stupor, requiring ICU treatment.	2083	2218
24014394	The clinical examination showed generalized hypotonia, a central breathing pattern, and a fluctuating comatose state with hardly any reaction to external stimuli.	2219	2381
24014394	Laboratory tests showed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.78, pCO2 16.5; O2 saturation 96%), with increased plasma lactate (11, 2 mg/dl, n.v. < 2) and ammonia (279 μM, n.v. < 80), and severe anemia (Hb 6.8).	2382	2587
24014394	A blood culture was positive for Staphylococcus haemolyticus.	2588	2649
24014394	The profiles of urinary organic acids, plasma amino acids, and acylcarnitines were normal.	2650	2740
24014394	Heart and liver were normal as well.	2741	2777
24014394	A CT scan showed marked bilateral hypodensity of the centrum semiovale, later confirmed by brain MRI, indicating severe demyelinization and vacuolization of the white matter, and global atrophy with a thin corpus callosum (Fig.	2778	3005
24014394	1A and B).	3006	3016
24014394	The patient was intubated for forced ventilation, and treated with blood transfusions and intravenous bicarbonates.	3017	3132
24014394	In the next several days, the clinical features improved, with recovery of spontaneous breathing, and oral alimentation was resumed.	3133	3265
24014394	Nevertheless, severe psychomotor regression persisted with reduction of consciousness, no head control, inability to walk, and severe spastic tetraparesis with reduced spontaneous movements.	3266	3456
24014394	The patient died at 28 months of respiratory failure.	3457	3510
24014394	Informed consent, approved by the Ethical Committee of the Foundation IRCCS Istituto Neurologico “C.Besta,” Milan, Italy, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, was signed by the parents of the patient.	3511	3721

24014394	Muscle morphology showed normal COX reaction with no ragged-red fibers.	5156	5227
24014394	Biochemical assays showed severe, isolated decrease of cIII specific activity normalized to citrate synthase (CS) activity (22.2, n.v. 70–130).	5228	5371
24014394	The other respiratory chain enzymes were normal, although the cI/CS ratio was at the lower limit of the control range (13.4, n.v. 13.6–27.7) (Fig.	5372	5518
24014394	1C).	5519	5523
24014394	The CS-specific activity was also slightly below the lower control limit (74.7 nmol/min mg−1, n.v. 80–210).	5524	5631
24014394	Because of the profound cIII deficiency, we sequenced cIII-related genes, including those encoding cyt b, BCS1L, and TTC19, which were all normal.	5632	5778
24014394	Contrariwise, analysis of the recently reported LYRM7 gene revealed a homozygous c.73G>A transition (NM_181705.2), predicting a Asp25Asn amino-acid change in the corresponding protein (NP_859056.2) (Fig.	5779	5982
24014394	1D).	5983	5987
24014394	The c.73G>A variant was absent in 100 alleles from subjects of North-Africa origin and is not reported in any public SNP databases, including dbSNP and the Exome Variant Server, which contains >10,000 alleles; this variant has been submitted to LSDB (http://www.lovd.nl/LYRM7).	5988	6265
24014394	The Asp25 residue is highly conserved in the phylogenesis (Fig.	6266	6329
24014394	1E).	6330	6334
24014394	The mutation was present in heterozygosis in both parents and in all three unaffected siblings, according to autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease trait.	6335	6497
24014394	Neither fibroblast cells, nor other tissues of the proband were available.	6498	6572
24014394	However, the LYRM7 gene is the human ortholog of MZM1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Atkinson et al., 2011; Sánchez et al., 2013] and the Asp25 residue is conserved between the two species (Fig.	6573	6765
24014394	1E).	6330	6334
24014394	We then introduced the change equivalent to the c.73G>A, p.Asp25Asn of human LYRM7 into the yeast MZM1 wild-type (wt) gene, cloned in a centromeric monocopy vector.	6771	6935
24014394	The MZM1 and mzm1D25N constructs were used to transform a mzm1Δ mutant, giving rise to mzm1Δ/MZM1 and mzm1Δ/mzm1D25N yeast strains.	6936	7067
24014394	In order to reveal a possible respiratory growth defect, serial dilutions of the strains were incubated on minimum medium supplemented with either dextrose or glycerol, at 28°C and 37°C.	7068	7254
24014394	A clear growth defect of the mzm1Δ/mzm1D25N was observed in glycerol-containing plates incubated at 37°C but not at 28°C, (Fig.	7255	7382
24014394	2A), similar to, albeit less pronounced than, the mzm1Δ mutant [Atkinson et al., 2010].	7383	7470
24014394	To further analyze the respiratory deficiency, we measured oxygen consumption, cIII activity and cyt spectra.	7471	7580
24014394	The O2 consumption rates of mzm1Δ/mzm1D25N and mzm1Δ were 36% and 54% less than that of mzm1Δ/MZM1, respectively (Fig.	7581	7699
24014394	2B).	7700	7704
24014394	Likewise, the cIII activity was reduced in mzm1Δ/mzm1D25N (65% residual activity) and mzm1Δ (50%) mitochondria (Fig.	7705	7821
24014394	2C).	7822	7826
24014394	Moreover, the mzm1Δ/mzm1D25N strain showed marked reduction of the peak at 570 nm, corresponding to respiratory cyt b (not shown).	7827	7957
24014394	These results are consistent with the temperature-sensitive respiratory growth defect observed in the mzm1Δ/mzm1D25N serial dilution spot test.	7958	8101

24014394	Mzm1Δ strains harboring a wild-type MZM1 allele, the mzm1D25N allele or the empty vector were serially diluted from 107 to 103 cells/mL.	8163	8299
24014394	Five microliters of each dilution was spotted on YNB minimum agar plates minus uracil with dextrose or glycerol.	8300	8412

24014394	Values were normalized to wild-type rate of oxygen consumption (35 nmol O2 min−1 mg−1) and represented as the mean of at least three values ± SD.	8582	8727

24014394	Antibodies against Core1 and 2 were used to detect complex III (cIII).	9880	9950
24014394	Mzm1p plays a role in the last steps of cIII assembly, being involved in the maturation of the Rieske iron–sulfur protein (Rip1p in yeast), an essential catalytic subunit of cIII [Atkinson et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2012].	9951	10172
24014394	Before incorporation into nascent cIII, the Rip1p precursor undergoes two proteolytic cleavages, which remove a 30-amino-acid import signal at the N-terminus.	10173	10331
24014394	The mitochondrial matrix peptidase removes the first 22 N-terminal residues, giving rise to a partially processed, immature form of Rip1 (i-ISP).	10332	10477
24014394	Next, eight additional N-terminal residues are removed by Oct1p, to generate the mature form (m-ISP), which is eventually incorporated in the nascent cIII [Graham et al., 1994; Nett and Trumpower, 1999].	10478	10681
24014394	MZM1 deletion impairs Rip1p maturation and causes marked decrease in its steady state level.	10682	10774
24014394	In order to evaluate the effects of the mzm1D25N mutation on Rip1p biogenesis and cIII function, we studied mitochondria purified from mzm1Δ/MZM1, mzm1Δ/mzm1D25N, and mzm1Δ strains, cultured at 37°C in YNB medium.	10775	10988
24014394	Mitochondrial proteins were resolved by SDS-page and both i-ISP and m-ISP were immunovisualized by Western-blot analysis.	10989	11110
24014394	As shown in Figure 2D, m-ISP and i-ISP levels were strongly reduced in the mzm1D25N compared with the MZM1 parental strain, resembling the mzm1Δ strain defects [Cui et al. 2012].	11111	11289
24014394	The reduced level of Rip1p was associated with a clear reduction of cIII holocomplex (Fig.	11290	11380
24014394	2E), with no trace of stable subassembly intermediates (Fig.	11381	11441
24014394	2F).	11442	11446
24014394	These data indicate that the Mzm1D25N mutant protein impairs the stabilization/maturation of ISP and, as a consequence, the assembly of the cIII holoenzyme, thus supporting the pathogenic role of its human ortholog.	11447	11662
24014394	Whilst numerous mutations of the gene encoding cyt b, a mtDNA-encoded cIII subunit, have been associated with slowly progressive, usually adult onset, mitochondrial myopathy, mutations in nuclear genes associated with cIII deficiency are much rarer, and characterized by severe clinical course.	11663	11957
24014394	In fact, only a handful of nucleus-encoded proteins related to cIII biogenesis have been linked to disease in humans: three small structural subunits, Ubiquinol cyt c-reductase binding protein (UQCRB), Ubiquinol-cyt c-reductase subunit VII (UQCRQ), and Ubiquinol-cyt c-reductase core 2 protein (UQCRC2), and two cIII assembly factors, BC-synthesis-1 like (BCS1L) and tetra-trico-peptide repeat domain 19 (TTC19) [Miyake et al., 2013; Ghezzi and Zeviani, 2011].	11958	12418
24014394	Only one mutation in each of the cIII encoding subunits UQCRB, UQCRQ, and UQCRC2 has been reported, each in single families, and with clinical presentations of variable severity and features [Ghezzi and Zeviani, 2011].	12419	12637
24014394	However, several mutations in BCS1L are known, encompassing a clinical spectrum ranging from Biornstad syndrome (nerve deafness and pili torti) (MIM #209900), to isolated early onset encephalopathy (MIM #124000), to multisystem GRACILE syndrome (MIM #603358), linked to a founder mutation that is part of the Finnish disease heritage.	12638	12972
24014394	TTC19-mutant patients are characterized by slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder, usually starting in infancy or childhood, although a late-onset rapidly progressive neurological syndrome has also been described, resembling Jacob-Creutzfeldt Disease [Ghezzi et al., 2011].	12973	13253
24014394	LYRM7 is a novel human cIII assembly factor containing a LYR motif.	13254	13321
24014394	LYRM7 is involved in the maturation of the Rieske iron–sulfur protein, an essential catalytic subunit containing a (2Fe–2S) cluster, which is incorporated late during cIII assembly [Cui et al., 2012].	13322	13522
24014394	Interestingly, small LYR proteins are deemed to be involved in the biogenesis of iron–sulfur cluster containing structures, including respiratory chain complex I, where several LYR proteins are present as ancillary subunits, and complex II, for which a LYR-containing assembly factor, SDHAF1, was recently identified [Ghezzi and Zeviani, 2011].	13523	13867
24014394	The role of LYRM7 in maturation/incorporation of the Rieske protein in cIII explains the specific biochemical phenotype and the severe, early onset encephalopathy with lactic acidosis found in our patient, who carried a disease-segregating homozygous missense mutation in LYRM7, affecting a highly conserved amino-acid residue.	13868	14195
24014394	In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the ortholog of LYRM7 is MZM1, which plays the same role on cIII assembly.	14196	14309
24014394	We took advantage of the phylogenetic conservation of both gene and mutant residue, to demonstrate the pathogenic role of the human variant in a yeast recombinant model carrying the equivalent mutant allele.	14310	14517
24014394	We clearly showed that the mutant yeast strain has impaired oxidative growth, low cIII activity, reduced amount of cyt b and cIII holocomplex; the mature Rieske protein steady state level is also strongly decreased.	14518	14733
24014394	Taken together, these results confirm the pathogenicity of the mutation, according to a recessive trait, and provide genetic evidence for a role of LYRM7 in a terminal step of cIII assembly, relevant to warrant OXPHOS proficiency in cells and tissues.	14734	14985
28472177	Childhood high-grade astrocytoma, although rare, is extremely difficult to treat.	0	81
28472177	For a vast majority of the patients, the disease quickly relapses following an initial response to aggressive multimodality treatments and about 80% of the affected children will die from their disease.	82	284
28472177	Malignant gliomas show substantial genetic and histological heterogeneity, which supports the notion of pathway pliability.	285	408
28472177	The clinical presentations, which includes invasion of surrounding tissue, and the response of these patients to therapy supports the concept that a pool of stem-like cancer cells responsible for long-term remission failure that exits within these tumors [3–5].	409	670
28472177	In this scenario, identifying pathways that impart stem-like characteristics to glioma cells can offer radical advances to the treatment and diagnosis of this devastating childhood cancer.	671	859
28472177	Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), the major cellular machinery that regulates protein homeostasis.	860	1049
28472177	The UPS is responsible for intracellular protein degradation and regulation of many key biological processes, such as breakdown of transcription factors, cell cycle control, and cell differentiation [6, 7].	1050	1256
28472177	Defect in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is observed in several human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases [8, 9] and in certain types of malignant tumors [10, 11].	1257	1432
28472177	In this regard, UCHL1 is differentially expressed in various cancers, and has been proposed to have oncogenic or tumor suppressive properties depending on the cellular context.	1433	1609
28472177	UCHL1 activity in tumorigenesis has been linked to cell cycle regulation, possibly, by targeting p53, β-catenin, and Akt pathways [13–16].	1610	1748
28472177	UCHL1 has been shown to promote metastasis via the activation of HIF-1 and its overexpression also correlates with poor prognosis in patients with breast and lung cancers.	1749	1920
28472177	Several lines of evidence suggest that UCHL1 is essential for the onset of neurogenesis and that is a determinant of asymmetric distribution during germ-line stem cell self-renewal and differentiation [18, 19].	1921	2131
28472177	Data from the Protein Atlas Database (http://www.proteinatlas.org/), shows a distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear UCHL1 immunoreactivity in glioma samples.	2132	2283
28472177	Although the clinical relevance of UCHL1 expression in glioma seems possible, whether UCHL1 overexpression contributes to the malignant transformation/phenotype in astrocytoma has not been ascertain, and the molecular mechanism underlying its action in this context is also unclear.	2284	2566
28472177	The ubiquitin proteasome system has emerged as a promising target for cancer therapy with two drugs targeting the proteasome (bortezomib and carfilzomib) currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma.	2567	2789
28472177	Improved oral bioavailability and specificity of action together with targeting “undruggable” oncoproteins (e.g. MYCN, Beta-catenin) are areas of interests in cancer therapy research (reviewed in).	2790	2987
28472177	Therefore, DUB enzymes found to be deregulated in cancer, such UCHL1, may give rise to alternative cancer therapies as upstream regulators of “undruggable” oncoproteins.	2988	3157
28472177	Also, increased selectivity of DUB enzymes over the currently FDA approved proteasome inhibitors is a driving force for exploring DUBs as potential anticancer targets.	3158	3325
28472177	Using a lentiviral knockdown system, we investigated the effect of UCHL1 inhibition on astrocytoma cell invasion, cell proliferation, and on the stem-like cancer cell population.	3326	3504
28472177	To gain some insight in the UCHL1-associated pathways, we then conducted transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses with the control and knockdown cell lines.	3505	3663
28472177	Our loss of function studies using these pediatric high-grade gliomas cell lines showed that UCHL1 promoted cell growth, invasiveness, and self-renewal characteristics in vitro.	3664	3841
28472177	Using a luciferase reporter system, we found significant downregulation of Wnt/Beta catenin signal transduction in the UCHL1 KDs, which suggested this pathway as a possible candidate mediating, at least in part, the observed effects.	3842	4075
28472177	Subsequent transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses identified angiogenesis, neuron development and differentiation, or cell motility among the potential functions of the UCHL1-associated gene network.	4076	4279
28472177	Endocytosis, chemokine signaling, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction were also identified in our model system as possible pathways associated to the UCHL1-KD transcriptome.	4280	4463
28472177	To gain some insight in the potential role of UCHL1 in high-grade glioma, we mined its levels of expression in human glioma tissue microarrays reported in the publicly available Protein Atlas Database; http://www.proteinatlas.org/.	4464	4695
28472177	The expression levels of UCHL1 in these tissue microarray glioma samples from the database is summarized in Table 1.	4696	4812
28472177	This tissue microarray consists of 20 adult and 2 childhood glioma samples.	4813	4888
28472177	A distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear UCHL1 immunoreactivity was reported in 19 of the 22 samples in the microarray which included the two pediatric cases and 13 of 16 high-grade adult astrocytoma cases (http://www.proteinatlas.org/).	4889	5120
28472177	Then, using well-characterized pediatric astrocytoma cell lines as a model system, we observed elevated UCHL1 mRNA expression with correlating protein expression in UW479, a WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytoma, SF188, and SJ-GBM2, WHO grade IV glioblastoma mutiforme cell lines but no expression in Res186, a WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma cell line.	5121	5475
28472177	The mean densitometry values with SEM of three western blots along with the digitalized image of one of the blots is shown in Fig 1A.	5476	5609
28472177	Thus, the tissue microarray and cell lines data suggested a possible role for UCHL1 in the higher grade glioma cancer cells.	5610	5734
28472177	To explore the relevance of UCHL1 in glioma growth and invasion, we carried out several in vitro analyses using a loss of function strategy.	5735	5875
28472177	We knocked down UCHL1 expression in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cells utilizing two different shRNA constructs (herein called UCHL1 KD1 and KD2).	5876	6011
28472177	At least a 70% reduction in UCHL1 transcript levels as measured by ddPCR and confirmed by RNAseq was achieved in all the four KDs compared to their shRNA controls.	6012	6175
28472177	The mean and SEM densitometry values for UCHL1 protein levels, and their representative western blots in the SJ-GBM2 and SF188 knockdowns are shown in Fig 1B.	6176	6334
28472177	As shown in this figure, UCHL1 expression was knocked down to 0.16 ± 0.03 and 0.23 ± 0.03 in SJ-GBM2 KD1, and SJ-GBM2 KD2 respectively, and to 0.28 ± 0.05 and 0.20 ± 0.04 in the SF188 KD1, and SF188 KD2 respectively.	6335	6551
28472177	To assess the role UCHL1 in vitro tumorigenicity, a colony formation assay (ie, soft-agar growth assay) was used.	6552	6665
28472177	As shown in Fig 2B, close to 50% reduction in clonogenicity was observed in the SF188 and SJ-GBM2 UCHL1 KDs, suggesting a functional role of UCHL1 in glioma malignant transformation.	6666	6848
28472177	The ability of forming colonies in soft agar was 0.45 ± 0.06 and 0.56 ± 0.15 for SF188 KD1 and KD2 respectively, and 0.44 ± 0.07 and 0.47 ± 0.08 for SJ-GBM2 KD1 and KD2, respectively.	6849	7032
28472177	Table 2 shows that depletion of UCHL1 increased the population doubling times to 50–70 hours, suggested that UCHL1 might play a role in promoting cell proliferation.	7033	7198
28472177	To elucidate the possible role of UCHL in cell proliferation, cell cycle analysis was performed.	7199	7295
28472177	As shown in Fig 2A, depletion of UCHL1 increased the percentage of cells in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle from 13% in the control cells to 21% in the UCHL1 knockdowns.	7296	7467
28472177	A key feature of malignant gliomas is their ability to migrate and to invade normal surrounding tissue.	7468	7571
28472177	Invasive cells produce proteolytic enzymes that enable them to detach from their basement membrane, to digest the extracellular matrix, and to migrate.	7572	7723
28472177	To investigate possible differences invasiveness between the knockdowns and controls, an in vitro Matrigel assay was done.	7724	7846
28472177	Fig 2C shows that UCHL1 depleted cells were significantly less invasive than the control cells.	7847	7942
28472177	Approximately, a 90% decrease in the number of cells able to migrate through the basement membrane inserts was found in the knockdown samples.	7943	8085
28472177	We scored the number of cells invading 8 fields (magnification, 40x) of the Matrigel inserts of the controls and knowndowns.	8086	8210
28472177	The average number of invasive cells in the 8 fields of the Matrigel were: 7 in the case of SJ-GBM2 KD1, 4 in SJ-GBM2 KD2 cells, 5 in SF188KD1, and 5 in SF188 KD2 compared to 56 in the SJ-GBM2, and 40 in the SF188 control cells, respectively.	8211	8453
28472177	Thus our cell-based assays suggested a potential role of UCHL1 in glioma cell transformation and cell invasiveness.	8454	8569
28472177	Our data suggested that UCHL1 might affect glioma growth and invasiveness, these are known properties associated with stem-like cell populations.	8570	8715
28472177	Spheroid cultures have been demonstrated to enrich in glioblastoma stem-like cancer cells and are considered a surrogate marker of self-renewal capability.	8716	8871
28472177	Using this well-established protocol for glioma CSC culture, first we determine the optimum cell density at plating so that cells were dispersed to ensure that each third generation sphere is derived from a single cell, which is a requirement to assess self-renewal in vitro.	8872	9147
28472177	As shown in Fig 3A, we determined that plating cell densities from 50 to 200 cells per well of a 96-well plate provided a reproducible results, with a sphere formation rate of ~10% in the control and ~2% in the UCHL1 KD.	9148	9368
28472177	As shown in Fig 3B, there was an approximately 60% reduction in the number of third generation spheres in the SF188 KDs (i.e. 8 ± 1 and 13 ± 1 in the KD1 and KD2 compared to 23 ± 3 in the control shRNA construct).	9369	9582
28472177	A 80% reduction was observed in the SJ-GBM2 KDs (i.e. 1.3 ± 0.6 and 3.1 ±0.6 in the KD1 and KD2 versus 10.2 ± 0.7 in the control shRNA construct).	9583	9729
28472177	These results suggested a potential role of UCHL1 in pediatric high-grade glioma stem-like cells.	9730	9827
28472177	De-regulation of p53, β-catenin, and Akt pathways have been linked to the activity of UCHL1 in tumorigenesis [13–16].	9828	9945
28472177	In this regard, UCHL1 has been proposed to form a positive feedback loop with β-catenin, whereby UCHL1 promotes translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus where it binds to the TCF/LEF complex and activates transcription of its downstream targets, which may also include UCHL1.	9946	10224
28472177	Furthermore, abnormal of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling has been reported in glioma stem-like cancer cells.	10225	10328
28472177	Thus, we sought to determine whether UCHL1 was involved in Wnt/Beta-catenin activity in our model system.	10329	10434
28472177	We used a TOPflash luciferase reporter assay to assess Beta-catenin-mediated activation of downstream target genes in our model system.	10435	10570
28472177	We found, on average, a 70% decrease in Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling when UCHL1 was depleted.	10571	10662
28472177	As shown in Fig 4, the mean and SEM arbitrary units of luminescence were 0.26 ± 0.05 (SJ-GBM2 KD1), 0.28 ± 0.09 (SJ-GBM2 KD2), 0.24 ± 0.04 (SF188 KD1), and 0.34 ± 0.13 (SF188 KD2), normalized to their respective control cells.	10663	10889
28472177	These data suggested the beta-catenin pathway as a mediator, at least in part, of the effects of UCHL1 in SJ-GBM2 and SF188 glioma cells.	10890	11027
28472177	To obtain additional insights in the UCHL1-associated gene networks and potential mechanisms mediating the UCHL1 effects, we performed transcriptome comparisons of the cells transduced with the UCHL1 shRNA constructs and those transduced with the shRNA control plasmid.	11028	11297
28472177	Three hundred and six differentially expressed genes were found by RNAseq in the SJ-GBM2 UCHL1 knockdowns and control cells (S1 File), the top 32 differentially expressed genes are listed in Table 3.	11298	11497
28472177	In silico gene ontology (GO) analysis of these 306 differentially genes identified 11 annotation clusters with enrichment scores above 2.5 (DAVID,).	11498	11646
28472177	Table 4 summarizes the top GO annotated clusters and biological processes identified in the bioinformatics analyses.	11647	11763
28472177	The top 4 clusters (with enrichment scores 8.33, 6.87, 3.65, and 3.61 respectively) were related to “signal peptides”, “extracellular matrix“, “secreted proteins”, and “plasma membrane (proteins)” GO Terms (S2 File).	11764	11980
28472177	Specifically, top enriched GO Terms identified with this analysis were “signal peptide” (with 97 genes involved; 32.33% enrichment; p = 4.07x10-11), extracellular region” (63 genes; 21% enrichment, p = 9.78x10-7), “glycoprotein” (103 genes; 34% enrichment; p = 1.13x10-6), and “integral to plasma membrane” (40 genes; 13.33% enrichment; p = 4.33x10-5).	11981	12333
28472177	Additional biological process showing significant cluster enrichment in the GO analysis included “angiogenesis and blood vessel development”, (enrichment score 2.89) “neuron differentiation/development” (2.79), “cell adhesion” (2.65), and “cell migration” (2.56).	12334	12597
28472177	Thus these GO analyses seemed to suggest a potential role for UCHL1 in extracellular matrix composition or extracellular matrix-cell communication.	12598	12745
28472177	Intriguingly, our Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) also identified, inflammation, endocytosis, metastasis related functions and “High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB1) Signaling” within the top canonical pathways possibly affected by UCHL1 in SJ-GBM2 cells (i.e. “Role of Macrophages, Fibroblasts and Endothelial Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis”; p = 3.68x10-5, “Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis Signaling”; p = 5.14x10-4, “Virus Entry via Endocytic Pathways”; p = 6.15x10-4, “HMGB1 Signaling”; p = 6.15x10-4, “Colorectal Cancer Metastasis Signaling”; p = 8.18x10-4), also in line with a possible role of UCHL1 in cell-extracellular matrix interaction.	12746	13388
28472177	These UCHL1-associated pathways and upstream regulators are summarized in Table 5.	13389	13471
28472177	The top three potential upstream regulators of the UCHL1-KD transcriptome predicted by IPA software (S3 File) were coagulation factor II (F2, p = 5.96x10-9; with 18 targets in our differentially expressed genes), nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1, p = 1.17x10-4; with 18 target genes), and P53 (TP53; p = 2.14x10-15; with 58 target genes).	13472	13802
28472177	Of note, expression of NUPR1 (a transcription factor involved in progression of liver and other cancers) was about 8-fold increased in our UCHL1 knockdown (p = 1.20x10-8).	13803	13974
28472177	Within the list of top differentially expressed genes, in the UCHL1 KDs we found downregulation of the Wnt targets POSTN, SP7, and DLL1, of the transporter ABCA4, of the homeobox gene DLX4, and of genes recently linked to cancer progression ACTA2, AQ4, GRAP2, and ALK.	13975	14243
28472177	Tumorigenesis is a complex process that involves abnormal changes in the pathways mediating cell proliferation, survival, and motility.	14244	14379
28472177	Cancer cells usually achieve these functions by hijacking developmental pathways including Wnt/Beta-catenin, Sonic Hedgehog, Akt or Notch to name some.	14380	14531
28472177	High-grade gliomas are very heterogeneous tumors that may resemble a developmental program going awry with glioma cancer stem cells positioned at the top of the hierarchy.	14532	14703
28472177	These cancer stem cells are defined operationally in analogy to normal adult stem cell, as cells with the dual capacity to regenerate themselves through self-renewal mechanism and to perpetuate the production of phenotypically heterogeneous progeny with limited proliferative ability.	14704	14988
28472177	High-grade gliomas are the most aggressive type of primary brain tumors and their great tendency to invade surrounding tissue represents a real therapeutic challenge [1, 26].	14989	15163
28472177	Cancer cells with stem-like properties have been identified in high-grade gliomas and have been proposed as the basis for the plasticity and survival of these malignant tumors.	15164	15340
28472177	These CSCs are able to regenerate themselves, to differentiate into the cells forming the bulk of the tumor, and to communicate with their microenvironment to increase angiogenesis or to recruit inflammatory cells that sustain tumor growth and survival.	15341	15594
28472177	Thus, novel strategies in high-grade gliomas, and in many other types of cancers, aim to target these CSC populations is warranted.	15595	15726
28472177	UCHL1 is a deubiquitinase highly expressed in the nervous system and its role in different types of cancer is starting to be elucidated.	15727	15863
28472177	Recent studies have demonstrated that UCHL1 can affect invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, chemosensitivity, and cell cycle among other functions [14, 28–30].	15864	16031
28472177	The available protein expression data from tumor samples (Protein Atlas database; http://www.proteinatlas.org/) supported a potential role of UCHL1 in high-grade glioma.	16032	16201
28472177	Using cell lines as model system we confirmed that UCHL1 was highly expressed in high-grade pediatric glioma SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cells compared to low-grade Res186 cells.	16202	16370
28472177	As shown in Fig 1A, SJ-GBM2 cells exhibited higher levels of UCHL1 protein compared to SF188 and UW479 cells.	16371	16480
28472177	This data provided us with the rationale to explore whether UCHL1 was involved in high-grade glioma malignancy.	16481	16592
28472177	Future work will explore the biological relevance of the differences in UCHL1 expression among the various WHO grade astrocytomas.	16593	16723
28472177	In this study, we knocked down the expression of UCHL1 in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cell lines using a lentivirus transduction system of two different UCHL1 shRNA vectors, providing us a model system to elucidate the potential function of UCHL1 in glioma malignancy.	16724	16982
28472177	We assessed the effects of UCHL1 depletion upon sphere formation, cell invasion, and cell proliferation.	16983	17087
28472177	A decrease on cell proliferation and in cellular invasiveness, together with an impaired sphere formation (in vitro surrogate assay for self-renewal), was observed in the knockdowns, which suggested a potential role for UCHL1 in high-grade glioma CSC function.	17088	17348
28472177	Although activating mutations in beta-catenin do not seem frequent in gliomas, intracellular accumulation of beta-catenin and Wnt pathway activation occur in glioblastoma and they contribute to CSC maintenance and cell invasion.	17349	17577
28472177	For example, PLAGL2 (Pleomorphic adenomas gene-like 2) and Dishevelled-2 (DVL2) have been shown to activate Wnt pathway in glioblastomas and to sustain self-renewal in glioma CSCs independently of beta-catenin mutations [23, 32].	17578	17807
28472177	UCHL1 has also been proposed to activate Wnt signaling through deubiquitination and stabilization of beta-catenin.	17808	17922
28472177	In this study, using TCF-dependent TOPflash reporter system we found approximately, a 70% decrease in the activity of Wnt pathway in our KDs model system, thus suggesting that Wnt or of its downstream effectors could be influencing sphere formation, cell proliferation, and/or invasion.	17923	18209
28472177	Of note, in the UCHL1 KDs we found a marked decrease in the gene expression of the Wnt targets SP7 (a transcription factor involved in osteoblast differentiation; ~19-fold decrease), DLL1 (delta like canonical Notch ligand 1; ~11-fold decrease), and POSTN (~6-fold decrease), thus consistent with a reduced activity of the pathway in these cells.	18210	18556
28472177	POSTN gene encodes for periostin; an extracellular protein secreted by glioma cancer stem cells that recruits macrophages to the CSC niche, promotes angiogenesis (in part by increasing HIF-1α expression), cell invasion and glioblastoma progression in mouse models [27, 34, 35].	18557	18834
28472177	Interestingly, in the UCHL1 KDs we found downregulation of additional proangiogenic genes such as ELK3, CXCL12, ANGPT1, HMOX1, or DLK1 and upregulation of the anti-angiogenic gene THBS1.	18835	19021
28472177	UCHL1 has been shown to increase metastasis through deubiquitination and stabilization of HIF-1α, a central protein in tumor angiogenesis.	19022	19160
28472177	Thus, a positive feedback loop between UCHL1, HIF-1α, and POSTN might be proposed where UCHL1 may promote angiogenesis directly via HIF-1α stabilization and indirectly via POSTN upregulation.	19161	19352
28472177	Additional mechanisms mediating self-renewal and invasion in our model system such as activation of Akt and Erk1/2 pathways [30, 36], or stabilization of the oxidase NOX4 and of membrane receptors like the cell adhesion protein NCAM among other yet to uncover targets [37, 38] should not be ruled out.	19353	19654
28472177	For instance aberrant expression of the brain aquaporin 1 (AQ1) and 4 (AQ4), which regulate water flow in and out of the cells, have been found in glioblastoma sphere cultures and their role in this tumor has just started to be elucidated [39, 40].	19655	19903
28472177	Of note, AQ4 was the second most downregulated gene in the UCHL1 KDs (~37-fold reduction compared to controls), thus consistent with a possible function of UCHL1 in glioma CSCs.	19904	20081
28472177	Nevertheless, UCHL1 is highly expressed in the brain and retina, and inactivation of this protein is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson’s disease [41–44].	20082	20276
28472177	Thus, the UCHL1-KD associated transcriptome may be able to uncover cancer associated genes, but also additional genes not involved in cancer per se but rather be considered within the context of neuroprotective functions associated with UCHL1.	20277	20520
28472177	For example, the observed downregulation in ABCA4, a gene encoding a member of the of the ABC family of transporters that is expressed in retinal photoreceptors and its defect causes retinal degeneration such as Stargardt’s disease (reviewed in).	20521	20767
28472177	Finally, within the list of upregulated genes in the UCHL1 KD we also found several cancer-associated genes such as SERPINB4, FGF21, NUPR1, SBSN, GDF1, HMOX1, or SOCS2, which suggested the activation of potential compensatory mechanisms in these KDs cells.	20768	21024
28472177	Future work will evaluate whether these genes exert a biological effect in our model system.	21025	21117
28472177	Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms driving UCHL1 de-regulation in glioma cells and whether the UCHL1 aberrant expression can influence the progression from low to high-grade glioma remains unknown.	21118	21317
28472177	In summary, our data indicated that UCHL1 might be an important factor in pediatric high-grade glioma progression, by sustaining the cancer stem cell population.	21318	21479
28472177	The potential role of UCHL1 in modulating pathways involved in the niche of glioma CSCs such us angiogenesis, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, or receptor endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, may point to promising targets for treatment in pediatric high-grade gliomas by either targeting directly UCHL1 or its associated pathways.	21480	21827
28472177	Our in vitro functional studies and gene expression data demonstrated that UCHL1 regulates glioblastoma CSCs populations and suggested wnt as a potential pathway mediating UCHL1 activity.	21828	22015
28472177	Angiogenesis, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and endocytosis were also identified as processes associated to the UCHL1-KD transcriptome.	22016	22164
28472177	Given the relevance of the cancer microenvironment in sustaining the CSC niche, future work will aim to explore UCHL1 as a potential mediator of the interactions between glioma cancer cells and the tissue microenvironment and to explore UCHL1 as a prospective therapeutic target for high-grade pediatric glioma.	22165	22476
28472177	SJ-GBM2 was obtained from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Cell Culture and Xenograft Repository.	22477	22577
28472177	SF188 was kindly provided by Dr. Daphne Haas-Kogan (University of California at San Francisco, USA) and Res186 by Dr. Michael Bobola (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA).	22578	22756
28472177	SJ-GBM2 cells were maintained in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Atlanta® Biologicals, Inc., Lawrenceville, GA), 4mM L-Glutamine, and 1X ITS (5 μg/mL insulin, 5 μg/mL transferrin, 5 ng/mL selenous acid) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).	22757	23078
28472177	SF188 and Res186 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 Ham’s medium (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics.	23079	23225
28472177	All cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.	23226	23288
28472177	Cells were regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert™ Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Anaheim, CA).	23289	23410
28472177	All the experiments shown here were performed with cells free of mycoplasma contamination.	23411	23501
28472177	Stable UCHL1 knockdowns (KDs) were obtained through a lentiviral transduction system (Addgene) using puromycin (2 μg/mL) as marker for selection.	23502	23647
28472177	Viral packaging and titration were performed as per Addgene’s standard protocols.	23648	23729
28472177	Two different shRNA constructs targeting different sequences within the UCHL1 coding region were used (KD1; TRCN0000011079, NM_004181.3-400s1c1, and KD2; TRCN0000007276, NM_004181.3-236s1c1).	23730	23921

27941998	Desminopathies, also known as genetically skeletal myopathy and/or cardiomyopathy, is the most common subtype of protein aggregated myopathies.	0	143
27941998	This disease ranged from childhood to late adulthood is severely disabling disease, was due to the mutation of human desmin gene on chromosome 2q35.	144	292
27941998	Most of patients with desminopathy loss their kinetism for 10 to 20 years of pathogenesis and died of cardiomyopathy or respiratory failure.	293	433
27941998	The muscle pathology is characterized by enlarged myofibrillar diameter, desmin protein aggregate.	434	532
27941998	The precise pathology of myopathies is myofibrillar intermediate sediments.	533	608
27941998	Desminopathies are mainly reported in Northern American, less in China and Japan.	609	690
27941998	Desminis an important muscle-specific type III intermediate filament cytoskeletal protein, containing the 470 amino acids.	691	813
27941998	Its spherical ends mainly interact with intracellular proteins and a variety of substances and the middle rod-shaped are mainly α- helix cytoskeleton.	814	964
27941998	Protein filaments within the muscle cells formed skeleton, and are widely connected to the fascia, Z-disc, nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and other structures.	965	1166
27941998	Meanwhile, special spiral-helix domain of desmin molecule can play a perfect role in power transmission, so that when the muscle fiber contraction or relaxation, the junction cytoskeleton structure will constitute an integrated whole body, muscle cells and organelles make their effective adaptation in systolic and diastolic changes.	1167	1501
27941998	Mutant desmin will lose the function of the previous frame, resulting in not only mechanical power transmission dysfunction of myocyte, but also the obstacle of the mechanical signals of different molecules within the cells and myocytes.	1502	1739
27941998	However, why the desmin gene mutations lead to abnormal accumulation of more than 60 proteins appeared in muscle cells, muscle cells, and what kinds of pathophysiological changes in organelles happened after desmin mutation, these problems have still not been fully understood clearly.	1740	2025
27941998	Mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of the disease has been the research highlights.	2026	2119
27941998	It has been confirmed, and mitochondria are the principal target of pathological mechanisms involved in a variety of inflammatory muscle disease and hereditary muscle disease.	2120	2295
27941998	Recent studies have found that after the desmin gene mutation, mitochondrial morphology and function of muscle cells also appeared abnormal pathological changes.	2296	2457
27941998	Desmin knockout mouse muscle cells, mitochondrial dysfunction are the earliest pathological changes, mainly increased the number of mitochondria, mitochondrial swelling and abnormal accumulation in the muscle membrane, mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, and decreased activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes.	2458	2802
27941998	In the mutant desmin L345P transgenic mice, the muscle fibers within the mitochondrial function and morphology also showed abnormal mitochondrial Ca2+levelsincreased considerably apoptosis start the mitochondria-mediated pathway at the same time.	2803	3049
27941998	Schroder R et al. found that mutant desmin K239fsX242 patient muscle cells appear abnormal distribution of mitochondria, the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes I and IV decreased.	3050	3255
27941998	Above clinical and basic studies have shown that abnormal muscle mitochondria is one of the earliest pathological changes in the desmin mutations, not only for structural mitochondrial abnormalities and abnormal position, but also, the performance of the energy metabolism and Ca2+dysregulation.	3256	3551
27941998	Mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also called mitochondrial membrane pore protein, is an imperative mitochondrial membrane permeability material transport channel.	3552	3735
27941998	The main functions of VDAC include the following aspects: (1) VDAC controls the transport of metabolites between the mitochondria and cytoplasm, VDAC polymers form channels to modulate ATP transportation the outer mitochondrial membrane; (2) VDAC is an important part of mitochondrial permeability transformation channels (permeability transition pore, PT hole), PT hole is composed of mitochondrial proteins and cytoplasmic proteins (including: VDAC, creatine kinase, adenylate transporter, cyclophilin D, etc.	3736	4247
27941998	), mainly localised in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the outer membrane contact sites.	4247	4340
27941998	cytochrome C (CytoC), apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), Smac/DIABLO, nucleic acid within various apoptotic factors, endonuclease G, etc.	4341	4476
27941998	were released into the cytosol when the mitochondrial PT pore are opening; (3) VDAC is the important protein cross-talk between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, VDAC connected to endoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel IP3R physically with chaperone GRP75 (glucose-regulated protein 75) and play an important regulatory role in modulating the inner mitochondrial Ca2+ levels.	4477	4865
27941998	In addition, VDAC connected to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum through phosphorylation cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS2), regulating Bid of Bcl2pro-apoptotic factor family mediated apoptotic pathways; (4) VDAC is involved in the regulation of intracellular redox substances.	4866	5151
27941998	On the one hand, VDAC can promote mitochondrial free oxygen radicals to release into the cytoplasm, on the other hand, nitric oxide (NO) and VDAC interacts directly, inhibits VDAC channel permeability, thereby inhibiting the opening of the mitochondrial PT pores.	5152	5415
27941998	In conclusion, VDAC is the important intersectional target of mitochondrial regulation of cell survival and death pathways.	5416	5539
27941998	Apoptosis is completed through the extrinsic pathway and intrinsic pathway, the extrinsic pathway is considered to be leaded by a number of extracellular signals, such as Fas or tumor necrosis factor (TNF); intrinsic pathway usually begins with the mitochondria response to different stimuli.	5540	5832
27941998	VDAC is uniquely positioned in the outer mitochondrial membrane channel, control crosstalk between mitochondria and other parts of cell metabolism.	5833	5980
27941998	VDAC is a powerful lever in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism.There are a lot of proteins interacting with VDAC1 in the cell, adjusting the permeability of PT pore and the release of the apoptotic material of mitochondrial membrane gap, thereby regulating cell apoptosis.	5981	6261
27941998	The bcl-2 protein family is one of the key factors in the regulation of apoptosis, and plays an important role in apoptosis signal transduction pathway.	6262	6414
27941998	Bcl-2 and bax are the most representative the anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic genes of bcl-2 family respectively, and bax is the main regulator of bcl-2 activity.	6415	6578
27941998	bax can interact with VDAC to increase VDAC aperture and increases mitochondrial permeability, promoting apoptosis.	6579	6694
27941998	The bcl-2 protein is an essential anti-apoptotic proteins, preventing the release of cytochrome C and the activity of caspase.	6695	6821
27941998	The proper proportion of bax and bcl-2 maintains the cell homeostasis to ensure cell survival.	6822	6916
27941998	In the studies of tumor cells, it was found that tumor cells still maintain energy supply even in the presence of oxygen by enhancing the glucose anaerobic glycolysis, this enhanced characteristics of tumor cell is called aerobic glycolysis tile Berg effects (Warburg effect).	6917	7193
27941998	Further studies showed that the conjunction of mitochondrial and hexokinase is the key of Warburg effect.	7194	7299
27941998	Additional studies showed that hexokinase (HK) and mitochondrial outer membrane through VDAC associated.	7300	7404
27941998	There are four genes encoding four kinds of HK subtypes in the human genome.	7405	7481
27941998	HKⅠand HKⅡare positioned in the outer mitochondrial membrane.HKⅢis localized in the nucleoside, HKⅣis localized in the cytoplasm.	7482	7611
27941998	Evidences suggest that HKⅡof four subtypes is really related to VDAC in 1998.	7612	7689
27941998	HKⅡand VDAC mitochondrial membrane gap prevents the release of binding protein and apoptosis.	7690	7783
27941998	Evidence suggested that activated into factor (ATF2) of cytoplasmic localization is associated with the cell death and stress of disease process.	7784	7929
27941998	Genotoxic stress stimulates nuclear ATF2 to translocate to the cytoplasm.	7930	8003
27941998	ATF2 within the cytoplasm is positioned on the outer membrane of mitochondrial, and then mitochondrial membrane potentially reduced, causing mitochondrial depolarization, which increases the permeability of mitochondria, causing mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis.	8004	8272
27941998	ATF2-Bim-VDAC1 hierarchically regulates apoptosis, ATF2 damages HK-VDAC1 complex, inspires Bim-mediated BAX-VDAC complex formation to increase the permeability and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome C, resulting in induction of apoptosis.	8273	8516
27941998	In mammals, VDAC have three kinds of isoforms: VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3, which VDAC1 is the most abundant and mainly studied.	8517	8640
27941998	In HeLa cells, the amount of VDAC1 is ten times more than VDAC2, 100 times more than VDAC3.	8641	8732
27941998	Desmin is the most important protein in muscle cells intermediate filament cytoskeletal.Whether there is interaction between desmin and VDAC, and when desmin changes, what changes of VDAC function will occur, how mitochondrial happen to change, it is not clear.	8733	8994
27941998	The study adenovirus coated protein gene mutation junction constructs desmin disease animal model, by contrasting immunohistochemical results of desminopathy patient-related diseases and animal models of desminopathy disease, we found that desmin mutation and VDAC1, bax, bcl-2, HKⅡ, ATF2 are closely related, it provided ideas for the study of other neurological protein aggregation diseases, also provides a new approach for drug development.	8995	9439

27941998	Desmin, bax, bcl-2, bcl-xl, ATF2 and HK2were detected in the frozen sections of muscle fibers by using immunofluorescence staining.	22275	22406
27941998	In the abnormal muscle fibers, it showed the diffuse high signal or strong positive expression of desmin aggregationin the muscle fibers (Fig 4 and S4 Fig); sarcolemma, bax positively aggregated in pulp (Fig 4A and S4 Fig); Bcl-2 expressed weaker compare to the normal muscle fibers(Fig 4B and S4 Fig); There was no significant difference of bax expression compare to the normal muscle fibers (Fig 4A and S4 Fig); The signaling of ATF2 aggregated highly in the corresponding muscle fibers of abnormal desmin (Fig 4D and S4 Fig).	22407	22935
27941998	There was no difference of the expression of HK2 between the normal muscle fibers and abnormal ones (Fig 4E and S4 Fig).	22936	23056

27941998	HK2 be distributed evenly in the normal skeletal muscle membrane and cytoplasm (Fig 4E and S4 Fig).	23657	23756
27941998	Desminopathyis hereditary myopathy caused by mutations of desminin the skeletal or cardiac muscle [25, 26].	23757	23864
27941998	In this study, we have successfully constructed desminopathy disease animal model by direct intramuscular transduction with adenovirus coding mutations of the gene desmin, the high stability of the model was validated.	23865	24083
27941998	In frozen sections of skeletal muscle of the desminopathy patients or animal model, we found that desmin and VDAC1 deposition with high signals in muscle fibers, and the related pro-apoptotic proteins (bax, ATF2) also appeared high signal aggregation, and about related anti-apoptotic proteins (bcl-2, bcl-xl, HK2), HK2 in patients and bcl-2 in desminopathy rat model are slightly lower expressed than the normal ones, the other anti-apoptotic proteins are unclear.	24084	24549
27941998	Thus, we propose the following model: (1)gathered desmin caused bax from polymerization channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane, bax and VDAC1 are combined.	24550	24710
27941998	(2) bcl-2 was reduced caused by desmin aggregation, the ratio of bax and bcl-2 is more than 1.	24711	24805
27941998	(3) desmin aggregation caused the increase of ATF2, stimulating the formation of bim-mediated bax-VDAC1 complex, or ATF2 was directly targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential.	24805	25027
27941998	(4) Desmin aggregation inhibited the expression of HK2, reducing the formation of HK2-VDAC complex and increasing bax/bak formed polymerization hole channel in the outer mitochondrial membranes.	25028	25222
27941998	High expression of VDAC1 increased the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, then the pro-apoptotic factors released from the mitochondrial membrane gap to the cytoplasm, eventually leading to apoptosis.	25223	25432
27941998	In the previous study, Pierre Joanne constructed desminopathy model by direct intramuscular transduction with the protein of the mutant desmin coated adeno-associated virus.	25433	25606
27941998	Because adenoviral vector can also be transfected into the dividing or non-dividing cells, the virus titer is high and is easily prepared and purificated, does not integrate into the host cell genome, the current adenovirus has become recognized the most ideal gene vectors.	25607	25881
27941998	In this study, desminopathy model was constructed by direct intramuscular transduction with the adenoviral vector containing mutations of desmin(c.821T> C; L274P).	25882	26045
27941998	We successfully constructed the desminopathy rat model with intramuscular transduction and re-verify the high stability of the model.	26046	26179
27941998	Mitochondrial dysfunction in the progress of the disease has been a highlighted topic.	26180	26266
27941998	Muscle mitochondrial morphology and function showed the abnormal significantly increased Ca2+ levels in mitochondria starts mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.	26267	26431
27941998	Varying amounts of cytochrome C negative (COX-) muscle fibers and not the typical ragged red muscle fibers (RRF) appeared in the muscle biopsy specimens of desminopathy patients.	26432	26610
27941998	The clinical and basic studies have shown that mutations mitochondria abnormality is one of the earliest pathological changes in the abnormal muscle with desmin mutation, not only for structural mitochondrial abnormalities and abnormal position, but also the dysregulation of the energy metabolism and Ca2+.	26611	26918
27941998	Permeability transition (PT) pore were formed by the combination of mitochondrial proteins and cytoplasmic protein comprising: a voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), creatine kinase, adenylate transporter, cyclophilin D etc.	26919	27146
27941998	PT hole was mainly located in the contact sites of the mitochondrial inner membrane and the outer membrane.	27147	27254
27941998	Cytochrome C (CytoC) apoptosis inducing factor (apoptosis inducing factor, AIF), Smac / DIABLO, a variety of apoptotic factors endonuclease G, etc.	27255	27402
27941998	were released into the cytosol when the mitochondrial PT pore is opening and induce apoptosis; VDAC also called mitochondrial porin is an important part of PT holes, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane.	27403	27613
27941998	Further Ca2+, ATP, glutamate, and many other proteins of NADH and VDAC interaction regulate the permeability of the VDAC channel.	27614	27743
27941998	Eukaryotic VDAC have VDAC1, VDAC2, VDAC3 subtype III, respectively, by three distinct genes encoding, which VDAC1 is the most studied subtype currently.	27744	27896
27941998	In this study, patients and desmin Construction disease model, row frozen section of skeletal muscle desmin and VDAC1 double staining detected desmin accumulation in muscle fibers VDAC1 there gathered high signal.	27897	28110
27941998	Tip desmin and muscle disease VDAC1 highly expressed genes are closely related.	28111	28190
27941998	There are many proteins combining with VDAC to regulate the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and apoptosis.	28191	28308
27941998	Bcl-2 family proteins play a key role in the regulation of apoptosis, so far, there are at least 19 kinds of proteins of human bcl-2 family are found.	28309	28459
27941998	This family includes seven kinds of anti-apoptotic proteins:bcl-2, bcl-Xl, Mcl-1, Bcl-B, Bcl-w, A1 / Bfl1; and other pro-apoptotic proteins: Bax, Bak, Bok, bim, Bmf, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bid, Bcl-Xs, BiNP3, Hrk, respectively.	28460	28681
27941998	Bcl-2 and bax of Bcl-2 family proteins in apoptosis are most important [31, 32].	28682	28762
27941998	Bax mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of the package and is shifted to mitochondrial outer membrane to form dimers, trimers, and adenylate transporter combination response to the stimulation of apoptosis signaling, or combines with VDAC directly to induce VDAC open and increases the permeability of mitochondrial membrane, thereby causing induction of apoptosis.	28763	29128
27941998	The major anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is an integral membrane protein of bcl-2 family proteins, mainly anchored in the outer membrane of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic side of the nuclear membrane, and competitive inhibition of bax, thereby inhibiting apoptosis [34, 35].	29129	29419
27941998	The ratio of bax/bcl-2 regulates the apoptosis or inhibition of apoptosis, while bax / bcl-2 is more than 1, the cells tend to apoptosis; when bax / bcl-2 is less than 1, the cell s tend to anti-apoptosis.	29420	29625
27941998	Bcl-xl and bcl-2 are highly homological.The overexpression of bcl-xl will protect the hippocampus and cortex nerve cells against ischemia and hypoxia.	29626	29776
27941998	Under hypoxic-ischemic brain damage condition, bcl-xl gene may also inhibit caspase-3, caspase-9 activity, inhibiting the shift of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) to the nucleus.	29777	29955
27941998	Overexpression of bcl-xl can also protect primary neurons antioxidant sugar deprivation and hypoglycemia stress in rats.	29956	30076
27941998	Studies have shown that bcl-xl plays an important role in the number of mitochondria and its division or integration, and also maintains the stability of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthase effect.	30077	30288
27941998	Recent studies have shown that theBH4 area of bcl-xl, targeting the VDAC1, reduces mitochondrial Ca2+ influx mediated by VDAC1 to inhibit apoptosis.	30289	30437
27941998	Abnormal accumulation of bax appears in skeletal muscle fibers of desminopathy patients and desminopathy the content of baxin type 1 muscle fibers is lower than type 2 muscle fibers; there is no difference of bcl-2 and bcl-xl in muscle fibers withdesmin aggregation of between patients and normal people,.	30438	30743
27941998	Within desminopathy animal models, bcl-2 signal is slightly lower in muscle fibers with desmin aggregation of animal model than normal, while bcl-xl no significant difference compared with normal.	30744	30940
27941998	It suggested that desmin deposition in muscle fibers tends to apoptosis.	30941	31013
27941998	Under normal circumstances, activated into factor 2 (ATF2) can be found in the nucleus and cytoplasm.	31014	31115
27941998	Overexpression of Cytoplasmic ATF2 predicts low malignancy and good prognosis.	31116	31194
27941998	ATF2 aggregation can be observed in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer rafter radiotherapy.	31195	31284
27941998	Overexpression of cytoplasmic ATF2 induced cell death in melanoma, thereby reducing the transcriptional activity of endogenous ATF2.	31285	31417
27941998	Evidence suggested BH3 protein (BH3s), such as Bim, can induce BAX and VDAC restructure in the mitochondrial outer membrane to form the new channels [47, 48].	31418	31576
27941998	Recent studies have found that ATF2, Bim, VDAC1 hierarchically regulate apoptosis, ATF2 damages HK-VDAC1 complex, stimulating Bim-mediated the formation BAX-VDAC complex to increase permeability and the release mitochondrial cytochrome C, and induce death.	31577	31833
27941998	We have found that ATF2 deposited in the skeletal muscle fibers with desmin deposition of desminopathy patients and animal models, which suggests that desmin deposition in muscle fibers and tends to apoptosis.	31834	32043
27941998	HKⅡ-VDAC complexes interfere the conjunction of bcl-xl with VDAC, leading to an increase of free bcl-xl.	32044	32148
27941998	Increased bcl-xl and bax binding inhibits the formation of bax/bak in the outer mitochondrial membrane, inhibiting apoptosis.	32149	32274
27941998	Recent studies showed that mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase inhibitor (mTOR-KI) promotes HKⅡto bind to VDAC binding to shut down the PT hole, while the dissociation of HK2 from the VDAC loss the function of mTOR-KI.	32275	32496
27941998	Our study found that HKⅡslightly weakened within muscle fibers of the desminopathy patients than normal, Indicating that the occurrence of desminopathy is related to the reduction of HKⅡ.	32497	32684
27941998	In this study, there are also some shortcomings.	32685	32733
27941998	First of all, a small sample volume and the lack of large sample statistics.	32734	32810
27941998	Secondly, it is a short time observed in this animal model, discrepancies of proteins in animal models and patients with desminopathy.	32811	32945
27941998	Thirdly, proteins are lack of quantitative comparison in this study observed morphological changes of muscle fibers.	32946	33062
27941998	However, we have successfully constructed desmin disease animal models with the validation of high stability of the model.	33063	33185
27941998	Furtherly, we present the understanding of desmin related myopathies by studying the mitochondrial apoptotic proteins.	33186	33304
27941998	All above, we presented powerful evidences that VDAC1 are correlated with the desminopathies.	33305	33398
27941998	Moreover, apoptosis related protein are also associated with desmin mutation in the patients with desminopathies or rat desminopathies model.	33399	33540
27941998	The deeply mechanism of VDAC1 in the desminopathies need to be furtherly explored, so as to the mitochondrial dysfunction.	33541	33663
26937641	Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a 12.5 kd acute phase protein which is highly conserved among all vertebrate species [1–3].	0	116
26937641	Serum amyloid A has been shown to play a protective role during inflammation.	117	194
26937641	After infection or injury, SAA levels increase up to 1000-fold reaching serum concentrations of up to 80 μM in total.	195	312
26937641	While the majority of SAA is found in association with high density lipoproteins, up to 15% of SAA exists in a lipid-free or lipid-poor form.	313	454
26937641	Human SAA1 and SAA2, and murine SAA1, SAA2 and SAA3 are the main acute phase SAA proteins and predominantly produced by hepatocytes, whereas SAA4 is constitutively expressed.	455	629
26937641	Hepatic acute-phase SAA production is stimulated by LPS and TNFα in a NF-κB dependent manner, and accounts for up to 2.5% of protein produced in inflamed liver in humans and up to 10% in other species.	630	831
26937641	SAA has been suggested to play a role in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease [7–10].	832	987
26937641	Other studies propose functions for SAA in cholesterol transport [2, 3, 11].	988	1064
26937641	Recently, it has been demonstrated that SAA may elicit cytokine and chemokine production, cell migration and upregulation of MMPs [6, 12–15].	1065	1206
26937641	On the molecular level, SAA has been shown to stimulate several proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways including NF-κB, C/EBP, JNK, Erk, Akt and p38 [10, 14–16].	1207	1383
26937641	Its role in liver injury and fibrogenesis is, however, yet ill-defined.	1384	1455
26937641	In this study, we investigate whether SAA may be involved in a potential crosstalk between hepatocytes as its major producing cell type and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).	1456	1626
26937641	HSCs are a pericyte-like cell population in the liver that normally store a large proportion of the body’s vitamin A.	1627	1744
26937641	Following hepatic injury, HSCs undergo an activation process to become the predominant extracellular matrix producing cell population [17, 18].	1745	1888
26937641	Here we demonstrate that SAA levels are strongly elevated in 2 mouse models of hepatic fibrosis, and that SAA elicits inflammation, proliferation and apoptosis in HSCs suggesting SAA as a potential mediator of hepatocyte-HSC crosstalk in the injured liver.	1889	2145
26937641	Primary HSCs were isolated by a 2-step collagenase perfusion from surgical specimens of healthy human livers (n = 3), from livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–450 g, n = 20) or male Balb/c mice (n = 15) followed by Nycodenz (Nycodenz, Oslo, Norway) two-layer discontinuous density gradient centrifugation as described [19–22].	2146	2476
26937641	All tissues were obtained by qualified medical staff, with written donor consent and the approval of the Ethics Committee of Columbia University, according to the Declaration of Helsinki.	2477	2664
26937641	Purity of human, rat and mouse HSC preparations was 88, 94 and 96%, respectively, as assessed by autofluorescence at day 2 after isolation.	2665	2804
26937641	Hepatic stellate cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and standard antibiotics on uncoated plastic tissue culture dishes.	2805	2951
26937641	Culture-activated human HSCs were used between passages 2 to 7.	2952	3015
26937641	Rat and mouse HSCs were not passaged and considered culture-activated between day 7 and 14 after isolation.	3016	3123
26937641	Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from mouse from C57BL/6J wt, IL-1R knockout, TNF-R1 knockout and IL-1R, TNF-R1 double knockout mice by skin excision and culture in DMEM media plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.	3124	3350
26937641	Skin fibroblasts were used between passage 2 and 4.	3351	3402
26937641	TRAF2- and RIP-1-knockout MEFs (a gift from Dr. Michael Karin) have been described previously.	3403	3497
26937641	The animals were sacrificed by a lethal dose of ketamine under anesthesia.	3498	3572
26937641	All animals received humane care and all procedures were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Commitee for Animal Studies in North Rhine-Westphalia (LANUV 84–02.05.20.11.249) and are in accordance with the requirements set by the National Institutes of Health and the German Protection of Animals Act.	3573	3925
26937641	Hepatic fibrosis was induced by injecting Balb/c mice with 0.5 μl CCl4/g body weight intraperitoneally once per week for 8 weeks or by performing bile duct ligation as previously described.	3926	4115
26937641	Human cells were treated with recombinant human SAA (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or recombinant human soluble Fas receptor (sFasR, PeproTech), murine cells were treated with recombinant human SAA or recombinant murine SAA, rmTNFα or rmIL-1β (all R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, as indicated) in the presence or absence of adenoviral GFP or IκBsr, or SP600125 (20 μM) or LY294002 (10 μM) as described above.	4116	4519
26937641	Recombinant human SAA corresponds to the sequence of human SAA 1 isotype except for addition of an N-terminal Met and substitution of Asp for Asn at position 60 and substitution of His to Arg at position 71.	4520	4727
26937641	RNA was extracted by homogenizing tissue or cells in Trizol according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).	4728	4860

26937641	Real time PCR was performed for 40 cycles of 15s at 95°C and 60s at 60°C using an ABI 7000 sequence detection system as described.	5011	5141
26937641	Each sample was measured in duplicate and quantification was performed by comparing the Ct values of each sample to a standard curve.	5142	5275
26937641	Probes and primers for human RANTES, human MCP-1, human IL-8, human MMP9, 18s, mouse SAA1, mouse SAA3 and mouse GAPDH were designed by ABI.	5276	5415
26937641	RANTES, MCP-1, IL-8 and MMP9 levels were normalized to 18s, SAA1 and SAA3 levels were normalized to GAPDH and are expressed as fold induction compared to untreated control.	5416	5588
26937641	PCR products were partly analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel.	5589	5645
26937641	Human HSCs were infected with AdGFP or AdIκBsr at a multiplicity of 500 particles/cell one day before treatment or pretreated with LY294002 (10 μM), SP600125 (20 μM) or DMSO (0.1%) for 30 minutes where indicated followed by treatment with rhSAA (5 μg/ml) for 18h.	5646	5909
26937641	Levels of human IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES were determined by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems) as previously described.	5910	6021
26937641	Protein extracts were run on 10–12% SDS acrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose as previously described [19–21].	6022	6146
26937641	Blots were incubated with anti-caspase-3, anti-PARP, anti-phospho-Erk, anti-phospho(S536)-p65, anti-phospho(S473)-Akt (all Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-IκBα, anti-phospho(S63)-c-Jun (both Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) overnight at 4°C.	6147	6476
26937641	After incubation with secondary horseradish-peroxidase conjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence light method (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to X-omat film (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, CT) or a chemiluminescence imager (Image Station 2000R, Eastman Kodak Co.).	6477	6811
26937641	Blots were reprobed with monoclonal anti-actin (MP Biomedicals) or GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology) to demonstrate equal loading.	6812	6942
26937641	Human HSCs were serum starved for 12h followed by treatment with rhSAA or rhTNFα.	6943	7024
26937641	IKK activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay as previously described [19, 26].	7025	7111
26937641	Briefly, 300 μg protein were immunoprecipitated with 2 μl anti-IKKγ (Santa Cruz) and washed three times.	7112	7216
26937641	The kinase reaction was performed in 25 μl kinase buffer containing 0.5 μCi 32P-labeled ATP, 5 μM ATP and 80 μg/ml substrate (either GST-IκB (1–54), GST-p65 (354–551) or GST-p65 (354–551, 536 A) for 30 minutes at 30°C.	7217	7435
26937641	Plasmids for GST-p65 substrates were a gift from H. Sakurai (Tanabe Seiyaku Co., LTD., Osaka, Japan).	7436	7537
26937641	JNK activity was determined by an in vitro kinase assay as previously described.	7538	7618
26937641	Briefly, 25 μg of whole cell extract were precipitated with GST-c-Jun sepharose beads, washed three times and subjected to a kinase reaction for 30 minutes at 37°C.	7619	7783
26937641	Subsequently the beads were boiled in Laemmli-buffer and run on a 10% SDS-acrylamide gel.	7784	7873
26937641	The gels were stained with Coomassie blue to confirm equal substrate loading, dried, exposed to Kodak Biomax film and/or to a Phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, Ca) for quantification of the bands.	7874	8082
26937641	Human HSCs were infected with an adenovirus containing a NF-κB-driven luciferase using a multiplicity of infection of 250.	8083	8205
26937641	12h later, the supernatant was changed and cells were serum starved for 12h followed by treatment with rhSAA or rhTNFα for 6h.	8206	8332
26937641	Luciferase activity was detected by luminescence (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) on a Fluostar Optima platereader (BMG, Durham, NC) and normalized to protein content as determined by the Bradford method.	8333	8541
26937641	Serum-starved HSCs (0.4×105/well) were incubated with rhSAA or PDGF-BB (Sigma) in the presence or absence of PD.	8542	8654
26937641	16h later, the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [3H]-thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 8h, followed by TCA-precipitation, lysis, and measurement in a scintillation counter.	8655	8829
26937641	Activated rat HSCs were infected with AdIκBsr or AdGFP at 500 moi for 12h followed by serum starvation for 12h and rhSAA (5 μM) or rhTNFα (R&D Systems; 10 ng/ml) treatment for 8h.	8830	9009
26937641	For some experiments, HSCs were co-cultured with FasL-expressing 3T3 fibroblasts or control 3T3 fibroblasts at a HSC to 3T3 ratio of 1:5.	9010	9147
26937641	Primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with rmSAA (5 μM) or rmTNFα (30 ng/ml, R&D Systems) with or without ActD (0,2 μg/ml, Sigma) after 12h of serum starvation.	9148	9309
26937641	Cell death in HSCs or hepatocytes was measured by LDH release into the culture medium according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).	9310	9467
26937641	Caspase 3-cleavage and PARP cleavage were determined by western blot.	9468	9537
26937641	Apoptosis was visualized by fluorescent microscopy of PI- and Annexin V-staining (Roche).	9538	9627
26937641	All data represent the mean of 3 independent experiments ± SD, if not otherwise stated.	9628	9715
26937641	For the determination of statistical significance, unpaired Student’s t-tests were performed using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).	9716	9847
26937641	P values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.	9848	9914
26937641	SAA is secreted by hepatocytes and represents one of the most abundant proteins in the liver during the acute phase response [2, 3].	9915	10047
26937641	To assess whether SAA may influence the fibrogenic response in the liver, we determined its effect on proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways in cultured HSC, which are believed to play an essential role in HSC activation and perpetuation [29, 30].	10048	10300
26937641	First, we measured activation of IKK and JNK, which are upstream activators of the NF-κB and the AP-1 pathways.	10301	10412
26937641	Recombinant human SAA induced a strong activation of IKK as determined by western blot for its target IκBα, which was completely degraded after 15 and 30 minutes of stimulation (Fig 1A).	10413	10599
26937641	Additionally, we observed a strong S536 phosphorylation of p65, a second target of IKK.	10600	10687
26937641	SAA also strongly induced the JNK pathway as determined by western blotting for the phosphorylation of its target c-Jun (Fig 1A).	10688	10817
26937641	These results were confirmed by an in vitro-kinase assay which showed potent activation of IKK towards GST-IκBα and GST-p65 and JNK toward GST-c-Jun with a maximum activation occurring after 15 minutes (Fig 1B).	10818	11029
26937641	To rule out unspecific effects of SAA, e.g. by contaminants, we used human recombinant soluble Fas receptor, sFasR, as control and checked for IκBα degradation.	11030	11190
26937641	In contrast to SAA and to TNFα as positive control, sFasR did not degrade IκBα (Fig 1C).	11191	11279
26937641	Notably, SAA-induced IKK and JNK activation were as potent as TNFα-induced IKK activation (Fig 1A and 1B).	11280	11386
26937641	These results were further confirmed by a reporter gene assay in which human HSCs were infected with an adenovirus containing 3xκB driven luciferase.	11387	11536
26937641	SAA induced a dose-dependent increase in NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity and exceeded the effects of TNFα at a concentration of 10 μM (Fig 1D).	11537	11684
26937641	Next we tested whether this effect also occurred in primary rat HSCs.	11685	11754
26937641	Similar to the results obtained with human HSCs, we observed a potent activation of the JNK and IKK pathways culture-activated rat HSCs (day 4 and day 8), but only a weak activation in quiescent HSCs (day 2) (Fig 1E).	11755	11972
26937641	In activated rat HSCs, SAA-induced NF-κB driven luciferase activity reached or even exceeded levels of those induced by TNFα (Fig 1F).	11973	12107
26937641	To test whether the increased activity of IKK after SAA stimulation resulted in an increased transcription of NF-κB dependent genes in HSCs, we measured the secretion of the NF-κB-dependent chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES by ELISA.	12108	12341
26937641	Recombinant human SAA strongly induced the secretion of all three chemokines (Fig 2A).	12342	12428
26937641	To address the question whether the IKK and JNK pathways are responsible for driving the induction of these chemokines, we pretreated HSCs with pharmacological inhibitors of JNK and Akt, or infected them adenovirus expressing IκBsr, a potent inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway.	12429	12702
26937641	Whereas inhibition of NFκB and JNK resulted in a complete or partial inhibition of chemokine secretion, respectively, we did not observe a significant inhibition of chemokine secretion with the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig 2A).	12703	12937
26937641	Thus JNK and NF-κB, but not PI-3kinase/Akt are signaling pathways that mediate the upregulation of IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES in human HSCs in response to SAA.	12938	13093
26937641	Next we investigated whether NF-κB and JNK inhibition also reduce chemokine production at the mRNA level.	13094	13199
26937641	Real time PCR measurements showed that IκBsr almost completely reduced the SAA-induced secretion of all 3 chemokines, whereas the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced chemokine secretion 50 to 80% (Fig 2B).	13200	13400
26937641	Additionally, we also investigated whether SAA upregulated the levels MMP9 and MMP13, two crucial regulators of extracellular matrix and inflammation in the liver [31, 32].	13401	13573
26937641	Whereas we did not find detectable levels of MMP13 in the presence or absence of SAA (data not shown), we detected a strong induction of MMP9 after SAA treatment, which was blocked after incubation with either SP600125 or infection with AdIκBsr (Fig 2C, upper panel).	13574	13841
26937641	The induction of MMP9 by SAA was confirmed by zymography which showed an increased MMP9 activity after SAA or TNFα (Fig 2C panel), yet to a much lower extent than the induction found at the mRNA level.	13842	14043
26937641	Next we determined whether SAA activated Erk and Akt in HSCs as previously reported in other cell types.	14044	14148
26937641	Both Akt and Erk have been implicated in HSC proliferation [33, 34].	14149	14217
26937641	Erk phosphorylation was strongly activated by SAA with a maximum between 5 and 30 minutes after stimulation, and inhibited by MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig 3A).	14218	14375
26937641	We observed a strong activation of Akt after SAA as apparent by S473 phosphorylation already after 5 minutes of stimulation which lasted for up to two hours (Fig 3B).	14376	14542
26937641	SAA-induced Akt S473 phosphorylation was completely blocked by the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 demonstrating that SAA-induced Akt activation is mediated by its upstream activator PI-3 kinase.	14543	14737
26937641	To determine whether activation of Akt and Erk in response to SAA had any effect on HSC proliferation, we investigated SAA-induced [3H]-thymidine uptake in the presence or absence of PI-3 kinase and MEK inhibitors.	14738	14952
26937641	SAA-induced a strong induction of [3H]-thymidine uptake which was almost 60% of that induced by 5 nM PDGF (Fig 3C).	14953	15068
26937641	Pharmacological inhibition of PI-3 kinase and MEK as well as of JNK completely blocked SAA-induced [3H]-thymidine uptake suggesting that activation of these pathways is responsible for the proliferative effects of SAA (Fig 3C).	15069	15296
26937641	Many of the signaling pathways induced by SAA resembled those activated by TNF.	15297	15376
26937641	Therefore, we next investigated whether SAA induces apoptosis in HSCs.	15377	15447
26937641	Since human HSCs are highly resistant to TNFα-induced cell death, we investigated SAA-induced cell death in primary unpassaged rat HSCs which are susceptible to TNFα-induced apoptosis after NF-κB inhibition.	15448	15655
26937641	As expected, we did not detect an increase in cell death in primary HSCs that were treated by SAA alone.	15656	15760
26937641	However, when NF-κB activation was blocked by IκBsr in primary rat HSCs, we observed almost 50% cell death after 24h of SAA treatment (Fig 4A).	15761	15904
26937641	To determine whether cell death was apoptotic, we checked for the presence of cleaved caspase 3 and the 89kd PARP cleavage fragment, two hallmarks of apoptosis.	15905	16065
26937641	After 8h of SAA treatment, we detected the occurrence of caspase-3 cleavage products at 17kd and 19kd as well as the 89kd PARP cleavage product (Fig 4B).	16066	16219
26937641	To confirm these results, we stained HSC with AnnexinV and propidium iodide.	16220	16296
26937641	After 8h of SAA, the majority of IκBsr-expressing cells were AnnexinV-positive indicating the onset of apoptotic cell death (Fig 4C).	16297	16430
26937641	Interestingly, SAA treatment alone or after inhibition of NFκB activation by ActD did not cause cell death in primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig 4D), indicating a possible selective induction of cell death in HSCs and hepatocytes by SAA during hepatic injury and fibrogenesis.	16431	16703
26937641	However, SAA treatment of hepatocytes also led to potent phosphorylation of Erk, and c-Jun and to a lesser extent of Akt and p65 (Fig 4E).	16704	16842
26937641	SAA signaling is not well defined and several receptors including formyl peptide receptor like 1 (FPRL1) and SR-BI have been proposed as receptors for SAA.	16843	16998
26937641	We did not see any effects on SAA-induced JNK activation when we blocked FPRL1 signaling by pertussis toxin or SR-BI by a blocking antibody (Fig 5A).	16999	17148
26937641	Our previous observation showed that SAA activated pathways that are induced in similar manner by TNFα, and to some extent by LPS and IL-1β (Figs 1–4).	17149	17300
26937641	To investigate whether SAA-induced signals may be due to minute contamination with LPS, we first investigated SAA-induced p65 phosphorylation in TLR4-deficient fibroblasts.	17301	17473
26937641	LPS did not induce p65 phosphorylation in these cells whereas TNFα and SAA induced p65 phosphorylation effectively excluding that SAA-mediated effects were due to LPS contamination (Fig 5B).	17474	17664
26937641	To exclude involvement of TNF-R1 and IL-1R, we treated fibroblasts deficient in TNF-R1 and/or IL-1R with SAA.	17665	17774
26937641	Whereas TNFα and IL-1β signaling was completely abolished in these cells, SAA-induced c-Jun phosphorylation as well as UV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation (serving as positive control) was present demonstrating that TNF-R1 and IL-1R are not involved in the SAA pathway (Fig 5C).	17775	18050
26937641	Similarly, we found an induction of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in IL-1R- and/or TNFR1-deficient cells.	18051	18152
26937641	To explore whether SAA-induced pathways are similar to the TNF pathway downstream of the TNF receptor at the level of adapter molecules, we treated RIP1- and TRAF2-deficient MEFs with SAA, TNFα and IL-1β.	18153	18357
26937641	Whereas TNFα signaling was completely blocked in RIP1- and TRAF2-deficient cells, SAA and IL-1β induced a strong activation of the JNK pathway (Fig 5D).	18358	18510
26937641	In conclusion, our results demonstrate that SAA signals through an unknown receptor in fibroblasts and this pathway is independent of TLR4, IL-1R, TNFR1, TRAF2 and RIP1, and not sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin.	18511	18732
26937641	To determine whether SAA levels are increased during hepatic fibrogenesis and may thus influence HSCs in vivo, we measured SAA mRNA levels in 2 models of hepatic fibrogenesis by quantitative real time PCR.	18733	18938
26937641	While SAA1 is the main acute phase SAA produced by hepatocytes, SAA3 is predominantly produced by macrophages during the acute phase response.	18939	19081
26937641	The levels of SAA1 and SAA3 mRNA were induced 28-fold and 8-fold, respectively, in mice after 8 injections of CCl4 (Fig 6A).	19082	19206
26937641	In mice that underwent bile duct ligation to induce fibrogenesis, we measured a 55-fold and 2-fold increase in SAA1 and SAA3 mRNA three days after bile duct ligation, respectively (Fig 6A).	19207	19396
26937641	Five days after bile duct ligation, SAA1 and SAA3 mRNA were increased 23-fold and 19-fold, respectively.	19397	19501
26937641	Three weeks after bile duct ligation the mRNA levels of SAA1 and SAA3 still remained elevated, but were significantly lower than at day 5.	19502	19640
26937641	In freshly isolated quiescent HSCs, we found only low levels of SAA1 mRNA in quiescent HSCs, which were 76000 times lower than those of hepatocytes and attributable to the small degree of hepatocyte contamination (data not shown).	19641	19871
26937641	After 5 days of culture-activation, the levels of SAA1 became undetectable in HSCs consistent with the disappearance of hepatocyte contamination in culture (Fig 6b, left panel).	19872	20049
26937641	In contrast, the levels of SAA3 were markedly upregulated during HSC culture-activation (Fig 6b, right panel).	20050	20160
26937641	Thus, HSCs are likely to be a target of SAA1 and a source of SAA3 in the liver.	20161	20240
26937641	Although SAA is one of the most abundantly expressed hepatic proteins during infection and inflammatory conditions, its functions remain incompletely understood.	20241	20402
26937641	The present study provides evidence that SAA modulates fibrogenic responses in the liver by inducing proliferation and inflammation in HSCs under some conditions and by promoting HSC cell death under other conditions.	20403	20620
26937641	Previous studies have reported that SAA exerts cytokine-like properties in many cell types.	20621	20712
26937641	Consistent with these observations, we detected the activation of a large number of proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in HSCs and hepatocytes.	20713	20875
26937641	Surprisingly, the effects of SAA on mouse and human HSCs on pathways such as NF-κB and JNK were as strong as those exerted by TNFα and IL-1β, one of the most potent proinflammatory cytokines in HSCs and other cell types [19, 25].	20876	21105
26937641	Stimulation with SAA led to a dramatic increase in the production of chemokines such as IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES.	21106	21217
26937641	To exclude that signals mediated by SAA were due to a contamination with LPS or by TLR-agonistic activity of SAA as suggested by recent publications [37–39], we investigated proinflammatory signaling pathways in cells from TLR4-mutant mice.	21218	21458
26937641	We found no difference between TLR4 wild-type and TLR4-mutant cells effectively excluding LPS as a contaminating agonist.	21459	21580
26937641	Additionally, we investigated whether SAA might directly or indirectly activate receptors for TNFα or IL-1β.	21581	21689
26937641	Again, there was no significant inhibition of SAA signals in cells deficient for TNFR1, IL-1 receptor or both receptors.	21690	21810
26937641	Previous reports have suggested several receptors to mediate SAA effects, among these FLRP-1 and SR-BI [11, 14].	21811	21923
26937641	However, we could not find a role for these receptors in mediating proinflammatory effects of SAA in primary HSCs.	21924	22038
26937641	Inflammation is tightly associated with hepatic fibrogenesis and considered a key event that promotes the activation of HSCs [29, 40, 41].	22039	22177
26937641	Increased production of chemokines by HSCs allows HSCs to recruit cell populations such as Kupffer cells whose presence is required for HSCs to fully activate [42, 43].	22178	22346
26937641	Moreover, secretion of chemokines is thought to exert autocrine and paracrine effects on HSCs further leading to activation and to the recruitment of additional HSCs to the site of injury [45, 46].	22347	22544
26937641	Thus, SAA-mediated chemokine secretion in activated HSCs is likely to contribute to fibrogenesis and may represent a novel link between hepatocytes and HSCs in the injured liver.	22545	22723
26937641	Induction of HSC proliferation represents a second mechanism by which SAA may enhance fibrogenesis in the liver.	22724	22836
26937641	Following activation, HSCs become highly proliferative and thus expand to a pool of activated HSCs to enhance fibrogenic responses.	22837	22968
26937641	Accordingly, blockade of PDGF, the most potent mitogen for HSCs, significantly reduces hepatic fibrogenesis.	22969	23077
26937641	We found that the pro-proliferative effects of SAA were weaker than those exerted by PDGF, yet stronger than those reported other agonists including insulin, leptin and chemokines such as MCP-1 and RANTES [25, 45, 47, 48].	23078	23300
26937641	Our results are similar to studies that show SAA-induced proliferation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes, and suggest that SAA may exert similar functions in chronic inflammatory conditions of different organs.	23301	23515
26937641	Blockade of SAA-induced signaling pathways revealed specific functions in regards to proliferation and inflammation.	23516	23632
26937641	While NF-κB and JNK activation were required for SAA-mediated proinflammatory gene expression and MMP9 expression, JNK, Akt and Erk were essential for SAA-induced proliferation.	23633	23810
26937641	Blocking NF-κB was more efficient in reducing chemokine expession than blocking JNK.	23811	23895
26937641	These findings are similar to previous results in TNFα- and IL-1β induced chemokine regulation in HSCs suggesting that NF-κB plays a more prominent role in regulating these genes than the JNK/AP-1 pathway [25, 49].	23896	24110
26937641	Previous studies have demonstrated that both Erk and Akt are required for HSC proliferation.	24111	24203
26937641	Thus, our study provides evidence that SAA utilizes well-characterized pathways to induce inflammatory gene expression and proliferation in HSCs.	24204	24349
26937641	Amyloids are believed to be responsible for organ damage in diseases such as systemic amyloidosis and Alzheimer’s disease.	24350	24472
26937641	Not only has SAA been shown to induce lysis of bacterial cells by forming ion-channels in lipid bilayer membranes, but has been reported to prevent cell death in eukaryotic cells [51, 52].	24473	24661
26937641	One study reported induction of nuclear changes consistent with apoptotic cell death after SAA treatment, but this study did not specify the type of SAA that was used for cell death induction nor did it provide quantification of cell death.	24662	24902
26937641	Here we show for the first time that NF-κB can act as a switch between SAA-induced cell death and proliferation.	24903	25015
26937641	Similar to TNFα, SAA induced cell death in HSCs only in the absence of NF-κB activity.	25016	25102
26937641	Thus, it seems that the anti-apoptotic effects of NF-κB regulated genes override proapopototic signals after SAA stimulation.	25103	25228
26937641	SAA-mediated cell death was apoptotic as demonstrated by the appearance of caspase 3- and PARP-cleavage products and Annexin V membrane staining.	25229	25374
26937641	This novel function of SAA suggests that in a fashion similar to TNF, SAA may act as double-edged sword in chronic inflammatory states: Induction of inflammation under most conditions, but induction of cell death when NF-κB dependent genes cannot be transcribed.	25375	25637
26937641	In view of the abundance of SAA in the injured liver and its upregulation not only during liver injury but many other infectious and inflammatory conditions, it is unlikely that SAA is a primary stimulator of HSC activation and inflammation.	25638	25879
26937641	This notion is further supported by our finding that SAA did not induce IκBα degradation in quiescent (day 2) HSCs and only weak phosphorylation of the JNK target c-Jun.	25880	26049
26937641	We therefore suggest that SAA modulates inflammatory and proliferative response in HSCs after they have initiated the activation process.	26050	26187
26937641	SAA plays a similar role in other chronic inflammatory conditions and stimulates wound healing response in atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis [7, 8].	26188	26343
26937641	While SAA is likely to promote HSC activation under many circumstances, the induction of cell death after inhibition of NF-κB suggest that SAA can also exert opposite effects.	26344	26519
26937641	When the underlying liver disease is eradicated and liver injury ceases, activated HSCs are either eliminated by induction of cell death or by deactivation [54–57].	26520	26684
26937641	Recently, it has been shown that inhibition of NF-κB activation during hepatic fibrogenesis is associated with an increase in HSC cell death and accelerates recovery from experimental liver fibrosis.	26685	26884
26937641	It is conceivable that SAA may contribute to the increased rate of HSC apoptosis in mice treated with NF-κB inhibitors such as sulfasalazine.	26885	27026
26937641	Moreover, hepatocytes were not effectively killed by SAA even after NF-κB inhibition, suggesting that abundant SAA production during liver injury and fibrogenesis may contribute to a controlled clearance of activated HSCs thus leading to containment of an excessive wound healing response.	27027	27316
26937641	In conclusion, our study suggests that SAA represents a novel cytokine-like molecule that may mediate a crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs in the injured liver.	27317	27481
26937641	Future studies need to define its receptor target and to confirm the potential pro- and antifibrogenic effects of SAA during liver fibrosis induction and resolution for potential therapeutic exploitation.	27482	27686
25946186	Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related mortality.	0	122
25946186	There are approximately 1000,000 new lung cancer cases and more than 800,000 estimated deaths every year in the world.	123	241
25946186	Despite recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, the 5-year overall survival rate of lung cancer patients is still less than 15%.	242	388
25946186	Therefore, it is an urgent need to reveal the molecular mechanism of lung cancer and find novel candidate biomarkers with potential clinical value, which will facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.	389	638
25946186	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced protein 8-like 2 (TNFAIP8L2), also known as TIPE2, is a member of the TNFAIP8 family and a newly described negative regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity.	639	844
25946186	It prevents hyper-responsiveness and maintains immune homeostasis via suppressing TLR and TCR function, and its deficiency in mice leads to multi-organ inflammation.	845	1010
25946186	Moreover, in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and hepatitis, TIPE2 expression is also down-regulated and inversely correlates with disease progression.	1011	1210
25946186	However, different from murine TIPE2, which is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, human TIPE2 is also expressed in a wide variety of non-hematopoietic cell types.	1211	1387
25946186	Human TIPE2 shares approximately 53% identity and 78% similarity amino acid sequence with TNFAIP8, and about 94% homologous with murine TIPE2.	1388	1530
25946186	Initial studies showed that other members of TIPE family such as TNFAIP8 and TIPE1 play roles in carcinogenesis in most human cancers [9–11].	1531	1672
25946186	The high-resolution crystal structure of TIPE2 reveals that it contains a large hydrophobic central cavity, which appears to be a DED-like domain differs from caspase-8 or cFLIP.	1673	1851
25946186	Murine TIPE2 inhibits MAPKs and NFκB signaling pathways which promote Fas-induced apoptosis.	1852	1944
25946186	Additionally, overexpression of TIPE2 in mice results in cell death and significantly inhibits Ras-induced tumorigenesis.	1945	2066
25946186	However, TIPE2 is not detectable or poorly expressed in most human carcinoma cell lines.	2067	2155
25946186	These results suggest that in addition to inflammation, TIPE2 may also be involved in cancer development.	2156	2261
25946186	Increasing studies have been focused on TIPE2 and human cancers in recent years.	2262	2342
25946186	TIPE2 suppresses TLR4-mediated development of colon cancer by inhibiting caspase-8 activity, while its expression is positively correlated with TNM staging in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients.	2343	2538
25946186	Recently, TIPE2 is proved to be an endogenous inhibitor of Rac1 in liver by which it suppressed invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).	2539	2693
25946186	However, the role of TIPE2 in lung cancer is unclear.	2694	2747
25946186	In present study, we provide evidences firstly indicate that TIPE2 suppresses the growth and promotes apoptosis of lung cancer through regulating the Bcl-2/Bax balance and then leads to the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 possibly via affecting P38 and Akt pathway.	2748	3019
25946186	The study was approval by the Institutional Research Ethics Committees of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.	3020	3206

25946186	All animal procedures in this study were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of Xiamen University.	3299	3417
25946186	The paraffin-embedded lung cancer specimens were used for immunohistochemical analysis.	3418	3505
25946186	The paraffin-embedded lung cancer specimens consisted of 25 lung squamous cancer specimens, 20 lung adenocarcinoma specimens, 15 small lung cancer specimens and 30 adjacent non-tumor lung specimens.	3506	3704
25946186	All the patients recruited in this study received neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy before the surgery.	3705	3812
25946186	The human NCI-H446 cell lines were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Shanghai, China).	3813	3921
25946186	The H446 cell was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin.	3922	4068
25946186	Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.	4069	4138
25946186	Full-length human TIPE2 gene was generated from the cDNA clone by PCR and then cloned into the pRK5 vector by standard molecular techniques and verified by sequencing.	4139	4306
25946186	Transfection of tumor cells with vector was performed using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.	4307	4449
25946186	To generate stable transfected cell lines, transfected cells were selected in RPMI 1640 medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 for two weeks to isolate the formed colonies for further expansion.	4450	4638
25946186	At the end of the transfection, TIPE2 expression was verified by Western Blotting.	4639	4721
25946186	Paraffin-embedded specimens (4 μm) were used for analysis as the standard immunohistochemical technique.	4722	4826
25946186	Briefly, sections were incubated with anti-TIPE2 antibody (Abnova) overnight at 4°C.	4827	4911
25946186	Secondary staining was performed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody using a Max Vision kit.	4912	5007
25946186	Immunoreactivity was visualized using a DAB Peroxidase Substrate kit (Maixin Co, Fuzhou, China) and counterstained with hematoxylin.	5008	5140
25946186	In negative controls, primary antibodies were replaced by PBS.	5141	5203
25946186	All IHC staining was independently evaluated by two experienced pathologists in an effort to provide a consensus on staining patterns according to a scoring method, as described previously.	5204	5393
25946186	At least 10 high-power fields, selected randomly, and >1000 cells were counted for each specimen.	5394	5491
25946186	Each case was scored according to the intensity and area of staining.	5492	5561
25946186	The intensity of staining was graded on the following scales: 0, no staining; 1+, mild staining; 2+, moderate staining; 3+, intense staining.	5562	5703
25946186	The area of staining was evaluated as follows: 0, no staining of cells in any microscopic fields; 1+, <30% of tissue stained positive; 2+, 30–60% stained positive; 3+, >60% stained positive.	5704	5894
25946186	A combined staining score (intensity + extension) of between 0 and 3 was considered to be low expression, whereas a score between 4 and 6 was considered to be high expression.	5895	6070
25946186	Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer with proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and PMSF (Sigma).	6071	6178
25946186	Then 30 μg lysates from each sample was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes.	6179	6279
25946186	Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and probed overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: anti-TIPE2 (dilution, 1:800; Abnova), anti-caspase-3 p17 (dilution, 1:400; Santa Cruz), anti-caspase-9 (dilution, 1:400; Santa Cruz), anti-Bcl-2 (dilution, 1:200; Santa Cruz), anti-Bax (dilution, 1:1000; Santa Cruz), anti-ERK (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-phospho-ERK (dilution, 1:1000; R&D), anti-P38 (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-phospho-P38 (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-Akt (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-phospho-Akt (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-IκBα (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-phospho-IκBα (dilution, 1:1000; CST), and anti-β-actin antibody (dilution, 1:4000; Abcam), then followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti rabbit or mouse IgG, 1:5000; Santa Cruz) for 1 hour at room temperature.	6280	7117
25946186	After washing, the blots were developed using ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and quantitated by densitometry using ImageQuant image analysis system (Storm Optical Scanner).	7118	7297
25946186	All the experiments were performed independently three times at least.	7298	7368
25946186	Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 500 cells per well, and replaced the medium every 3 days.	7369	7479
25946186	Two weeks later, cells were washed by PBS, and fixed with methanol for 15 minutes, then stained with crystal violet.	7480	7596
25946186	Colonies which consisted of more than 50 cells were counted and calculated as a percentage of that of the control group.	7597	7717
25946186	The experiment was performed independently three times at least.	7718	7782
25946186	Cell viability was detected by MTT assay.	7783	7824
25946186	A total of 3000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates with three triplicate wells.	7825	7914
25946186	After incubation for 24 hours, 10 μl MTT (500 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium and cultured for another 4 hours.	7915	8040
25946186	Then the medium was discarded and 150 μl dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to dissolve the formation product.	8041	8161
25946186	At last, the absorbance of each well was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm.	8162	8238
25946186	Each assay was repeated three times at least.	8239	8284
25946186	The effect of TIPE2 on cell apoptosis was determined by FITC Annexin V staining followed by flow cytometric analysis.	8285	8402
25946186	Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 1× binding buffer (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml.	8403	8534
25946186	100 μl of the solution was transferred to a 5 ml culture tube, then 5 μl FITC Annexin V (BD Biosciences) and 10 μl PI (BD Biosciences) were added into the tube.	8535	8695
25946186	After that, the cells were mixed gently and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.	8696	8797
25946186	Finally, 1 ml PBS was added to each tube and samples were analyzed by flow cytometric within 1 hour.	8798	8898
25946186	All experiments were repeated in triplicate.	8899	8943
25946186	Six week old male BALB/c nude mice were purchased from Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China) and maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions.	8944	9096
25946186	5 × 106 H446 cells transfected with TIPE2 over-expressing vector (TIPE2 group) in 100 μl of PBS were injected subcutaneously into right flank while control vector (control group) into left flank of the nude mice, 10 nude mice were used in this experiment.	9097	9352
25946186	Tumor size was measured every two days and the tumor volume was calculated according to the following formula: length × width × width × 0.5.	9353	9493
25946186	About six weeks later, all the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, then the tumors were removed, weighed, and fixed in formalin for the subsequent analysis.	9494	9660
25946186	All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 13.0 software.	9661	9728
25946186	The χ2 test was used for analysis of TIPE2 expression between lung cancer subtypes and adjacent non-tumor tissues.	9729	9843
25946186	The student’s t-test was used for comparison among different groups.	9844	9912
25946186	The differences in tumor growth and weight between two groups of nude mice were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance.	9913	10045
25946186	P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.	10046	10096
25946186	Recent studies already revealed that TIPE2 expression were significantly correlated with some cancers such as RCC and HCC.	10097	10219
25946186	However, the TIPE2 expression pattern in lung cancer is unclear so far.	10220	10291
25946186	To assess the relationship of TIPE2 expression and lung cancer tissues, we detected the expression status of TIPE2 in common histological types of lung cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry, including 25 lung adenocarcinoma tissues, 20 lung squamous carcinoma tissues, 15 small cell lung cancer tissues and 30 adjacent non-tumor lung tissues.	10292	10635
25946186	As shown in (Fig 1A and 1B), in non-tumor lung tissues, TIPE2 strong staining was observed in lung epithelial alveolar cells and bronchial cells.	10636	10781
25946186	And in bronchial epithelials with squamous metaplasia, TIPE2 still had strong staining (Fig 1C).	10782	10878
25946186	In lung cancer tissues, TIPE2 showed strong staining in primary lung adenocarcinoma and lymph node metastasis tissue (Fig 1D, 1E and 1F), but exhibited very weak staining in lung squamous cancer and even almost no staining in most of small cell lung cancer (Fig 1G, 1H and 1I).	10879	11156
25946186	Interestingly, (Fig 1H) showed very weak TIPE2 expression in the nests of lung squamous cancer cells (red arrows) and strong staining of TIPE2 in the adjacent bronchial epithelials simultaneously.	11157	11353
25946186	In lung cancer stroma, no stain of TIPE2 was found in fibroblasts cells, but strong staining could be found in inflammatory cells such as plasmocytes and macrophagocytes.	11354	11524
25946186	In positive cancer cells, TIPE2 staining was predominantly found in the cytoplasm but seldom in nuclear.	11525	11629
25946186	Statistical analysis (Table 1) indicated TIPE2 expression was significantly down-regulated in lung squamous cancer and small cell lung cancer tissues compared to the non-tumor lung tissues, while no difference between lung adenocarcinoma and non-tumor lung tissues.	11630	11895
25946186	The results demonstrated that TIPE2 was down-regulated in some histological subtypes of lung cancer, which encouraged us to further inquire into the specific role and underlying mechanism of TIPE2 in lung cancer development.	11896	12120
25946186	To investigate the potential biological function of TIPE2 in lung cancer, we examined the effects of TIPE2 on cell growth of lung cancer cell H446 by MTT assay and colony formation assay, and apoptosis by flow cytometric.	12121	12342
25946186	To up-regulate TIPE2 expression in H446, TIPE2 over-expressing vector was constructed and transfected stably in H446 cells.	12343	12466
25946186	Western blotting validated the TIPE2 expression in H446 cells untransfected (H446/Null), control vector-transfected (H446/Control) and TIPE2 over-expressing vector transfected (H446/TIPE2).	12467	12656
25946186	As shown in (Fig 2A), H446/Null and H446/Control showed almost no TIPE2 expression, while H446/TIPE2 revealed high level of TIPE2 expression.	12657	12798
25946186	MTT assay (Fig 2B) and colony formation assay (Fig 2C) analysis showed reduction of cell viability and fewer colonies observed in H446/TIPE2 respectively, compared with H446/Control and H446/Null cells, which indicated TIPE2 could inhibit lung cancer cell growth.	12799	13062
25946186	Cancer cell growth is affected by two main factors including proliferation and apoptosis.	13063	13152
25946186	It was reported that murine TIPE2 could promote Fas-induced apoptosis.	13153	13223
25946186	Has TIPE2 potential role on apoptosis of lung cancer?	13224	13277
25946186	Therefore, we applied flow cytometric to reveal effect of TIPE2 on apoptosis of H446.	13278	13363
25946186	As shown in (Fig 2D), the early apoptosis rate of H446/TIPE2, H446/Control and H446/Null was 21.08%, 9.21% and 9.15% respectively, which showed over-expressing TIPE2 could significantly increase the apoptosis rate.	13364	13578
25946186	These results suggested TIPE2 can effectively suppress the growth and promote the apoptosis of H446 cells in vitro.	13579	13694
25946186	The results above-mentioned showed TIPE2 could promote apoptosis of H446 cells.	13695	13774
25946186	Then, we were further interested in the underlying mechanism of it.	13775	13842
25946186	It has been well known that Bcl-2/Bax balance plays an important role in cell apoptosis, so we investigated the effect of TIPE2 expression on Bcl-2/Bax balance.	13843	14003
25946186	As shown in Fig 3, over-expressing TIPE2 could increase the Bax expression while decrease the Bcl-2 expression, which implied that the function of TIPE2 on cell apoptosis may be associated with Bcl-2/Bax balance.	14004	14216
25946186	Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that caspase plays a critical role in executing the final pathway of apoptosis.	14217	14334
25946186	We further investigated whether TIPE2 would affected the activation of apoptotic molecular caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-9.	14335	14467
25946186	Therefore, we detected the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 in H446/Null, H446/Control and H446/TIPE2.	14468	14583
25946186	As shown in Fig 3, TIPE2 enhanced the cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression levels, which suggested TIPE2 could promote the activation of caspase-3 and capase-9.	14584	14750
25946186	We also explored the effect of TIPE2 on several signaling pathways by analyzing key signaling molecules involved.	14751	14864
25946186	We found that P38 and Akt pathway, but not ERK pathway and NF-κB pathway, were targets of TIPE2 action.	14865	14968
25946186	High level expression of phosphorylated P38 MAPK was detected in H446 cells over-expressing TIPE2, while relatively low level expression in null and control cells (Fig 4), which indicated that TIPE2 may activate P38 MAPK pathway.	14969	15198
25946186	However, the level of phosphorylated Akt was significantly decreased in H446 cells over-expressing TIPE2 compared to null and control cells (Fig 4).	15199	15347
25946186	In addition, we also examined the expression of other signal molecules such as phospho-ERK, phospho-MEK, and phospho-IκBα in H446/Null, H446/Control and H446/TIPE2, among which little or no difference was noted (Fig 4).	15348	15567
25946186	Taken together, these data indicated that TIPE2 could regulate P38 and Akt pathway, in which TIPE2 was a positive regulator of P38 pathway while negative regulator of Akt pathway.	15568	15747
25946186	The above-mentioned results showed TIPE2 could effectively suppress the growth and promote the apoptosis of H446 cells in vitro.	15748	15876
25946186	Next, we investigated its effect on tumorigenesis in vivo. H446 cells transfected with control vector or TIPE2-expressing vector were injected subcutaneously into nude mice to initiate tumor formation.	15877	16078
25946186	From the curve of tumor growth (Fig 5B), the tumor volume of TIPE2-expression groups were significantly decreased compare to the vector groups.	16079	16222
25946186	About six weeks later, all groups of nude mice were sacrificed and the tumors were isolated and weighted (Fig 5A).	16223	16337
25946186	The overall mean tumor size of TIPE2-expression groups was significantly smaller than that of the vector groups, which was consistent with the tumor weights (Fig 5C).	16338	16504
25946186	All these results demonstrated that overexpression of TIPE2 could inhibit the subcutaneous tumor growth in vivo obviously.	16505	16627
25946186	As above-mentioned, over-expression of TIPE2 had significant impacts on the expression of some apoptotic molecules in H446 cells in vitro, such as Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9.	16628	16811
25946186	So, it is necessary to elucidate the effect of TIPE2 on these molecules expression in the tumors from nude mice in vivo.	16812	16932
25946186	The tumors from nude mice were isolated, fixed, embedded and made into sections, which were then stained by immunohistochemistrical analysis.	16933	17074
25946186	Results showed overexpression of TIPE2 while a increased expression of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 and a reduced expression of Bcl-2 in TIPE2-overexpression tumors (Fig 6), which were similar to the results in vitro.	17075	17292
25946186	We also detected the expression of Ki-67, a proliferation marker, in above tumors.	17293	17375
25946186	No alteration on Ki-67 expression was detected regardless of TIPE2 over-expression (Fig 6), by which we speculated that TIPE2 inhibits tumor growth mainly attributing to its function of promoting apoptosis of H446 cells, but not via affecting proliferation.	17376	17633
25946186	TIPE2 belongs to TIPE (TNFAIP8) family, which is a recently identified group of proteins including four members, TNFAIP8, TIPE1, TIPE2 and TIPE3.	17634	17779
25946186	TNFAIP8 is associated with enhanced cell survival and inhibition of apoptosis.	17780	17858
25946186	Knocking down the expression of TNFAIP8 in tumor cells can reduce their tumorigenicity.	17859	17946
25946186	All these evidences support that TIPE is an oncogene and it may be linked with the cell survival and malignant growth-related signaling pathways.	17947	18092
25946186	High level of TIPE1 mRNA is detected in most human carcinoma cell lines, which suggests that it may play a role in carcinogenesis.	18093	18223
25946186	Unlike TNFAIP8 and TIPE1, TIPE2 was mainly found played a vital role in immunity.	18224	18305
25946186	As reported, TIPE2 was a novel gene which maintains immune homeostasis and negatively regulates innate and adaptive immunity.	18306	18431
25946186	However, information about TIPE2 in human cancer is limited.	18432	18492
25946186	A few studies on the relationship of TIPE2 with cancer already verified TIPE2 had some function in cancer development.	18493	18611
25946186	In recent research, TIPE2 was thought as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma.	18612	18700
25946186	However, the relationship between TIPE2 and lung cancer is unknown so far.	18701	18775
25946186	In our present study, we demonstrated the state of TIPE2 expression in lung cancer.	18776	18859
25946186	We found that TIPE2 expression was down-regulated in lung squamous carcinoma and even almost lost in small cell lung cancer.	18860	18984
25946186	However, in lung adenocarcinoma, TIPE2 strong expression was found, but no difference between non-tumor lung tissues and lung adenocarcinoma was analyzed.	18985	19139
25946186	These results showed TIPE2 expression patterns might be different among different histologic subtypes of lung cancer, which suggested TIPE2 might play some different biological roles in different histologic types of lung cancer.	19140	19368
25946186	To find out TIPE2 expression in all kinds of lung cancer, increaseing the numbers of lung cancer samples in the future study may be necessary.	19369	19511
25946186	Furthermore, this study preliminarily interpreted the biological function of TIPE2 in lung cancer.	19512	19610
25946186	Over-expressing TIPE2 promoted apoptosis of H446 cells in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. At the molecular level, TIPE2 regulated Bcl-2/Bax balance and activated caspase-3 and caspase-9.	19611	19807
25946186	Interested in looking into the specific signal molecules possibly regulated by TIPE2, we then screened the expression of some common signaling molecules after TIPE2 over-expression.	19808	19989
25946186	High level expression of phosphorylated P38 MAPK was detected after TIPE2 up-regulation.	19990	20078
25946186	Recent studies have suggested a key role for P38 MAPK in mediating pathways leading to apoptosis and growth inhibitory signals.	20079	20206
25946186	Additionally, P38 MAPK triggers the activation of caspase-3, 9 and is also necessary for the phosphorylation of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bax, Bim and Bcl-2 in OA-treated cancer cells.	20207	20403
25946186	Combined with these results, we speculate that TIPE2 promotes lung cancer cell apoptosis through activation of P38 MAPK, which triggers the over-expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9.	20404	20587
25946186	In addition, we also found that TIPE2 decreased the phosphorylated level of Akt.	20588	20668
25946186	As reported, the Akt pathway is a central signal transduction pathway that regulates many critical aspects of cancer physiology, including cell proliferation, cell morphology, migration and apoptosis.	20669	20869
25946186	Meanwhile, some apoptosis-related molecules such as Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 are affected distinctly by TIPE2.	20870	20991
25946186	So, our results provide a lot of evidence that TIPE2 promotes lung cancer apoptosis.	20992	21076
25946186	Interestingly, we found Ki-67 expression had no alteration after TIPE2 over-expression, which indicated that TIPE2 inhibited lung cancer growth attributing to promotion of cell apoptosis.	21077	21264
25946186	Taken together, TIPE2 functions as a tumor suppressor to promote lung cancer cell apoptosis.	21265	21357
25946186	Therefore, the forced expression of human TIPE2 may be a new strategy for treatment of lung cancer.	21358	21457
25874935	Thrombolysis induced by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an important strategy for treating cerebral ischemia (CI).	0	120
25874935	Nevertheless, alongside playing a role as a thrombolytic agent, tPA triggers neurotoxic effects after stroke, including inflammatory damage, excitotoxicity, and basal lamina degradation by enhancing the activation of microglia and neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated signaling.	121	417
25874935	Neuroserpin (NSP) is an axon-secreted serine protease inhibitor and belongs to the serpins superfamily.	418	521
25874935	It plays a crucial role in cerebral development, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity as an inhibition of tPA.	522	638
25874935	Although mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of NSP are poorly understood, it is believed that NSP exerts neuroprotective effects in CI animal models and patients.	639	817
25874935	The neuroprotective role of NSP in cerebral ischemia is well documented.	818	890
25874935	As early as 2000, Yepes et al. first reported that NSP reduces the volume of ischemic lesions and exhibits neuroprotective effects by protecting neurons from ischemic injury.	891	1065
25874935	Cinelli et al. later verified these neuroprotective effects in ischemic mice, showing that NSP reduces activation of microglia.	1066	1193
25874935	Next, Zhang et al. found adjuvant administration of NSP prolonged the therapeutic window for thrombolysis with tPA.	1194	1309
25874935	Our previous studies indicated that the reduction of fibrinolytic component and the neuroprotective role of NSP may cause the exacerbation of ischemic injury in diabetic rats.	1310	1485
25874935	Lebeurrier et al. (2005) reported that NSP prevents NMDA-induced neurotoxicity.	1486	1565
25874935	A later report from the same laboratory showed that NSP plays crucial roles in the CNS, including the adjustment of neuronal migration, plasticity, and cell death.	1566	1729
25874935	Wu et al. (2010) found that NSP improved ischemic tolerance and decreased the volume of CI lesions in wild-type and tPA-deficient (tPA−/−) neurons and mice.	1730	1886
25874935	Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al. (2011) demonstrated that NSP had neuroprotective effects in CI patients and OGD-treated mixtures of neurons and astrocytes in rats by attenuating tPA-mediated mechanisms of inflammation and disrupting the blood–brain barrier in an ischemic model in vitro.	1887	2168
25874935	They also found that a high serum NSP level indicates a better outcome in CI patients.	2169	2255
25874935	Ma et al. (2012) confirmed a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of NSP in OGD/R rats by inhibiting tPA-mediated acute neuronal excitotoxicity.	2256	2401
25874935	Moreover, Gelderblom et al. recently reported that an unbalanced expression of NSP and tPA caused a negative outcome in experimental CI, which is believed to be associated with increased microglial activation.	2402	2611
25874935	These previous clinical and bench studies verified the neuroprotective properties of NSP from different angles, and are helpful in approaching the mechanisms of NSP; however, there have been no studies to date on the effects of NSP on astrocytes in vitro.	2612	2867
25874935	Astrocytes are the most numerous cells in the central nervous system (CNS).	2868	2943
25874935	They play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of CNS by the processing, transfer, and storage of information in the nerves.	2944	3080
25874935	The role of astrocytes in the ischemic state is complex.	3081	3137
25874935	Astrocytes interact with neurons by cross-talk, and are crucial in maintaining the survival of neurons in the ischemic brain.	3138	3263
25874935	Abnormal astrocyte function, induced by ischemia, may have remarkable effects on the survival of neurons.	3264	3369
25874935	Cerebral ischemia triggers astrocyte activation.	3370	3418
25874935	It is reported that reactive astrocytes contribute to the protection of the ischemic penumbra, modulate the decrease of the infarct volume, and counteract the effects of edema.	3419	3595
25874935	Another recent study emphasized the important role of astrocytes in maintaining the function and integrity of blood–brain barrier.	3596	3726
25874935	Because of the abundance of astrocytes, their wide distribution, and important role in ischemic stroke, we speculate that NSP is neuroprotective to astrocytes.	3727	3886
25874935	A previous study verified the neuroprotective effect of NSP in ischemic cortical cells (mixture of neuron and astrocytes), the effects of NSP on astrocytes alone remain unverified.	3887	4067
25874935	The present study had two aims.	4068	4099
25874935	The first was to confirm whether NSP exerts neuroprotective effects on astrocytes in an in vitro ischemic model.	4100	4212
25874935	The second was to explore the potential mechanisms of NSP in astrocytes.	4213	4285
25874935	The influence of inflammatory cytokines along with measurement of proteins related to the NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were also investigated.	4286	4444
25874935	On the basis of the results of a pre-experiment, we used a NF-κB inhibitor, called sc3060, to verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the NF-κB pathway.	4445	4626
25874935	All the astrocytes were acquired from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats (age < 24 h, Shanghai Institute of the Chinese Academy of Science, China).	4627	4768
25874935	All animals were treated as per the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.	4769	4888
25874935	All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Fudan University (authorization No: 072105387).	4889	5022
25874935	Rats were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight); their cortical hemispheres were separated from the skull and meninges.	5023	5201
25874935	Then, the tissues were dissociated by 0.125% trypsin digestion for 10 min at 37°C and gently triturated.	5202	5306
25874935	The homogenate was placed in 100-mm dishes or 96-well plates at a density of 3–5 × 105 cell/mL and maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.	5307	5458
25874935	Astrocytes were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 5.5 mM glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), which was replaced every 3 d. At confluence (days 7–9), the astrocyte cultures formed a confluent layer of process-bearing glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells (at least 95%).	5459	5771
25874935	OGD was performed following the processes described in a previous study.	5772	5844
25874935	Briefly, the original glucose-containing media were removed from all treatment groups and kept aside for future use.	5845	5961
25874935	Astrocytes were washed three times with deoxygenated glucose-free medium and then incubated in an anaerobic chamber (Model 1025, Forma Scientific, USA) in an atmosphere containing 85% N2, 10% H2, 5% CO2, and <0.1% O2 at 37°C.	5962	6187
25874935	In this study, OGD was continued for 12 h. OGD was terminated by removing the cultures from the chamber and reoxygenation was performed by adding the original media and culturing in a normoxic incubator for 0–24 h at 37°C.	6188	6410
25874935	The control astrocytes were washed and incubated in a normoxic incubator throughout the common normoxic astrocyte culturing medium (blank control).	6411	6558
25874935	Recombinant human NSP (PeproTech, USA) was diluted with MEM containing 10% FBS 24h before the experiments.	6559	6665
25874935	NSP was randomly added to the normal astrocyte culturing mediums (100 μL/well) in a 96-well filter plate (AcroPrep, USA).	6666	6787
25874935	We adjusted NSP solutions to various concentrations (i.e., 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 ng/mL) and reacted for 1 h, and then subjected to the OGD treatment for 12 h followed by 24 h of reoxygenation (OGD12hR24h).	6788	6999
25874935	We observed the cell survival rate and relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release of all the OGD12hR24h cells along with a blank control.	7000	7139
25874935	The cell survival rate was calculated as follows: at the end of culture, 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Adrich, USA) was added to each well to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.	7140	7367
25874935	After incubation at 37°C for 4 h, the medium was removed and 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well and kept for 10 min.	7368	7501
25874935	The plate was read at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Multiscan MK3; Thermo Labsystems USA).	7502	7596
25874935	The cell survival rate was calculated as the ratio of the cells survived compared to the blank control.	7597	7700
25874935	LDH release was measured following a classic method.	7701	7753
25874935	Briefly, the medium (50 μL) of each group was transferred from the culture well to a 96-well plate and mixed with 50 μL of reaction using a commercial LDH detecting kit (Sigma, USA).	7754	7936
25874935	The mixtures were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min, and then 50 μL of stop solution included in the kit was added to each well.	7937	8084
25874935	After 30 min, the absorbance was read at 492 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo, USA).	8085	8173
25874935	The maximum LDH release was measured in each well at the end of each experiment, following repeated freezing and thawing.	8174	8295
25874935	Each experiment was conducted in triplicate, with each experiment containing eight readings.	8296	8388
25874935	Results are expressed as a percentage of the maximum LDH release, after subtracting background levels determined from the medium alone.	8389	8524
25874935	Finally, we selected 5 ng/mL as the appropriate NSP concentration for further experiments (Fig 1A and 1B).	8525	8631
25874935	We then confirmed the efficacy of 5 ng/mL NSP by measuring the survival rates of cells undergoing 12 h of OGD followed by reoxygenation for various times (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 h) A standard Hoechst 33342 staining was employed to observe changes in DNA in astrocytes, as described in a previous study.	8632	8943
25874935	Briefly, the astrocytic monolayer solution (8 mL) was fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (1 h, room temperature).	8944	9054
25874935	Cells were then stained with 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Beyotime, China) for 5 min at room temperature in the dark, and washed three times with PBS for 3 min.	9055	9209
25874935	The morphological features of apoptosis were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX 51, Japan), and at least 500 cells from 10 randomly selected fields per dish were counted.	9210	9393
25874935	The proportion of apoptotic cells was observed by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioVision, USA), according to a previously described method.	9394	9569
25874935	Briefly, cells were harvested and resuspended in binding buffer at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/mL (8 mL).	9570	9680
25874935	During reoxygenation, cells were simultaneously mixed with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI).	9681	9781
25874935	After incubation at room temperature for 10 min in the dark, the cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACScan; BD Biosciences, USA) to determine the population positive for annexin V-FITC (FL-1 channel) and/or PI (FL-2 channel).	9782	10014
25874935	Data were analyzed using the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, USA).	10015	10086
25874935	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to observe the influence of NSP on NO and TNF-α.	10087	10186
25874935	We added the NSP into astrocyte solutions (100 μL) and adjusted the concentration of the NSP solution to 5 ng/mL, and after 1 h of reaction, the cells were treated with OGD12h followed by 12 or 24 h of reoxygenation.	10187	10403
25874935	The blank control group was not subjected to the OGD/R treatment.	10404	10469
25874935	Then, NO and TNF-α were measured using the NO ELISA kit and TNF-α ELISA kit (ADL, USA), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	10470	10617
25874935	Nitric oxide was measured as described in a previous study.	10618	10677
25874935	In brief, we made a standard curve to detect concentrations between 1 and 100 μM of nitrite per well.	10678	10779
25874935	Next, 100 μL astrocyte solutions were centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4°C for 2 min, and the clarified supernatant recovered.	10780	10900
25874935	Ice-cold (5%) metaphosphoric acid (Sigma–Aldrich) was mixed with clarified samples in a ratio of 1:1 (v: v) (mixing and spinning at 10,000 g for 5 min).	10901	11053
25874935	Supernatants along with standards were exposed to nitrate reductase for 1 h at room temperature (23°C) to transform nitrate to nitrite.	11054	11189
25874935	By using the enhancer, Griess reaction reagents were applied to convert nitrite to a purple azo-cromophore compound.	11190	11306
25874935	Optical density was measured using a microplate reader (Multiscan MK3; Thermo Labsystems, USA) at 450 nm with a wavelength correction at 570 nm.	11307	11451
25874935	Classic Western blotting analysis was performed to clarify the potential effect of NSP on the NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways.	11452	11581
25874935	We added the NSP into astrocyte solutions (100 μL) and adjusted the concentration of the NSP solution to 5 ng/mL, the cells for the NF-κB pathway were divided into two group.	11582	11756
25874935	One group was only treated with NSP, and the other group was treated with NSP and the NF-κB inhibitor, sc3060 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) (75 ug/mL) and after 1 h of reaction, the cells were treated with OGD12 h followed by 24 h of reoxygenation.	11757	12007
25874935	The blank control group was not subjected to the OGD/R treatment.	10404	10469
25874935	After OGD/R, the cells were subjected to Western blotting analysis.	12074	12141
25874935	Cells were scraped into lysis buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 10 mM KCl; 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM EGTA; 1 mM DTT; 1 mM PMSF; 1 μg/mL aprotinin; and 1 μg/mL leupeptin) and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min.	12142	12342
25874935	Supernatants were collected and used as the cytosolic fractions, whereas pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 400 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 10% glycerol; 1 mM DTT; 1 mM PMSF; 1 μg/mL aprotinin; and 1 μg/mL leupeptin) on ice for 30 min.	12343	12600
25874935	These lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 min, and supernatants were collected and used the nuclear fractions.	12601	12724
25874935	Protein concentrations in the resultant supernatants were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Manufacturing, USA) and samples containing equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.	12725	12973
25874935	After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the membranes were incubated in 4% milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 12 h at 4°C with antibodies (diluted 1:500) against NF-κB p65, phospho-IKKα/β (p- IKKα/β, CST, USA), phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2, CST Co, USA), total-ERK1/2 (t-ERK1/2, Kangchen, China), phospho-AKT (p-AKT, CST Co., USA), total-AKT (t-AKT, Santa Cruz, USA), β-actin (Abcam, USA), and histone H3 (Santa Cruz, USA).	12974	13425
25874935	The proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit or antimouse secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and after exposure to a film, they were visualized using chemiluminescence reagents provided with the ECL kit.	13426	13680
25874935	Densitometry was performed as the index of quantitative analysis using the Quantity One software (BioRad Laboratories, USA).	13681	13805
25874935	All experiments were repeated at least three times in separate cell preparations and the average data were calculated.	13806	13924
25874935	Data were recorded as the mean ± standard error and were analyzed using the SPSS 13.0.0 software (SPSS, USA).	13925	14034
25874935	Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc correction was used for multiple comparisons.	14035	14126
25874935	The variables included the NSP dose (Fig 1A and 1B), time of reoxygenation (Fig 1C), reoxygenation time and NSP dose (Figs 2A2 and 3), NSP dose and OGD (Figs 4B and 4C and 5B and 5C).	14127	14310
25874935	The type I error in ANOVA was accepted as P < 0.05.	14311	14362
25874935	All the tests were two-sided.	14363	14392
25874935	Fig 1 shows the protective effects of NSP on the astrocytes treated by OGD/R.	14393	14470
25874935	The survival rate of the cells was significantly reduced after OGD12hR24h (NSP 0 ng/mL vs. blank control); however, the administration of NSP significantly increased the survival rate.	14471	14655
25874935	The maximum effect was observed with 5 ng/mL of NSP, but no further improvements were observed at a dose over 5 ng/mL (Fig 1A).	14656	14783
25874935	The relative LDH release of the cells significantly increased after OGD12hR24h (NSP 0 ng/mL vs. blank control); however, the administration of NSP significantly decreased the LDH release.	14784	14971
25874935	The maximum effect was observed with 5 ng/mL of NSP, but no further improvements were observed at a dose over 5 ng/mL NSP (Fig 1B).	14972	15103
25874935	Thus, we selected 5 ng/mL as the administration dose for further experiments.	15104	15181
25874935	We also found that 5 ng/mL of NSP improved the cell survival rate in the cells treated by OGD12h followed by different times of reoxygenation (4–24 h, Fig 1C).	15182	15341
25874935	Fig 2 shows the protective effects of NSP by morphological methods.	15342	15409
25874935	Fig 2A shows the results of DNA staining (Hoechst 33342 staining).	15410	15476
25874935	By comparing the number of pyknotic changes between the non-NSP group and NSP group, it is obvious that NSP administration inhibited the changes induced by OGD/R (Fig 2A1).	15477	15649
25874935	The results of quantitative counting are shown in Fig 2A2.	15650	15708
25874935	Fig 2B shows the results of the Annexin V assay.	15709	15757
25874935	The apoptotic cells increased by OGD/R treatments (OGD12h24h vs. blank control, right lower quadrant), whereas NSP administration exerted an inhibitory effect against ischemia-induced apoptosis (OGD12h24h vs. OGD12h24h + NSP, Fig 2B1).	15758	15993
25874935	Fig 2B2 shows the results of quantitative cell counting.	15994	16050
25874935	The potential mechanisms of neuroprotection were investigated by measuring the release of NO and TNF-α and the proteins related to the NF-κB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways.	16051	16221
25874935	Fig 3 shows that NSP inhibited the release of NO (Fig 3A) and TNF-α (Fig 3B).	16222	16299
25874935	Inhibition of NO and TNF-α may play a role in the mechanism of NSP neuroprotection.	16300	16383
25874935	Fig 4 shows the results of the morphological studies and Western blotting analysis used to assess the activation of the NF-κB pathway, including expression of p-IKKα/β and p65.	16384	16560
25874935	We observed typical star-shaped astrocytes with synapses enwrapped in a slice of blank control, but the typical astrocytes disappeared after OGD 12 h and R24 h. Administration of NSP was neuroprotective, as we observed characteristic star-shaped astrocytes in the slice, but these neuroprotective effects could be reversed by administration of the NF-κB pathway inhibitor, sc3060.	16561	16941
25874935	For the cytosolic fractions, the expression of p-IKKα/β was significantly enhanced by the OGD12hR24h treatment and was recovered after the administration of NSP.	16942	17103
25874935	The recovery induced by NSP could be reversed by administration of the NF-κB pathway inhibitor, sc3060 (Fig 4B and 4C).	17104	17223
25874935	For the nuclear fractions, the expression of nuclear NF-κB p65 was upregulated by the OGD12hR24h treatment, whereas it reduced significantly after the administration of NSP.	17224	17397
25874935	The reduction induced by NSP could be reversed by administration of sc3060 (Fig 4B and 4D).	17398	17489
25874935	These results indicated that inhibition of the NF-κB pathway may play a role in the mechanism of NSP neuroprotection.	17490	17607
25874935	Fig 5 shows that, although the OGD12hR24h treatment upregulated the expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2 (Fig 5A and 5B), and p-Akt (Fig 5A and 5C), interestingly, the administration of NSP did not invert that trend, which indicated that NSP has little influence on the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.	17608	17898
25874935	Thrombolysis with tPA is the most common therapy for treating CI, despite tPA administration being a double-edged sword.	17899	18019
25874935	In this regard, a deeper insight into the tPA inhibitor NSP, which plays a crucial role in tPA regulation, is particularly important.	18020	18153
25874935	Although the neuroprotection of NSP on cerebral ischemia is well documented, the present study aimed to confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP on ischemic astrocytes in vitro and attempted to explore the related mechanisms.	18154	18381
25874935	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the mechanisms of the effects of NSP on astrocytes.	18382	18499
25874935	Early in 1999, Docaqne et al. reported that NSP is expressed in both neurons and astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells in CNS).	18500	18625
25874935	Our findings verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes i.e., NSP administration significantly reduced the release of LDH (Fig 1B) in OGD/R-treated astrocytes.	18626	18800
25874935	In addition, the cell survival rate (Fig 1A) along with the morphological evidences (Figs 2 and 4A) confirmed the neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes.	18801	18960
25874935	These findings are in agreement with the results of Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al..	18961	19039
25874935	In that study, they found that OGD treatment caused morphological alterations and increased cell death in these cells, whereas the administration of NSP could reverse these changes.	19040	19221
25874935	The results of our present study are different on two accounts.	19222	19285
25874935	First, their study, which involved a mixture of neurons and astrocytes, did not focus on the mechanisms underlying the effect of NSP on astrocytes.	19286	19433
25874935	Second, they used the OGD process, whereas in this study, we used the OGD/R process in order to mimic the ischemic state of astrocytes.	19434	19569
25874935	All of our evidence proved that NSP is neuroprotective to astrocytes under ischemic conditions.	19570	19665
25874935	The mechanism of NSP neuroprotection is complicated.	19666	19718
25874935	Previous studies concerning NSP focused on its effects in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease [25,30–32], and most of the mechanisms were discussed with regard to its neuroprotective effects in NMDA-induced cell death and microglia.	19719	19971
25874935	Previous studies have suggested that NSP may regulate the growth and maturation of neurons via a noninhibitory mechanism.	19972	20093
25874935	In the present study, once the protective efficacy was verified, we explored other potential neuroprotective mechanisms.	20094	20214
25874935	The first finding was that NSP could inhibit the release of NO and TNF-α (Fig 3).	20215	20296
25874935	Oxidative and inflammatory pathways have been proven to play roles in the injuries induced by OGD/R exposure.	20297	20406
25874935	The release of NO and TNF-α can be used as a simple biomarker in the future.	20407	20483
25874935	The second finding was that NSP administration considerably reduced the overactive expression of p-IKKα/β and P65 in OGD/R astrocytes (Fig 4B and 4D).	20484	20634
25874935	The protection induced by NSP could be significantly reversed by sc3060, a NF-κB pathway inhibitor.	20635	20734
25874935	We first reported that blocking the NF-κB pathway deteriorates the morphological appearance of astrocytes ameliorated by NSP (Fig 4A), and reverses the downregulation of p-IKKα/β and P65 expression induced by NSP (Fig 4B and 4D).	20735	20964
25874935	These data suggest the critical role of the NF-κB pathway in NSP-induced neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia.	20965	21075
25874935	The NF-κB pathway acts as an important transcription factor and regulator of genes that control cell proliferation and survival.	21076	21204
25874935	It is regarded as the center of various cellular responses, including immune and inflammatory reactions, and is generally considered as a “prototypical proinflammatory” signaling pathway on the basis of the activation of NF-κB by proinflammatory cytokines.	21205	21461
25874935	The roles of the NF-κB pathway under ischemic conditions are dual, and the interaction between the NF-κB pathway and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α is complicated.	21462	21631
25874935	Nijboer et al. reported that early NF-κB activation is neurotoxic, whereas the late NF-κB pathway is neuroprotective.	21632	21749
25874935	Inhibition of the early NF-κB pathway is neuroprotective only if the late NF-κB pathway is maintained.	21750	21852
25874935	It is believed that TNF-α can directly activate the NF-κB pathway, and such activation of the NF-κB pathway may generate NO by stimulation of the expression of nitric oxide synthase.	21853	22035
25874935	The interaction between NSP and the NF-κB pathway is poorly understood.	22036	22107
25874935	It is believed that NF-κB may be activated by the accumulation of NSP polymers within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.	22108	22233
25874935	Chronic activation of NF-κB may cause cell death, resulting in the accumulation of NSP and causing dementia.	22234	22342
25874935	On the basis of the above evidence, we speculate that a potential explanation of our findings is that in the early stage of ischemic/hypoxic injury to astrocytes (OGD12h), administration of NSP inhibits the release of TNF-α, which causes less activation of the NF-κB pathway and consequent reduction in the release of NO (Fig 6).	22343	22672
25874935	This should be verified in our next experiments.	22673	22721
25874935	One limitation of this study is that we did not measure the changes in NO after administrating sc3060.	22722	22824
25874935	However, astrocyte morphology (Fig 4A) provides evidence that NF-κB pathway inhibitor can reverse the efficacy of NSP.	22825	22943
25874935	Another limitation is that we did not have a control condition, i.e. only with OGD, in all our experiments.	22944	23051
25874935	We aim to do this in future experiments.	23052	23092
25874935	Moreover, we also found that the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were activated by the OGR/R treatment (Fig 5), which was in accordance with a previous study.	23093	23258
25874935	However, our data showed that NSP has only little influence on these pathways.	23259	23337
25874935	Additional studies are warranted to clarify the interactions between these complicated pathways and NSP.	23338	23442
25874935	In conclusion, NSP exerts neuroprotective effects in OGD/R-treated astrocytes, and these potential neuroprotective mechanisms may lie in the inhibition of release of TNF-α and NO, along with inhibition of the NF-κB pathway.	23443	23666
25874935	In addition, NSP has little influence on the MAPK and P13K/Akt pathways.	23667	23739
25054547	Butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8; BChE) also known as pseudocholinesterase, is the sister enzyme of acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7; AChE).	0	141
25054547	It is present in most tissues and in human plasma at a concentration about 50 nM.	142	223
25054547	Though BChE lacks obvious physiological functions, it is of toxicological and pharmacological importance in detoxifying or catabolising ester-containing drugs.	224	383
25054547	Furthermore, individuals deficient in BChE appear asymptomatic, apart from a heightened sensitivity to the muscle relaxants suxamethonium and mivacurium, two BChE substrates used as myorelaxant.	384	578
25054547	In patients with usual BChE levels, these drugs are rapidly hydrolysed in plasma and their duration of action is short (<10 min).	579	708
25054547	BChE deficiency results in slower hydrolysis of these drugs and, consequently, a prolonged neuromuscular block, leading to apnea.	709	838
25054547	Prolonged neuromuscular block occurs with BChE deficiencies of marked severity (impairment >70%).	839	936
25054547	Although many acquired conditions may affect BChE activity (liver or renal diseases, malnutrition, pregnancy, malignancy), BChE deficiency is mainly due to mutations in the BCHE gene (MIM 177400).	937	1133
25054547	Prolonged apnea following injection of succinylcholine was first described in 1953.	1134	1217
25054547	The genetic variation of BChE deficiency was described by Kalow and Genest in 1957 and is said to be a cornerstone in pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics.	1218	1370
25054547	The human BCHE gene is located on chromosome 3q26.1, contains 3 coding exons, and spans approximately 64 kb.	1371	1479
25054547	Genetically inherited BChE deficiency shows autosomal recessive inheritance.	1480	1556
25054547	It has been estimated that almost 24% of the human population carries at least one variant BCHE allele.	1557	1660
25054547	Currently, close to 70 natural mutations have been documented in human BCHE.	1661	1737
25054547	Most of them have an adverse effect on BChE activity.	1738	1791
25054547	This may occur either by deleterious effects of point mutations on catalytic functioning, or by point mutations that affect protein expression, which may result in an absence of BChE altogether.	1792	1986
25054547	Although the majority of these mutations are rare, two of them, the atypical variant (c.293A>G, p.Asp70Gly, rs1799807) and the K-variant (c.1699G>A, p.Ala539Tyr, rs1803274), are relatively common, homozygotes occurring at 1∶3,000 and 1∶100 in the Caucasian population respectively.	1987	2268
25054547	Here we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant.	2269	2411
25054547	DNA sequencing showed that this variant results from a point mutation c.695T>A (p.Val204Asp).	2412	2505
25054547	Inhibition studies, kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation determines the “silent” phenotype.	2506	2648
25054547	The patient is a one-month old infant boy (subject II-1), who presented a prolonged neuromuscular block (16 hours) after administration of a single dose of succinylcholine (2 mg/kg) for pyloric stenosis surgery.	2649	2860
25054547	His parents have no medical or surgical history.	2861	2909
25054547	Biological investigations mentioned below were performed on plasma from the patient and his parents.	2910	3010
25054547	The parents signed an informed consent to participate in the genetic study, which was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the Begin Military Teaching Hospital.	3011	3183
25054547	Three reference plasma samples of phenotype UU, UA and AS (DNA sequence for the silent BChE unknown) from O. Lockridge’s plasma sample collection were used for control of catalytic and inhibition properties and electrophoresis of plasma BChE samples.	3184	3434
25054547	Butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTC), Benzoylcholine chloride (BzCh) and dibucaine chloride were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, Missouri, United States of America).	3435	3595
25054547	Succinyldithiocholine was custom synthesized by Molecular Probes Inc. Other chemicals were of biochemical grade.	3596	3708
25054547	Total plasma BChE activity was measured with butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTC) as substrate on a Cobas® 6000 system (Roche Diagnostics) according to the method described by the manufacturer ([BTC] = 7.56 mM at pH = 7.7 and 37°C).	3709	3936
25054547	Under these conditions the reference interval for BChE activity in healthy individuals was 5,320–12,920 IU/L for men, 4,260–11,250 IU/L for women under 39-years, and 2,260–6,460 IU/L for infants.	3937	4132
25054547	Activity of BChE in plasma or serum was also measured in the laboratory using a single beam spectrophotometer.	4133	4243
25054547	Two substrates were used: BTC and BzCh.	4244	4283
25054547	Activity with BTC was determined using Ellman’s method in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at 25°C.	4284	4380
25054547	Plasma samples (10 µL) were preincubated for 5 min with the chromogenic reagent 20 mM DTNB (50 µL) in 1,275 µL of the buffer solution prior to assay to neutralize plasma-containing free thiol compounds (under these conditions, free-thiol-containing molecules present in plasma samples were neutralized in less that 3 min).	4381	4703
25054547	After adding 1 mM BTC, assays were recorded at 412 nm taking ε412 = 16,360 M−1 cm−1.	4704	4788
25054547	Activity with BzCh was determined according to Kalow and Genest by recording decrease in absorbance at 240 nm (Δε = 6,700 M−1.cm−1) of 50 µM BzCh in 67 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 25°C.	4789	4976
25054547	For both assays, one unit (U) of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes one µmol of substrate per minute.	4977	5110
25054547	Blood samples were collected from the patient and his parents.	5111	5173
25054547	Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes with use of the QIAamp Blood-DNA mini reagent set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	5174	5337
25054547	DNA was eluted in 100 µL of water in the final step and stored at −20°C until required.	5338	5425
25054547	Sequencing of the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the BCHE gene was performed after PCR amplification of genomic DNA, with specific primers (Table 1).	5426	5587
25054547	All of the coding exons and the flanking introns of the BCHE gene were amplified by PCR using the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95°C for 10 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s, and an extension at 72°C for 40 s; 1 cycle of 72°C for 7 min.	5588	5869
25054547	The reaction mixture of final volume 25 µL contained 100 ng DNA template, 1×PCR Buffer (Invitrogen), 2.0 mmol MgCl2, 0.2 mmol dNTP, 1 µmol of each primer, and 0,625 U Taq Gold DNA polymerase.	5870	6061
25054547	PCR products were purified with use of the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	6062	6209
25054547	Both strands were sequenced using amplification primers as sequencing primers and BigDyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Beckman Coulter).	6210	6394
25054547	Purified sequencing fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis and detected by laser-induced fluorescence on a Beckman Ceq 8000 (Beckman Coulter).	6395	6552
25054547	Polyphen and Mutation Taster were used to perform in silico prediction of the impact of nucleotide changes on the protein structure and function.	6553	6698
25054547	Inhibition numbers (i.e. the dibucaine number and the fluoride number) for plasma BChE samples were determined according to classical procedures using BzCh as the substrate in 67 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 25°C.	6699	6913
25054547	An inhibition number is defined as the percentage of inhibition of hydrolysis of 50 µM BzCh by a fixed concentration of inhibitor.	6914	7044
25054547	The dibucaine number (DN) was determined using 10 µM dibucaine according to Kalow and Genest.	7045	7138
25054547	The fluoride number (FN) was determined using 50 µM sodium fluoride according to Harris and Whittaker.	7139	7241
25054547	Catalytic parameters for hydrolysis of BTC were determined in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at 25°C.	7242	7342
25054547	Measurements were performed using Ellman’s method.	7343	7393
25054547	Hydrolysis rates were recorded for 2 min after preincubation of plasma samples in the presence of DTNB as mentioned above.	7394	7516
25054547	Wide ranges of substrate concentrations were used: from 10 µM to 50 mM for BTC.	7517	7596
25054547	Spontaneous hydrolysis of substrates was recorded and subtracted for each enzymatic measurement at corresponding substrate concentrations.	7597	7735
25054547	BChE catalyzed-hydrolysis of substrates can be described by the model (Fig.	7736	7811
25054547	1) and by Eq 1:(1) At low substrate concentration, hydrolysis kinetics for all substrates follow the simple boxed reaction scheme that corresponds to the simple Michaelis-Menten mechanism in which the Michaelis constant, Km, is described by Eq 2:(2)with Ks = k-1/k1, the dissociation of the ES complex, k2 and k3 the rate constant for acylation (EA) and deacylation, respectively.	7812	8192
25054547	The catalytic constant kcat is:(3)with Vmax, the maximum velocity, and [E], the enzyme active site concentration.	8193	8306
25054547	At high concentration, for positively charged substrates like BTC a second substrate molecule binds to the peripheral anionic site (PAS, p) of wild-type enzyme (Usual): SpE, and the ternary complex SPES makes products.	8307	8525
25054547	Kss is the dissociation constant of this ternary complex.	8526	8583
25054547	As a consequence, the kinetics deviate from the Michaelian model; there is either activation by excess substrate, e.g. with BTC, or inhibition by excess substrate, e.g. with BzCh.	8584	8763
25054547	In Eq 1, the b factor refers to the effect of the second substrate molecule on the kcat.	8764	8852
25054547	If b>1, there is activation; if b<1, there is inhibition.	8853	8910
25054547	If there is no binding on the PAS, b = 1, and Eq 1 reduces to the simple Michaelis-Menten equation.	8911	9010
25054547	Catalytic parameters were determined by non-linear fitting of substrate-dependent hydrolysis rate curves.	9011	9116
25054547	Because BChE has a non-Michaelian behavior with BTC as substrate, Eq 1 was used to describe hydrolysis of BTC.	9117	9227
25054547	On the other hand, owing to the structure of SCdTC which contains 2 thiocholine groups (one binds on the catalytic active center and the other binds to the PAS) the catalytic behavior is Michaelian, and Eq 1 reduces to Eq 3.	9228	9452
25054547	Nondenaturing gradient gel (4–30%) electrophoresis of plasma samples (5 µL/lane) was carried out as described.	9453	9563
25054547	BChE active bands were stained using the methods of Karnovsky and Roots with BTC as the substrate as described elsewhere.	9564	9685
25054547	BChE was immunopurified from 0.5 ml plasma by binding to monoclonal mAb2 immobilized on Sepharose 4B.	9686	9787
25054547	Activity assays showed that 97% of the BChE activity had disappeared from plasma following overnight incubation with mAb2-Sepharose.	9788	9920
25054547	Beads (0.04 mL) were washed with phosphate buffered saline, and desalted by washing with water.	9921	10016
25054547	Beads were transferred to 0.45 µm Durapore centrifugal filters.	10017	10080
25054547	BChE protein was released from the beads with 80 µL of 0.4 M acetic acid pH 2.6.	10081	10161
25054547	The filtered acid extract was dried in a vacuum centrifuge, dissolved in 35 µL of SDS/dithiothreitol loading buffer, heated in a boiling water bath for 3 min and loaded on an SDS gel.	10162	10345
25054547	Denaturing gel electrophoresis in SDS in the presence of dithiothreitol was carried out according to Laemli on 4–30% gradient polyacrylamide gels.	10346	10492
25054547	Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.	10493	10550
25054547	Model structures for wild type (usual BChE) and p.Val204Asp mutant were prepared from the X-ray coordinates of PDB ID 1P0I as described in our previous studies,.	10551	10712
25054547	For p.Val204Asp mutant of BChE, the Val204 side chain was manually converted to aspartic acid and its side chain was minimized with other protein atoms fixed.	10713	10871
25054547	Minimization and MD simulations were performed with the NAMD 2.9 program and the CHARMM36 force field on the Lomonosov Moscow State University supercomputer.	10872	11029
25054547	After solvation and addition of ions, protein structures were saturated with water molecules and water box equilibrating runs were performed as described in.	11030	11187
25054547	This was followed by a full dynamic simulation of each system performed for 100 ns under periodic boundary conditions at a constant temperature of 298 K and constant pressure 1 atm.	11188	11369
25054547	Structural analysis of the obtained MD trajectories was performed with ProDy and VMD software packages.	11370	11473
25054547	The crystal structure of human BChE was described in 2003.	11474	11532
25054547	The active, or acylation site (Ser198…His438…Glu325 triad) lies near the base of a gorge, approximately 20 Å from the surface.	11533	11659
25054547	An adjacent site, the choline-binding site, also called the anionic site (Trp82…Tyr128…Phe329), is responsible for binding the choline moiety of the substrate, and positioning the ester bond for nucleophilic attack by the serine of the active site.	11660	11908
25054547	Two additional structures, also located near the base of the gorge, are the oxyanion hole (Gly116…Gly117…Ala199) and the acyl pocket (Trp231…Leu286…Val288), which stabilize the substrate during hydrolysis.	11909	12114
25054547	A peripheral anionic site (Asp70…Tyr332) is involved in the initial binding of the substrate and in activation control.	12115	12234
25054547	Various mutations affect BChE activity.	12235	12274
25054547	In some cases, residues involved in the catalytic process are mutated: e.g. Ser198 of the active site, Tyr128 of the choline binding site, or Asp70 of the peripheral site.	12275	12446
25054547	The first two mutations result in a silent enzyme, while the last one causes a reduction in substrate affinity and an abolition of substrate activation.	12447	12599
25054547	Other mutated residues fall within conserved sequences or motifs that are distant from the active site.	12600	12703
25054547	Here we report a novel BCHE variant in a patient presenting a marked deficiency in BChE activity (|BChE| = 1,270 IU/L) (Fig.	12704	12828
25054547	2).	12829	12832
25054547	Sequencing of the whole coding region of BCHE revealed that this patient harbored three point mutations in a compound heterozygous state.	12833	12970
25054547	One was the well-known atypical variant (c.293A>G, p.Asp70Gly).	12971	13034
25054547	The second one was the Kalow-variant (c.1699G>A, p.Ala539Thr).	13035	13097
25054547	The last one, which was not previously described nor was included in any mutation databases, introduced a mis-sense mutation at amino acid residue 204 (c.695T>A, p.Val204Asp, GenBank Accession #KJ513459) (Fig.	13098	13307
25054547	2).	12829	12832
25054547	It involves a residue highly conserved across species (Table 2).	13312	13376
25054547	In silico predictions identified this mutation as potentially deleterious: i.e. PolyPhen-2 score of 1.0 (sensitivity: 0.00, specificity: 1.00), and Mutation Taster score of 152.	13377	13554
25054547	This mutation was observed in the patient’s father (patient I-1) at heterozygous state, whereas the mother (patient I-2) was compound heterozygote for the atypical variant and the Kalow variant.	13555	13749
25054547	Mutations near residue Val204 have previously been described: p.Ala199Val, p.Ala201Thr and p.Ser203Pro.	13750	13853
25054547	These mutations result in a silent enzyme.	13854	13896
25054547	However, the mechanisms by which these mutations determine the silent phenotype were not established.	13897	13998
25054547	In the present work kinetic analysis, inhibition studies and molecular dynamics studies have led to an understanding of how mutation p.Val204Asp disrupts the catalytic triad and determines the “silent” phenotype.	13999	14211
25054547	Results of phenotyping are in Table 3.	14212	14250
25054547	Results are consistent with reported values of activity, DN and FN for heterozygous human BChE of genotype Silent (p.Val204Asp)/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr (Proband), Silent (p.Val204Asp)/Usual (father) and Usual/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr (mother).	14251	14491
25054547	Hydrolysis kinetics of BTC were performed under steady-state conditions.	14492	14564
25054547	The catalytic behavior of the patient’s BChE (p.Val204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr) follows the Michaelis-Menten model (boxed reactions in Scheme 1).	14565	14712
25054547	Km was about 10 times higher than that of the Usual enzyme (18±5 µM) and two times that of the atypical enzyme (150±50 µM) (Control #2 in Table 4).	14713	14860
25054547	The catalytic behavior of the parent’s BChE fits with expected values for heterozygous enzyme tetramers containing half of usual (U) subunits.	14861	15003
25054547	The low Kss of the patient’s mother can be explained by the reduced affinity of BTC for the PAS in K-subunits (Kss value of K-BChE was reported to be two-fold lower than Kss of the usual enzyme).	15004	15199
25054547	According to Eq 1, the two-fold reduced Kss did not significantly affect kinetic measurements at BTC concentrations lower than 10 mM, i.e. performed at 1mM and 7.56 mM.	15200	15368
25054547	Kinetic analysis of the patient’s BChE with BTC as the substrate showed that there was no substrate activation (b = 1), see Individual II-1 in Table 4.	15369	15520
25054547	This fact indicates that the PAS is not functional in p.Val204Asp subunits or that subunits carrying the p.Val204Asp mutation are totally inactive at all BTC concentrations.	15521	15694
25054547	Because the tetrameric enzyme is a hybrid of silent subunits carrying the mutation p.Val204Asp and subunits carrying the two mutations p.Gly70Asp and p.Ala539Thr, Vmax was expected to be reduced compared to parent’s BChE (I-1, I-2) and control BChEs (#1,2).	15695	15952
25054547	However, Vmax in the patient’s BChE was unexpectedly low (Tables 3 and 4).	15953	16027
25054547	This result, was corroborated by electrophoresis data on both activity stained gels and Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels of highly purified BChE (Figs.	16028	16184
25054547	3 and 4), which indicated that the concentration of BChE in the patient’s plasma is lower than the average BChE concentration of 50 nM.	16185	16320
25054547	This suggests that mutation p.Val204Asp may either reduce the biosynthesis of enzyme or more likely destabilizes the enzyme and accelerates its clearance from the bloodstream.	16321	16496
25054547	If the latter possibility is correct this would suggest that mutation p.Val204Asp alters the 3D structure of silent subunits.	16497	16622
25054547	The MD study on p.Val204Asp mutant protein sheds light on this issue.	16623	16692
25054547	An additional cause for the low enzyme concentration could be the p.Ala539Thr mutation.	16693	16780
25054547	Residue Ala539 is involved in the tetramerization domain of BChE.	16781	16846
25054547	Mutation p.Ala539Thr (K variant) was found to destabilize the enzyme structure.	16847	16926
25054547	Therefore the presence of the K variant in subunits carrying the p.Asp70Gly mutation may have also contributed to the low enzyme concentration in the patient’s plasma.	16927	17094
25054547	Comparison of MD trajectories for usual BChE and p.Val204Asp mutant showed that in the mutant, shortly after the beginning of simulation, the catalytic triad is disrupted.	17095	17266
25054547	The side chains of Ser198 and His438 move too far from each other to perform catalysis.	17267	17354
25054547	By contrast, the catalytic triadstays operative during the whole MD trajectory for usual BChE.	17355	17449
25054547	In usual BChE these catalytic residues are maintained in close proximity by a network of hydrogen bonds involving Gln223, Glu441 and Asn322, which bring the α/β-unit turn carrying the catalytic Ser198 close to the loop carrying the catalytic His438 (Fig.	17450	17704
25054547	5).	17705	17708
25054547	Introduction of a charged amino acid instead of Val204 results in establishment of new hydrogen bonds and disruption of the initial bonds.	17709	17847
25054547	Asp204 forms a hydrogen bond with Gly196.	17848	17889
25054547	This causes Gly196 to turn about 90° out of the β-sheet plane (Fig.	17890	17957
25054547	6).	17958	17961
25054547	As a result the Gly196 oxygen backbone forms a hydrogen bond with the Gln223 side chain, instead of with backbone peptide bonds, as for β-sheet strands in usual BChE (Fig.	17962	18133
25054547	5).	17705	17708
25054547	In addition to partial disruption of the β-sheet, this switches hydrogen bonding of the Gln223 side chain from Glu441 to Trp471.	18138	18266
25054547	In the usual BChE the hydrogen bond between Gln223 and Glu441 links together the β-sheet and the loop carrying the catalytic His438.	18267	18399
25054547	For Glu441 new hydrogen bonds are formed in the mutant: 3 hydrogen bonds with peptide bond groups of neighboring residues on the His438 loop (Fig.	18400	18546
25054547	6).	17958	17961
25054547	However, Glu441 still interacts with the Asn322 side chain, as in usual BChE.	18551	18628
25054547	This likely prevents the protein from unfolding.	18629	18677
25054547	In other words, the overall effect of the mutation p.Val240Asp is disruption of hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441.	18678	18801
25054547	This leads the catalytic Ser198 to move away from the loop carrying the catalytic His438 with subsequent disruption of the functional catalytic triad.	18802	18952
25054547	Therefore, BChE subunits carrying this mutation have no activity regardless of the type of substrate.	18953	19054
25054547	This mutation also has an impact on the overall protein structure and causes an increase in the radius of gyration along the MD trajectory of p.Val204Asp BChE compared to the usual BChE (Fig.	19055	19246
25054547	7).	19247	19250
25054547	However it does not cause any significant secondary structure change except for that mentioned above (result not shown).	19251	19371
25054547	The increased gyration radius suggests that the enzyme is in a pre-molten globule state, susceptible to unfolding.	19372	19486
25054547	This statement would thus explain why the BChE concentration is reduced in plasma.	19487	19569
25054547	In conclusion, this work explains how a point mutation (Val204Asp) far from the active site leads to a “silent” BChE phenotype where the BChE enzyme has no activity regardless of the type of substrate, and has a structure that is not recognized by a monoclonal to native BChE.	19570	19846
25054547	MD simulations suggest that the enzyme is in a pre-denaturation state.	19847	19917
25006961	Although lithium is an older antipsychotic, it still remains the most common treatment for bipolar disorder.	0	108
25006961	Lithium also has beneficial effects in multiple other CNS disorders including stroke, multiple sclerosis, HIV-associated neurotoxicity and Huntington disease.	109	267
25006961	Although lithium is effective at treating these and other CNS disorders, the drug is also known to be associated with renal, neurological and endocrine side effects.	268	433
25006961	One of the renal side effects associated with lithium therapy is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) which presents in approximately 40% of patients,.	434	585
25006961	Affected patients present with polyuria, polydipsia, reduced capacity to produce concentrated urine and an inability to respond to vasopressin,.	586	730
25006961	The advancing polyuria associated with lithium-acquired NDI may appear early in the treatment regimen and can be considered a contraindication to continued use.	731	891
25006961	In many cases with chronic use, lithium-induced NDI cannot be reversed thus discontinuing therapy after a certain point may not be advantageous in reducing this side effect.	892	1065
25006961	Ensuing NDI is particularly problematic as the risk for acute renal failure is significantly elevated due to increased circumstance for acute lithium toxicity and/or dehydration from severe polydipsia/polyuria.	1066	1276
25006961	Although not all of the signaling mechanisms underlying lithium-induced NDI have been elucidated, acute administration of lithium inhibits the formation of cAMP–.	1277	1439
25006961	Cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of two critical transporters in the urine concentration mechanism, aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and the urea transporter, UT-A1, is required for translocation and insertion of these transporters into the apical plasma membrane of the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD),.	1440	1741
25006961	This initial dysregulation of vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption contributes to the urine-concentrating defect; however, long-term lithium treatment decreases the protein abundance AQP2 and UT-A1 exacerbating the effect.	1742	1968
25006961	Although lithium-dampened cAMP production is likely the primary cause of NDI, lithium dysregulation of renal prostaglandins, altered purinergic signaling and modifications of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway– have also been implicated.	1969	2214
25006961	To prevent advancing renal side effects resulting from lithium therapy, physicians may have to remove the patient from treatment regardless of its effectiveness on psychotic episodes.	2215	2398
25006961	With the increasing popularity of lithium for treatment of other CNS disorders, there is an increased need to alleviate potential renal side effects that may result in early termination of an otherwise effective treatment.	2399	2621
25006961	Recent studies revealing cAMP-independent pathways that regulate urine concentration,, indicate that targeting regulatory proteins in these signaling cascades may provide novel pharmacological targets to treat vasopressin insensitive NDI.	2622	2860
25006961	Recently, PKCα, a kinase involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling, has been shown to regulate AQP2 and UT-A1 function independently from cAMP–.	2861	3006
25006961	We explored the idea that in the absence of PKCα, the severity of lithium-mediated NDI would be affected using a PKCα null mouse model with the ultimate goal of identifying a potential therapeutic site for prevention of this renal side effect of lithium therapy.	3007	3269
25006961	The findings of our study show that ablation of PKCα significantly offsets lithium-induced NDI in part by preserving the transporters involved in the urine concentration mechanism.	3270	3450
25006961	All animal protocols were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.	3451	3554
25006961	PKCα−/− mice were initially obtained from Dr. Jeffery Molkentin (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center).	3555	3667
25006961	The mice were bred in parallel with wild-type mice from a mixed C57BL/6 x 129 genetic background (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME).	3668	3802
25006961	Each three to four generations PKCα−/− and PKCα+/+ were crossed to generate heterozygotes, which were then bred to produce wild-type (WT) and PKCα-null (PKCα KO) litermates, which were then bred separately.	3803	4009
25006961	All mice were male, ranged between 7–9 weeks of age and between 23-25 grams at the beginning of lithium treatment.	4010	4124
25006961	For short-term lithium treatment, PKCα KO and WT mice were injected intraperitoneally with 40 mmol/kg LiCl in saline every 24 hours for 3 or 5 days.	4125	4273
25006961	For long-term treatment studies, PKCα KO and WT mice were fed either standard diet (containing 23% protein) supplemented with LiCl (40 mmol/kg; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) or standard diet without supplementation for 6 weeks.	4274	4499
25006961	In both treatment groups, mice were given free access to tap water and a salt block to maintain sodium balance and prevent lithium intoxication.	4500	4644
25006961	Mice were individually housed in a Tecniplast Single Mouse Metabolic Cage, (Tecniplast USA Inc, Exton, PA) for a 24-hour acclimation period followed by an additional 24 hours to measure food and fluid intake and collect urine for analysis.	4645	4884
25006961	Proteins (20 µg/lane) were size-separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and then electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA).	4885	5050
25006961	After being blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 hour, blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C.	5051	5167
25006961	Specifically, either a 1∶2000 dilution of an antibody generated against the C-terminal domain of AQP2 (purchased from StressMarq (Victoria, BC, Canada)), or a 1∶1000 dilution of an antibody generated against the C-terminal domain of the UT-A1 transporter (fully characterized by our source of the antibody, Dr. Jeff M. Sands) was used for AQP2 and UT-A1 detection, respectively.	5168	5546
25006961	Blots were next washed three times in tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 and then incubated for 2 hours with Alexa Fluor 680-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1∶4000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).	5547	5739
25006961	Bound secondary antibody was visualized using infrared detection with the LI-COR Odyssey protein analysis system (Lincoln, NE) and densitometry of the desired band was collected.	5740	5918
25006961	To insure equal loading and quantify our densitometric scanning, blots were also probed for β tubulin (1∶500; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) as a loading control.	5919	6089
25006961	Positive detection was observed following incubation with the corresponding secondary antibody, DyLight 800 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1∶5000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).	6090	6273
25006961	The Odyssey system was used to collect densitometry of the β tubulin band.	6274	6348
25006961	Results are expressed as arbitrary units normalized to the densitometry of the loading control, β tubulin.	6349	6455
25006961	Urine osmolality was measured on a Wescor 5520 Vapor Pressure Osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT).	6456	6548
25006961	Serum lithium levels and urinary sodium, chloride and potassium were measured by EasyLyte (Medica, Bedford, MA) instrument.	6549	6672
25006961	Urine creatinine was determined by the Jaffe reaction and serum creatinine was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.	6673	6803
25006961	Urinary calcium was measured by atomic absorption and urinary protein by the Lowery method.	6804	6895
25006961	Kidneys from all four experimental groups were perfusion fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.	6896	6984
25006961	Paraffin sections (5 µm thick) were cut on a Leica microtome and dried overnight at 37°C.	6985	7074
25006961	Slides were then placed in xylene overnight and then rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (30 min in 99% ethanol and 10 min in 96% ethanol) and endogenous peroxidases were blocked with H2O2 (1% H2O2 solution in methanol) for 30 minutes.	7075	7315
25006961	Target retrieval was accomplished by microwaving samples with 10 mmol/l Tris and 0.5 mmol/l EGTA (TEG) buffer.	7316	7426
25006961	To prevent nonspecific antibody binding, sections were further blocked with 50 mmol/l NH4Cl in PBS (30 min).	7427	7535
25006961	Tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber with primary antibody (1∶50,000 C-terminal UT-A1; 1∶10,000 C-terminal AQP2).	7536	7684
25006961	The tissue sections were then incubated the following day with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1∶200, GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 2 hours at room temperature.	7685	7914
25006961	Positive staining was visualized using a diaminobenzidine dye (brown; Amreso, Solon, OH).	7915	8004
25006961	Cell nuclei were also counterstained with hematoxylin (blue; EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ).	8005	8096
25006961	Images were collected with an Olympus 1×51 inverted microscope using a SIS-CC12 CLR camera.	8097	8188
25006961	Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SEM.	8189	8235
25006961	Differences were determined by either t-test or the Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance where appropriate using GraphPad Instat Software (La Jolla, CA).	8236	8396
25006961	We and others have demonstrated that rodents become polyuric within days of lithium treatment,,–.	8397	8494
25006961	Similarly, wild-type littermates (WT) generated 5.3±0.3 ml/24 h urine in as little as 3 days following daily lithium injections (40 mmol/kg/d) (Table 1).	8495	8648
25006961	This urine was 4-fold more dilute than that collected from untreated, WT mice (Figure 1).	8649	8738
25006961	Following 5 days of lithium injections, WT mice produced 7.4±0.5 ml/24 h urine that remained significantly dilute (Figure 1).	8739	8864
25006961	Mice with a global deletion of PKCα (PKCα KO) did not generate more urine after 3 or 5 days of lithium-treatment and osmolality was not significantly altered (Figure 1); however, our data confirm previous reports of slight but significant concentrating defect in PKCα KO mice (Table 1).	8865	9151
25006961	Serum lithium remained below toxicity levels throughout the acute experiments and kidney function was preserved as evidenced by the stable creatinine clearance and urinary protein:urinary creatinine ratio values (Table 1).	9152	9374
25006961	We conclude that although lithium can induce polyuria within 3 days of treatment, the absence of PKCα protected mice from generating large amounts of dilute urine in the same time frame.	9375	9561
25006961	Two transporters located in the apical membrane of the IMCD that are responsible for urine concentration are the water channel, AQP2, and the urea transporter, UT-A1,.	9562	9729
25006961	Absence or dampened expression of one or both of these transporters frequently occurs with clinical maladies that present with polyuria including NDI.	9730	9880
25006961	In WT mice, combined glycosylated and unglycosylated AQP2 expression in the inner medulla was decreased ∼45% following 3 days of lithium injections and ∼84% with continued treatment for 5 days (Figure 2B).	9881	10086
25006961	PKCα KO mice did not display a reduction of AQP2 abundance in the inner medulla after 3 or 5 days of lithium treatment (Figure 2A).	10087	10218
25006961	We observed a similar pattern in lithium-induced reduction of AQP2 expression in outer medullary tissues from WT mice but not from PKCα KO (Figure 2C).	10219	10370
25006961	We also observed that total glycosylated UT-A1 expression was reduced ∼43% in the inner medulla of WT mice after 5 days of lithium injections; however, UT-A1 abundance was unaffected by lithium treatment in the PKCα KO mice (Figure 3).	10371	10606
25006961	We did not investigate alterations of UT-A1 expression in the outer medulla because of the transporters exclusive location to the renal papilla.	10607	10751
25006961	To determine if the absence of PKCα prevents lithium-induced NDI for an extended time, WT and PKCα KO mice were fed either standard chow or chow containing 40 mmol/kg lithium ad libitum for 6 weeks.	10752	10950
25006961	After 6 weeks, lithium-treated mice had elevated lithium serum levels (Table 2), comparable to therapeutic levels in humans.	10951	11075
25006961	Mice from all four experimental groups were housed in metabolic cages during the final 72 hours of treatment.	11076	11185
25006961	Following 24 hours of metabolic cage acclimation, we measured food and water intake and collected urine for 24 hours.	11186	11303
25006961	There was no difference in food intake among the treated and untreated animals (data not shown); however, lithium treatment increased water intake in both WT and PKCα KO mice albeit polydipsia was increased 10-fold in lithium-treated WT mice and only 3-fold in lithium-treated PKCα KO mice (Table 2).	11304	11604
25006961	Urine output was also significantly elevated in lithium-treated PKCα KO mice but not to the extent as observed in lithium-treated WT mice (Table 2).	11605	11753
25006961	Lithium decreased urine osmolality corroborating the developing polyuria with treatment.	11754	11842
25006961	We found that lithium did not change the creatinine clearance rate in either the WT or PKCα KO mice indicating that 6-week lithium treatment did not alter kidney function in these animals.	11843	12031
25006961	Furthermore, the urinary protein-osmolality ratio was not significantly different among the four experimental groups confirming the absence of proteinuria (Table 2).	12032	12197
25006961	Inner medullas collected from untreated WT and PKCα KO mice had comparable expression levels of AQP2 when quantified by Western blot analysis as expected (Figure 4A).	12198	12364
25006961	After 6 weeks of lithium treatment, AQP2 expression in the inner medulla was almost abolished in the WT mice whereas AQP2 levels were decreased 40% in treated PKCα KO mice (Figure 4B).	12365	12549
25006961	In outer medullary tissues, AQP2 abundance was decreased in response to lithium treatment in WT mice; however, lithium only reduced AQP2 expression by 30% in PKCα KO mice (Figure 4D).	12550	12733
25006961	Because PKCα reportedly plays a role in vasopressin-induced AQP2 trafficking, we wanted to determine if the preservation of AQP2 expression in lithium-treated PKCα KO was ineffective due to inability of the channel to reach the apical membrane.	12734	12978
25006961	AQP2 was diffusely localized in the cytosol of inner medullary collecting duct cells in both untreated WT and PKCα KO mice (Figure 5).	12979	13113
25006961	We observed that AQP2 localization was primarily apical in lithium-treated PKCα KO mice (Figure 5).	13114	13213
25006961	UT-A1 expression in the inner medulla was decreased 52% in WT mice treated with lithium for 6 weeks compared to untreated WT mice (Figure 6A).	13214	13356
25006961	Interestingly, UT-A1 expression did not decrease in PKCα KO mice treated with lithium; rather, there was a trend toward an increase in urea transporter expression although this did not reach significance (Figure 6B).	13357	13573
25006961	Despite a decreased abundance, UT-A1 was detected in the apical region of the IMCD in lithium-treated WT mice (Figure 7).	13574	13695
25006961	Expression and cellular localization of UT-A1 is unchanged in the PKCα KO mice treated with lithium (Figure 7).	13696	13807
25006961	Urinary sodium, chloride, potassium and calcium levels were measured in mice from all four experimental groups and normalized to urinary creatinine to compensate for urine volume (Figure 8).	13808	13998
25006961	Following 6 weeks of lithium treatment, natriuresis was observed in the WT mice whereas the PKCα KO mice had no change in sodium excretion (Figure 8A).	13999	14150
25006961	We observed a similar increase in potassium excretion in WT mice treated with lithium (Figure 8B).	14151	14249
25006961	PKCα KO mice displayed no significant changes in potassium excretion (Figure 8C).	14250	14331
25006961	Next we measured urinary calcium and found that lithium-treatment significantly elevated calcium levels in WT mice; however, urinary calcium levels remain unchanged in treated PKCα KO mice (Figure 8D).	14332	14533
25006961	Although lithium is an older antipsychotic, it still remains a popular treatment for bipolar disorder and its therapeutic potential for other central nervous system (CNS) diseases is also gaining favor.	14534	14736
25006961	The fraction of patients that develop lithium-induced NDI are more at risk to become dehydrated, increasing the risk of lithium toxicity,.	14737	14875
25006961	Water balance is maintained in the collecting duct by vasopressin regulation of AQP2 and UT-A1 through a cAMP pathway,; however, recent studies suggest that other signaling pathways can also regulate the urine concentration mechanism,,,-.	14876	15114
25006961	Lithium impairment of cAMP production– led to our exploration of a cAMP-independent pathway involving PKCα, which has been implicated in regulating urine concentration–.	15115	15284
25006961	Our results demonstrate that in the absence of PKCα, mice are protected from lithium-induced NDI from the onset of treatment and, as the regimen progresses; the polyuria is not as severe.	15285	15472
25006961	This may seem counterintuitive given that other studies have shown that PKCα KO mice have a higher flow rate and lower urine osmolality and we observed that at basal state, PKCα KO mice are slightly polyuric (Table 1 and 2).	15473	15697
25006961	In agreement with Yao et.al, we did not see a difference in medullary AQP2 expression between WT and PKCα KO mice (Figure 4) and there are no apparent alterations in the morphology of the inner medulla in PKCα KO mice (Figures 5 and 7).	15698	15934
25006961	Despite the mild, basal polyuria in PKCα KO mice, these animals are able to concentrate urine after water depravation demonstrating that the urine concentration mechanism is preserved.	15935	16119
25006961	Although the mechanism of how PKCα contributes to urine concentration in the basal state remains to be determined, our studies demonstrate that when the concentration mechanism is tested by lithium treatment, the mild polyuria in the PKCα KO mice is overcome and the massive polyuria associated with NDI is attenuated in the absence of the kinase.	16120	16467
25006961	The presence of AQP2 in the IMCD is critical for production of concentrated urine to maintain fluid homeostasis.	16468	16580
25006961	Consequently, protein abundance of AQP2 is increased as a regulatory mechanism to long periods of water deprivation and/or high circulating levels of vasopressin.	16581	16743
25006961	Several animal models of acquired NDI including hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, ureteral obstruction, chloroquine and lithium nephrotoxicity have decreased AQP2 expression in the inner medulla,–; hence the need to understand the transcriptional regulation of the AQP2 gene.	16744	17013
25006961	It is generally accepted that the cAMP-mediated regulation of AQP2 gene transcription is mediated by CREB binding to a documented functional CRE element.	17014	17167
25006961	Although it has been speculated that lithium reduced AQP2 expression by dampening cAMP synthesis, studies by Li et al., showed that lithium reduction of AQP2 mRNA level was independent of cAMP and vasopressin-stimulated PKA phosphorylation of CREB still occurred.	17168	17431
25006961	Our study found that ablation of PKCα prevented the reduction of AQP2 abundance commonly observed in lithium-treated control animals.	17432	17565
25006961	The mechanism behind PKCα suppression of AQP2 is unknown.	17566	17623
25006961	It is possible that in the absence of PKCα, Gi-mediated inhibition of cAMP generation does not occur thus allowing cAMP to remain in the IMCD cell to stimulate CREB-mediated transcription of the AQP2 gene.	17624	17829
25006961	Using systems biology-based approaches, Yu et al., identified several putative transcriptional regulator families and binding elements other than CREB and CRE that may regulate AQP2 gene expression suggesting that PKCα could decrease AQP2 expression by either directly phosphorylating one of these novel transcription factors or indirectly by phosphorylating one or more downstream modifying proteins.	17830	18231
25006961	While detailed mechanisms of down regulation of AQP2 by lithium and other causes of acquired-NDI remain unexplained, our findings support a role for PKCα in this process.	18232	18402
25006961	Unlike AQP2, UT-A1 transcription is not mediated by cAMP but rather through the interaction between the tonicity-responsive enhancer (TonE) and the corresponding transcription factor, TonEBP.	18403	18594
25006961	Our results demonstrate that UT-A1 expression is not altered by lithium in PKCα KO mice.	18595	18683
25006961	Preservation of the urea transporter in the absence of PKCα likely occurs through the persevered tonicity of the medullary interstitium in lithium-treated PKCα KO mice.	18684	18852
25006961	For instance, in long-term cyclosporin A administration, another model of acquired-NDI, downregulation of TonEBP was secondary to the reduced tonicity of medullary interstitium.	18853	19030
25006961	We also observed an ensuing kaliuresis in lithium-treated WT mice.	19031	19097
25006961	Potassium depletion reduces the abundance of TonEBP, possibly explaining why abundance of UT-A1 is not altered in long-term lithium-treated PKCα KO mice that are not potassium wasting.	19098	19282
25006961	In addition to CRE, TonE is also present in the AQP2 gene which could contribute to the cAMP independent reduction of AQP2 mRNA by lithium.	19283	19422
25006961	In addition to persevering AQP2 expression, we found that in the absence of PKCα, AQP2 expression was highly localized to the apical membrane of the IMCD following long-term lithium treatment.	19423	19615
25006961	Studies indicate that the inhibitory action of PKC on vasopressin-stimulated water permeability is due to PKC-initiated endocytosis of AQP2.	19616	19756
25006961	Although PKC does not directly interact with AQP2, activation of PKC leads to the short-chain ubiquitination of AQP2 resulting in lysosomal degradation of the channel.	19757	19924
25006961	Reports show that the PKCα isoform is involved in α-tubulin assembly in renal cells and microtubule-dependent trafficking of AQP2 regulates intracellular localization following internalization; however, microtubules are not involved in the exocytic transport of the channel.	19925	20199
25006961	In fact, overexpression of a constitutively active PKCα construct in IMCD cells prevented translocation of AQP2 to the plasma membrane and resulted in AQP2 distribution throughout the cytoplasm.	20200	20394
25006961	Our data support these collective findings and indicate that in the absence of PKCα, AQP2 remains at the apical membrane despite a lithium-mediated reduction in cAMP concentration.	20395	20575
25006961	Recently Zhang et al., discovered that lithium-induced natriuresis and kaliuresis is not as severe in mice lacking the P2Y2 receptor.	20576	20709
25006961	We found that in the absence of PKCα, the onset of natriuresis and kaliuresis with lithium treatment was blocked.	20710	20823
25006961	Given that the creatinine clearance and the osmolality:protein ratio was unchanged in either WT or PKCα KO mice in response to lithium, it is unlikely that an alteration in glomerular filtration or kidney injury is contributing to the observed natriuretic responses.	20824	21090
25006961	The determination of any altered response of sodium and potassium transporters along the nephron is beyond the scope of this manuscript but will be intriguing for future studies.	21091	21269
25006961	Regardless, our current findings suggest that the downstream target of purinergic signaling, PKCα, is an important regulator in water and solute absorption.	21270	21426
25006961	We also observed that lithium-treated PKCα KO mice did not display the hypercalciuria observed in treated WT mice.	21427	21541
25006961	Polyuria is often clinically correlated with hypercalcemia and resulting hypercalciuria in several fluid balance disorders including the chronic administration of lithium,.	21542	21714
25006961	Increased urinary calcium is sensed by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), located in the apical membrane of the collecting duct.	21715	21845
25006961	Studies suggest that activation of collecting duct CaSR by elevated urinary calcium reduces the expression of AQP2 resulting in decreased water reabsorption.	21846	22003
25006961	Bustamante et al. demonstrated that cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells chronically exposed to extracellular calcium reduced both AQP2 mRNA and protein levels while CaSR gene silencing counteracted this effect.	22004	22215
25006961	AQP2 was also reduced in the inner medulla of animal models of hypercalciuria including hypercalciuric rats, and TRPV5 null mice.	22216	22345
25006961	Furthermore, hypercalciuria is associated with elevated levels of urinary AQP2 in enuretic children.	22346	22446
25006961	PKCα, one of the conventional PKC isoforms that requires calcium for activation, is stimulated in response to extracellular calcium treatment in CCD cells.	22447	22602
25006961	These reports combined with our findings suggest an interesting interaction between PKCα, and the known association of hypercalciuria with decreased AQP2 expression and CaSR activation.	22603	22788
25006961	In conclusion, we discovered that the development of lithium-mediated NDI is not as severe in the absence of PKCα.	22789	22903
25006961	Although lithium remains the drug of choice for treating psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder, many patients experience several side effects including acquired-NDI.	22904	23080
25006961	Our findings indicate that adding a PKC inhibitor to a prescribed lithium regimen will prevent deleterious renal side effects.	23081	23207
25006961	Treating patients simultaneously with the CNS-penetrant PKC inhibitor, tamoxifen, and lithium reduces the number of manic episodes compared to patients on lithium therapy alone, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of PKC to alleviate the renal side effects of lithium will not hamper the effectiveness of lithium as an anti-psychotic but is in fact beneficial.	23208	23575
24743235	Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a hematopoietic cytokine that is secreted by activated T and mast cells (MCs),,.	0	104
24743235	It is produced during allergic inflammations or in response to parasitic infections, and has been considered a Th2 response promoter,.	105	239
24743235	IL-3 is necessary for optimal immunity against helminthes, reflecting its role in enhancing generation of systemic basophils and tissue MCs.	240	380
24743235	The hallmark of IL-3 is its capacity to stimulate proliferation of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells, particularly those of the myeloid lineage, at various developmental stages,.	381	583
24743235	As such, IL-3 has been recognized as a multi-potential colony-stimulating factor (multi-CSF),.	584	678
24743235	IL-3 stimulates ex vivo generation of MCs, macrophages, basophils and CD11c+ cells in mouse bone marrow (BM),.	679	789
24743235	The hematopoietic effect of IL-3 has been shown to be strain-specific.	790	860
24743235	In contrast to IL-3, CSF-1 or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is produced in the steady state, with a much more restricted hematopoietic coverage, primarily regulating development of the monocyte lineage,,, and has been reported to have a role in developing dendritic cells (DCs).	861	1154
24743235	The capacity of IL-3 to promote multilineage development has been examined in conjunction with several cytokines.	1155	1268
24743235	For instance, IL-3, IL-6 and stem cell factor mediate generation of granulocytes and monocytes, and this combination has been used to study myeloid lineage commitment of C57BL/6 mice,.	1269	1453
24743235	Together with TNFα, IL-3 is a potent cytokine in generation of Langerhans cells from human cord blood CD34+ hematopoetic progenitor cells (HPCs).	1454	1599
24743235	In humans, IFNγ cooperates with IL-3 to enhance expansion of HPCs, while IFNβ and IL-3 induce monocyte differentiation into DCs, which potently stimulate helper T cells.	1600	1769
24743235	IL-4 and IL-3 initiate human monocyte differentiation into Th2-polarizing DCs.	1770	1848
24743235	While IL-3 and CSF-1 were known to act synergistically in induction of BM colonies and CSF-1R+ hematopoietic cells,, their hematopoietic relationship has not been fully characterized.	1849	2032
24743235	With advanced knowledge in leukocyte biology and cellular/molecular techniques, we revisited earlier studies on IL-3 hematopoiesis and its lineage relationship with CSF-1 and addressed issues pertinent to a) phenotypic identifications of leukocyte populations induced by IL-3 with and without CSF-1 in BM ex vivo, b) the effect of CSF-1 in IL-3 multilineage hematopoiesis and associated molecular pathways and c) clarification of macrophage or DC induction as previously reported and their immunological functions.	2033	2547
24743235	We identified an instructive role of CSF-1 in IL-3-mediated hematopoiesis and demonstrated that the combination of the two cytokines stimulated expansion of CD11c+ macrophages that produced IL-10 with a minimal T cell stimulation capacity.	2548	2787
24743235	C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice (aged 6–10 wk) used throughout this study were purchased from the Animal Resources Centre (Canning Vale, Western Australia).	2788	2936
24743235	These mice, together with Csf1r-EGFP (MacGreen) derived from the University of Queensland, were maintained in the animal facilities of Griffith University (Gold Coast, Australia).	2937	3116
24743235	All experimental procedures were conducted following the animal ethics guideline of Griffith University Animal Ethics Committee (GLY/06/12/AEC).	3117	3261

24743235	To examine cell morphology, cells were imaged by the 40X lens in bright field in a 24-well plate, using the ECLIPSE TS100 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).	4355	4510
24743235	CD11c+ and T cells were purified by magnetic cell sorting.	4511	4569
24743235	To purify CD11c+ cells, BM culture cells were incubated with anti-CD11c (N418) MAC beads (10 µl/107 cells) (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) in the presence of 2% FCS and 2 mM EDTA in PBS at 4°C for 15 min.	4570	4772

Plates were washed and biotin coated detection antibody added for 2 h. Streptavidin-horseradish-peroxidase and the substrate (R&D) were added and the colorimetric reaction was stopped by 2N H2SO4.	5459	5822
24743235	The optical density of each well was determined at 450 nm by Wallac Vitor3 1420 Multi-label Counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).	5823	5950
24743235	Cells were stimulated with LPS (1 µg/ml) derived from Escherichia coli (0111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37°C for 24 h. Cells (5×105) were collected, washed and incubated with Fc Block at 4°C for 5 min.	5951	6162

24743235	Cells were then labeled with APC-eFlour780-anti-CD11c.	6740	6794
24743235	The capacity of CD11c+ cells in dextran uptake was evaluated.	6795	6856
24743235	BM cell culture was harvested at day 3 and lineage-depleted.	6857	6917
24743235	Briefly, cells were pelleted and incubated with biotin-lineage antibody cocktail (10 µl/107 cells) (Miltenyi Biotec), followed by anti-biotin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec).	6918	7089

24743235	Primers were designed for the quantification of C/EBPA (F 5 CGG TGC GCA AGA GCC GAG AT; R 5 CCC GCA GCG TGT CCA GTT CA) and c-fos (F 5 ACT AGA GAC GGA CAG ATC TG; R 5 ATA ACG GGA ACG CAG CAG TA).	7630	7825
24743235	Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 (QuantiTec, Qiagen, Victoria, Australia) and presented as the relative level of expression.	7826	7969
24743235	Purified C57BL/6 CD11c+ cells (2–8×103) derived from IL-3, IL-3/CSF-1 and GM-CSF culture were co-cultured in triplicates with purified 2×104 Balb/c T cells, which had been labeled with 5 µM CFSE, in a 96-well round bottom plate.	7970	8198
24743235	At day 3, cells were collected and T cell proliferation was evaluated by CFSE fluorescence in flow cytometry.	8199	8308
24743235	The percentages of cells proliferated were determined by gating on CD3+ cell populations with descended FITC fluorescence.	8309	8431
24743235	All data are shown as the mean ± SEM, where statistical analysis is required.	8432	8509
24743235	Significance between experimental groups was determined by the p value (<0.05), using student t test or one-way ANOVA.	8510	8628
24743235	We have examined the effect of IL-3 on cell generation kinetics of BM ex vivo. IL-3 primarily induced three cell populations, CD11b+CD11c+ cells, FcεRI+c-kit– basophils and FcεRI+c-kit+ MCs (Fig.	8629	8824
24743235	1).	8825	8828
24743235	The rapid increase in numbers of CD11c+ cells was followed by moderate expansion of basophils, whereas the development of MCs occurred later (Fig.	8829	8975
24743235	1).	8825	8828
24743235	This sequential induction of three distinct IL-3 regulated populations may be linked to their specific roles at various stages of the allergic immune response.	8980	9139
24743235	While CSF-1 alone had a minimal effect on DC generation, the addition of CSF-1 into IL-3 treated cultures significantly increased both the percentage and absolute number of CD11c+ cells, with the percentage peaking at day 12 and absolute number at day 9 (Fig.	9140	9399
24743235	1A and 1B).	9400	9411
24743235	CSF-1/IL-3 induced more than a two-fold increase of the CD11c+ cell yield, compared with IL-3 treatment alone (Fig.	9412	9527
24743235	1A and 1B).	9400	9411
24743235	In contrast to CD11c+ cells, IL-3-induced generation of basophils and MCs, both in percentages and numbers, was depressed by the addition of CSF-1 (Fig.	9540	9692
24743235	1C and 1D).	9693	9704
24743235	Both IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 had a comparable potent effect in inducing overall cell expansion (Fig.	9705	9801
24743235	S1).	9802	9806
24743235	There was no effect of CSF-1 on expansion of CD11c+ cells with GM-CSF (Fig.	9807	9882
24743235	S2A), a potent cytokine that is associated with the generation of inflammatory DCs, even though CSF-1 was able to enhance generation of total cells in cultures containing this cytokine (Fig.	9883	10073
24743235	S2B).	10074	10079
24743235	We further investigated the mechanism by which CSF-1 modulates the IL-3-mediated hematopoietic pathway.	10080	10183
24743235	CD11c+ cell generation mediated by IL-3 was significantly inhibited when CSF-1R was blocked with AFS98 (Fig.	10184	10292
24743235	2A).	10293	10297
24743235	In contrast, the AFS98 antibody had no effect on the generation of CD11c+ cells induced by GM-CSF (Fig S3).	10298	10405
24743235	In a positive control, AFS98 blocked the action of CSF-1, resulting in a similar level of CD11c+ cell generation to that seen in the AFS98 treated IL-3 culture (Fig.	10406	10571
24743235	2A).	10293	10297
24743235	The dependence of IL-3 on CSF-1R in inducing CD11c+ generation was further validated by two findings.	10577	10678
24743235	First, expression of the CSF-1R reporter c-fms/EGFP in MacGreen BM cells was rapidly induced by IL-3 with or without CSF-1 (Fig.	10679	10807
24743235	2B).	10075	10079
24743235	Second, albeit at a low level, CSF-1 was produced and remained at a constant level at the early stage of IL-3 culture (Fig.	10813	10936
24743235	2C), while IL-34, another cytokine known to signal through CSF-1R, was not detected (data not shown).	10937	11038
24743235	We next examined how CSF-1 transcriptionally regulates IL-3 induction of CD11c+ cells.	11039	11125
24743235	Monopoiesis and granulopoiesis have been linked to transcriptional factors c-Fos and C/EBPα, respectively,,.	11126	11234
24743235	Indeed, in early lineage-depleted progenitor cells, CSF-1 significantly enhanced expression of transcriptional factor c-Fos, whereas it reduced expression of C/EBPα (Fig.	11235	11405
24743235	2D).	11406	11410
24743235	IL-3 stimulates JAK/STAT, which activates and upregulates c-Fos and cell proliferation.	11411	11498
24743235	CSF-1 preferentially activates ERK and induces expression of c-Fos that enhances monopoiesis,.	11499	11593
24743235	Thus, CSF-1 skews IL-3-mediated hematopoiesis towards monopoiesis through reinforcing c-Fos, promoting differentiation of the CD11c+ monocytic pool,.	11594	11743
24743235	We next compared the maturation phenotype and functions of IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 CD11c+ cells.	11744	11836
24743235	Phenotypically, both populations expressed similar levels of costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-class I (H2Kb) and II (IA, IE) (Fig.	11837	11983
24743235	3A).	11984	11988
24743235	After LPS stimulation, IL-3/CSF-1 CD11c+ cells exhibited a more mature phenotype, expressing higher levels of co-stimulatory markers, particularly CD86 (Fig.	11989	12146
24743235	3A).	11984	11988
24743235	Both populations were comparable in their abilities to take up antigens based on FITC-dextran binding at 4°C and internalization at 37°C for 15 min (Fig.	12152	12305
24743235	3B).	12306	12310
24743235	After 7 days of culture, both cell populations were adherent; however, IL-3/CSF-1 cells were more elongated/spreading in appearance resembling macrophages (Fig.	12311	12471
24743235	3C).	12472	12476
24743235	Neither of the cell populations exhibited the conventional DC morphology.	12477	12550
24743235	In response to LPS, both CD11c+ purified populations produced comparable levels of TNFα, IL-1β and a relatively high level of IL-6, (Fig.	12551	12688
24743235	3D).	12689	12693
24743235	Both produced IL-10, with IL-3/CSF-1 CD11c+ cell expression detected at a lower level, while IFNγ expression was not detected at all (data not shown).	12694	12844
24743235	In the mixed lymphocyte reactions (Fig.	12845	12884
24743235	3E), both IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 CD11c+ cells failed to efficiently stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation, with much lower levels of percentages on proliferated T cells, in contrast to GM-CSF-derived DCs.	12885	13090
24743235	These data support that IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1-derived CD11c+ cells are macrophages with a possible regulatory phenotype.	13091	13209
24743235	Although both express CD11c, CD11b, costimulatory molecules and MHC-class II (Fig.	13210	13292
24743235	3A), in contrast with the data reported in a previous study, we did not find any evidence to suggest that they have conventional myeloid DC properties.	13293	13444
24743235	Hence, expression of these cell surface markers under specific cytokine conditions or in response to certain inflammatory cues is insufficient to classify a monocytic cell population as DCs.	13445	13635
24743235	The ability of CSF-1 to modulate the IL-3-driven hematopoietic pathway may have implications in allergic inflammations.	13636	13755
24743235	IL-3 is the major inducer of blood basophils and tissue mast cells, which are FcεRI+ effector cells that regulate immediate hypersensitivity.	13756	13897
24743235	CSF-1 may on one hand mitigate overproduction of basophils and mast cells that can cause undesired tissue damage, while on the other hand mobilizing IL-10-producing monocytic cells that exert anti-inflammatory functions and/or facilitate the development of Th2 and humoral responses.	13898	14181
24743235	An alternative perspective is that, because CSF-1 drives CD11c-MHC-class II- macrophage generation, IL-3 may function to divert from a wound healing (mediated by CSF-1 alone) to an immunomodulatory phenotype.	14182	14390
24743235	Nevertheless, the ability of IL-3 together with CSF-1 to regulate CD11c+ macrophage expansion highlights the role of cytokine combination in plasticity of the BM progenitors that further contributes to the heterogeneity of the antigen-presenting cell system.	14391	14649
21042587	Glucocorticoids are one of the most important class of steroid hormones that regulate essential biological processes including development, metabolism, growth, inflammatory processes, behavior and apoptosis.	0	207
21042587	Glucocorticoid actions are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a nuclear receptor encoded by the NR3C1 gene.	208	326
21042587	GR is ubiquitously expressed as two distinct isoforms GRα and GRβ.	327	393
21042587	These isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of the last exon 9α or exon 9β of NR3C1 and differ by their last carboxy terminal amino acids and their transcriptional activities.	394	578
21042587	GR regulates a large variety of gene expression in responses to glucocorticoid hormones,.	579	668
21042587	A closely related nuclear receptor, the mineralocorticoid receptor also binds glucocorticoid hormones.	669	771
21042587	However, in classical aldosterone target tissues, such as the distal nephron and the colon, the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2) metabolizes cortisol into inactive derivative cortisone and prevents permanent MR activation leading to inappropriate sodium retention and subsequent arterial hypertension.	772	1097
21042587	To date, twelve germinal mutations of the human GR have been identified; most of them are heterozygous missense mutations causing partial loss of function of the GR,,.	1098	1265
21042587	These NR3C1 mutations compromise various steps of the glucocorticoid signalling pathway and cause primary glucocorticoid resistance (OMIM 138040), a rare hereditary disease with generalized partial insensitivity to glucocorticoid action.	1266	1503
21042587	However, the clinical presentation of primary glucocorticoid resistance is very diverse from severe signs of mineralocorticoid excess due to elevated aldosterone levels, and hyperandrogenia, to mild or asymptomatic forms.	1504	1725
21042587	This variable phenotype is associated with a wide genetic heterogeneity due to various missense mutations affecting distinct functional domains of the nuclear receptor and responsible for impaired glucocorticoid signalling.	1726	1949
21042587	Up to date, non-sense mutation of NR3C1 has never been described.	1950	2015
21042587	We report herein, the discovery of the first heterozygous nonsense mutation in the human GR.	2016	2108
21042587	We describe a clear-cut clinical, cellular and molecular characterization of a stop mutation and demonstrate that an impaired translation of mutant mRNA in vivo causes GR haploinsufficiency.	2109	2299
21042587	This mutation NR3C1 p.R469[R,X] identified in a French family with eight affected siblings spanning three generations gives a unique opportunity to study the natural history of GR haploinsufficiency as previously reported in mouse models.	2300	2538
21042587	We thus infer that GR haploinsufficiency in humans is responsible of a discrete phenotype of subclinical hypercortisolism, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and arterial hypertension.	2539	2718
21042587	This unusual clinical presentation, most notably incidentally discovered adrenal hyperplasia, progresses gradually throughout the life cycle, and clearly differs from that previously described during primary glucocorticoid resistance associated with other NR3C1 missense mutations.	2719	3000
21042587	We finally provide evidence that arterial hypertension in this family is related to an illicit MR activation in the kidney, due to altered renal 11βHSD2 activity and hypercortisolism rather than to elevated mineralocorticoids as previously proposed for primary glucocorticoid resistance.	3001	3288
21042587	Thus, GR haploinsufficiency might be an underestimated cause of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and arterial hypertension.	3289	3409
21042587	The 46-year-old French Caucasian male propositus (subject II.3, Fig.	3410	3478
21042587	1A) was referred for evaluation of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia discovered incidentally during computerized tomography (CT) performed for lumbago.	3479	3626
21042587	His personal history was marked by recent onset of arterial hypertension (190 mm Hg systolic values).	3627	3728
21042587	Physical examination showed no signs of Cushing's syndrome such as striae bruises, amyotrophy or faciotroncular obesity (Fig.	3729	3854
21042587	1B).	3855	3859
21042587	Biochemical evaluation showed normal glycemia (4.1 mmol/L), moderate hypokalemia (3.5 mmol/L) with inappropriate kaliuresis (55 mmol/d) and normal renal function.	3860	4022
21042587	Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) excretion, measured by mass spectrometry-HPLC, was 2- to 4-higher than normal while serum ACTH levels were inappropriate and increased after the CRH test (Table 1).	4023	4232
21042587	Further endocrine evaluation showed a preserved circardian cortisol cycle but markedly elevated midnight cortisolemia (248 nmol/L).	4233	4364
21042587	An overnight 1-mg dexamethasone (DEX) suppression test failed to completely suppress plasma cortisol (nadir 119 nmol/L, N <50).	4365	4492
21042587	Supine aldosterone and active renin levels were undetectable (Table 1) and deoxycorticosterone values were low (40 pg/ml, N 40-200).	4493	4625
21042587	In contrast, the urinary tetrahydrocortisone/tetrahydrocortisol ratio (THE/THF) was low (0.92, N>1.5), suggesting impaired renal 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2) activity.	4626	4814
21042587	Abdominal CT revealed bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (Fig.	4815	4885
21042587	1C, middle panel).	4886	4904
21042587	Normal bone density and osteocalcin levels ruled out detrimental consequences of the cortisol excess on bone structure and metabolism.	4905	5039
21042587	Magnetic resonance imaging showed normal pituitary and no muscle atrophy and no abdominal or subcutaneous adipose depots.	5040	5161
21042587	The two affected brothers of the propositus (subjects II.5 and II.7, Fig.	5162	5235
21042587	1A) had no clinical features of Cushing's syndrome despite hypercortisolism and insufficiently suppressed plasma or salivary cortisol with low or undetectable renin and aldosterone values (Table 1).	5236	5434
21042587	The THE/THF ratio was abnormally low in both cases (Table 1).	5435	5496
21042587	CT also revealed bilateral nodular adrenal hyperplasia in subject II.5 (not shown).	5497	5580
21042587	The 72-year-old mother (I.2, Fig.	5581	5614
21042587	1A) had a history of severe uncontrolled arterial hypertension and hypokalemia (Table 1), with no clinical features of hypercortisolism or hyperandrogenism (testosterone 0.31 ng/mL, N 0.1-0.4, D4-androstenedione 1.3 ng/mL, N 0.6-1.6, DHEAS 400 ng/ml, N 200-2300).	5615	5878
21042587	Her bone mineral density was at the upper limit of normal for her age despite probable longstanding glucocorticoid excess.	5879	6001
21042587	UFC and midnight plasma cortisol levels were elevated and remained high after an overnight DEX suppression test (Table 1).	6002	6124
21042587	Aldosterone was undetectable.	6125	6154
21042587	Her THE/THF ratio was also abnormally low (Table 1).	6155	6207
21042587	CT revealed bilateral nodular adrenal hyperplasia (Fig.	6208	6263
21042587	1C, upper panel).	6264	6281
21042587	The proband's 9-year-old affected daughter (III.2, Fig.	6282	6337
21042587	1A) has normal height, growth and prepubertal development (S2, P1), without clinical hypercortisolism or hyperandrogenism.	6338	6460
21042587	Her UFC was increased, with inappropriately high ACTH levels (Table 1).	6461	6532
21042587	Androgen levels were very low.	6533	6563
21042587	CT also revealed slightly enlarged adrenal glands for her age (Fig.	6564	6631
21042587	1C, lower panel).	6632	6649
21042587	Subject III.5, a 14-year-old daughter of subject II.7, had normal development and regular menses that started at age 12 years.	6650	6776
21042587	She shows no signs of hypercorticism despite a 4-fold increase in UFC and a negative suppression test (Table 1).	6777	6889
21042587	All these clinical and endocrine abnormalities raised the diagnosis of familial generalized glucocorticoid resistance and prompted us to search for genetic defects.	6890	7054
21042587	We also studied some unaffected family members, including three with normal hormone levels (Table 1) and one with a normal abdominal CT (not shown), in order to demonstrate phenotype and genotype co-segregation.	7055	7266
21042587	After sequencing the ten exons and the exon-intron boundaries of the proband's hGR gene, a single heterozygous cytosine to thymidine substitution was identified in exon 4 at nucleotide position 1405 (Fig.	7267	7471
21042587	2A), replacing a CGA (arginine) by a TGA stop codon at amino acid 469 in the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of GR.	7472	7600
21042587	This p.R469X mutation results, as expected, in a truncated GR molecule of 468 amino-acids (Fig.	7601	7696
21042587	2B).	7697	7701
21042587	Interestingly, this nucleotide substitution abrogates the Bsp119I restriction site (TTCGAA), thus facilitating rapid identification of the mutation in the amplified exon 4 sequence (Fig.	7702	7888
21042587	2C).	7889	7893
21042587	This heterozygous nonsense mutation was detected in eight heterozygous individuals (see Fig.	7894	7986
21042587	1A: I.2, II.3, II.5, II.7, III.2, III.3, III.4 and III.5), absent in unaffected family members and in 100 unrelated Caucasians.	7987	8114
21042587	The functional properties of the hGRα-R469X mutant were assayed in human HEK 293 cells by transient transfection experiments.	8115	8240
21042587	As expected from the DBD truncation, the hGRα-R469X mutant migrated as a ∼50-kDa band as shown by Western blot with an antibody recognizing the N-terminal part of GR (Fig.	8241	8412
21042587	3A) and by autoradiography of the radiolabeled receptor obtained in a translation-coupled-to-transcription assay (Fig.	8413	8531
21042587	3B).	8532	8536
21042587	The mutant receptor was unable to bind DNA as shown by gel retardation assay (Fig.	8537	8619
21042587	3C) neither to translocate to the nucleus after dexamethasone exposure (Fig.	8620	8696
21042587	3D).	8697	8701
21042587	Finally, the mutant was unable to transactivate the GRE2-Luc reporter gene in the absence or presence of hormone (Fig.	8702	8820
21042587	3E).	8821	8825
21042587	Fibroblasts cultured from a proband skin biopsy sample were used for molecular characterization of the endogenous GR mutation in vivo.	8826	8960
21042587	The presence of the heterozygous GR mutation in genomic DNA from fibroblasts of individual II.3 was confirmed.	8961	9071
21042587	However, direct sequencing of cDNA failed to detect any mutated transcripts (Fig.	9072	9153
21042587	4A, upper panel).	9154	9171
21042587	This was consistent with selective degradation of the mutated GR mRNA through a nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay (NMD), a specific quality-control mechanism that eliminates aberrant mRNAs harboring a premature termination codon before the last exon.	9172	9417
21042587	The involvement of this active process was unambiguously demonstrated as treatment of patient fibroblasts with either emetine or cycloheximide, two potent NMD inhibitors, stabilized the mutant mRNA expressed from the defective allele (Fig.	9418	9657
21042587	4A) and significantly increased the total amount of GR mRNA levels as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig.	9658	9772
21042587	4B).	9773	9777
21042587	Furthermore, GR mRNA levels expressed in patient fibroblasts were approximately half those measured in two controls (Fig.	9778	9899
21042587	4C).	9900	9904
21042587	DEX binding assays accordingly demonstrated a 50% decrease in the number of fibroblast hormone-binding sites as compared to controls (Fig.	9905	10043
21042587	4D).	10044	10048
21042587	Given the drastic reduction in GR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and the absence of defective allele expression, we suspected that the mutated GR protein was not expressed in vivo.	10049	10245
21042587	Indeed, the 50-kDa mutated GR species was undetectable by western blot whereas a 50% reduction in the 90-kDa WT GR molecule was observed (Fig.	10246	10388
21042587	4E).	10389	10393
21042587	Finally, owing to this decrease in the functional GR concentration in the proband's fibroblasts, significantly below-normal induction of FKBP5, a glucocorticoid-induced target gene, was observed after DEX exposure (Fig.	10394	10613
21042587	4F).	10614	10618
21042587	Altogether, these findings unambiguously establish that the heterozygous nonsense mutation p.R469[R,X] results in GR haploinsufficiency that ultimately compromises glucocorticoid signaling in vivo. We describe a family carrying the first heterozygous nonsense mutation (R469X) in the GR gene.	10619	10911
21042587	This germinal mutation results in partial glucocorticoid resistance associated with subclinical hypercortisolism, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and hypertension but yet low mineralocorticoid levels, aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone, defining an apparent mineralocorticoid excess.	10912	11194
21042587	In vitro characterization revealed that the GR p.R469X mutant is unable to bind hormones and DNA.	11195	11292
21042587	GR p.R469X mutant does not exhibit any ligand-dependant nuclear translocation nor display transcriptional activity.	11293	11408
21042587	In vivo functional characterization of the endogenous heterozygous nonsense mutation demonstrated that the molecular mechanism underlying glucocorticoid insensitivity in this kindred involves GR haploinsufficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay (NMD).	11409	11662
21042587	This mechanism of glucocorticoid signaling dysfunction differs from that induced by other heterozygous missense GR mutations that impair one or several steps of the GR activation cascade and/or exert dominant negative effect on wild-type GR.	11663	11904
21042587	The rare familial or sporadic cases of primary glucocorticoid resistance are associated with mild to very severe clinical presentations.	11905	12041
21042587	In this family, the clinical presentation was quite unusual.	12042	12102
21042587	Indeed, adrenal incidentalomas are emerging as an increasingly important clinical entity owing to the routine use of efficient imaging techniques.	12103	12249
21042587	Its prevalence increases with age, affecting as much as 10% of the elderly.	12250	12325
21042587	Among clinically unapparent adrenal masses, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia often causes difficulties of diagnostic and management.	12326	12455
21042587	Investigation of adrenal incidentalomas leads to the identification of this nonsense mutation in eight individuals spanning three generations allowing us to examine the natural history of the disease and to study the effects of human GR deficiency throughout the life cycle.	12456	12730
21042587	Moderate hypercortisolism is associated with an almost normal phenotype with normal fertility and no virilization in affected women.	12731	12863
21042587	A striking observation is the extent of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia which progresses gradually, probably owing to chronic exposure to inappropriate ACTH levels; this clinical presentation resembles that of heterozygous GR+/− mice.	12864	13096
21042587	Alternatively, altered intraadrenal glucocorticoid-regulated adrenocortical cell signaling could play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of the disease.	13097	13251
21042587	Besides GR, glucocorticoids also bind the closely related mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).	13252	13342
21042587	Therefore, despite a drastic reduction in normal GR abundance, longstanding glucocorticoid excess may have deleterious effects through MR binding.	13343	13489
21042587	In classical aldosterone target tissues such as the distal nephron, the enzyme 11βHSD2 metabolizes cortisol into inactive cortisone and prevents permanent MR activation with subsequent sodium retention and arterial hypertension.	13490	13718
21042587	Indeed, the THE/THF ratio was low and fell gradually over the generations in this kindred, strongly suggesting impaired activity of renal 11βHSD2, a direct GR target gene.	13719	13890
21042587	Owing to the absence of elevated aldosterone and DOC levels, increased cortisol levels induce illicit occupation and activation of the unprotected MR leading to an apparent mineralocorticoid excess with hypertension and hypokalemia.	13891	14123
21042587	Glucocorticoid-activated MR could also trigger proadipogenic effects, or affect neuron function, although this needs to be investigated in patients with glucocorticoid receptor haploinsufficiency.	14124	14320
21042587	On the other hand, the absence of hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia in the propositus despite chronically high glucocorticoid levels, suggests that the reduction in hepatic or adipose GR levels might somehow protect against glucose intolerance or metabolic alterations as observed in equivalent animal models,,.	14321	14630
21042587	It remains to be established how and to which extent such an unbalanced GR dosage affects metabolic, central nervous system or cardiovascular functions in these affected individuals.	14631	14813
21042587	In conclusion, our results provide first evidence for a new human genetic defect due to nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay responsible for GR hapoinsufficiency.	14814	14968
21042587	Indeed, GR haploinsufficiency identified in this family compromises glucocorticoid sensitivity and may represent a novel genetic cause of subclinical hypercortisolism, incidentally revealed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and mineralocorticoid-independent hypertension.	14969	15236
21042587	We propose that a GR genetic screening should be proposed and particularly relevant in such patients given the possible therapeutic potential of MR antagonists,.	15237	15398

23285048	Hematopoiesis is the process by which new blood cells are generated and occurs mainly in the adult bone marrow (BM).	0	116
23285048	The importance of the BM microenvironment in regulating hematopoiesis has been amply demonstrated by studying the so-called “stem cell niches”, in which the endosteal and vascular niches were shown to support hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation–.	117	408
23285048	However, recent findings have proven this interpretation of the BM stem cell niches may to be too simplistic,.	409	519
23285048	Interestingly, the vascular niche is not only critical for HSC maintenance– and differentiation, but also for hematopoietic reconstitution and recovery–.	520	673
23285048	Mechanistically, the BM endothelial cells were shown to express different “angiocrine genes”, whose production is dependent on the activation of Akt or MAP kinase signaling pathways, and whose function is to restore hematopoiesis following insults such as irradiation.	674	942
23285048	Therefore, targeting the BM vascular niche and angiocrine genes production to modulate hematopoietic recovery and function may be of clinical relevance.	943	1095
23285048	We found Delta-like 4 (Dll4, a ligand of the Notch signaling pathway expressed by BM endothelial cells) targeting to potentially fulfill this aim.	1096	1242
23285048	Blockade of Dll4-mediated Notch signaling has been described as a modulator of tumor angiogenesis.	1243	1341
23285048	Indeed, its inhibition, by promoting non-productive angiogenesis, was shown to be an effective treatment strategy in pre-clinical solid tumor models–, and is already being tested in clinical trials,.	1342	1541
23285048	We have explored the effects of Dll4 blockade in the BM vascular niche using two strategies, first by using different endothelial cell markers, to assess qualitative changes in BM vasculature, and secondly by exploring the modulation of “angiocrine genes” in vivo and EC-specific activation of signaling pathways in vitro.	1542	1864
23285048	To characterize the phenotypic response of the BM vascular niche to anti-Dll4 antibody treatment, we used different EC markers (CD31, CD105, VE-Cadherin, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) and Lycopersicon esculentum lectin–), SMA (smooth muscle actin, a pericyte marker), and by counting megakaryocyte numbers (which are part of the BM vascular niche, and are CD41+–).	1865	2254
23285048	Additionally, we assessed the effect of Dll4 blockade in modulating the expression of angiocrine genes and activation of signaling pathways on BM endothelial cells in vitro.	2255	2428
23285048	We also determined how Dll4 systemic blockade interfered with hematopoiesis by directly affecting hematopoietic cells.	2429	2547
23285048	Dll4 has been shown to be involved in HSCs self-renewal and proliferation–, megakaryocytic differentiation, and lymphoid modulation,–.	2548	2682
23285048	However, the hematopoietic effects of Dll4 blockade, namely in the setting of perturbed BM function, had not been previously shown.	2683	2814
23285048	We performed in vivo phenotypic characterization of the main BM hematopoietic lineages following anti-Dll4 treatment, in vitro functional assays to identify hematopoietic cell-specific modulation of anti-Dll4, and an in vivo BM transplant (BMT) following lethal irradiation.	2815	3089
23285048	For the in vivo characterization of the main BM hematopoietic lineages we quantified myeloid (CD11b+) and lymphoid (B, B220+ and T, CD3+) BM content–.	3090	3240
23285048	Additionally, we measured hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs; stem cell antigen (Sca)-1+ and fetal liver kinase (Flk)-1−), and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC; Sca1+Flk1+–, in BM and peripheral blood (PB).	3241	3456
23285048	The effects of anti-Dll4 treatment in HSPCs commitment and differentiation was assessed in vitro by performing colony-forming units (CFU) assays in methylcellulose,.	3457	3622
23285048	We show that systemic Dll4 blockade affects the BM vascular niche and hematopoietic cell differentiation, while having limited effects on the expression of “angiocrine genes” or on EC activation.	3623	3818
23285048	Interestingly, in a BMT setting, anti-Dll4 treatment of donor mice results in faster lymphoid and erythroid recovery of recipient mice.	3819	3954
23285048	Together, we show that anti-Dll4 treatment perturbs BM recovery following irradiation, which can be clinically relevant in a BMT setting.	3955	4092
23285048	The following animal experiments were performed following approval of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência Animal Care Committee and Review Board.	4093	4238

23285048	Data were analyzed using unpaired two-tailed student's t test.	12478	12540
23285048	P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.	12541	12601
23285048	We asked whether a therapeutic (systemic) approach of Dll4 blockade would affect the BM vascular niche.	12602	12705
23285048	For that, we sub-lethally irradiated mice (300rad), therefore inducing myeloablation and BM turnover, and systemically treated them with a neutralizing anti-Dll4 antibody, HMD4-2 (Figure 1A).	12706	12897
23285048	We used six different vascular markers to characterize the effects of anti-Dll4 in the BM vascular niche: CD31, CD105 and VE-Cadherin antibodies, widely used to identify BM endothelial cells,; VEGFR3 antibody, described as a specific marker of BM sinusoids; SMA antibody, which labels pericytes in arteries and capillaries-; and Lycopersicon esculentum lectin, used as a pan-endothelial marker that stains perfused vessels,.	12898	13322
23285048	By day 15 post-irradiation, increased number of CD31+ and VE-Cadherin+ vessels were scored in the BM of anti-Dll4 treated mice, with no significant changes in CD105+, VEGFR3+, SMA+, and lectin+ vessels (Figure 1B, C, S1A).	13323	13545
23285048	VE-Cadherin mRNA expression was also increased in vivo and in vitro following anti-Dll4 treatment (Figure S1B, C).	13546	13660
23285048	Furthermore, anti-Dll4 treatment following myeloablation also increased BM megakaryocyte content (Figure 1D).	13661	13770
23285048	BM VE-Cadherin (endothelial) expression had been previously associated with an increase in megakaryocyte numbers.	13771	13884
23285048	Moreover, it has been reported that Dll4 impairs the final stages of megakaryocytic differentiation, without affecting its early stages, also concordant with our data.	13885	14052
23285048	Therefore, the increase in megakaryocyte numbers herein described might be due to the increase in VE-Cadherin expression, to a direct effect of anti-Dll4 treatment on megakaryocytes, or both.	14053	14244
23285048	These results were surprising, as previous work has shown quantitative vascular changes in tumors upon anti-Dll4 treatment,.	14245	14369
23285048	However, in our study, we observed a qualitative modulation of the BM vascular niche (as suggested by the use of the different vascular markers).	14370	14515
23285048	Therefore, we further characterized the type of blood vessels in the BM microenvironment, following anti-Dll4 treatment.	14516	14636
23285048	As previously described, we found VEGFR3 to be a specific sinusoidal marker, lectin to stain all types of blood vessels in the BM (Figure S1A), and SMA to stain for pericyte-covered (stable) blood vessels, such as arteries and capillaries, (Figure S1A, S2a,c).	14637	14897
23285048	CD31, CD105 and VE-Cadherin have been extensively used as BM endothelial cells markers,,,, but the CD31 and VE-Cadherin specific modulation led us to further characterize these vessels.	14898	15083
23285048	As shown in Figure S2, BM stable vessels are CD105high/low, VE-Cadherinhigh and CD31+, whereas BM sinusoids are CD105+, VE-Cadherin+/−, and CD31+/− in sub-lethally irradiated mice.	15084	15264
23285048	Next, we asked whether these BM vascular niche-specific changes were a direct effect of Dll4 blockade on the endothelial cells.	15265	15392
23285048	For that, we used inducible, conditional knockout (VECad-Cre-ERT2Dll4lox/lox) mice and assessed the number of CD31, CD105 and VE-Cadherin vessels, as well as the percentage of megakaryocytes in the BM.	15393	15594
23285048	Consistent with the effects reported earlier (seen after systemic anti-Dll4 treatment), we observed a similar phenotype in this genetic targeting of Dll4, with an increase in CD31+ and VE-Cadherin+ vessels without modulation of CD105+ vessels, and an increase in the percentage of CD41+ megakaryocytes (Figure S3).	15595	15909
23285048	These data suggest the effects of anti-Dll4 blockade in the BM vascular niche are exerted predominantly on VE-Cadherin-expressing BM endothelial cells.	15910	16061
23285048	The BM vascular modifications herein described were accompanied by systemic defects in the vascular compartment of the liver (Figure S4), as previously reported by others.	16062	16233
23285048	Together, these data suggest systemic Dll4 blockade perturbs the BM vascular niche, favoring CD31+ and VE-Cadherin+ endothelial cells expansion and increasing BM megakaryocyte content.	16234	16418
23285048	Next, we investigated the mechanisms by which anti-Dll4 could affect endothelial cells function.	16419	16515
23285048	First, we characterized the BM endothelial phenotype induced by systemic anti-Dll4 blockade in more detail.	16516	16623
23285048	We used a stem cell marker, c-kit, and found some BM vessels to be c-kit+ (Figure 2A).	16624	16710
23285048	C-kit is unappreciated as a BM vessel marker, despite in vitro reports of c-kit expression in primary BM endothelial cells.	16711	16834
23285048	Some BM vessels were previously shown to express another stem cell marker, stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1), but its endothelial functions are still unknown.	16835	16987
23285048	The overall percentage of c-kit+ vessels (assessed from double labeling with CD105) also increased in anti-Dll4 treated animals (Figure 2A, B).	16988	17131
23285048	Next, we searched for modulation of “angiocrine genes” and of MAPK and Akt signaling pathways in our system, since these were considered crucial for the instructive role exerted by the BM vascular niche in promoting hematopoietic recovery.	17132	17371
23285048	We performed qPCR analysis on a set of angiocrine genes, chosen because these are expressed depending on the activation state of BM endothelial cells and because of their involvement in hematopoietic recovery and vascular remodeling (Figure 2C, S5).	17372	17621
23285048	Anti-Dll4 treated animals showed a significant decrease in BM expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and colony stimulating factor 2 (granulocyte-macrophage, CSF2) and an increase in insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFbp2), IGFbp3, angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2), Dll4, desert hedgehog (DHH) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) (Figure 2C, S5A).	17622	17997
23285048	This increase in VEGF-A (but not SDF-1α or stem cell factor, SCF) mRNA levels was accompanied by increased VEGF-A protein levels in BM plasma, assessed by ELISA (Figure S5B).	17998	18172
23285048	In order to identify endothelial-specific angiocrine gene modulation, we treated HUVEC in vitro with anti-Dll4 antibody.	18173	18293
23285048	Anti-Dll4 treatment resulted in a significant decrease in FGF1, CSF3, but not CSF2, and an increase in VEGF-A expression (Figure S5C).	18294	18428
23285048	Genes whose expression was not changed in vivo were modulated in vitro, namely FGF2, CSF3, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and SCF (Figure S5C).	18429	18562
23285048	Dll4 expression, however, was decreased in vitro, and increased in vivo (Figure S5C).	18563	18648
23285048	The latter phenotypes can be interpreted as a non-endothelial cell-specific angiocrine gene modulation; another possibility is that the timing, activation state or endothelial cell identity of this in vitro assessment does not mimic BM endothelial cell characteristics.	18649	18918
23285048	After characterizing angiocrine gene modulation, we searched for alterations of Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways induced by anti-Dll4 treatment.	18919	19064
23285048	In light of the theory supported by Kobayashi et al., the fine-tuning between Akt and MAPK activation in BM endothelial cells balances self-renewal vs. differentiation of HSPCs.	19065	19242
23285048	We found that treatment of HUVEC with anti-Dll4 decreased Akt phosphorylation, but did not induce significant changes in ERK1/2 activation (Figure 2D, E), which supports the notion that reduced Akt and equal MAPK promotes the maintenance of the HSPCs pool.	19243	19499
23285048	These data suggest that modulating the BM vascular niche by anti-Dll4 treatment increases c-kit+ vessels and affects BM endothelial cells activation state and angiocrine factors production.	19500	19689
23285048	Having shown systemic anti-Dll4 treatment affected BM endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro, including angiocrine gene modulation, next we explored the hematopoietic effects of anti-Dll4 treatment in BM hematopoietic recovery following myeloablation.	19690	19941
23285048	Both BM and PB from anti-Dll4 treated mice showed increased myeloid cell content (CD11b+) (Figure 3A).	19942	20044
23285048	The BM lymphocytic compartment was also affected by the anti-Dll4 treatment; there was a significant decrease in both CD3+ T and B220+ B lymphocytes, with no significant changes in the PB (Figure 3A).	20045	20245
23285048	In contrast, anti-Dll4 treatment did not seem to affect BM progenitor cell populations.	20246	20333
23285048	As shown in Figure 3B, there were no significant changes in the percentage of BM or PB EPCs (Sca1+Flk1+) or HSPCs (Sca1+Flk1−), with a trend for increased BM HSPCs (p = 0.07) in anti-Dll4 treated mice.	20334	20535
23285048	After characterizing the global alterations in hematopoiesis upon anti-Dll4 treatment, we performed in vitro CFU assays, counting single-cell derived colonies, which represent either multipotent (CFU-granulocyte-erythrocyte-macrophage-megakaryocyte, CFU-GEMM), bipotent (CFU-granulocyte-macrophage) or unipotent (CFU-monocyte, CGU-M, CFU-granulocyte, CFU-G, or CFU-erythrocyte, CFU-E),.	20536	20922
23285048	These assays allowed us to evaluate if the hematopoietic effects seen with anti-Dll4 treatment could also be due to direct effects on hematopoietic elements, namely in their differentiation capacity.	20923	21122
23285048	For that, we sorted BM HSPCs (Lin-Sca1+) from anti-Dll4 treated and control mice and cultured these in methylcellulose in vitro,.	21123	21252
23285048	In accordance with the lack of change in HSPCs frequency seen after anti-Dll4 treatment (Figure 3B), this did not affect HSPCs CFU potential, or colony number (Figure S6).	21253	21424
23285048	Next, we also assessed the direct effects of anti-Dll4 treatment on HSPCs, by treating naïve HSPCs with anti-Dll4 in vitro, in CFU assays.	21425	21563
23285048	We further sought to determine whether Notch1 was the receptor involved, by blocking Notch1 using a monoclonal antibody either alone or in conjugation with anti-Dll4.	21564	21730
23285048	We induced cord blood HSPCs’ (Lin-) differentiation in methylcellulose in the presence of either PBS, anti-Dll4, anti-Notch1, or the 2 neutralizing antibodies together.	21731	21899
23285048	As shown in Figure 3C, anti-Dll4 treatment shifted differentiation towards the myeloid lineage (increased CFU-M and CFU-G colonies), an effect independent of anti-Notch1 treatment, as anti-Notch1 did not affect CFU-M or CFU-G colony number.	21900	22140
23285048	Anti-Dll4 treatment reduced multipotent HSPCs (CFU-GEMM colonies), as did anti-Notch1 and the conjugation of both antibodies, indicating that anti-Dll4 treatment reduced multipotent HSPCs by reducing Notch1-mediated Notch signalling.	22141	22374
23285048	Anti-Notch1, alone or combined with anti-Dll4, decreased HSPCs potential to differentiate into the erythroid lineage (CFU-E), and decreased HSPCs differentiation potential (total colony number).	22375	22569
23285048	Both treatments reduced multipotent HSPCs (CFU-GEMM) (Figure 3C).	22570	22635
23285048	Taken together, these data suggest that besides affecting the BM vascular niche, anti-Dll4 treatment also perturbs hematopoietic cell differentiation and commitment.	22636	22801
23285048	Next, we assessed whether the BM changes induced by anti-Dll4 treatment affected the efficiency of BM hematopoietic recovery in a transplant setting.	22802	22951
23285048	For this purpose, we lethally irradiated recipient mice, which were subsequently transplanted with BM from untreated or anti-Dll4 treated mice (Figure 4A).	22952	23107
23285048	Mice that received BM from anti-Dll4 treated mice showed evidence of improved hematopoietic recovery following lethal myeloablation (significantly faster recovery of leukocytes, hematocrit and lymphocytes), assessed by CBC (Figure 4B).	23108	23343
23285048	These data suggest that treatment of BM donor mice with anti-Dll4 improves hematopoietic recovery following lethal myeloablation.	23344	23473
23285048	The data presented in this paper show that systemic Dll4 blockade induces qualitative changes in the BM vasculature (which becomes more heterogeneous), which may be favorable in a BMT setting.	23474	23666
23285048	A number of studies have proven the relevance of the BM vascular niche in hematopoiesis, but the heterogeneity of the BM vasculature has only been recently objectively assessed, clearly suggesting further detailed studies are needed to understand the importance of the different BM vessels for normal BM function–,,,,–.	23667	23986
23285048	We describe that systemic targeting Dll4, which has previously been shown to confine to particular vascular ECs (called “tip cells”), changes the vascular identity in the BM.	23987	24161
23285048	Following myeloablation, we applied an anti-Dll4 treatment, similar to what is currently being performed in phase I clinical trials to treat patients with solid malignancies.	24162	24336
23285048	This treatment resulted in different vascular alterations in the BM, as shown by increased CD31, VE-Cadherin and c-kit+ cells, without quantitative changes in CD105+, VEGFR3+, SMA+ or lectin+ vessels.	24337	24537
23285048	The global BM vessel identity is therefore altered upon anti-Dll4 treatment.	24538	24614
23285048	Interestingly, CD31 is indispensable for several stages of hematopoiesis, endothelial cells survival and angiogenesis, which in turn are all crucial for hematopoietic recovery following myeloablation,,–.	24615	24818
23285048	VE-Cadherin is also required for hematopoiesis and angiogenesis,,.	24819	24885
23285048	The role of c-kit, in ECs, however, is unknown; studies assessing its role in angiogenesis and, more specifically, in the BM microenvironment, will be required for proper interpretation of the data presented in this paper.	24886	25108
23285048	Regarding the modulation of “angiocrine genes”, besides the increase in CD31+ BM vessels previously described, we detected a significant increase in IGFbp2, IGFbp3, Angpt2, DHH and VEGF-A and a decrease in FGF1 and CSF2 expression in whole BM extracts from anti-Dll4 treated animals (Figure 2C).	25109	25404
23285048	Even though FGF1, which is decreased upon anti-Dll4 treatment, prevents vessel regression, IGFbp3, Angpt2 and VEGF-A, which are increased, are modulators of vascular survival and re-growth, which, as previously mentioned, is crucial for hematopoietic recovery following myeloablation–.	25405	25690
23285048	Despite the decrease of CSF2, which is associated with a decrease in the myeloid lineage, IGF1 induces proliferation and differentiation of myeloid lineage cells, and DHH is important for granulocyte differentiation/proliferation in the BM; moreover, the myeloid modulation we describe may be due to a direct effect of anti-Dll4 treatment on hematopoietic cells (Figure 3C).	25691	26065
23285048	Both HSPCs and myeloid cells are reported to express Dll4.	26066	26124
23285048	We show that anti-Dll4 treatment of HSPCs in vitro increases CFU-M and CFU-G number, independently of Notch1 modulation, but decreases multipotential progenitor cell-derived CFUs, similar to anti-Notch1 treatment (Figure 3C).	26125	26350
23285048	VEGF-A blocks both B and T lymphopoiesis–.	26351	26393
23285048	The altered BM lymphocyte content observed might either be simply due to the increased myeloid content, to the VEGF-A increase in the BM, to the direct effect of anti-Dll4 in lymphoid cells, and/or to the effect of Dll4 inhibition in secondary hematopoietic organs, such as the thymus and spleen, which were previously shown to express Dll4,,,–.	26394	26739
23285048	Regarding the signaling pathways that are proposed to trigger the EC role in hematopoiesis, we observed a decrease of Akt activation, without significant changes in Erk1/2 (Figure 2D, E) after exposing EC to anti-Dll4.	26740	26958
23285048	It should be noted that Dll4 has been shown to modulate the MAPK activation on a stimulus-depending manner; the technical constraints to study EC-specific signaling pathways activation in vivo led us to an in vitro study, which may not completely mirror the in vivo systemic effects of anti-Dll4, nor the proper stimulus acting in different BM microenvironments.	26959	27321
23285048	In vivo assessments showed both HSPC phenotype and function (reconstitution potential) were not impaired by systemic anti-Dll4 treatment, and in vitro differentiation of HSPCs collected from the BM of anti-Dll4 treated mice was also not impaired, meaning HSPCs are unaffected by in vivo anti-Dll4 treatment (Figure 3B, 4B and S6).	27322	27652
23285048	Systemic anti-Dll4 treatment of donor mice in a setting of BMT resulted in a mild, but significant, accelerated hematopoietic recovery of recipient mice (Figure 4),.	27653	27818
23285048	For a successful BMT, HSPCs must home and engraft in the BM, a process for which BM ECs are essential–.	27819	27922
23285048	In this study, we transplanted whole BM mononuclear cells; this fraction includes BM ECs, which were previously shown to incorporate in the BM vasculature.	27923	28078
23285048	Interestingly, vascular CD31 and VE-Cadherin regulate the transition of HSPCs between blood and BM,.	28079	28179
23285048	The increased VE-Cadherin and CD31-positive BM vessels from anti-Dll4 treated donor mice may have enhanced the homing of HSPCs in recipient mice, thereby leading to an overall faster hematopoietic recovery.	28180	28386
23285048	Interestingly, we have also observed an increase in Dll4 expression in the BM of anti-Dll4 treated donor mice (Figure 2C).	28387	28509
23285048	Given that anti-Dll4 treatment was performed only in donor mice, and not in recipients, the transplanted cells may have increased Dll4 protein levels.	28510	28660
23285048	Remarkably, in vitro data have shown that increasing Dll4 signaling in HSPCs increases erythroid commitment and HSPCs proliferation, induces commitment and complete maturation to the T cell lineage, and maintains HSPCs stemness,,,.	28661	28892
23285048	In our BMT model, these effects were transient, because the treatment was not maintained thoughout the process of hematopoietic recovery; therefore, the lymphoproliferative disease that mice overexpressing Dll4 in the hematopoietic lineage are expected to develop was not observed (evidenced by the long term survival of recipient mice),.	28893	29231
23285048	Alternatively, or in addition, IGFbp2 and IGFbp3 showed increased expression following anti-Dll4 treatment; these factors, by stabilizing IGF1, may contribute towards the effects of anti-Dll4 in promoting hematopoietic recovery following BMT.	29232	29474
23285048	Together, our data shows that targeting Dll4 alters the vascular identity in the BM, mildly affects hematopoiesis, and promotes a faster hematopoietic recovery after BMT.	29475	29645
23285048	We have characterized the BM vascular niche and provide evidence of its heterogeneity, which may create different microenvironments within the BM.	29646	29792
23285048	This assessment may be particularly interesting to explore, as relevant information regarding the functional characterization of hematopoietic stem cell niches can be obtained.	29793	29969
23285048	We further suggest anti-Dll4 blockade may be an interesting therapeutic approach in a BMT setting.	29970	30068
22808010	As committed erythroid progenitors transit through a CFU-e stage, proerythroblast formation becomes dependent upon key signals transduced by EPO's cell surface receptor (EPOR).	0	176
22808010	Interest in better understanding EPO effects (and EPOR action mechanisms) recently has intensified.	177	276
22808010	This is based, in part, on the clinical emergence of new EPO orthologues and mimetics, and on EPO's ability to cytoprotect select non-hematopoietic tissues from ischemic injury; to regulate select immune responses; and to modulate susceptibility to diabetes.	277	535
22808010	Via poorly understood routes, EPO also may be associated with hypertensive and thrombolytic events, and as used to treat the anemia of chemotherapy may worsen the progression of certain cancers.	536	730
22808010	With regards to action mechanisms, the EPOR occurs pre-assembled with Jak2 kinase (as apparently paired dimer sets),.	731	848
22808010	EPO binding conformationally alters EPOR complexes.	849	900
22808010	This leads to Jak2 activation, and the phosphorylation of up to eight cytoplasmic EPOR PY sites.	901	997
22808010	One EPOR/Jak2 signaling axis involves EPOR PY479 recruitment of p85-alpha plus p110 PI3K.	998	1087
22808010	Disruption of p85-alpha is known to limit fetal erythropoiesis (and leads to the sustained expression of nucleated erythrocytes).	1088	1217
22808010	Nonetheless, mutated EPOR forms that lack this PY479 PI3K docking site efficiently support erythropoiesis.	1218	1324
22808010	Fully PY-deficient EPOR forms that retain only a box-1,2 Jak2 binding domain also can support erythropoiesis at steady-state, but are markedly defective during anemia,.	1325	1493
22808010	A pathway that couples to EPOR PY- independent mechanisms involves a Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk axis.	1494	1584
22808010	However, candidate necessary-and-sufficient roles for Erk's have been discounted by the recent observation that erythropoiesis can be bolstered when Erk1 is disrupted.	1585	1752
22808010	A third central EPOR signaling route involves a Jak2-plus-Stat5 axis which has been shown to be important for EPO-dependent erythropoiesis during anemia.	1753	1906
22808010	Original studies of Stat5 disruption per se yielded disparate results for erythropoietic roles,.	1907	2003
22808010	Full deletion of Stat-5a and -5b loci, however, has since been shown to markedly compromise erythropoiesis.	2004	2111
22808010	Among candidate Stat5 targets, Bcl-x previously was proposed to comprise one important EPO/EPOR- response factor whose anti-apoptotic actions might largely explain EPO's effects.	2112	2290
22808010	Follow-up studies in primary bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells, however, have challenged this EPO/EPOR- Bclx connection, and instead point to roles for Bcl-xL within maturing late-stage erythroblasts,.	2291	2497
22808010	Together, such considerations raise important questions concerning how much is well understood about key EPO/EPOR response circuits, and effects.	2498	2643
22808010	Towards advancing insight into EPO/EPOR action, our laboratory recently has applied basic gene profiling approaches to initially identify select EPO-modulated targets, and for these few factors has generated basic evidence for functional significance.	2644	2895
22808010	Examples include Podocalyxin as a proposed mediator of erythroblast adhesion/migration; Cyclin G2 as an EPO/EPOR- repressed cell cycle inhibitor; and Serpina-3g as an EPO- induced candidate erythropoietic factor.	2896	3108
22808010	To broaden insight into EPO action mechanisms, we presently report on global transcript response events that EPO regulates within primary bone marrow CFUe- like progenitors.	3109	3282
22808010	Attention is first given to candidate mediators of EPO's effects on response genes.	3283	3366
22808010	Subsequent analyses address functional sets of EPO/EPOR targets which proved to include unique sets as regulators of proerythroblast survival, cell cycle progression, signal transduction, negative-feedback factors, and cytokines plus receptors.	3367	3611
22808010	Within each functional sub-set (including delineated EPOR/JAK2/STAT5 targets), specific EPO/EPOR- modulated factors are described.	3612	3742
22808010	Among cytokines-plus-receptors, one prime EPO-EPOR induced target proved to be a pro-survival TNF receptor, Tnfr-sf13c,.	3743	3863
22808010	As engaged in lymphoid cells by its BAFF ligand (B-cell activating factor TNF family), Tnfr-sf13c is essential for lymphoid progenitor cell survival and B-cell formation.	3864	4034
22808010	Within primary erythroid progenitors, Tnfr-sf13c (as induced by EPO) is now shown to enhance proerythroblast survival, and in addition, to promote the formation of late-stage Ter119pos erythroblasts.	4035	4234
22808010	Overall findings are discussed in the contexts of unique response circuits that the EPOR regulates within primary bone marrow progenitors to sustain the balanced production of red blood cells at steady-state, and over a dynamic range of rates during anemia.	4235	4492
22808010	Unless otherwise indicated, C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were used at age 8–14 weeks as a source of bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells (EPC's).	4493	4645
22808010	Mice harboring the knocked-in minimal EPOR alleles EPOR-H, and EPOR-HM were as characterized by Menon et al. All protocols and procedures were approved by the IACUC of the Maine Medical Center Research Institute (Protocol number 0911).	4646	4881
22808010	Bone marrow cells were prepared from femurs and tibiae as previously described,,,.	4882	4964
22808010	EPC's were then expanded in SP34ex medium supplemented with 2.5 U/mL EPO, 100ng/mL mSCF, 1uM dexamethasone, 1 uM beta-estradiol, 75 ug/mL holo-transferrin, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mM glutamine, 0.5% BSA (Stem Cell Technologies).	4965	5199
22808010	At day 3.5 of culture, CFUe-like stage E1 progenitors, stage E2 proerythroblasts, and stage E3 erythroblasts were isolated.	5200	5323
22808010	Here, optimized multi-step MACS-based procedures were employed as recently detailed, and yielded purities of ≥99.9%.	5324	5440
22808010	In analyses of stage E1, E2 and/or E3 cells (and per 200 uL assay), 106 cells were incubated (15 minutes, 4°C) with 5 ug of rat IgG in PBS, 0.5% BSA (0.2 mL assay volumes).	5441	5613
22808010	PE-Ter119, FITC anti-CD71, and APC-anti-Kit antibodies (1 ug each, BD Biosciences) then were added (30 minutes, 4°C).	5614	5731
22808010	Washed cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACScalibur, Cell Quest software).	5732	5815
22808010	In assays of cell survival, Annexin-V or YoPro3 were used as recently detailed,.	5816	5896
22808010	Viable cell numbers and frequencies were assayed by Vicell assays.	5897	5963
22808010	In all experiments, equivalent numbers of gated events were analyzed.	5964	6033
22808010	In analyses of EPO/EPOR response genes, purified stage E1 CFUe- like progenitors were cultured in the absence of EPO for 5.5 hours in HEPES buffered IMDM supplemented with 10 µg/mL transferrin, 15 ng/mL insulin, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% BSA, 1.5mM glutamine.	6034	6298
22808010	Cells were then exposed to EPO (4 U/mL) or carrier (HSA, PBS).	6299	6361
22808010	At 90 minutes of exposure, cells (from four independent replicates, each plus- and minus- EPO) were lysed directly in Trizol reagent.	6362	6495
22808010	RNA was then isolated and used to prepare biotinylated probes for array hybridizations.	6496	6583
22808010	Gene profiling utilized Affymetrix 430 2.0 arrays, GeneChip 3000 scanning and initial GCOS software (Affymetrix) analyses of hybridization signals.	6584	6731
22808010	Subsequent bioinformatics analyses utilized GeneSpring GX 11.0.	6732	6795
22808010	Microarray data were assessed for background signals, normalized, and probe-summarized using a GC-RMA algorithm.	6796	6908
22808010	Significantly expressed genes were identified using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR filter.	6909	6993
22808010	For EPO modulated genes, a p-value cut-off of 0.05 was used.	6994	7054
22808010	K-means clustering utilized a Euclidean distance matrix.	7055	7111
22808010	For significance testing between [−] EPO vs [+] EPO samples, Student's T-testing was used (single tailed).	7112	7218
22808010	Analyses of transcription factor binding sites represented within K-means clusters #1 – #4 of EPO- modulated genes was via DiRE,.	7219	7348
22808010	To further estimate the significance of STAT elements as represented among Cluster #4 EPO-response genes, TransFac was applied (−950 to +50 algorithm).	7349	7500
22808010	Reverse transcription (standard 1 ug of RNA per reaction) was with Superscript III (and included pre-treatment with DNAse I) (Invitrogen).	7501	7639
22808010	Quantiative PCR utilized Sybr-green reagents and MyIQ single color real-time PCR detection system (BioRAD).	7640	7747
22808010	Primer pairs were from SuperArray, and are defined in supplemental materials (Table S1).	7748	7836
22808010	During definitive erythropoiesis, development beyond the CFU-e stage fails due to disrupted expression of Epo, or the EpoR.	7837	7960
22808010	Such CFUe- like cells, including those generated using an optimized serum-free ex vivo system for murine bone marrow erythroblast development,,,, exhibit sharp dependency on EPO for their growth and survival.	7961	8169
22808010	Present global transcriptome analyses therefore focused on this developmental cohort of KitposCD71highTer119neg progenitors (termed “stage E1”).	8170	8314
22808010	Figure 1A defines approaches employed for the short-term expansion, and isolation of these primary progenitors.	8315	8426
22808010	For stage E1 cells, the high purity routinely obtained is illustrated via flow cytometric analyses of KitposCD71highTer119neg cells (Figure 1B).	8427	8571
22808010	This was further confirmed through transcriptome-based analyses of erythroid and possibly contaminating B-cell, T-cell and myeloid cell markers.	8572	8716
22808010	May-Grumwald cytospins of stage E1 cells also are shown (Figures 1C, 1D).	8717	8790
22808010	Pilot experiments next served to assess time-courses for EPO-induction of four known response genes as Cis, Pim1, Socs3 and Podocalyxin.	8791	8927
22808010	As analyzed at 10, 30, 90 and 270 minute intervals, near maximal induction of these target genes was achieved by 90 minutes (data not shown).	8928	9069
22808010	With regards to ligand concentration, EPO levels during anemia can increase several hundred-fold (and EPO at 3U/mL is required to support stress BFU-e development, for example).	9070	9247
22808010	An EPO challenge dose of 4U/mL therefore was used in profiling experiments.	9248	9323
22808010	Using the above defined conditions, purified CFUe-like cells next were interrogated for EPO/EPOR modulated events using Affymetrix arrays.	9324	9462
22808010	Specifically, quadruplicate independent samples were interrogated for EPO- challenged stage E1 cells versus unchallenged controls.	9463	9593
22808010	In these (and all profiling experiments presented below), all samples readily passed all quality control parameters, and signal variance was distributed similarly among replicates (Figure 1E).	9594	9786
22808010	Figures 1F and 1G illustrate heat-maps for each sample, together with a volcano plot of p-value distributions.	9787	9897
22808010	When analyzed via GC-RMA algorithms (p≤0.05) and unpaired Student's T-testing), 196 arrayed genes proved to be significantly EPO- modulated (Figure 1H).	9898	10050
22808010	Among these target genes, 157 were up-modulated, and 39 were down-modulated (with mean fold- modulations of 3.6 fold, and 2.6 fold, respectively).	10051	10197
22808010	A consideration of core structure-function features of the EPOR (Figure 2A) prompted an unsupervised clustering approach to sub-categorize EPO/EPOR- response genes.	10198	10362
22808010	K-means clustering of modulated transcripts resolved four major patterned response sets: 1- induced, 2- moderately induced, 3- repressed, and 4- markedly induced (Figure 2B).	10363	10537
22808010	This analysis suggested that possible groupings of transcription factor sets may differentially modulate select clusters of EPO/EPOR target genes.	10538	10684
22808010	In this context, cluster-4 was considered in further detail.	10685	10745
22808010	Notably, based initially on in silico analyses, essentially all EPO- modulated targets in this subset proved to comprise either known, or predicted Stat5 (or Stat X) targets (Figure 2C).	10746	10932
22808010	This included six new candidate Stat5 target genes within CFUe- like progenitors as Matr3, Chac1, Ccrn4l, Socs2, Tnfr-sf13c and Rpl12.	10933	11067
22808010	To critically assess the candidate nature of these targets as EPO/EPOR/Stat5 response genes, independent quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed using CFUe-like progenitors isolated from mice harboring knocked-in EPOR-HM and EPOR-H alleles.	11068	11312
22808010	The minimal EPOR form EPOR-HM is coupled to JAK2 but lacks all cytoplasmic PY sites, while EPOR-H retains a single PY343 site for Stat5 recruitment.	11313	11461
22808010	CFUe-like stage-E1 progenitors from bone marrow of EPOR-HM and EPOR-H mice were expanded, purified and cultured without EPO for 5.5 hours.	11462	11600
22808010	Cells then were exposed to EPO (+/−4U/mL).	11601	11643
22808010	At 90 minutes RNA was isolated, and reverse-transcribed.	11644	11700
22808010	Quantitative PCR analyses provided independent evidence that each of the above novel cluster-4 EPO response factors represent an EPOR-PY343-Stat5 target (Figure 2D).	11701	11866
22808010	DiRE analyses of cluster-4 also indicated ∼33% representation of STAT sites among ten top- occurring transcription factor binding sites (and scored 2nd of 10 in indicated importance) (Figure S1).	11867	12062
22808010	As points of comparison, DiRE was also applied to analyze predominant representations of transcription factor elements for EPO- response genes within clusters #1, #2 and #3.	12063	12236
22808010	Within EPO- response gene clusters #1 and #2, STAT binding sites were not enriched (among top-20 enriched motifs).	12237	12351
22808010	In addition, no known STAT5- induced genes occurred among cluster #1 EPO targets, and within cluster #2 only Cyclin-d2 was represented (and only for a single probe set signal).	12352	12528
22808010	To inform further, all EPO- modulated genes within each cluster are listed in Table S2 (together with DiRE- predicted transcription factor binding sites).	12529	12683
22808010	In contrast, within cluster #4 Cyclin-d2 was represented for five probe sets, and T-cell receptor-gamma for three probe sets (for example), data not shown.	12684	12839
22808010	In addition, cluster #4 contained a number of EPO- modulated genes that previously have been implicated as STAT5 targets (e.g., Socs3, Cis, Pim1, Podocalyxin).	12840	12999
22808010	STAT5a elements, however, were enriched in DiRE analyses of cluster #3 (although at a lower scoring) (note: DiRE searches and scores full gene loci for conserved, weighed transcription factor binding sites.	13000	13206
22808010	Positive scores are reported based on numbers of sites with summation for non-coding region sites.	13207	13305
22808010	DiRE also scores the association of individual transcription factors with the biological function shared by groups of input genes,).	13306	13438
22808010	Cluster #3 includes transcripts that are down-modulated by EPO.	13439	13502
22808010	In support of the apparent enrichment of STAT5a sites, inspection of the gene list for cluster #3 (see Table S2) revealed Cyclin G2, Trb2, and Klf3, each of which previously has been implicated to be subject to repression by STAT5,,.	13503	13736
22808010	By speculation, STAT5a therefore might be more involved in repression within an EPO- response context as contrasted to STAT5b.	13737	13863
22808010	In keeping with broadening concepts for EPO's effects,,,,,, functional sub-sets of EPO/EPOR- modulated targets included survival factors, cell cycle regulators, signal transduction factors, negative feedback factors and a select set of cytokines plus receptors (as defined in some detail below).	13864	14159
22808010	In addition, a substantial number of EPO/EPOR response factors sorted to functional categories of transcriptional regulators, cancer biology- associated factors, ribosome biosynthesis regulators, RNA processing factors and metabolic factors.	14160	14401
22808010	These overall functional sub-sets of EPO/EPOR- modulated factors are outlined in Figure 3A.	14402	14493
22808010	The latter categories of EPO/EPOR targets are of significant interest, and therefore are further defined in Tables S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8.	14494	14632
22808010	One prime role ascribed to EPO/EPOR signaling involves anti-apoptotic effects.	14633	14711
22808010	In highly EPO-dependent CFUe-like stage E1 erythroid progenitors, seven cell survival factors proved to be clear EPO/EPOR target genes (Figure 3B).	14712	14859
22808010	Pim1 S/T kinase has previously been described.	14860	14906
22808010	Pim3 (like Pim1) acts via an mTOR-like pathway.	14907	14954
22808010	In parallel, Gas5, a non-coding RNA that supports mTor expression also was induced (2.6-fold).	14955	15049
22808010	Lyl1 also comprised a novel EPO/EPOR target, and recently has been shown to act (as a transcriptional regulator) to promote hematopoietic progenitor cell survival.	15050	15213
22808010	Among Bcl2-related factors, only Bim was EPO/EPOR regulated (2.7-fold repression of this BH3-only, proapoptotic factor).	15214	15334
22808010	Finally (and as reported recently) the intracellular serpin Serpina-3g and the pseudokinase Trb3 each were strongly EPO-induced.	15335	15463
22808010	Each has potential anti-apoptotic activities, and each comprises a singular EPO-modulated orthologue within multi-member families (e.g., Tribs-1, -2 and -3) (data not shown).	15464	15638
22808010	Notably, modulation of the above EPO/EPOR-response genes (Figure 3D) also was validated by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 3B, and Figure S2).	15639	15777
22808010	Select cell cycle regulators recently have been indicated to also be subject to EPO- modulation.	15778	15874
22808010	Specifically, the inhibitory cyclin, Cyclin-G2 has been described as a target for EPO repression, and Cyclin-D2 as a target for EPO-induction (each, in part, via an EPOR/Jak2/Stat5 axis),.	15875	16063
22808010	Beyond Cyclins G2 and D2, global transcriptome analyses revealed four additional EPO-modulated cell cycle regulators (Figure 3C).	16064	16193
22808010	These first included Btg3 as an E2F-1 regulator (and novel EPO/EPOR target).	16194	16270
22808010	Also modulated were p27/Kip1 as a repressed target (and CDK2 inhibitor) together with two regulators of phase G2 progression as Cdc25a and a Cyclin B interacting protein, Cyclin B-IP1.	16271	16455
22808010	EPO therefore appears to engage a select collection of cell cycle regulators which overall are proposed to promote G1 and G2 phase progression within rapidly dividing CFUe-like progenitors.	16456	16645
22808010	For the above cell cycle regulators (Figures 3C, 3E) EPO/EPOR modulation also was confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 3C, and Figure S2).	16646	16775
22808010	Next, with regards to an extended category of EPO/EPOR targets as additional signal transduction factors (STF's), global analyses revealed 22 such factors to be significantly modulated.	16776	16961
22808010	Two STF sub-categories were cytokines plus receptors, and negative feedback factors (Figure 4) (guiding references also are cited in Figure 4 as PMIDs) (also see Figure S3).	16962	17135
22808010	Among receptors, a TNF receptor, Tnfr-sc13c, proved to be most strongly induced (3.4 to 7.0 – fold up-modulated due to EPO).	17136	17260
22808010	Tnfr-sc13c binds BAFF ligand, and as studied to date in B-cells, is an atypical TNF-R which exerts pro-survival effects (Figures 4A and 4C).	17261	17401
22808010	This factor therefore is the subject of extended functional erythropoietic studies (see following Results sub-section).	17402	17521
22808010	Lrp8, a receptor for apolipoprotein-E ligands also was induced 1.9 – to 2.9 – fold.	17522	17605
22808010	Interestingly, roles for Lrp8 in platelet function and neural cell migration recenty have been described.	17606	17711
22808010	In stage-E1 EPC's, EPO also induced the expression of three cytokines: Cmtm6, Gdf3 and Oncostatin-m. Cmtm6 is a chemokine-like factor superfamily member with presently unknown function, while Gdf3 can act as a TGF/BMP antagonist (and may therefore counter inhibitory effects of TGFbeta on erythropoiesis).	17712	18017
22808010	Oncostatin-m is a known EPO response gene, but recently has been shown to induce hepatocyte hepcidin expression, and to consequently decrease serum iron levels.	18018	18178
22808010	EPO/EPOR STFs also included five negative feedback factors (Figures 4B, 4D) (guiding references are included as PMIDs) (also see Figure S3).	18179	18319
22808010	Two are suppressors of cytokine signaling, while three are novel EPO targets as Spred2, Spred1 and Eaf1.	18320	18424
22808010	SOCS factors act as E3 ubiquitin ligases, and exert feedback effects on activated EPOR/Jak2 complexes.	18425	18527
22808010	The present results specifically implicate not only Socs-3 but also Socs-2 in this feedback loop.	18528	18625
22808010	Spreds are adaptor proteins that have been characterized as negative feedback factors in RTK systems, but not in the context of Janus kinase- coupled receptor modulation.	18626	18796
22808010	Finally, Eaf1 can act as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling.	18797	18852
22808010	For twelve additional EPO/EPOR modulated STF's, these are described in supplemental text associated with Table 1 (which includes references as PMID's).	18853	19004
22808010	As defined in Table 1, these include.	19005	19042
22808010	Pik-3cb, Mobkl1a, Prkcq, Gnb2l1, Gab2, Irs2, Erbb2ip, Tirap, Gnl3, Pnrc1, Nol8, Plek2.	19043	19129
22808010	Specific roles for Tnfr-sf13c during erythropoiesis next were assessed.	19130	19201
22808010	EPO- induction in stage E1, E2 and E3 cells first was investigated, and confirmed at each stage (Figure 5A).	19202	19310
22808010	Steady-state expression also was assayed, and proved to peak in stage E2 proerythroblasts (Figure 5B).	19311	19413
22808010	The dependency of EPO's induction of Tnfr-sf13c on Stat5 also was confirmed in independent analyses using stage E1 progenitors expressing wt-EPO, EPOR-H or EPOR-HM alleles (Figure 5C).	19414	19598
22808010	In functional experiments, primary bone marrow (pro)erythroblasts first were prepared essentially as described above for EPO-challenge experiments (including a second depletion of residual Ter119pos cells).	19599	19805
22808010	Tnfr-sf13c expression then was induced by exposure to EPO (2U/mL) for 4 hours.	19806	19884
22808010	Cells were washed thrice, and replated in the presence or BAFF (as Tnfr-sf13c's ligand).	19885	19973
22808010	In parallel, cells were exposed to EPO (also included were no-BAFF, and no-EPO controls).	19974	20063
22808010	At a subsequent 15 hour time point, possible effects on survival and/or Ter119pos erythroblast formation were assessed (by flow cytometry).	20064	20203
22808010	Notably, BAFF ligand proved first to cytoprotect erythroid progenitors with an efficiency approaching that of EPO (ie, 60% of survival effects exerted by EPO) (Figure 5D).	20204	20375
22808010	(For example primary data, also see Figure S4).	20376	20423
22808010	In addition, BAFF (in the absence of EPO) also proved to clearly support the formation of Ter119pos erythroblasts (again, with substantial efficiency) (Figure 5E).	20424	20587
22808010	In colony-forming assays, BAFF also moderately enhanced CFUe formation (170.5+/−12.3 per 1×105 BM cells with 0.5 µg/mL BAFF vs. 143.3+/−13.9 with EPO alone, 1 U/mL) (p = 0.03, Student's T-test for mean values).	20588	20798
22808010	CFUe formation may be only modestly affected by BAFF-ligand based on apparent actions at a post-CFUe (pro)erythroblast stage.	20799	20924
22808010	These experiments employing primary bone marrow erythroblasts provide direct evidence for BAFF-ligated Tnfr-sf13c in promoting erythroblast development, and therefore the actions of EPO.	20925	21111
22808010	This especially applies to developing proerythroblasts with heightened Tnfr-sf13c levels (see schematic model, Figure 6).	21112	21233
22808010	In related analyses, NCBI Geo databases were used to more broadly consider Tnfrsf13c expression profiles.	21234	21339
22808010	General comparisons to receptors such as EGF-R and IFNa-R indicated relatively narrow expression distributions for Tnfrsf13c (121,615 and 45,101 positive profiles for EGF+R and FGFR vs 822 for Tnfrsf13c).	21340	21544
22808010	Factors indicated to regulate Tnfrsf13c also were limited.	21545	21603
22808010	Cytokines included SDF1, IL4 and IL2 while transcription factors included STAT5b, Zfp3L2 and Pu1 (see Table S9).	21604	21716
22808010	For each of eight example studies, basic details on mean fold-modulation and experiment design also are provided.	21717	21830
22808010	(For additional information, please consult the indexed NCBI Geo GDS data sets).	21831	21911
22808010	Since the cloning of EPO and its receptor, the EPOR system has served well as a paradigm for HGF-R action.	21912	22018
22808010	Much of our understanding of EPO/EPOR effects, however, depends upon ectopic over-expression in cell line models (which often have been non-erythroid, or non-hematopoietic).	22019	22192
22808010	In addition, and based on available reagents, attention has been paid predominantly to canonical pathways and signal transduction factors.	22193	22331
22808010	For the present studies, a prime goal was to employ a transcriptome profiling approach, together with a primary bone marrow CFUe- like target cell population, to better reveal events (initially at a transcript level) that EPO elicits in a bona fide target cell population.	22332	22604
22808010	Further impetus was provided by unique advances in the short-term expansion and purification of uniform cohorts of bone marrow-derived EPC's.	22605	22746
22808010	Also, pilot transcriptional analyses in various cell line models proved to yield partially overlapping but otherwise disparate profiles among EPO response genes (eg, differentially regulated orthologues of Pim, Socs, Spry, Spred and Bcl2 factors; no modulation of PodxL) (data not shown).	22747	23035
22808010	Using a serum-free short-term ex vivo expansion system plus optimized rapid and efficient cell immunoadsorption procedures, sufficient primary stage-E1 bone marrow EPC's presently were prepared in sufficient numbers for robust quadruplicate profiling studies.	23036	23295
22808010	One related basic point for consideration concerns the choice of stage-E1 CFUe-like cells as a target for EPO-action analyses.	23296	23422
22808010	Previously, we have shown that with regards to survival effects, EPO can also cytoprotect stage E2 proerythroblasts and stage E3 erythroblasts, but less effectively than for highly-dependent E1 cells,.	23423	23624
22808010	Stage E1 cells also are more stimulated in their proliferative responses by EPO,.	23625	23706
22808010	With regards to profiling per se, several features underscore the likelihood that culled transcripts represent EPO/EPOR response genes.	23707	23842
22808010	First, among 50 factors assayed by quantitative RT-PCR, all except one (Pias3) were confirmed.	23843	23937
22808010	Second, for the >2-fold modulated set considered, PCA and clustering analyses did not reveal outlying factors.	23938	24048
22808010	Third, when cluster-4 was independently analyzed, all EPOR targets tested were validated.	24049	24138
22808010	In addition (through the employ of knocked-in EPOR-H and EPOR-HM alleles) six new EPOR-PY343/Stat5 response genes were independently confirmed including Tnfr-sf13c, Ccrn4l, Rpl12, Socs2, Chac1 and Matr3 as novel EPO-regulated factors.	24139	24373
22808010	Confidence in our presently reported EPO/EPOR- regulated transcriptome is also reinforced via heat-map and p-value distribution analyses.	24374	24511
22808010	EPO is best known to promote EPC survival, and expansion,, and EPO/EPOR-modulated survival therefore is next considered.	24512	24632
22808010	Among seven such factors, two are novel as Gas5, and Lyl1.	24633	24691
22808010	Gas5 is of interest in ways that relate to Pim-1 and -3.	24692	24748
22808010	Specifically Gas5 can act as a non-coding RNA to regulate mTOR levels.	24749	24819
22808010	Together, Pim and mTOR pathways reinforce cell survival via pro-metabolic effects.	24820	24902
22808010	Lyl1, by comparison, is a bHLH transcriptional regulator which recently has been demonstrated to enforce hematopoietic progenitor cell survival.	24903	25047
22808010	EPO down-modulation of Bim (a BH3-only factor) is in-keeping with Bim's role as a Bclx antagonist.	25048	25146
22808010	Finally, Trib3 and Serpina3g are a pseudokinase, and candidate protease inhibitor each of which recently has been preliminarily demonstrated to affect erythroid progenitor cell survival.	25147	25333
22808010	For these latter highly EPO-induced factors, LOF studies are in progress (and point to important non-redundant effects exerted in relatively late EPC's) (manuscripts in preparation and submitted).	25334	25530
22808010	In maturing CFUe, cell cycle regulation is an atypical affair in that cell division rates accelerate markedly, become synchronous, and then sharply decrease as erythroblasts transition to reticulocytes.	25531	25733
22808010	In part, this recently has been indicated to involve E2F factor effects.	25734	25806
22808010	Presently, five EPO-modulated factors are predicted to promote cell cycle progression as Cyclin-D2, Cdc25a and Cyclin b1-interacting protein as induced factors, and Cyclin-G2 plus p27/Kip as repressed inhibitory factors.	25807	26027
22808010	Btg3, in contrast is a novel EPO-induced factor that previously has been demonstrated to attenuate G2 to M phase transitions.	26028	26153
22808010	Btg3 therefore may contribute to synchronizing aspects of proerythroblast cell divisions.	26154	26243
22808010	In a broad category of additional signal transduction factors, one interesting subset of EPO/EPOR- regulated STF's is negative feedback factors.	26244	26388
22808010	Among these, suppressors of cytokine signaling Socs-3 previously has been implicated as an EPOR/JAK2 complex inhibitor.	26389	26508
22808010	In primary bone marrow stage-E1 EPC's, Socs-3 as well as Socs-2 are shown to be induced by EPO.	26509	26604
22808010	Spreds-1 and -2, as also induced by EPO, may well affect not only EPOR complexes, but also RTK's such as Kit and/or EphB4, each of which play erythropoietic roles,.	26605	26769
22808010	Biologically, such suppression might relate, for example, to stage-E1 to -E2 transitions.	26770	26859
22808010	This brings questions of possible receptor cross-modulation to bear.	26860	26928
22808010	Eaf1 further is known to suppress Wnt signaling (see Figure 4B).	26929	26993
22808010	By extended considerations, select EPO-induced transcriptional events also may result in erythroid cell extrinsic EPC effects.	26994	27120
22808010	Examples are given by EPO- induction of Cmtm6 as a CMTM cytokine; Gdf3 as a candidate inhibitor of TGFbeta and Oncostatin M as a newly discovered regulator of hepatic hepcidin and therefore of iron availability.	27121	27332
22808010	Finally, Tnfr-sf13C proved to comprise a strong EPO/EPOR response factor in EPC's and (as discussed below) this has proven to be of clear functional significance.	27333	27495
22808010	Tnfr-sf13c to date has been studied in B-cells and (together with its BAFF ligand) is essential for B-cell survival and development,.	27496	27629
22808010	BAFF interestingly is expressed by bone marrow stromal cells, and has been implicated as an anchoring site within marrow for multiple myeloma cells.	27630	27778
22808010	In an erythropoietic context, we now demonstrate that Tnfr-sf13c is a major EPO-response gene in primary bone marrow EPC's, and ligation of Tnfr-sf13c results in not only cytoprotective effects, but also appears to bolster the formation of stage-E3 erythroblasts from stage E1 and E2 progenitors.	27779	28075
22808010	Our profiling analyses of E1, E2 and E3 EPC's further indicate that these cells are not a significant source of BAFF as compared directly to primary bone marrow stromal cells (data not shown).	28076	28268
22808010	Therefore, a novel functional connection is implicated between EPC's (via Tnfr-sf13c) and bone marrow stromal cells.	28269	28385
22808010	It is of potential clinical interest to suggest that BAFF may comprise a rationale anti-anemia agent for possible use in combination with EPO.	28386	28528
22808010	Via MGI Gene Expression Atlas, twenty-four cited experiments which include Tnfrsf13c indicate skewed expression among nine non-hematopoietic tissues (with 7 of 24 studies in brain).	28529	28710
22808010	A final set of observations that merit discussion involves additional functional subsets of targets presently discovered to be modulated by EPO.	28711	28855
22808010	This includes up to 99 EPO modulated genes (see Tables S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8).	28856	28935
22808010	Among these, space (and focus) dictate the brief discussion of only a few such factors.	28936	29023
22808010	Among transcription factors (Table S3) Eklf3 can both antagonize or substitute for Eklf1, and Kruppel-like factors also can cross-regulate one another.	29024	29175
22808010	EPO's down-regulation of Eklf3 therefore might contribute to late erythroid development (ie, by indirectly modulating Eklf1 activation of late erythroid genes, eg, beta- globins).	29176	29355
22808010	Mllt3, a transcription factor recently shown in Mllt3-null and transgenic mice to regulate early stage erythro- and megakaryopoiesis, also was down modulated 3.3 fold by EPO (Table S3).	29356	29541
22808010	This therefore may favor advancement to late-stage erythroid development.	29542	29615
22808010	In a category of ubiquitinylation (Table S4), EPO induced the expression of Usp12 and Fbxw7.	29616	29708
22808010	Usp12 is a deubiquitinating enzyme previously implicated in Fanconi anemia, while Fbxw7 (a substrate binding component of Ub ligase complexes) can act as a tumor suppressor in part by regulating Mcl1 levels.	29709	29916
22808010	Other EPO- modulated metabolic factors of note (Table S4) include Tim-9 and Tim-10 which act coordinately to facilitate transport of hydrophobic proteins to inner mitochondrial membranes.	29917	30104
22808010	Interestingly, EPO induced mitochondrial biogenesis also has recently been reported in myocardial tissue.	30105	30210
22808010	In a related category of transporters (Table S4) EPO also regulated the expression of Slc40a1, an iron transporter that may correspond to erythroid ferroportin.	30211	30371
22808010	Here, down- modulation of an iron exporter would result in increased iron accumulation prior to hemoglobinization.	30372	30486
22808010	Finally, eleven factors involved in ribosome biogenesis were induced by EPO (see Table S6) (for references, also see Table S6).	30487	30614
22808010	This was unexpected, but of significant interest based on association of mutations in several ribosomal factors with Diamond-Blackfan anemia and 5q-linked myelodysplastic syndrome,.	30615	30796
22808010	In part, this appears to involve a heightened sensitivity of erythroid progenitors to dysregulated ribosome biogenesis (and a consequential activation of p53).	30797	30956
22808010	Among EPO/EPOR response factors presently discovered in bone marrow derived CFUe-like progenitors, Rrs1, Rpl12, Urb2 and Bxlc2 are known ribosome biogenic factors; Tsr1, Bysl and Nmd3 are involved in 20S, 40S, and 60S rRNA/subunit formation (respectively); Mak16p and Rbp1B and rRNA stabilizers and/or processing components; Rps24 is a structural component; while Dimt1l is an 18S rRNA adenosine demethylase.	30957	31365
22808010	To date, none of the above EPO/EPOR targets have been directly implicated in the anemia of MDS or Diamond Blackfan disease.	31366	31489
22808010	It nonetheless is compelling to suggest that EPO/EPOR signals likely impact on ribosome formation within (pro)erythroblasts – And that this bolstering of ribosome biogenesis may be important to avoid anemia, and keep pace with high demands for the translation of globin transcripts plus erythrocyte membrane and cytoskeletal components.	31490	31826
21238926	Stem cells have the defining characteristic of being able to divide asymmetrically, producing a differentiating daughter cell while simultaneously renewing their own identity.	0	175
21238926	The Drosophila ovarian germline serves as a paradigm for stem cell research due to its structural simplicity and accessibility (Kirilly and Xie, 2007).	176	327
21238926	The Drosophila ovary consists of around 15–20 ovarioles—linear arrangements of developing eggs that originate from the anterior-most structure called the germarium.	328	492
21238926	The germarium houses two to three germline stem cells (GSCs), from which the female germline derives.	493	594
21238926	These GSCs are maintained by signals produced from various surrounding somatic cells, which together make up the ovarian stem cell niche (Figure 1A).	595	744
21238926	The niche cells provide the key self-renewal signal Decapentaplegic (Dpp), which functions as a short-range signal to maintain the adjacent GSCs (Xie and Spradling, 1998) by directly repressing transcription of the key differentiation factor Bag of marbles (Bam) (Chen and McKearin, 2003a; Pyrowolakis et al., 2004; Song et al., 2004).	745	1080
21238926	When the GSC divides, one daughter cell remains within the niche, continuing to receive the Dpp self-renewal signal, whereas the other, the cystoblast (CB), moves posteriorly away from the source of the signal, leading to the derepression of Bam expression, which is both necessary and sufficient to cause germline differentiation (Ohlstein and McKearin, 1997).	1081	1442
21238926	Loss of Dpp signaling allows cells to differentiate, whereas ectopic expression leads to tumorous expansion of GSCs (Chen and McKearin, 2003a; Xie and Spradling, 1998).	1443	1611
21238926	A number of intracellular factors that contribute to stem cell identity have also been characterized, including components of the miRNA pathway (Jin and Xie, 2007; Yang et al., 2007), as well as the translational repressors Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos) (Chen and McKearin, 2005; Forbes and Lehmann, 1998; Szakmary et al., 2005; Wang and Lin, 2004).	1612	1961
21238926	It has been hypothesized that Pum and Nos maintain GSCs by repressing the translation of mRNAs encoding differentiation factors (Forbes and Lehmann, 1998; Szakmary et al., 2005; Wang and Lin, 2004), although the identity of these targets has yet to be elucidated.	1962	2225
21238926	In CBs Nos is downregulated by Bam (Li et al., 2009), potentially allowing expression of these differentiation factors, thus contributing to the change of cell fate.	2226	2391
21238926	Cooperation of the Pum and Nos repressors has also been shown in different developmental contexts, including the embryonic germline where they regulate multiple aspects, such as pole cell migration and proliferation (Asaoka-Taguchi et al., 1999), and the postembryonic nervous system where they control morphogenesis of neuronal dendrites (Ye et al., 2004).	2392	2749
21238926	Pum and Nos often function with an additional translational regulator Brain Tumor (Brat), as described for the repression of hunchback (hb) mRNA to pattern the early embryo (Sonoda and Wharton, 1999), and paralytic mRNA to control excitation of larval motoneurons (Muraro et al., 2008).	2750	3036
21238926	Therefore, we investigated whether Brat also has a functional role in the ovary.	3037	3117
21238926	Here, we provide evidence that Brat acts as a powerful differentiation factor within the germline via its limiting effects on the Dpp self-renewal pathway, allowing cells to robustly adopt distinct fates.	3118	3322
21238926	Furthermore, our data demonstrate how stem cell progeny can rapidly commit to a differentiated fate despite proximity to a niche, a concept relevant to multiple stem cell systems.	3323	3502
21238926	We began by examining the expression of brat in the ovary.	3503	3561
21238926	In situ hybridization using a brat anti-sense probe revealed that the brat transcript is expressed throughout the germline, including GSCs (Figure 1B), whereas immunohistochemistry showed that Brat protein is excluded from GSCs (Figure 1C).	3562	3802
21238926	This is further confirmed by costaining with a Bam-GFP reporter that labels only differentiating cells (Chen and McKearin, 2003b) (Figure 1D).	3803	3945
21238926	In the bam mutant, Brat protein is not present, but transcripts are still detected (see Figure S1 available online), suggesting that Brat may be expressed as part of, or in response to, a differentiation program, downstream of Bam.	3946	4177
21238926	These observations also indicate that brat may be regulated in GSCs at the level of RNA translation.	4178	4278
21238926	Pum and Nos are translational repressors known to be required autonomously in GSCs (Forbes and Lehmann, 1998).	4279	4389
21238926	To investigate whether brat is a target of Pum-Nos repression, epitope-tagged constructs of pum and nos were coexpressed with a GFP reporter bearing the brat 3′UTR (GFP-brat3′) in Drosophila S2 cells.	4390	4590
21238926	Because Brat protein is known to function with Pum-Nos in other contexts, and all three repressors are endogenously expressed in S2 cells (data not shown), RNAi targeting the brat coding region was employed to ensure that any regulation of the reporter was independent of Brat.	4591	4868
21238926	The loss of endogenous Brat protein following RNAi treatment was confirmed by western blot (Figure S1).	4869	4972
21238926	Analysis revealed that Pum-Nos cooperatively repress the GFP-brat3′ reporter expression (Figures 1E and 1F), but not GFP alone (Figure S1).	4973	5112
21238926	Intermediate levels of repression by each regulator alone are attributed to the presence of endogenous Pum or Nos.	5113	5227
21238926	To understand the relevance of this regulation in vivo, we examined various allelic combinations of pum mutant GSCs, which were found to ectopically express Brat protein (Figures 1G and 1I), indicating that brat is normally repressed by Pum in GSCs.	5228	5477
21238926	Similarly, nos mutant GSCs also ectopically express Brat (Figures 1H and 1I).	5478	5555
21238926	Moreover, when nos is ectopically expressed in anterior germline cells, brat repression is maintained in these cells, and the differentiation program is suppressed, producing ectopic GSCs (Figure S1).	5556	5756
21238926	Taken together, these results indicate that the brat mRNA is regulated by Pum-Nos in the ovary, limiting its expression to CBs and developing cysts.	5757	5905
21238926	To investigate the function of Brat in the ovary, we generated a fly line in which the germline was homozygous mutant for the strong brat11 allele, which truncates the protein and removes the vital NHL domain, shown to be necessary for protein-protein interaction (Arama et al., 2000).	5906	6191
21238926	The brat mutant germline displayed an increased growth phenotype, with larger cells than wild-type (Figure 2A).	6192	6303
21238926	The mutant germline also had more GSCs, as indicated by the presence of Bam-negative cells with round fusome organelles (Figures 2B and 2C).	6304	6444
21238926	Analysis of two additional brat alleles reveals a similar expansion in GSC number (Figure S2).	6445	6539
21238926	Because an increase in GSCs is seen when Dpp signaling is augmented in the germarium (Xie and Spradling, 1998), we investigated Dpp signaling in the brat mutant by analyzing expression of the Dpp target gene Daughters against dpp (Dad).	6540	6776
21238926	In wild-type germaria a Dad-lacZ reporter is expressed strongly in GSCs, and at a lower level in CBs, reflecting Dpp-signaling activity (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004) (Figure 2D).	6777	6956
21238926	By contrast the expression domain of Dad-LacZ in the brat mutant is increased, confirming that the Dpp-signaling range is expanded (Figures 2D and 2E).	6957	7108
21238926	These data indicate that Brat potentially has multiple functions within the differentiating germline, including cellular growth control and negative regulation of Dpp signaling.	7109	7286
21238926	To further clarify the function of Brat, we ectopically expressed it specifically in the germline using the GAL4-UAS system and staining for the germline marker Vasa (Figure 3A).	7287	7465
21238926	When Brat is ectopically expressed in this way, the number of germline cells present is severely diminished, whereas other defects such as missing egg chambers and mispackaged cysts are evident (Figures 3B and 3C; Figure S3).	7466	7691
21238926	When the activity of GAL4 is increased by raising the growth temperature, the phenotypes become increasingly severe, ultimately resulting in a complete loss of germline and female sterility (Figure 3D; Figure S3).	7692	7905
21238926	A TUNEL assay reveals no increase in programmed cell death of germline cells over time (Figures 3E–3I), whereas viability staining confirmed an absence of cell death by other mechanisms, such as necrosis (Figures 3E′–3I′).	7906	8128
21238926	Both assays detected some dying somatic cells at the anterior tip of empty germaria (Figures 3H–3I′), suggesting that an intact germline may be required to maintain the germarium structure.	8129	8318
21238926	Together, these results reveal Brat to be a powerful differentiation factor within the germline.	8319	8415
21238926	Brat interacts with the d4EHP and Pum translational repressors to repress the hb mRNA in the embryo (Cho et al., 2006; Sonoda and Wharton, 2001).	8416	8561
21238926	To unravel the molecular mechanism of Brat-mediated differentiation in the germarium, we ectopically expressed mutant forms of the Brat protein that either cannot interact with d4EHP or Pum.	8562	8752
21238926	These two brat mutant transgenes are expressed at approximately equivalent levels to the wild-type transgene (Figure S3).	8753	8874
21238926	Expression of BratR837D, which cannot interact with d4EHP (Cho et al., 2006), resulted in the same loss of germline seen for ectopic expression of wild-type Brat (Figure 4A), suggesting that d4EHP interaction is dispensable for Brat's function in the ovary.	8875	9132
21238926	The ovaries of initially eclosed flies expressing wild-type Brat or BratR837D had few developing egg chambers and no mature embryos, whereas after a period of 21 days, only empty germaria remained (Figure S3).	9133	9342
21238926	Conversely, ovaries expressing the BratG774D mutant, which has a reduced ability to bind Pum (Sonoda and Wharton, 2001), have a less-severe phenotype (Figure 4B), indicating that Brat requires an interaction with Pum in order to promote differentiation.	9343	9596
21238926	These flies eclosed with ovaries bearing intact germlines, which persisted over 21 days and produced mature embryos, although these were rarely laid for unknown reasons (Figure S3).	9597	9778
21238926	Because Pum is expressed in GSCs and also coincides with Brat expression in CBs (Figure 4C), this led us to consider the possibility that Brat is repressed by Pum-Nos in GSCs but acts in conjunction with Pum in CBs.	9779	9994
21238926	Evidence shows that Nos is downregulated in CBs by Bam (Li et al., 2009), implying that Nos is not involved in this Pum-Brat interaction.	9995	10132
21238926	When Brat and Nos are visualized simultaneously, they were found to be expressed in reciprocal patterns (Figure 4D), supporting the idea that Brat interacts with Pum independently of Nos in CBs, thus establishing a distinct repression complex.	10133	10376
21238926	Because Brat protein expression overlaps that of Bam (Figure 1D), and is downstream of it (Figure S1), it is possible that Bam downregulates Nos to allow Brat expression, which then forms a new complex with Pum that acts in favor of differentiation.	10377	10626
21238926	Having shown that Brat acts to promote differentiation, we next examined the potential targets of Brat repression.	10627	10741
21238926	Because loss of brat function leads to expansion of Dpp signaling (Figure 2D), we investigated whether Dpp pathway members could be subject to repression by Pum-Brat.	10742	10908
21238926	Epitope-tagged Pum and Brat constructs were transfected into Drosophila S2 cells, along with reporters or tagged ORFs of the Dpp-signaling transducer Mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad) and the Dpp receptor thickveins (tkv).	10909	11135
21238926	Because S2 cells express pum, nos, and brat at detectable levels (data not shown), nos RNAi was used to ensure that the results reflect nos-independent regulation and, therefore, approximate the in vivo situation.	11136	11349
21238926	The RNAi effectively suppresses Nos expression (Figure S4).	11350	11409
21238926	Western blot analysis reveals that a GFP construct bearing the Mad 3′UTR (GFP-Mad3′) was significantly repressed when cotransfected together with both Pum and Brat (Figure 5A), whereas GFP alone or the Mad coding sequence was not (Figure 5B; Figure S4).	11410	11663
21238926	Removal of nos RNAi reveals the same pattern of repression (Figure S4), although the weaker effect may indicate that Nos and Brat compete for Pum.	11664	11810
21238926	A tagged tkv construct bearing both UTRs showed no repression (Figure 5C), suggesting that the Dpp receptor is not a Pum-Brat target.	11811	11944
21238926	Because mutation of brat also caused a significant growth phenotype, we tested the growth regulator dMyc, which has been implicated as a Brat target in neural cells (Betschinger et al., 2006).	11945	12137
21238926	A reporter bearing the dMyc 3′UTR (GFP-dMyc3′) showed significant repression (Figure 5D), indicating that Pum-Brat can also regulate dMyc-mediated cellular growth.	12138	12301
21238926	Because expression of all reporters is under the control of the actin promoter, it is unlikely that the repression is at the transcriptional level but, instead, points to posttranscriptional regulation, consistent with it being conferred by the presence of the UTRs.	12302	12568
21238926	To confirm that these mRNAs are authentic targets of Brat repression in vivo, Mad and dMyc proteins were visualized in the brat mutant germline.	12569	12713
21238926	In the absence of a suitable Mad antibody, the expression of activated Mad (pMad) was examined.	12714	12809
21238926	Wild-type pMad is limited to GSCs and CBs at lower levels, reflecting Dpp-signaling activity as described previously (Song et al., 2004) (Figure 5E).	12810	12959
21238926	In brat mutant germaria, pMad protein distribution is expanded (Figure 5E), consistent with Mad being a target of Brat repression.	12960	13090
21238926	Examination of dMyc protein in wild-type germaria reveals moderate levels of nuclear expression beginning after 16-cell cyst encapsulation (Figure 5F), and high levels in GSCs with reduced expression in CBs (Figure 5G), as described previously (Rhiner et al., 2009).	13091	13357
21238926	In the brat mutant germline, expression of dMyc occurs earlier and is more evident in the nucleus, whereas at the anterior germarium, expression is present in additional cells (Figures 5F and 5G).	13358	13554
21238926	Therefore, our data suggest that Brat repression limits interpretation of the Dpp signal, in addition to restricting dMyc-mediated cellular growth.	13555	13702
21238926	To assess the potential of the Brat-mediated network to produce a necessary sharp transition between adjacent self-renewing and differentiating cells, we generated a local, single-cell mathematical model of the intracellular network based on our experimental data (Figure 6A).	13703	13979
21238926	This simplified, local model includes Brat-mediated translational repression of Mad and assumes sufficient levels of both intracellular Pum and Med.	13980	14128
21238926	The model confirms that Brat-mediated repression of Mad can confer bistability to pMad and other components of the network (Figures 6B and 6C) and that this bistable behavior is largely insensitive to the precise parameter values (Figure S5).	14129	14371
21238926	Therefore, the intracellular network allows two adjacent cells such as the GSC and CB to have equivalent levels of bound and signaling Dpp ligand, yet distinct levels of pMad and other intracellular components.	14372	14582
21238926	The GSC or CB fate adopted by each cell depends on the cellular machinery, the levels of Pum, Brat and Mad, as well as the history of active signaling in the cell.	14583	14746
21238926	Loss or ectopic expression of Brat in the model abolishes this bistability, and cells become either ultrasensitive or refractory to extracellular Dpp (Figure 6B), which is consistent with the observations in Figures 2 and 3.	14747	14971
21238926	To investigate Brat-mediated differentiation in the niche space and cell-to-cell competition, we developed a 3D spatiotemporal model of an idealized germarium.	14972	15131
21238926	The 3D model contains two volumetric compartments: extracellular and intracellular, and includes chemical reactions and exchange of molecules between each individual cell's surface and the intracellular compartment.	15132	15347
21238926	This allows us to investigate cell responses to changing conditions in the germarium, as well as interactions between cells, such as competition for Dpp in the niche space.	15348	15520
21238926	The 3D model also includes additional elements, such as RBP9, which regulates Bam in developing cysts (Kim-Ha et al., 1999), and incorporates the repression of dMyc by Brat (Figures 5D and 5G; Figure S5).	15521	15725
21238926	Because the mechanism of dMyc action in the germarium is unknown, we used the model to investigate two putative functions for dMyc (Figure 6D).	15726	15869
21238926	The first “synthesis” model involves a network whereby dMyc upregulates the overall intracellular protein synthesis rate, consistent with the previously observed role of dMyc in cellular growth control (Grewal et al., 2005).	15870	16094
21238926	The second “endocytosis” model is based on data suggesting that cells with higher dMyc levels outcompete cells with less dMyc, potentially by increasing uptake of the Dpp ligand (Moreno and Basler, 2004; Rhiner et al., 2009).	16095	16320
21238926	In both models the networks lead to bistability and the capacity for sharp delineation between adjacent cells.	16321	16431
21238926	Each network was tested by modeling a situation in which one of the two GSCs expressed ectopic dMyc (4xdMyc), which has been shown to lead to GSC competition and niche takeover by the 4xdMyc cell in vivo (Rhiner et al., 2009).	16432	16658
21238926	In the “synthesis” model the introduced 4xdMyc cell exhibits no significant change in pMad level, or only a small increase for some parameter sets, and no changes are evident in the adjacent cells (Figure 6E, t1).	16659	16872
21238926	When the Dpp level is transiently reduced, the 4xdMyc clone does differ from the adjacent GSC (Figure 6E, t2).	16873	16983
21238926	However, modification of the intracellular network alone cannot confer a competitive advantage to the cell, and on return to normal Dpp levels, both cells return to the previously observed steady state (Figure 6E, t3).	16984	17202
21238926	In this network the 4xdMyc clone cannot outcompete wild-type GSCs, inconsistent with the in vivo observations (Rhiner et al., 2009).	17203	17335
21238926	In contrast the “endocytosis” model reveals that although pMad levels also do not substantially increase in the 4xdMyc cell, signaling in the adjacent GSC diminishes (Figure 6F, t1).	17336	17518
21238926	The low dMyc expressing GSC is susceptible to small perturbations in the level of Dpp such that it will differentiate following a transient loss of Dpp (Figure 6F, t2), allowing the 4xdMyc clone to take over the niche and germarium via symmetric division (Figure 6F, t3).	17519	17790
21238926	Thus, this network exhibits effective competition and predicts that it may occur by limiting the amount of Dpp ligand available to the “loser” cell, rather than through an increase of signaling in the “winner” 4xdMyc cell.	17791	18013
21238926	The comparison of the two networks demonstrates how simple upregulation of endocytosis can in principle lead to competition of GSCs for Dpp or other niche signals, although additional experiments aimed at measuring Dpp uptake in GSCs and CBs will be required to directly test this model.	18014	18301
21238926	Because the “endocytosis” model more faithfully reflects GSC behavior in vivo, its validity was further considered by examining the spatial expression of network components.	18302	18475
21238926	The expression patterns generated are consistent with our experimental observations in both wild-type germaria (Figure 6G) and under conditions of altered Brat levels (Figure 6H).	18476	18655
21238926	The model was then used to explore the signaling dynamics during division and differentiation of a GSC.	18656	18759
21238926	Our analysis reveals that immediately following GSC division, the daughter cell, which we assume contains initially high pMad and low Brat levels inherited from the mother cell, rapidly evolves to the low Dpp-signaling state (Figure 6I, positions 1–2).	18760	19012
21238926	The rapid evolution of pMad in the CB can be attributed to two dominant and directly related processes: lower Dpp levels at the distal position of the CB relative to the GSCs, and competition between the CB and GSCs for available Dpp.	19013	19247
21238926	In general, we find that the cell in position 2 is sensitive to Dpp production rates and the effective diffusivity of Dpp, which may explain the experimental observation of two to three GSCs per niche in wild-type germaria.	19248	19471
21238926	We also tested whether the model could recapitulate other behavior of the stem cell system seen in vivo, including the reoccupation of an empty niche by the dedifferentiation of developing cysts.	19472	19667
21238926	If no GSCs are present, resulting in an absence of competition, the increase in available Dpp is sufficient to reverse the differentiated fate of a CB (Figure 6I, red line to position 1), restoring the GSC population.	19668	19885
21238926	To test this phenomenon for cells far from the Dpp source, we developed a 2D cell array model and found that in a niche devoid of cells and a germarium with a cyst-fated cell in the posterior region, the distribution of Dpp automatically adjusts and switches the differentiating cell into a GSC-like cell (unpublished data).	19886	20210
21238926	Overall, these data, together with the predicted function of dMyc in endocytosis, are consistent not only with the cell competition data obtained (Rhiner et al., 2009) but also the suggested mechanism of GSC replacement through symmetric division of a single GSC (Xie and Spradling, 2000) and the repopulation of an empty niche (Kai and Spradling, 2004), providing insights and testable hypotheses for a better understanding of the underlying interactions responsible for these behaviors in vivo.	20211	20707
21238926	Finally, the case of a brat-null mutant was considered to observe signaling dynamics in a system that is sensitive to Dpp signaling but does not exhibit the bistability provided by Brat (Figure 6J).	20708	20906
21238926	In the absence of Brat, sensitivity to Dpp signaling is established throughout the system, consistent with an increase in GSC-like cells in the germarium, as seen in vivo (Figure 2B).	20907	21090
21238926	Cells that are far from the Dpp source will eventually begin to differentiate but are much more susceptible to dedifferentiation (Figure 6J).	21091	21232
21238926	Thus, the Brat-mediated repression of Mad and dMyc provides a robust autoregulatory module that is essential for maintaining stable and discrete cell fates during the transition from self-renewing to differentiated identity.	21233	21457
21238926	Without Brat, this sharp delineation is lost, leaving the differentiation process vulnerable to perturbations in the Dpp signal.	21458	21586
21238926	Overall, our data show that the decision of a stem cell to self-renew or differentiate depends on feedback generated by a network of translational repressors (Figure 7).	21587	21756
21238926	When anchored to the niche, the GSC receives high levels of Dpp signal due to its proximity to ligand-producing cells, in addition to the effects of a competitive mechanism, modeled here as increased Dpp-ligand uptake, resulting from high dMyc expression (Figure 7, 1).	21757	22026
21238926	These factors, in conjunction with other molecular players that augment Dpp signaling (see below), silence transcription of Bam (Figure 7, 2), allowing Pum-Nos to repress mRNAs encoding differentiation factors, including the brat mRNA (Figure 7, 3).	22027	22276
21238926	Following GSC division, a transient loss of Dpp signaling is sufficient to initiate a chain of events that ultimately locks the CB into a differentiation fate.	22277	22436
21238926	A reduction in Dpp signaling allows derepression of Bam expression in the CB (Figure 7, 4).	22437	22528
21238926	Bam then downregulates Nos (Figure 7, 5) to subsequently allow the translation of differentiation-promoting factors, including Brat (Figure 7, 6).	22529	22675
21238926	Brat interacts with Pum to form a distinct translational repression complex with altered specificity, which targets self-renewal mRNAs, including those of Mad and dMyc (Figure 7, 7).	22676	22858
21238926	Downregulation of signal transduction by Brat's repression of Mad can explain at the molecular level the previously reported genetic evidence showing that Bam limits Dpp signaling downstream of its receptor in the ovary (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004) because Brat is expressed downstream of Bam.	22859	23154
21238926	The loss of Mad in GSCs has been shown to cause their differentiation (Xie and Spradling, 1998), whereas the loss of just one copy of Mad can reverse the effect of Dpp ectopic expression (Xi et al., 2005), illustrating the acute sensitivity of germline cells to changes in Dpp pathway components and, hence, Brat's impact on cellular fate.	23155	23494
21238926	Brat repression of Mad and dMyc diminishes the CB's ability to respond to the Dpp signal, committing the cell to the differentiation program.	23495	23636
21238926	The regulation of Dpp transduction is one level at which Dpp signaling is regulated within the ovarian stem cell system.	23637	23757
21238926	The production and availability of the ligand depend upon transcriptional control in niche cells mediated by JAK-STAT signaling (Lopez-Onieva et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008a), whereas spatial regulation is provided by extracellular elements such as type IV collagens that sequester Dpp ligand (Wang et al., 2008b), and the glypican Dally that potentiates local Dpp signaling (Guo and Wang, 2009; Liu et al., 2010), thus contributing to Dpp's limited availability.	23758	24222
21238926	The action of Brat ensures that ligand present in the vicinity of CBs is transduced at a limited rate.	24223	24325
21238926	This is complemented by dSmurf-mediated degradation of Mad (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004; Chen and McKearin, 2005), and the control of expression and localization of the Dpp receptor Saxophone by miR-184 in differentiating cells (Iovino et al., 2009).	24326	24577
21238926	Thus, multiple mechanisms are employed to restrict Dpp-signaling activity in the germarium, consistent with the essential requirement to downregulate Dpp signaling to ensure proper oogenesis.	24578	24769
21238926	However, whereas the germarium contributes to the spatial control of Dpp, Brat-regulated mechanisms, including the repression of dMyc, provide a link between extracellular regulation and intracellular interpretation.	24770	24986
21238926	The interactions we have identified and modeled form a bistable network, which demonstrates multiple behaviors that are observed in vivo.	24987	25124
21238926	The bistability generates a large difference between the minimum amount of Dpp required to maintain self-renewal and that needed to transition from differentiation to self-renewal.	25125	25305
21238926	This effect affords a robust mechanism, in concert with cell competition, to ensure a constant population of GSCs because the balance between Dpp secretion and utilization is sufficient to support only two to three GSCs.	25306	25526
21238926	Our modeling data suggest that dMyc-mediated competition can be explained by a role for dMyc in promoting endocytosis of Dpp.	25527	25652
21238926	However, because the link between increased dMyc and elevated pMad levels is molecularly undefined, we cannot exclude other possibilities, such as influences of dMyc on pMad stability or maintenance of its phosphorylated state.	25653	25880
21238926	In addition to the effect of dMyc, physical niche interactions, such as niche adherence and forces from crowding, have also been suggested as a competitive interaction downstream of Bam expression (Jin et al., 2008).	25881	26097
21238926	Interestingly, niche adherence in GSCs, mediated by E-cadherin, has been observed to be independent of dMyc (Jin et al., 2008; Rhiner et al., 2009), indicating that these two potential competition mechanisms are not coupled at the level of dMyc expression.	26098	26354
21238926	It is likely that there are multiple parallel competitive mechanisms downstream of Bam, which could potentially be mediated by Brat, and extension of the model will contribute to their delineation in the future.	26355	26566
21238926	Our data are consistent with Pum being a member of distinct translation repression complexes that target different pools of mRNAs.	26567	26697
21238926	Evidence suggests that the recruitment of Pum corepressors is both context and target dependent.	26698	26794
21238926	The well-documented Pum-Nos-Brat complex that targets the hb mRNA in the embryo (Sonoda and Wharton, 2001) does not appear to play a role in the germarium because Nos and Brat have mutually exclusive expression patterns.	26795	27015
21238926	Although there are precedents for a Pum-Nos complex functioning in the absence of Brat, e.g., in the repression of the cyclinB (cycB) mRNA in embryonic pole cells (Kadyrova et al., 2007; Sonoda and Wharton, 2001), to our knowledge, a Pum-Brat complex has not been described previously.	27016	27301
21238926	Because Nos functions with Pum to co-recruit Brat to the Pum-Nos-Brat complex, it is likely that in the absence of Nos, another factor takes on this role in CBs.	27302	27463
21238926	One possibility is that Bam and its binding partner BGCN are responsible for this function because they have been implicated in translation repression in CBs (Li et al., 2009) and can interact with Pum (Kim et al., 2010).	27464	27685
21238926	Dissection of elements within the mRNA 3′UTRs conferring specificity of translation repression by either the Pum-Nos or Pum-Brat complexes will ultimately be informative in terms of understanding mRNA selection, although potentially challenging due, in part, to the loose binding consensus of Pum (Gerber et al., 2006) and its binding promiscuity (Gupta et al., 2008).	27686	28054
21238926	Brat belongs to the NHL domain family that also includes the Drosophila protein Mei-P26, which, like Brat, acts to promote ovarian germline differentiation (Neumuller et al., 2008).	28055	28236
21238926	Both Brat and Mei-P26 have higher expression in CBs than GSCs, yet this is achieved by distinct mechanisms.	28237	28344
21238926	For Brat, Pum-Nos repression of the mRNA ensures that its expression is limited to CBs and not GSCs, whereas the expression of Mei-P26 is stimulated in CBs by the binding of Vasa to a U-rich region of the mei-P26 mRNA, which then potentially recruits the essential translation activator eIF5B (Liu et al., 2009).	28345	28657
21238926	In addition the miRNA pathway has been implicated in repression of Mei-P26 in the Drosophila wing (Herranz et al., 2010), and because the miRNA pathway is active in GSCs (Park et al., 2007), it may serve to negatively regulate Mei-P26 levels in these cells.	28658	28915
21238926	In addition to the distinct mechanisms used to actively limit Brat or Mei-P26 protein to the CB, it appears that each paralog also mediates differentiation through contrasting mechanisms.	28916	29103
21238926	Although our work shows that Brat acts via direct repression of self-renewal promoting mRNAs, Mei-P26 is thought to function through inhibition of the miRNA pathway, affecting regulation of differentiating-promoting target mRNAs in CBs and differentiating cells (Neumuller et al., 2008).	29104	29391
21238926	Mei-P26 interacts with the miRNA pathway effector Argonaute (Ago1), although how this interaction affects the miRNA pathway is currently unclear.	29392	29537
21238926	Mei-P26 shares significant domain homology with the C. elegans protein Ncl-2 (Glasscock et al., 2005), a putative E3-ubiquitin ligase, suggesting that Mei-P26 could act via ubiquitination to downregulate either Ago1 directly or another component of the miRNA pathway.	29538	29805
21238926	Indeed, mammalian homologs similarly control cell fate through ubiquitination and miRNA regulation, such as the mouse ortholog mLin41 that antagonizes Ago2 by ubiquitination (Rybak et al., 2009), and TRIM32 that regulates miRNA level in neuroblast progenitors and additionally ubiquitinates c-Myc (Schwamborn et al., 2009).	29806	30129
21238926	Although Brat can also bind Ago (Neumuller et al., 2008), it is not known whether Brat functions through miRNA regulation in the germarium (Figure 7).	30130	30280
21238926	However, Brat lacks the RING finger domain known to provide ubiquitin-ligase activity (Glasscock et al., 2005), potentially accounting for the contrasting mechanisms of regulation described for Brat and Mei-P26 in the control of germline differentiation.	30281	30535
21238926	Brat has been previously identified in an additional stem cell system of Drosophila as a key regulator of neuroblast progeny differentiation during development of the larval brain (Bello et al., 2006; Betschinger et al., 2006).	30536	30763
21238926	Together with our findings, these data could suggest a global function for Brat in promoting cell fate changes in stem cell systems.	30764	30896
21238926	Brat orthologs have been identified in other species and have also been implicated in disease, including neurodegeneration in mice (Balastik et al., 2008) and formation of brain tumors in humans (Boulay et al., 2009).	30897	31114
21238926	Thus, our study will serve as a platform for understanding differentiation in mammalian stem cell systems as well as related genetic diseases.	31115	31257
21238926	Fly stocks used were: yw67c23 as the initial stock to generate transgenics; Dad-LacZ (Tsuneizumi et al., 1997); GFP-Pum (Buszczak et al., 2007); Nos-myc (Verrotti and Wharton, 2000); Gal4-Nos:VP16, pumMsc, pum01688, pumET1, UAS-Flp (Bloomington Stock Center); Bam-GFP (Chen and McKearin, 2003b); nosRC, nosRD (a gift from R. Baines); Df(3R)DlFX1 (Forbes and Lehmann, 1998); and brat11 (Frank et al., 2002).	31258	31664
21238926	Transgenic flies were generated by standard P element-mediated transformation using the pUASp vector.	31665	31766
21238926	brat mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene).	31767	31854
21238926	Clones were generated by FLP/FRT recombination.	31855	31902
21238926	Flies of genotype Gal4-Nos:VP16/+ ; FRT-brat/FRT-GFP ; UAS-FLP/+ were dissected; clones were confirmed by loss of GFP.	31903	32021
21238926	As a control UAS-FLP was omitted.	32022	32055
21238926	For immunofluorescence, adults were dissected after maturing on yeast/apple juice agar plates, and ovaries were fixed and stained using standard techniques (detailed methods available on request).	32056	32252
21238926	Antibodies used are detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.	32253	32322
21238926	S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's Modified Drosophila Media (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep.	32323	32444
21238926	DNA constructs were transfected using Effectene (QIAGEN) according to manufacturers' instructions, and cells harvested following 3 days expression.	32445	32592
21238926	Western blot was performed using standard methods and detected using Li-Cor Infrared detection system.	32593	32695
21238926	Primary antibodies were used at 1:2000 dilution: mouse anti-HA (Santa Cruz); mouse anti-Myc (Santa Cruz); rabbit anti-Flag (Roche); mouse anti-V5 (Abcam); rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam); rabbit anti-Brat (Sonoda and Wharton, 2001); and mouse anti-Tubulin (Roche).	32696	32952
21238926	Secondary antibodies were used 1:10,000 dilution: IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse and IRDye 680LT goat anti-rabbit (Li-Cor).	32953	33073
21238926	Western blot IR signals were quantified using Li-Cor Odyssey software.	33074	33144
21238926	Error bars were generated from the SEM of at least three separate biological repeats with Student's t test used to evaluate significance.	33145	33282
21238926	For the local cell model, we developed a set of coupled, nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which are given along with parameters in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.	33283	33465
21238926	The core model is a simplified form of the known interaction network in BMP signaling.	33466	33552
21238926	This model considers only BMP-bound receptors, Mad, Bam, Nos, and Brat, with a double-negative feedback loop, formed by Brat acting on Mad availability and Nos acting on Brat availability.	33553	33741
21238926	dMyc is modeled here, but without feedback on other components.	33742	33805
21238926	The complete system comprises six state variables and 22 parameters (kinetic rates, regulatory constants, and the bound receptor level).	33806	33942
21238926	Equations were solved numerically using MATLAB® and the Matcont numerical bifurcation analysis software (Dhooge et al., 2003).	33943	34069
21238926	The local model equations were expanded further to develop a 3D spatiotemporal model of the germarium.	34070	34172
21238926	The nondimensionalized equations, including boundary conditions, are given in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.	34173	34288
21238926	This system considers BMP diffusing from a source boundary at the anterior end of the germarium and binding to receptors at the surface of cells, where signaling and receptor endocytosis occurs.	34289	34483
21238926	In addition to expanding the previous model spatially, this system considers the spatial distribution of Pum and RBP9, an inhibitor of Bam (Kim-Ha et al., 1999) .	34484	34646
21238926	We developed partial differential equation balances on extracellular, membrane-bound, and intracellular components.	34647	34762
21238926	All species are free to diffuse in each subdomain and on the cell membrane, and ligand uptake occurs by the binding of extracellular Dpp to transmembrane receptors, which are internalized as a Dpp-receptor complex.	34763	34977
21238926	Effects of alternate mechanisms of dMyc activity are considered in the 3D model.	34978	35058
21238926	In one model the effect of dMyc modulating the rate of BMP-bound receptor endocytosis is tested.	35059	35155
21238926	For simplicity we assumed a linear relationship between scaled dMyc, added to a constant basal endocytosis rate.	35156	35268
21238926	To describe the alternate dMyc model, wherein protein synthesis rates for many intracellular processes are upregulated by dMyc, production terms for Mad, Bam, Nos, and Brat linearly depend on the concentration of dMyc.	35269	35487
21238926	Partial differential equations were solved using COMSOL Multiphysics®.	35488	35558
21238926	All parameter values were obtained in the literature where available or estimated from similar processes in other systems (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details).	35559	35736
20801540	Aceruloplasminemia (ACP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism, where affected patients typically present with a triad of diabetes mellitus, retinal degeneration, and neurological symptoms.	0	209
20801540	Absence of ceruloplasmin (CP) in plasma in combination with mild anemia, hypoferremia, and hyperferritinemia is a diagnostic finding.	210	343
20801540	The prevalence of ACP is highest in Japan where it is estimated to be 1 in 2 million.	344	429
20801540	ACP can be caused by nonsense, missense, splice-site or frame shift mutations in the CP gene, where a total of about 40 different mutations has been described.	430	589
20801540	One ACP patient, heterozygous for only one missense CP mutation p.R701W, has been reported suggesting a dominant negative effect of this mutation.	590	736
20801540	CP is mainly expressed in hepatocytes and glial cells, where the hepatic splicing variant includes exons 1–19 and encodes a soluble, 1040 amino acid protein.	737	894
20801540	Astrocytes express a membrane-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored form of CP, resulting from alternative splicing, where a cryptic splice site within exon 18 is spliced to exon 20 and exon 19 is skipped.	895	1112
20801540	Hepatic CP is secreted into the plasma as a glycosylated metalloprotein that binds >90% of the copper in plasma.	1113	1225
20801540	CP is a multi-copper ferroxidase which facilitates iron binding to transferrin and promotes iron export from hepatocytes, macrophages, and glial cells [7–9].	1226	1383
20801540	Iron export from macrophages is required for the recycling of heme–iron from senescent red blood cells.	1384	1487
20801540	In contrast, iron export from hepatocytes supplies iron from stores during iron deprivation or iron loss.	1488	1593
20801540	The only known iron-exporter is ferroportin, which is stabilized by GPI-anchored CP in glial cells.	1594	1693
20801540	How soluble CP in plasma promotes iron export from hepatocytes remains unknown.	1694	1773
20801540	Ferroxidase activity and stabilization of ferroportin at the plasma-membrane require copper in the active site of CP.	1774	1891
20801540	Supply of copper to the hepatocellular Golgi apparatus for correct CP assembly and folding requires the activities of ATP7A, which is implicated in intestinal copper uptake, as well as the activity of ATP7B, which is an intracellular copper transport protein.	1892	2151
20801540	Menkes disease and Wilson’s disease, which are associated with genetic defects in ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively, are characteristically associated with low serum CP concentrations resulting from reduced copper supply to the Golgi apparatus.	2152	2392
20801540	Iron accumulation in ACP affects the liver, pancreas, and central nervous system, where the retina, striatum, thalamus, and dentate nucleus are primarily affected.	2393	2556
20801540	Brain iron accumulation can be associated with retinal degeneration, extrapyramidal symptoms, cerebellar symptoms, and mental dysfunction which indicate neurodegeneration.	2557	2728
20801540	In contrast, hepatic iron overload is not associated with liver disease in ACP but diabetes may be the result of iron-induced damage of pancreatic islet cells.	2729	2888
20801540	Disease onset typically occurs in the 4th–5th decade of life and ACP has a slowly progressive course, with deterioration of neurological symptoms that can cause typical complications and death in most patients in the 6th decade of life.	2889	3125
20801540	Iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine or deferiprone has been reported to reduce hepatic iron stores in ACP and transfusion of fresh plasma has been shown to partially reconstitute plasma ferroxidase activity [14–18].	3126	3346
20801540	Brain iron concentrations and neurological symptoms did not improve on iron chelators, which may be a result of the limited permeability of the blood–brain barrier for these drugs.	3347	3527
20801540	Herein, we report the clinical presentation of ACP in three siblings and the biochemical consequences of a novel CP mutation in a canonical splice-site.	3528	3680
20801540	Further, the clinical, biochemical, and radiological responses to iron chelation therapy with deferasirox are presented.	3681	3801
20801540	This study was approved by our local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all patients.	3802	3908
20801540	Serum iron parameters, serum copper concentration, serum CP concentrations, and hematological parameters were determined using routine clinical biochemical methods.	3909	4073
20801540	Serum ferroxidase activity was determined using p-Phenylenediamine (Sigma Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) as artificial substrate according to a previously published method.	4074	4241
20801540	For cDNA sequencing, total liver RNA extracted from a liver biopsy specimen of the index case was used as a PCR template after reverse transcription.	4242	4391
20801540	PCR products were directly sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Kit v.3.2 (Applied Biosystems, Vienna, Austria) and an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Vienna, Austria).	4392	4582
20801540	Primers and annealing temperatures for RT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 1.	4583	4665
20801540	Exons 11–17 and the exon–intron boundaries of the CP gene were sequenced from genomic DNA.	4666	4756
20801540	Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2.	4757	4810
20801540	Sequence analysis was carried out with the Sequencher v4.9 software (Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI) using the Ensemble entries for human CP as reference (ENSG00000047457, ENST00000264613).	4811	4994
20801540	To screen 100 chromosomes from healthy controls for the presence of an eventually identified c.2554+1G>T mutation, a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was set up.	4995	5170
20801540	The newly identified c.2554+1G>T mutation creates an additional RsaI cleavage cut site in the corresponding PCR product, which can be used for high throughput screening.	5171	5340
20801540	PCR products were analyzed after RsaI digestion by HPLC using a WAVE DHPLC system (Transgenomic, Glasgow, UK).	5341	5451
20801540	Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with Perls’ reagents according to standard methods.	5452	5605
20801540	Tissue iron and copper concentrations were determined in an unfixed and air-dried liver biopsy sample by atomic absorption spectroscopy.	5606	5742
20801540	For the non-invasive quantification of liver iron, T2∗ relaxation times were calculated from a fat-saturated multi-echo gradient-echo MR sequence.	5743	5889
20801540	For the quantification of liver T1-values a fast T1-mapping sequence based on an inversion recovery snapshot FLASH sequence was used which allowed the acquisition of a single T1 map during one breath hold.	5890	6095
20801540	T1 and T2∗ acquisitions were obtained for identical slice positions and slice parameters.	6096	6185
20801540	T2∗ and T1 maps were calculated off-line using ImageJ software (NIH, MD, USA).	6186	6264
20801540	The parameter maps were analyzed by the placement of region of interests into different hepatic lobe segments, whereby identical regions of interests were used in T1 and T2∗ maps.	6265	6444
20801540	Care was taken to avoid the inclusion of large vessels.	6445	6500
20801540	Protein extracts from liver biopsies were made by the addition of radio-immuno precipitation buffer-containing protease inhibitors to a 1 mm3 snap-frozen piece of liver tissue.	6501	6677
20801540	After reduction and heat denaturation, protein extracts were separated on an 8% discontinuous SDS gel.	6678	6780
20801540	After blotting onto a PVDF membrane, CP immunoreactivity was detected by incubation of blocked (in 1% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween) membranes in goat anti human CP polyclonal antibody (C0911-Sigma Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer.	6781	7047
20801540	Immune complexes were visualized by ECL after incubation of washed membranes in a rabbit anti goat peroxidase conjugate at a 1:1000 dilution.	7048	7189
20801540	A 3D homology model of truncated CP protein was made based on the PDB template 2J5WA using the Swiss-Model workspace.	7190	7307
20801540	Models were analyzed and figures were prepared with Accelrys DS Visualizer v2.0.	7308	7388
20801540	The index case (IV.2) was a 47 year old male who complained of a progressive gait disorder with falls which had deteriorated over the last 3–4 years.	7389	7538
20801540	In the neurological examination the patient presented with a cerebellar syndrome with a slurred speech, hypometric saccades, and an intention tremor in the right hand.	7539	7706
20801540	When standing he was unsteady with a reduced postural stability and a pronounced gait ataxia.	7707	7800
20801540	The patient also had a left-sided spastic hemiparesis following a traumatic brain injury at the age of 23 years.	7801	7913
20801540	Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was diagnosed at the age of 26 years.	7914	7987
20801540	Blood tests showed marked hyperferritinemia and hypoferremia with normal transferrin but decreased transferrin saturation (Table 1).	7988	8120
20801540	Serum CP and ferroxidase activity were undetectable.	8121	8173
20801540	Serum copper was 2.1 μM (reference range 11–22 μM).	8174	8225
20801540	No hematological or other biochemical abnormalities were found.	8226	8289
20801540	To assess tissue iron concentrations, MRI of the abdomen and the brain with T1 and T2∗ relaxation time-mapping was carried out.	8290	8417
20801540	As shown in Fig.	8418	8434
20801540	2A, iron accumulation was found in the liver, the basal ganglia, and the dentate nuclei.	8435	8523
20801540	Liver histology showed a normally structured liver with severe hepatocellular iron overload but no stainable iron in macrophages (Fig.	8524	8658
20801540	3).	4991	4994
20801540	The results from hepatic iron quantification are shown in Table 1.	8663	8729
20801540	Based on these findings the clinical diagnosis of ACP was made in the proband and family studies were initiated.	8730	8842
20801540	Family studies showed a consanguineous loop and the family history revealed diabetes in a sister (IV.4) of the proband (Fig.	8843	8967
20801540	1).	8117	8120
20801540	As shown in Table 1 hyperferritinemia, hypoferremia, and undetectable serum CP in two sisters indicated ACP.	8972	9080
20801540	A movement disorder with a hypomimia and a postural tremor of both arms were present in the older sister (IV.4), whereas all other family members were clinically unaffected.	9081	9254
20801540	Ophthalmological investigation in all individuals showed retinal pigment epithelium changes with a central depigmentation and a bulls-eye like macula but a normal vision and perimetry in patients IV.4 and IV.5.	9255	9465
20801540	MR imaging and liver histology in the biochemically affected sisters showed iron accumulation in the basal ganglia, dentate nuclei, and the liver.	9466	9612
20801540	The results from family studies further supported the diagnosis of autosomal recessive inheritance of ACP in this pedigree and molecular genetic testing was initiated.	9613	9780
20801540	To identify the genetic cause of ACP, hepatic cDNA analysis was carried out and RT-PCR did not show the expected full length product but showed an aberrant fragment, 100 bp shorter than the expected for the PCR product spanning from exons 13 to 16 (Supplementary Fig.	9781	10048
20801540	1).	8117	8120
20801540	Sequencing of the aberrant fragment showed absence of exon 14 in all biochemically affected family members.	10053	10160
20801540	No other mutations were detected.	10161	10194
20801540	Direct sequencing of genomic DNA revealed homozygosity for c.2554+1G>T in intron 14 of the CP gene in all biochemically affected family members.	10195	10339
20801540	The mother (III.1) and one unaffected brother (IV.3) were heterozygous carriers, whereas the other brother had the wild-type sequence on both alleles.	10340	10490
20801540	The c.2554+1G>T mutation of the CP gene was not found in 100 control chromosomes by PCR amplification, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and D-HPLC (Supplementary Fig.	10491	10666
20801540	2).	10667	10670
20801540	Genetic and biochemical findings in this family show segregation of this novel mutation with ACP.	10671	10768
20801540	The c.2554+1G>T mutation, which was shown to cause skipping of exon 14 is predicted to preserve the open reading frame and resulted in the loss of 43 amino acids spanning residues G809–G852 with a molecular weight of 4.6 kDa.	10769	10994
20801540	This was confirmed by SDS–PAGE and Western blotting of proteins extracted from liver biopsies of genetically affected family members and a healthy control, which showed major immunoreactive bands at the expected molecular weights (Fig.	10995	11230
20801540	4A).	11231	11235
20801540	A structural homology model of the mutant protein that appears to be expressed in the liver of genetically affected individuals was constructed (Supplementary Fig.	11236	11399
20801540	3).	4991	4994
20801540	Our model suggests that the missing region from G809–G852 is located within domain 5 (D724–P903) of CP, which contains neither a copper-binding site nor the ferroxidase site.	11404	11578
20801540	Analysis of the model suggests that rearrangement of the termini flanking the deleted residues would require a cumulative shift in their positions of approximately 20 Å.	11579	11748
20801540	The abnormal CP, where the open reading frame and all copper-binding sites are putatively preserved, is expressed in hepatocytes, but undetectable in plasma.	11749	11906
20801540	To study the pathogenesis of iron overload in ACP, mRNA of the key regulator of iron metabolism hepcidin was quantified by real time PCR in liver biopsies.	11907	12062
20801540	To determine if the observed increase in hepcidin expression was appropriate for the degree of iron overload, hepcidin/log (ferritin) ratios were calculated.	12063	12220
20801540	As shown in Fig.	8418	8434
20801540	4B mean hepcidin mRNA levels and hepcidin/log (ferritin) ratios are higher in ACP, dysmetabolic siderosis, and patients with fatty liver disease as compared to patients with C282Y homozygous hemochromatosis or viral hepatitis.	12238	12464
20801540	To treat iron overload associated with ACP, iron chelation therapy with deferasirox was started in all three homozygotes for the CP splice-site mutation with initial doses of 17–20 mg/kg bodyweight per day.	12465	12671
20801540	Treatment duration ranged from 1 week to 5 months.	12672	12722
20801540	In the index case deferasirox dose was reduced from 20 to 15 mg/kg/day after 4 weeks due to diarrhea and after 3 months treatment was stopped because of anemia (hemoglobin 9.9 g/dl).	12723	12905
20801540	Patient IV.4 also developed anemia (hemoglobin 10 g/dl) and treatment was stopped after 5 months due to a gradual increase in creatinine up to 1.3 mg/dl.	12906	13059
20801540	Treatment was discontinued after one week in patient IV.5 because of a skin rash.	13060	13141
20801540	Serum ferritin concentrations decreased in all patients whereas serum iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation remained unchanged during deferasirox therapy (Fig.	13142	13309
20801540	2D).	13310	13314
20801540	Non-invasive iron quantification by MRI showed a marked decrease in liver iron concentration after 3 months in the index case and in patient IV.4.	13315	13461
20801540	After 5 months of treatment T1 and T2∗ relaxation times in patient IV.4 increased from 390 to 513 ms (normal 570 ± 40 ms) and from 1.8 to 10.9 ms (normal 24 ± 6 ms), respectively.	13462	13641
20801540	However, there was no imaging evidence for significant effects on brain iron overload during iron chelation therapy in both patients.	13642	13775
20801540	Accordingly, neurological symptoms remained stable during the follow up.	13776	13848
20801540	Both patients reported a transient reduction in their insulin demands on deferasirox.	13849	13934
20801540	Iron chelation therapy with deferasirox is effective in reducing hepatic iron concentrations and improves endogenous insulin production, but has no short term effect on brain iron accumulation.	13935	14128
20801540	CP is a multi-copper ferroxidase essential for iron homeostasis which facilitates cellular iron efflux.	14129	14232
20801540	Lack of functional CP is typically associated with iron overload in the liver, pancreas, and the basal ganglia as illustrated in the reported cases.	14233	14381
20801540	Retinal degeneration has a penetrance ranging from 75% to 93% in patients with ACP and retinal pigment epithelium changes were present in patients IV.4 and IV.5.	14382	14543
20801540	It is unclear if the incomplete penetrance of neurological symptoms and diabetes in our patients is a result of disease modifiers or reflects the natural course of ACP.	14544	14712
20801540	Both clinically affected siblings are diabetic since their twenties, whereas the youngest genetically affected sibling is asymptomatic and not diabetic at the age of 37, which suggests the presence of modifiers that affect disease expression.	14713	14955
20801540	In agreement with previous reports of ACP, none of the genetically affected individuals had evidence of impaired biochemical liver function or advanced fibrosis despite the significant hepatocellular iron overload that exceeded the thresholds for hepatic fibrosis established in hemochromatosis cohorts.	14956	15259
20801540	This observation suggests that iron is only a cofactor in hepatic fibrogenesis.	15260	15339
20801540	Liver histology showed the presence of iron in hepatocytes, whereas no iron was found in macrophages.	15340	15441
20801540	Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging also showed the absence of iron overload in the spleen, suggesting that iron overload in Kupffer cell is a late event in ACP.	15442	15604
20801540	This observation suggests that CP is important for hepatocellular iron efflux, whereas CP-independent mechanisms for iron export from macrophages exist.	15605	15757
20801540	If CP was indispensable for iron export from recycling macrophages, one would expect more pronounced anemia and even higher sTfR concentrations.	15758	15902
20801540	In our ACP patients, stainable iron was restricted to hepatocytes, in comparison to patients with advanced hemochromatosis or transfusional iron overload where the iron storage typically affects parenchymal cells and macrophages.	15903	16132
20801540	The decline of serum ferritin on deferasirox treatment in ACP patients was faster than in patients with ß-thalassemia, which suggests that iron-loaded hepatocytes are the main source of serum ferritin and hepatocellular iron is more accessible to deferasirox than macrophageal iron.	16133	16415
20801540	The prompt increase in serum ferritin after cessation of deferasirox treatment may indicate a redistribution of iron, since the re-accumulation of food iron in such a short time appears unlikely.	16416	16611
20801540	Hepatocellular iron overload induces expression of the peptide hormone hepcidin in normal individuals, which causes ferroportin degradation.	16612	16752
20801540	This results in cellular iron retention and reduced iron absorption.	16753	16821
20801540	The observation that hepatic hepcidin mRNA expression in ACP patients and in dysmetabolic siderosis patients are comparable, but low in HFE hereditary hemochromatosis, suggests that CP but not HFE is dispensable for iron-mediated hepcidin regulation.	16822	17072
20801540	We found higher hepcidin mRNA expression in ACP than in viral hepatitis patients where hepcidin expression is suppressed, which also suggests that hepcidin responds normally to iron in ACP.	17073	17262
20801540	Normal hepcidin regulation in ACP supports the concept that regional iron accumulation in affected organs results from disturbed cellular iron metabolism rather than from alterations in total body iron homeostasis.	17263	17477
20801540	The functional consequence of the splice-site mutation c.2554+1G>T is the skipping of exon 14, which preserves the open reading frame.	17478	17612
20801540	The structural model suggests that the abnormal protein folds into a potentially functional protein, but such a significant structural change within domain 5 of CP is likely to affect the stability of the variant protein, resulting in intracellular retention.	17613	17872
20801540	The phenotypic similarity with CP nonsense mutations further suggests that this variant is dysfunctional.	17873	17978
20801540	Skipping of exon 14 is also predicted to affect the alternative transcript in the brain, where activation of a cryptic splice-site results in direct splicing of exons 18–20.	17979	18152
20801540	Iron accumulation in the basal ganglia of c.2554+1G>T homozygotes suggests the absence of functional GPI-anchored CP and supports the importance of correct protein folding for the activity and stability of GPI-anchored CP.	18153	18375
20801540	Ferroxidase activity is required to stabilize the iron export pump ferroportin in cells expressing GPI-anchored CP, which provides a molecular explanation for cellular iron retention in ACP.	18376	18566
20801540	Iron-mediated lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are the main causes of neurodegeneration secondary to brain iron accumulation.	18567	18699
20801540	To reduce iron toxicity chelation therapy was introduced in ACP.	18700	18764
20801540	The iron chelator deferoxamine was effective in reducing hepatic iron overload and leading to a partial improvement of neurological symptoms and brain iron accumulation, as reported in a single case report.	18765	18971
20801540	The positive effect of deferoxamine on central nervous symptoms and signs was not found in subsequent studies, which highlights the low permeability of the blood–brain barrier for deferoxamine.	18972	19165
20801540	Despite the lower molecular weight and more lipophilic properties of deferiprone, this orally bioavailable iron chelator had no beneficial effect in ACP in a previous report.	19166	19340
20801540	In agreement, we found no improvement of neurological symptoms or brain iron accumulation during deferasirox treatment over a period of several months.	19341	19492
20801540	Deferasirox could still be an effective brain iron chelator, whose clinical benefit might be missed after a short term treatment.	19493	19622
20801540	By comparison, the neurological improvement on zinc-sulphate was found after 15 months of treatment in a patient with ACP.	19623	19745
20801540	In contrast, hepatic iron concentration and insulin requirements improved in both patients who were treated for 3 and 5 months, respectively.	19746	19887
20801540	Taken together, short term deferasirox is effective in reducing hepatic iron overload, but ineffective for the treatment of brain iron accumulation.	19888	20036
20801540	In all patients, side effects prohibited the long term therapy that may be required to mobilize iron from the brain.	20037	20153
20801540	Given the high efficacy of a high dose of deferasirox, a low dose of the iron chelator may have a more favourable side effect profile, which in turn may allow for a long term and combination therapy.	20154	20353
20801540	Recent studies in an animal model of Friedreich’s ataxia suggest that the combined use of pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone and deferoxamine is an effective treatment of iron accumulation in glial cells.	20354	20557
20801540	Further work is required to determine if similar strategies can be developed for patients with ACP and other neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with brain iron accumulation.	20558	20743

24623966	Angiogenesis, a process of new blood vessel formation, plays important roles in development but also in pathologic conditions, including in cancer, diabetes mellitus, and ocular diseases.	0	187
24623966	Endothelial cell (EC)–generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) can function as signaling molecules to promote EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation in angiogenesis.	188	361
24623966	NADPH oxidase, originally recognized for the superoxide burst generated by leukocytes to fight infection, is a source of ROS generation in ECs that can affect angiogenesis.	362	534
24623966	Isoforms of NADPH oxidase, NOX 1–5 and Duox1 and -2, are differentially expressed in tissues and cells, and several papers support NADPH oxidase isoforms as having different roles in physiologic and pathological responses.	535	757
24623966	NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 are expressed in ECs and have been associated with pathology in retinal diseases.	758	860
24623966	Models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) are useful for studying mechanisms of developmental and pathologic angiogenesis caused by different oxygen stresses.	861	1020
24623966	In these models, newborn animals that normally vascularize their retinas postnatally are exposed to oxygen stresses that cause intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in which blood vessels grow outside the plane of the retina into the vitreous.	1021	1265
24623966	Several pathways involved in angiogenesis have been identified, including those activated by hypoxia and stabilization of hypoxia inducible factors, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor signaling; and inflammatory pathways, such as cyclooxygenase signaling and angiotensin II type I receptor signaling.	1266	1642
24623966	We and others found NADPH oxidase important in models of OIR.	1643	1704
24623966	In rat and mouse OIR models, NOX2 colocalized with retinal ECs and macrophages and regulated IVNV partly through apoptotic and inflammatory mechanisms.	1705	1856
24623966	Investigators also reported that activation of NOX1 in microglia or other cells contributed to ischemia-induced vascular pathologies and ganglion cell death.	1857	2014
24623966	The effects of NOX4 in vascular diseases are conflicting as having either protective or pathologic effects in ischemic vascular diseases.	2015	2152
24623966	In one study involving inducible Nox4−/− mice, silencing of NOX4 led to aortic inflammation.	2153	2245
24623966	However, in a diabetic mouse model, NOX4 activation upregulated VEGF and reduced the integrity of the endothelial blood–retinal barrier.	2246	2382
24623966	In this study, we sought to study the role of endothelial NOX4 in VEGF-induced IVNV.	2383	2467
24623966	We used the rat 50/10 OIR model, which recreates many of the features of human retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).	2468	2633
24623966	We addressed the hypothesis that VEGF-activated NOX4 in ECs contributes to pathologic angiogenesis through VEGF/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling.	2634	2781
24623966	All animal studies were performed in compliance with the University of Utah (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.	2782	3037
24623966	The rat 50/10 OIR model has been previously described.	3038	3092
24623966	Entire litters of newborn Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) and dams were placed in an oxygen environment that cycled oxygen concentration between 50% and 10% every 24 h for 14 days and then placed in room air.	3093	3325
24623966	Pup number was maintained at 12 to 14 pups/litter.	3326	3376
24623966	Pups were euthanized with intraperitoneal injections (IP) of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (18 mg/kg) followed by IP pentobarbital (80 mg/kg).	3377	3522
24623966	Eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 10 mmol/l sodium orthovanadate for 10 min.	3523	3621
24623966	Retinas were removed and placed into 4% PFA for 15 min followed by incubation in 30% sucrose/PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, Ph 7.4) overnight.	3622	3790
24623966	Each retina was immersed in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Tissue-Tek; EMS, Hatfield, PA).	3791	3893
24623966	Eyes were cut into 12 µm cryosections and were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody anti-NOX4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).	3894	4044
24623966	All sections were washed and then incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of Alexa 594-conjugated antibody for isolectin B4 and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for NOX4.	4045	4261
24623966	Sections stained with only secondary antibodies were controls.	4262	4324
24623966	Sections were rinsed in PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL).	4325	4417
24623966	Integrated density per image area of NOX4 fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ.	4418	4501
24623966	Human primary retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMVECs; Cell Systems, Kirkland, WA) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; Lonza, Hopkinton, MA) were maintained in basal endothelial growth medium (EGM2-MV, Lonza), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS).	4502	4783
24623966	Human choroidal endothelial cells (CECs) were isolated from donor eyes (Utah Eye Bank, Salt Lake City, UT) as described previously.	4784	4915
24623966	Briefly, the choroidal tissue was separated from the sclera, minced into small pieces.	4916	5002
24623966	After three washes with cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 0.5 mg ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin, the minced choroid was digested in a mixture containing 500 μg ml−1 collagenase 1A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1.2 U ml−1 Dispase II (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 °C in a rotating shaker.	5003	5306
24623966	The choroidal digests were double filtered through 70 and 44 μm meshes.	5307	5378
24623966	Enzymes were neutralized by adding two times the volume of DMEM with 10% FBS.	5379	5456
24623966	The cell suspension was incubated with CD31-coated DynaBeads (Dynal Biotech, Inc., NY) beads for 15–30 min at room temperature (RT) with gentle rotation to isolate human choroidal ECs and minimize RPE and fibroblast contamination.	5457	5687
24623966	The bead–EC complexes were then washed five times in HBSS with 5% FBS, mixed by gentle agitation for 1 min, and separated from the mixture with the Dynal Magnetic Particle Concentrator (MPC).	5688	5879
24623966	The bead–choroidal EC complexes were resuspended in 150 μl EGM-2 with 10% FBS and 0.5 mg ml l−1 penicillin–streptomycin and plated onto a 1 cm2 area and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.	5880	6073
24623966	Choroidal ECs were confirmed as ECs and not fibroblasts by 100% immunostaining with von Willebrand Factor (Sigma), CD31 (Serotec, NC), and VE-cadherin (R&D Systems, MN).	6074	6243
24623966	Choroidal ECs were maintained in basal endothelial growth medium (EGM-2, Lonza) with 5% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and Passages 2–5 were used in the experiments.	6244	6401
24623966	For treatment, cells were first starved in serum-free basal endothelial medium (EBM2; Lonza) overnight, pretreated with VEGFR2 tryosine-kinase inhibitor semaxanib (SU5416; 5 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 30 min, and then incubated with VEGF (20 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 1 h. Cells were harvested for western blots and immunoprecipitation.	6402	6778
24623966	Total RNA was extracted with the Tri Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).	6779	6855
24623966	cDNA was generated with the use of a High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).	6856	6962
24623966	Quantitative Real Time-PCR was performed on a Mastercycler ep Realplex (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) with SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).	6963	7125
24623966	Quantitative real-time PCR conditions were Step 1 (50 °C for 2 min), Step 2 (95 °C for 10 min) and Step 3 (40 cycles of [95 °C for 15 s to 60 °C for 1 min]).	7126	7283
24623966	Expression levels for NOX isoforms were normalized to the mean value of internal control GAPDH.	7284	7379
24623966	For siRNA transfection, hRMVECs at 70%–80% confluence in six-well plates were transfected with siRNAs targeting human NOX4 or STAT3 (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).	7380	7589
24623966	A silencer selective negative control siRNA was used as control.	7590	7654
24623966	Retina and hRMVECs were lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and orthovanadate (2 mmol/l; Sigma Aldrich), and then homogenized and centrifuged at 15,700 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C.	7655	7919
24623966	Protein concentration in the supernatant fluid was quantified with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL); 30 µg total protein for each sample was used for western blots.	7920	8113
24623966	Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: p-VEGFR2, total VEGFR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NOX4, p-STAT3 (Y705), and total STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).	8114	8326
24623966	For the interaction of NOX4 and VEGFR2, coimmunoprecipitation was performed in 500 µl cell lysate containing 500 µg protein using anti-NOX4 antibody to pull down NOX4; the amount of VEGFR2 interacted with NOX4 was determined with western blots using anti-VEGFR2 antibody.	8327	8598
24623966	Blots were visualized, and the relative densities of bands were calculated using UN-SCAN-IT Gel 6.1. hRMVECs were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected with siRNA.	8599	8767
24623966	Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were loaded with 5 µm 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CMDCF-DA; Invitrogen) in serum- and growth factor-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C.	8768	8996
24623966	After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) or control PBS for 30 min.	8997	9092
24623966	ROS generation was measured in a fluorescent plate reader (excitation-488 nm and emission-520 nm).	9093	9191
24623966	Cells incubated with 10 µM H2O2 were used as a positive control.	9192	9256
24623966	For the proliferation assay, 24 h post-transfection, cells were starved in serum- and growth factor-free medium for 24 h and then incubated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for another 24 h. Cell number was measured with Vybrant 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assay kit (Invitrogen).	9257	9583
24623966	Significant differences between treatment groups were determined with ANOVA with the Newman–Keuls multiple comparison post-hoc test.	9584	9716
24623966	A minimum value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.	9717	9784
24623966	For in vivo studies, three different litters were used for each experiment to account for potential effects within individual litters.	9785	9919
24623966	Four to five retinas from different individual pups were analyzed for time points.	9920	10002
24623966	For in vitro studies, at least three conditions were used in each experiment and experiments were repeated two additional times.	10003	10131
24623966	For real-time PCR, six individual samples were used for NOX isoforms mRNA analysis.	10132	10215
24623966	Results are means ± standard deviation (SD).	10216	10260
24623966	To determine the roles of endothelial NADPH oxidase isoforms in angiogenesis, we first detected expression profiles of NOX isoforms in several types of cultured vascular ECs (hRMVECs, CECs, HUVECs) using real-time PCR.	10261	10479
24623966	In support of our hypothesis and the literature, NOX4 was the most prevalent isoform in all ECs tested, and NOX2 was also expressed in CECs (Figure 1).	10480	10631
24623966	We then measured NOX4 expression in retinal lysates from pups raised in RA at postnatal day 0 (P0), P14, and P18 and found that NOX4 expression was reduced during development (Figure 2A).	10632	10819
24623966	In comparison to RA-raised rat pups, NOX4 protein was significantly increased in the OIR model at P18 (Figure 2C), but not at P14 (Figure 2B).	10820	10962
24623966	We then determined NOX4 localization in retinal cryosections from rat pups in OIR or RA at P18 (Figure 2D).	10963	11070
24623966	Compared to the RA-raised rat pups, semiquantitative assessment of NOX4 density was greater in lectin-stained ECs in the P18 OIR model than the P18 RA (Figure 2E).	11071	11234
24623966	Thus, NOX4 expression in retinal ECs was increased in the rat OIR model at the time point when IVNV occurred, whereas NOX4 was less prevalent during retinal vascular development.	11235	11413
24623966	We previously found that VEGF-activated STAT3 caused retinal endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and that NADPH oxidase mediated IVNV through activated STAT3 in a rat OIR+supplemental oxygen model in which pups were placed in 28% supplemental oxygen from P14 to P18, rather than 21% oxygen as in the rat OIR model used in the study.	11414	11750
24623966	We also previously reported that, compared to RA-raised pups, retinal VEGF expression increased at several time points including P18 in the rat OIR model.	11751	11905
24623966	Therefore, to determine if increased EC NOX4 was associated with activation of retinal STAT3 at P18 when VEGF is also increased in the rat OIR model, we measured phosphorylated STAT3 and total STAT3 in retinal lysates from the P18 OIR model and RA pups (Figure 3A).	11906	12171
24623966	STAT3 activation, determined as a ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 to total STAT3, was significantly increased at P18 in the OIR model compared to the RA pups (Figure 3B).	12172	12340
24623966	This suggested that increased NOX4 was associated with activation of STAT3 and VEGF signaling at the time point when IVNV occurred.	12341	12472
24623966	Increasing evidence indicates that NADPH oxidase participates in retinal angiogenesis through ROS generation.	12473	12582
24623966	We previously reported that VEGF activated NADPH oxidase in CECs and contributed to choroidal neovascularization in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model.	12583	12756
24623966	To understand the relationship between NOX4 and VEGF, we determined whether NOX4 was involved in VEGF-induced ROS generation in hRMVECs.	12757	12893
24623966	In hRMVECs, knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection (Figure 4A) inhibited basal and VEGF-induced ROS generation (Figure 4B).	12894	13018
24623966	This suggests that VEGF activates NOX4 and leads to ROS generation.	13019	13086
24623966	Activated VEGF/ VEGFR2 signaling can cause IVNV in rat and mouse models of OIR.	13087	13166
24623966	We determined if endothelial NOX4 was involved in VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling.	13167	13239
24623966	We first measured VEGF-induced VEGFR2 and STAT3 phosphorylation in cultured hRMVECs that were transfected with NOX4 siRNA compared to control (Figure 5A).	13240	13394
24623966	NOX4 silencing had no effect on basal levels of phosphorylated VEGFR2 (p-VEGFR2; Figure 5A) or STAT3 (p-STAT3; Figure 5B), but partly reduced p-VEGFR2 (Figure 5A) and completely inhibited VEGF-induced p-STAT3 (Figure 5B), providing support that STAT3 was a downstream effector of activated NOX4 and that NOX4 involved VEGFR2 signaling.	13395	13730
24623966	To determine the mechanism in which VEGF/VEGFR2 and NOX4 were involved in downstream STAT3 activation, hRMVECs were pretreated with the VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, SU5416, or vehicle, and then stimulated with VEGF.	13731	13951
24623966	In response to VEGF stimulation, coimmunoprecipitation of NOX4 with VEGFR2 was increased (Figure 5C).	13952	14053
24623966	However, inhibition of VEGFR2 activation by SU5416 inhibited coimmunoprecipitation of NOX4 and VEGFR2 and SU5416 treatment effectively blocked VEGF-induced p-VEGFR2 in the same cell lysates (Figure 5C).	14054	14256
24623966	Altogether, these results suggest that a structural relationship between NOX4 and p-VEGFR2 existed following VEGF-induced activation of VEGFR2 and that together the interaction over-activated STAT3.	14257	14455
24623966	To assess the effect of NOX4 and STAT3 on EC proliferation, hRMVECs transfected with siRNAs to NOX4 or STAT3 or control siRNAs were treated with VEGF or PBS for 24 h. Compared to control, NOX4 siRNA (Figure 6A) and STAT3 siRNA (Figure 6B) significantly inhibited VEGF-induced hRMVEC proliferation.	14456	14753
24623966	These and the previous data provide evidence that VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling mediated NOX4 enhanced EC proliferation through activation of STAT3.	14754	14894
24623966	VEGF plays important roles in physiologic angiogenesis in development and in the adult as well as in pathologic angiogenesis in cancer and eye diseases.	14895	15047
24623966	Inhibition of the bioactivity of VEGF has been used in several retinal and choroidal diseases to reduce pathologic angiogenesis, including several leading causes of blindness worldwide, neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity.	15048	15339
24623966	However, in AMD, repeated anti-VEGF injections are usually required, and reports of retinal and choroidal atrophy raise concerns regarding long-term vision loss.	15340	15501
24623966	In addition, a single dose of intravitreal anti-VEGF can reduce circulating VEGF levels, raising questions about reducing beneficial effects of VEGF as a neuroprotective agent in development or after brain ischemia or stroke.	15502	15727
24623966	We previously found excessive signaling through VEGFR2-triggered signaling pathways that caused IVNV.	15728	15829
24623966	To preserve beneficial aspects of VEGF signaling and inhibit IVNV, we sought to identify effectors that regulate VEGFR2 activation and downstream angiogenic signaling pathways as a means of supporting physiologic angiogenesis while inhibiting IVNV.	15830	16078
24623966	NADPH oxidase isoforms NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 have been implicated in pathologic angiogenesis of the retina and choroid in different models.	16079	16217
24623966	We previously found that activation of NADPH oxidase delayed physiologic retinal vascular development in the rat OIR model but caused IVNV mediated through STAT3 in the rat OIR model rescued in 28% supplemental oxygen.	16218	16436
24623966	We and others also found that VEGF expression increased at several time points in the rat OIR model, including at P18 in association with IVNV.	16437	16580
24623966	In this study, we focused on the potential role of NOX4 in retinal ECs in VEGF-induced IVNV.	16581	16673
24623966	At P18 in the OIR model compared to RA pups, STAT3 activation was also increased in retinal lysates, in association with greater expression of retinal NOX4 and the development of IVNV.	16674	16858
24623966	To study the role of NOX4 and VEGFR2 signaling in retinal ECs, a series of experiments were performed in cultured hRMVECs.	16859	16981
24623966	Knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection inhibited basal and VEGF-induced ROS generation.	16982	17070
24623966	In addition, knockdown of NOX4 partially reduced VEGF-induced VEGFR2 activation and abolished VEGF-induced STAT3 activation, suggesting the expression level of NOX4 and its activation to generate ROS were important for the interaction of NOX4/p-VEGFR2 and in maintaining activation of downstream signaling effectors of VEGFR2.	17071	17397
24623966	The results from in vitro studies support a structural interaction between NOX4 and VEGFR2, perhaps through an adaptor protein, that relies on activation of VEGFR2, and that triggered STAT3 activation to cause hRMVEC proliferation.	17398	17629
24623966	In summary, our study provides new evidence that VEGF-induced VEGFR2 can exacerbate downstream STAT3 activation through an interaction with NOX4 and may contribute to IVNV in the rat OIR model.	17630	17823
24623966	Future studies to understand the interaction between NOX4 and p-VEGFR2 are important, because inhibiting NOX4 or its generated ROS may be a method to regulate VEGFR2 singaling and safely reduce VEGFR2-mediated IVNV.	17824	18039
21976953	Marfan syndrome (MFS, OMIM 154700) is a relatively common autosomal dominant hereditary disorder of the connective tissue, with prominent manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems.	0	205
21976953	It is clinically diagnosed according to the Ghent criteria.	206	265
21976953	MFS is mainly caused by mutations in the human fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene.	266	337
21976953	FBN1 contains 65 exons encoding a secreted 350 kDa glycoprotein, which is highly conserved among different species.	338	453
21976953	Fibrillin-1 is characterized by a specific module organization in the extracellular matrix and is mainly composed of three types of repeated modules: 47 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules (43 calcium binding [or cb] EGF-like modules and 4 non-cb EGF-like modules), 7 transforming growth factor-binding (or TB) protein-like modules (8 Cys/TB), and 2 hybrid modules.	454	826
21976953	To date, more than 60% of the reported mutations of FBN1 are missense mutations, and the majority of these are located in the cb EGF modules (in particular, cysteine residues, implicated in disulfide bond formation, or other residues implicated in calcium-binding and/or intra-/intermolecular interactions).	827	1134
21976953	There is limited evidence of genotype-phenotype correlations of this disorder, while mutations associated with neonatal MFS and other severe forms have been shown to cluster in exons 24–32.	1135	1324
21976953	Molecular analysis of FBN1 is necessary because such analysis can detect at-risk individuals at an early stage and offer the possibility of prenatal diagnosis.	1325	1484
21976953	We came across a four-generation family affected with MFS in Northeast China and detected a novel heterozygous mutation in FBN1.	1485	1613
21976953	The mutation was found in the affected individuals but was not observed in any of the healthy family members.	1614	1723
21976953	The proband, a 32-year-old female, was diagnosed with MFS according to the Ghent criteria.	1724	1814
21976953	The family history revealed four affected members over four generations, two of whom were deceased.	1815	1914
21976953	Available individuals II:2, II:6, II:7, III:4, III:12, and IV:4 were given complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations after obtaining informed consent (Figure 1).	1915	2097
21976953	One hundred Chinese controls without diagnostic features of MFS were also recruited.	2098	2182
21976953	The study was approved by the Harbin Medical University Ethics Committee (Harbin, China).	2183	2272
21976953	Whole blood from six members of the family (II:2, II:6, II:7, III:4, III:12, and IV:4) and 170 unrelated Chinese controls were collected in tubes containing EDTA as an anticoagulant.	2273	2455
21976953	Genomic DNA was extracted using a TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (Tiangen Biltech Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.	2456	2595
21976953	All 65 coding exons and flanking intronic regions, including splice sites of FBN1, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a set of primers listed in Appendix 1.	2596	2773
21976953	PCR was performed for 35 cycles, with a denaturing phase of 30 s at 94 °C, annealing phase of 30 s at 58–62 °C, and an extension of 1 min at 72 °C.	2774	2921
21976953	The PCR products were subsequently purified with a TIANgel Midi Purification Kit (Tiangen Biltech Co. Ltd) and sequenced with an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).	2922	3117
21976953	Sequencing results were assembled and analyzed using Chromas 2.22 software (Technelysium Pty.	3118	3211
21976953	Ltd., QLD, Australia) with reference sequence in the Universal Mutation Database (UMD).	3212	3299
21976953	A schematic of the cb EGF-like domain of human fibrillin-1 was used to assess the possible impact of the mutation at the secondary structure level.	3300	3447
21976953	A homology 3D model of the cb EGF-like#15 domain was created based on the Protein data bank (PDB) template 1LMJ (45% sequence identity).	3448	3584
21976953	DeepView v4.0.1 was used to display the structure file and to predict the potential consequence of the mutation.	3585	3697
21976953	Two members (II:2 and III:12) of the family showed classic MFS (Appendix 2), and the unaffected family members, including a spouse (II:6), appeared normal.	3698	3853
21976953	The daughter of the proband (IV:4), who was 2 years old, was too young for a clinical diagnosis to be made because several manifestations of MFS are age-dependent and may not yet be present in childhood.	3854	4057
21976953	The proband had bilateral lens dislocation (Figure 2A,B), high myopia, and strabismus of both eyes.	4058	4157
21976953	Echocardiography revealed cardiovascular manifestation of dilatation of the aortic root and mild mitral valve prolapse in the proband.	4158	4292
21976953	Skeletal system abnormalities such as tall stature, long limbs, joint hypermobility, long narrow head, and arachnodactyly (Figure 2C), were also present in the proband.	4293	4461
21976953	Individual II:2 showed similar clinical symptoms as the proband, with the exception of abnormalities of the cardiovascular system.	4462	4592
21976953	Lentectomy and intraocular lens implantation were performed on individual II:2 in 2010.	4593	4680
21976953	Family member II:5 had died of heart disease at the age of 53 and III:2 had died of hepatic cancer at the age of 39, and according to the proband’s description, both of them appeared with tall stature, long limbs, and poor vision.	4681	4911
21976953	Direct sequencing of FBN1 revealed a novel heterozygous mutation, c.3703T>C in exon 29, which resulted in the substitution of serine by proline (p.S1235P; Figure 3A).	4912	5078
21976953	The mutation identified in the proband was also found in patient II:2 and the available affected member IV:4 (Figure 3B,C).	5079	5202
21976953	No mutation was detected in the healthy family members (Figure 3D-F) or in any of the 170 unrelated control subjects (Figure 3G).	5203	5332
21976953	The missense mutation c.3703T>C resulted in the substitution of serine at codon 1235, which is located in the neonatal region of fibrillin-1 (Figure 4A), and is highly conserved among mammalian species (Figure 3H).	5333	5547
21976953	Secondary structure analysis of the cb EGF-like domain revealed that the mutant proline1235 could neither interfere with calcium binding in the NH2-terminal region of the domain nor influence disulfide bond formation (Figure 4B).	5548	5777
21976953	Prediction by DeepView v4.0.1 suggested that the mutant residue could probably induce steric clash with its surroundings.	5778	5899
21976953	Therefore, the conformation of the cb EGF-like domain was likely to be altered by the presence of this mutation (Figure 4C,D).	5900	6026
21976953	In this study, we identified a novel heterozygous FBN1 mutation (p.S1235P) in a four-generation family affected with MFS.	6027	6148
21976953	This missense mutation is located in the cb EGF-like#15 domain.	6149	6212
21976953	It is clear that EGF-like domains play a major role in the pathogenesis of fibrillinopathies, as most of the mutations in these domains are associated with classic MFS.	6213	6381
21976953	Each cb EGF-like domain of fibrillin-1 contains six highly conserved cysteine residues that form three intra-domain disulphide bonds (C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6) and a consensus sequence for calcium binding in the NH2-terminal region.	6382	6609
21976953	The mutant residue found in our study, located at the 39th residue of the cb EGF-like#15 domain, did not affect disulphide bond formation or calcium binding of the domain at the secondary structure level.	6610	6814
21976953	3D structure analysis by DeepView v4.0.1 showed that the substitution of serine by proline could probably induce steric clash with its surroundings, which probably resulted in a conformation change and had a predictable detrimental effect on its function.	6815	7070
21976953	It is evident that the structural effects of different FBN1 missense mutations are complex.	7071	7162
21976953	Mutations in cb EGF motifs not affecting cysteines or residues of the calcium binding consensus sequence are extremely rare and have been postulated to affect intramolecular packing or intermolecular interactions, and subsequently affect microfiber assembly.	7163	7421
21976953	Previously, only 6 mutations were published in the UMD website in the cb EGF-like#15 domain, and none of those mutations affected the residues between C-5 and C-6.	7422	7585
21976953	The present study not only suggested that residues between C-5 and C-6 of cb EGF-like domains play an important role in maintaining the function of the FBN1 protein, but also added a new case to the notion that cb EGF-like#14–18 domains (in exons 28–32) are functionally more essential in fibrillin-1 of classic MFS than that of neonatal MFS.	7586	7928
21976953	This rare mutation found in our study is located in the hot spot region for neonatal MFS and could also cause classic MFS.	7929	8051
21976953	There is general consensus that neither the location of the affected module in the protein nor the position of the mutant residue is, by itself, sufficient to predict potential genotype-phenotype correlations.	8052	8261
21976953	This missense mutation was also found in the proband’s daughter, who was 2 years old and did not yet fulfill the diagnostic criteria.	8262	8395
21976953	As such, in situations of clinical uncertainty, molecular analysis of FBN1 seems a logical aid in the clinical diagnosis of MFS.	8396	8524
21976953	Moreover, the most important complication of MFS is a progressive dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, leading to aortic valve incompetence and aortic dissection.	8525	8701
21976953	As a result, early recognition of at-risk individuals not (yet) fulfilling the diagnostic criteria by molecular diagnosis is important in view of the available treatments that can significantly improve life expectancy and also offer the possibility of prenatal diagnosis.	8702	8973
21976953	Although the four-generation MFS family we studied was large, the number of patients was relatively small.	8974	9080
21976953	For genetic studies, it is better to examine pedigrees with more affected individuals, because (1) to find the mutant gene and exclude genetic heterogeneity, linkage analysis for candidate gene screening should be initially done, and in this condition, numbers of affected individuals should be large enough; and (2) more patients can help investigators to better interpret the rule of inheritance of the disease and display the genotype-phenotype correlations.	9081	9542
21976953	Collectively, evidences from our study and published data supported that this novel p.S1235P mutation is the causative mutation for MFS in this four-generation family.	9543	9710
21976953	Mutations in cb EGF-like domains of FBN1 play a critical role in the pathogenesis of classic MFS, and molecular diagnosis of MFS is becoming more and more important.	9711	9876
21976953	Although more than 600 FBN1 mutations have been published in the UMD website for MFS, information on genotype–phenotype correlations is still limited, especially in the Chinese population.	9877	10065
21976953	Our data adds a novel mutation to the spectrum of FBN1 gene mutations, analyzes the potential functional consequence of the mutation, and enriches the existing knowledge of genotype–phenotype correlations of Marfan syndrome.	10066	10290
19365571	Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD; OMIM 217800) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by bilateral progressive stromal clouding and central corneal thinning.	0	175
19365571	The onset usually occurs in the first decade of life, starting with a fine superficial stromal haze in the central stroma.	176	298
19365571	Gradually, the opacification extends to the periphery and usually involves the entire cornea, leading to visual impairment.	299	422
19365571	At this time, penetrating keratoplasty is necessary.	423	475
19365571	Although clinically indistinguishable, MCD has been subdivided into three immunophenotypes I, IA, and II, based on the serum level of sulfated keratan sulfate (KS) measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunohistochemical evaluation of the corneal tissue.	476	754
19365571	The serum level of KS and the immunohistochemical reaction to the cornea is negative in the patients with MCD type I.	755	872
19365571	The serum level of KS is negative, and the immunohistochemical reaction to the cornea is positive in the patients with type IA whereas both are positive in those patients with type II.	873	1057
19365571	MCD is histologically characterized by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the stromal lamellae, underneath the epithelium, and within the keratocytes and endothelial cells.	1058	1237
19365571	An abnormality in the metabolism of KS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MCD.	1238	1324
19365571	A gene responsible for MCD types I and II has been linked to chromosome 16q22.	1325	1403
19365571	Recently, mutations in a new carbohydrate sulfotransferase gene (CHST6) encoding corneal glucosamine N-acety-6-sulfotransferase (C-GlcNac-6-ST) have been identified.	1404	1569
19365571	Lack of activity of this enzyme is thought to result in the production of unsulfated KS and the loss of transparency in the corneas of affected patients.	1570	1723
19365571	Akama and others have described missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and insertions within the coding region in CHST6 in patients with type I macular corneal dystrophy (differentiation between types I and IA was not performed) whereas MCD type II is associated with deletions and rearrangements in the upstream region of CHST6 as well as missense mutations.	1724	2084
19365571	Despite the variety of mutations reported in both type I and type II patients, all of the identified sequence changes are associated with a similar clinical appearance.	2085	2253
19365571	In this study, we identified novel compound heterozygous mutations within CHST6 in a Chinese family with MCD and investigated the histopathological changes of the opaque cornea.	2254	2431
19365571	The family was ascertained by the Department of Ophthalmology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University (Harbin, China).	2432	2573
19365571	Informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Heilongjiang Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from all participants.	2574	2730
19365571	The pedigree was a four-generation family with three affected members, six unaffected family individuals, and two spouses (Figure 1).	2731	2864
19365571	Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of their peripheral blood by standard procedures.	2865	2956
19365571	Clinical diagnosis of MCD for these patients was based on pedigree structure and clinical features, which include bilateral symmetric stromal cloudiness studded by small, irregular, rounded, gray-white anterior stromal patches.	2957	3184
19365571	One hundred normal Chinese samples were collected as the control.	3185	3250
19365571	A half section of the corneal button obtained from the proband by penetrating keratoplasty was fixed in 4% formaldehyde then made into paraffin-embedded samples stained with Hale’s Colloidal iron (Maxim IHC World, Fuzhou, China).	3251	3480
19365571	After being fixed in 2.5% buffer glutaraldehyde, the other half section was washed with PBS, fixed in 4% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in the alcohol, and embedded by routine epoxy resin from which ultrathin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.	3481	3755
19365571	The sections were examined with light microscope (LM) and electron microscope (EM).	3756	3839
19365571	The unique exon involving the coding region, exon 3, was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers described previously.	3840	3983
19365571	The cycling program started with an initial denaturing step of 5 min at 95 °C followed by 33 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 53–57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s with a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min.	3984	4189
19365571	PCR products were purified and directly sequenced on both strands by using an automatic DNA sequencer (ABIPrism 377XL; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).The nucleotide sequences were compared with the published cDNA sequence of CHST6 (NM_021615).	4190	4439
19365571	Two enzymes, PvuII with recognition site 5′…CAGˇCTG…3′ and PmacI with recognition site 5′… CACˇGTG… 3′, were used for all family individuals to confirm the two heterozygous mutations identified by sequencing c. 892C>T and c.1072T>C, respectively.	4440	4686
19365571	To exclude the possibility that the mutations were polymorphisms, the PCR products from 100 control subjects were also analyzed by those restriction enzymes.	4687	4844
19365571	After digestion with PvuII and PmacI, the PCR products were electrophoresed by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by staining with 0.2% AgNO3.	4845	5003
19365571	Slit lamp examination of the affected individuals showed that stromal cloudiness were studded by irregular rounded gray-white opacities in both the central and peripheral cornea (Figure 2).	5004	5193
19365571	The corneal opacities were deep into corneal stroma anterior, the endothelial layer, and Descemet’s membrane.	5194	5303
19365571	From light microscopic study, plaque deposits were diffusely found in the corneal stroma and even near the endothelium.	5304	5423
19365571	They presented significant positive reaction to Hale’s colloidal iron stain, which was indicated by extracellular blue accumulations in the stroma.	5424	5571
19365571	(Figure 3).	5572	5583
19365571	Under transmission electron microscopy, it was displayed that the collagen fibers in the corneal stroma were irregular, enlarged, and intensive and the fibroblasts were active and hyperplastic.	5584	5777
19365571	The enlargement of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and intracytoplasmic vacuoles appeared within those cells (Figure 4).	5778	5899
19365571	CHST6 is 16.9 kb in length and consists of four exons of which only exon 3 contains the coding region.	5900	6002
19365571	Two mutations, c. 892C>T and c. 1072T>C, were identified on each allele of exon 3.	6003	6085
19365571	The first heterozygous change from the maternal allele, a c. 892C>T transition, occurred at the first nucleotide position of codon 298, predicting a change of amino acid glutamine to a stop codon (p.Q298X).	6086	6292
19365571	The other change on the paternal allele, a c. 1072T>C transition, was identified at the second nucleotide position of codon 358, changing the amino acid from tyrosine to histidine (p.Y358H; Figure 5).	6293	6493
19365571	Each patient (III:2, III:4, and III:6) in this family was found to have these two mutations within CHST6.	6494	6599
19365571	The unaffected individuals II-2, III:1, and IV-1 were heterozygous with the nonsense change, c. 892C>T, while the other unaffected individuals II-3, III-5, and IV-2 were heterozygous with the missense change, c. 1072T>C.	6600	6820
19365571	PCR products from individuals with c.892C>T transition were digested into 153 bp and 173 bp by restriction enzyme, PvuII, whereas ones without c.892C>T transition only had a 153 bp segment.	6821	7010
19365571	Sequence with c.1072T>C transition could be divided into 337 bp and 357 bp by PmacI, but those without c.1072T>C transition only had a 357 bp segment.	7011	7161
19365571	In addition, the results showed that the two heterozygous restriction enzyme segments segregated with all affected members.	7162	7285
19365571	PCR products from 100 control subjects were analyzed by the same two restriction enzymes, but no mutation segments were found among them (Figure 6, Figure 7).	7286	7444
19365571	Macular corneal dystrophy is the least common of the classic stromal dystrophies.	7445	7526
19365571	This disorder is more common in Iceland, however, representing the most frequent indication for penetrating keratoplasty.	7527	7648
19365571	In the present study, we collected one pedigree with three patients clinically diagnosed with MCD.	7649	7747
19365571	Slit lamp examination of the affected individuals showed corneal opacities and stromal haze, which were common characteristic of MCD as described elsewhere.	7748	7904
19365571	Sequence analysis of the CHST6 coding region revealed compound heterozygous mutations, c.892 C>T and c.1072T >C, co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree, which resulted in a missense mutation (p.Y358H) and an early stop codon (p.Q298X), respectively, and implied MCD as a recessive inherited disorder.	7905	8213
19365571	Each patient (III:2, III:4, and III:6) diagnosed with MCD in this family were found to have both mutations.	8214	8321
19365571	Six unaffected blood related members carried either one of the two mutations.	8322	8399
19365571	None of these nucleotide alterations were detected in the 100 normal control subjects, indicating that these variations were not polymorphisms.	8400	8543
19365571	The CHST6 protein is a sulfotransferase, a carbohydrate sulfotransferase of the semi-methyl-D/N-acetyl-galactose/N-acetyl glucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase family, which can catalyze the phosphorylation of 6-hydroxy-6-O of N-acetyl glucosamine, galactose, and N-acetyl galactosamine.	8544	8826
19365571	In the normal corneal tissue, keratan sulfate (KS) is an important glycosaminoglycan, which exists as a highly sulfated form and plays a crucial role in the structure and transparency of the cornea.	8827	9025
19365571	CHST6 can transfer the sulfuric acid group from the 3′-adenosine 5′-phosphate acid (PAPS) to the KS by competing with an endogenous or exogenous substrate.	9026	9181
19365571	The variations in the coding region of CHST6 may decrease activity of the enzyme or even make it lost, leading to a low sulfated form or non-sulfated form of KS.	9182	9343
19365571	Due to the loss of it's soluble property, non-sulfated KS is unable to be completely metabolized, inducing sediment to deposit in the corneal stroma.	9344	9493
19365571	The nonsense change (p.Q298X) resulted in the premature termination of protein transcription and truncated, dysfunctional protein products.	9494	9633
19365571	Sultana and Ha also found other nonsense mutations in the gene and thought that the truncated protein was instable and could be degraded rapidly, which was related to the MCD phenotype.	9634	9819
19365571	The p.Y358H mutation is a new missense mutation that changes tyrosine to histidine, inducing the substitution between a neutral amino acid into a basic amino acid.	9820	9983
19365571	In 2005, El-Ashry found the p.Y358D mutation (tyrosine to aspartate) in the patients with MCD type I, which changes from a neutral amino acid into an acidic amino acid.	9984	10152
19365571	The tyrosine at codon 358 is highly conservative in many eukaryotic species such as human, canine, chimpanzee, rat, mouse, and drosophila, using bioinformatic analysis.	10153	10321
19365571	So we speculated that the Y358H mutation could also affect the protein function.	10322	10402
19365571	Thus, in our study, KS was observed to deposit in the cornea extensively and deeply, which should be associated with severe abnormalities of the sulfotransferase, leading to little activity and lack of function.	10403	10614
19365571	As detected by microscopy, plaque accumulations (significant positive reaction to Hale’s colloidal iron stain) diffusely appeared in the corneal stroma and even close to the endothelium.	10615	10801
19365571	They were likely to be made up of the enlarged and intensive collagen fibers and active, hyperplastic fibroblasts that attempted to ingest the abnormal sediment, which caused the enlargement of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles in the cells.	10802	11084
19365571	The mutations identified in this Chinese family are completely different from those reported previously in other Asians (Japanese) or whites (British and Icelandic).	11085	11250
19365571	Together with previous reports, our data indicate significant allelic heterogeneity exists in MCD and the essential role of CHST6 in the transparency of the cornea.	11251	11415
19365571	The immunophenotype of MCD has not been performed in our study since we could not test the serum level of KS.	11416	11525
19365571	Yet no matter the type of MCD, all have indistinguishable clinical characteristic and the same responsible gene.	11526	11638
19365571	Further studies on these mutations would be helpful to achieve a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MCD.	11639	11761
24914936	The THRA and THRB genes encode the nuclear receptors (thyroid hormone receptor [TRα] and TRβ), which mediate thyroid hormone action in target tissues (1).	0	154
24914936	Autosomal-dominant resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) was recognized in 1967 (2), and the first causative mutations affecting THRB were identified 22 years later (3).	155	322
24914936	More thanr 1000 RTH families have since been described, and affected individuals have increased thyroid hormone levels with an inappropriately normal or elevated TSH concentration due to disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis (4).	323	568
24914936	After the identification of THRB mutations in individuals with RTH it was a further 23 years before the first THRA mutations were reported in 2012 and 2013 (5–7).	569	731
24914936	A six year-old girl with skeletal dysplasia and growth retardation was found to have a heterozygous THRA nonsense mutation resulting in expression of a truncated TRα1E403X protein.	732	912
24914936	She had normal serum TSH with low/normal T4 and high/normal T3 concentrations.	913	991
24914936	Further investigations revealed macrocephaly with patent and abnormal skull sutures, delayed tooth eruption and bone age, disproportionate short stature, and epiphyseal dysgenesis with delayed mineralization of secondary ossification centers.	992	1234
24914936	Treatment with T4 for 9 months resulted in suppression of TSH and an increased basal metabolic rate but did not improve linear growth or skeletal development (5).	1235	1397
24914936	A second girl with similar thyroid function and skeletal dysplasia was found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in THRA resulting in expression of a truncated TRα1F397fs406X protein (6).	1398	1592
24914936	She presented at the age of 3 years with macrocephaly, delayed tooth eruption, absent secondary ossification centers, and congenital hip dislocation.	1593	1742
24914936	Reducing growth velocity became evident between 3 and 6 years of age.	1743	1812
24914936	T4 treatment between 6 and 11 years of age only resulted in a small increase in growth velocity for a 2-month period but ultimately had no effect on her height, which continued along the 20th centile and was accompanied by persistently delayed bone age.	1813	2066
24914936	The girl's 47-year-old father had the same THRA mutation and displayed short stature with a height 3.77 SDs below normal and acquired hearing loss due to otosclerosis (6, 8).	2067	2241
24914936	Recently, a 45-year-old female with similar thyroid function, macrocephaly, and disproportionate short stature was identified and found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in THRA, resulting in expression of a truncated TRα1P382fs388X protein.	2242	2492
24914936	She presented in infancy with developmental delay and was treated intermittently with T4, which resulted in some improvement in growth velocity although her final adult height remained 2.34 SDs below normal (7).	2493	2704
24914936	These recent reports define a new genetic disorder characterized by a severe developmental phenotype with profound skeletal abnormalities that are thought to result from impaired T3 action in bone and cartilage (5–8).	2705	2922
24914936	In an attempt to ameliorate the phenotype, three children have already received intermittent T4 at different doses and for varying durations.	2923	3064
24914936	However, responses to date have been limited, and it is unknown whether long-term T4 treatment will be beneficial or detrimental.	3065	3194
24914936	Thus, it is now essential to define the adult skeletal consequences of THRA mutations and determine the long-term effects of T4 supplementation, because life-long therapy is likely to be required.	3195	3391
24914936	Importantly, Van Mullem et al (8) showed that dominant-negative inhibition of TRβ by TRα1F397fs406X in vitro could be overcome partially by a high concentration of thyroid hormone.	3392	3572
24914936	Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that TRβ may mediate T3 actions in bone and cartilage (9–12), even though the principal physiological effects are mediated by TRα1.	3573	3751
24914936	These observations suggest, therefore, that treatment of patients with supraphysiological doses of T4 may improve their skeletal abnormalities via TRβ-mediated actions.	3752	3920
24914936	To address this timely question we investigated the effects of prolonged T4 treatment in a mouse model of this novel disease.	3921	4046
24914936	Mice with dominant-negative mutations affecting Thra (Thra1PV) and Thrb (ThrbPV) were generated to investigate the tissue-specific roles of TRα and TRβ and aid the identification of patients with THRA mutations (13, 14).	4047	4267
24914936	The PV mutation, first recognized in a patient with RTH, is a C-insertion in exon 10 of THRB that results in a frameshift affecting the C-terminal 16 amino acids (15).	4268	4435
24914936	The equivalent Thra1PV mutation comprises a homologous C-insertion followed by the PV sequence described in THRBPV (14, 16).	4436	4560
24914936	The Thra1PV mutation disrupts helix 12 of TRα1, which is essential for T3 binding and coactivator recruitment (17) and lies within a 21-amino acid region containing the described human THRA mutations (5–7).	4561	4767
24914936	Accordingly, TRα1PV cannot bind T3 or activate target gene transcription but acts as a potent dominant-negative inhibitor of wild-type (WT) TRα1 or TRβ (14, 18, 19).	4768	4933
24914936	Thus, the functional characteristics of TRα1PV closely resemble those reported for TRα1E403X, TRα1F397fs406X, and TRα1P382fs388X (5–7).	4934	5069
24914936	Importantly, PV and none of the described human mutations affect the sequence of the TRα2 isoform that is also expressed from the THRA locus but which cannot bind T3 and has no known physiological function.	5070	5276
24914936	Consistent with this, juvenile Thra1PV/+ mice display the same characteristics as children with heterozygous THRA mutations.	5277	5401
24914936	They have a reduced T4:T3 ratio (14), delayed closure of the skull sutures with enlarged fontanelles, and severe postnatal growth retardation with delayed bone age.	5402	5566
24914936	These abnormalities result from impaired TRα1-mediated T3 action in bone and cartilage (20–22), indicating that Thra1PV mice represent an excellent disease model in which to investigate the consequences of prolonged T4 treatment.	5567	5796
24914936	We hypothesized that the adult phenotype of Thra1PV/+ mice would predict the skeletal outcome of human THRA mutations and determine whether affected individuals may be susceptible to fracture or osteoarthritis, both of which are associated with altered thyroid hormone action in bone (23–26).	5797	6089
24914936	We also hypothesized that prolonged treatment of Thra1PV/+ mice with a supraphysiological dose of T4 would ameliorate the developmental skeletal phenotype and improve bone structure and strength in adulthood.	6090	6298
24914936	The current studies demonstrate that adult Thra1PV/+ mice have short stature but normal bone strength despite high bone mass, suggesting that patients with THRA mutations are unlikely to have an increased risk of fracture.	6299	6521
24914936	By contrast, gross morphologic abnormalities of the bones and joints predict that individuals with THRA mutations may be predisposed to osteoarthritis (27, 28).	6522	6682
24914936	Although treatment with a supraphysiological dose of T4 completely suppressed TSH secretion, it had no effect on skeletal maturation, linear growth, or bone mineralization, thus demonstrating profound tissue resistance to thyroid hormone in Thra1PV/+ mice.	6683	6939
24914936	However, prolonged T4 treatment increased bone stiffness and strength abnormally due to progressive enlargement of cortical bone diameter and thickness.	6940	7092
24914936	Overall, the findings suggest that T4 treatment of individuals with dominant-negative THRA mutations is unlikely to improve their skeletal abnormalities substantially and may even be detrimental in the long term.	7093	7305
24914936	Nevertheless, Thra1PV/+ mice represent an important disease model in which to identify and evaluate new therapeutic approaches.	7306	7433
24914936	WT and heterozygous Thra1PV/+ mice have a mixed C57BL/6J and NIH Black Swiss genetic background and were bred and genotyped as described elsewhere (14, 21).	7434	7590
24914936	Detailed characterization of the adult skeleton in Thra1PV/+ mice was performed in 14-week-old female mice after cessation of growth, and in fully mature 20-week-old female mice that had been treated with vehicle or T4 from weaning at 4 weeks of age until death.	7591	7853
24914936	All mice were given ip injections of calcein (10 mg/kg in 100 μL PBS) 14 and 7 days before tissue collection (29).	7854	7968
24914936	Animal studies were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee granted ethical approval for all experiments.	7969	8201
24914936	TSH, T4, and T3 levels were determined in serum from mice (n = 5–13 per group) treated with vehicle or T4 (1.2 μg/mL in the drinking water) between 4–20 weeks of age.	8202	8368
24914936	T4-supplemented water was changed every 3 days, with the T4 concentration adjusted to intake in 2-week cycles to ensure all animals received the same amount of T4 and did not become markedly thyrotoxic (14, 30–32).	8369	8583
24914936	Tibias were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and decalcified in 10% EDTA, embedded in paraffin wax.	8584	8689
24914936	Sections (5 μm) were stained with alcian blue and van Gieson (29, 33).	8690	8760
24914936	Measurements from at least 4 separate positions across the growth plate were obtained to calculate the mean height using a Leica DM LB2 microscope and DFC320 digital camera (Leica Microsystems).	8761	8955
24914936	Results from 2 levels of sectioning were compared.	8956	9006
24914936	Femurs were imaged at 10 μm resolution using a Faxitron MX20 (Qados).	9007	9076
24914936	Bone mineral content was determined relative to steel, aluminum, and polyester standards.	9077	9166
24914936	Images were calibrated with a digital micrometer, and bone length, cortical bone diameter, and thickness were determined (33, 34).	9167	9297
24914936	Femurs were analyzed by micro-CT (Skyscan 1172a) at 50 kV and 200 μA with a detection pixel size of 4.3 μm2, and images were reconstructed using Skyscan NRecon software.	9298	9467
24914936	A 1-mm3 region of interest was selected 0.2 mm from the growth plate, and trabecular bone volume as proportion of tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular number, and trabecular thickness were determined (29, 33).	9468	9674
24914936	Representative femurs from each treatment group were rescanned using a SCANCO μCT 40 (SCANCO Medical AG) operating at 55 kVp peak energy detection, 6 μm resolution to obtain approximately 2500 cross-sections per specimen in 766 × 763 pixel 16 bit DICOM files.	9675	9934
24914936	Raw data were imported using 32-bit Drishti v2.0.221 (Australian National University Supercomputer Facility, http://anusf.anu.edu.au/Vizlab/drishti/) and rendered using 64-bit Drishti v2.0.000 to generate high-resolution images.	9935	10163
24914936	Femurs were fixed in 70% ethanol and opened longitudinally (33).	10164	10228
24914936	Carbon-coated samples were imaged using backscattered electrons with a Zeiss DSM962 digital scanning electron microscope (EM) at 20-kV beam potential (KE Electronics).	10229	10396
24914936	High-resolution images were quantified using ImageJ to determine the fraction of trabecular and endosteal bone surfaces displaying osteoclastic resorption (33).	10397	10557
24914936	Bone mineralization was determined by quantitative BSE-SEM at 1-μm3 resolution.	10558	10637
24914936	Specimens were embedded in methacrylate and block faces polished to an optical finish for scanning electron microscopy (EM) analysis at 20 kV, 0.5nA with a working distance of 11 mm (33).	10638	10825
24914936	Gradations of micromineralization density were represented in 8 equal intervals by a pseudocolor scheme (33, 35).	10826	10939
24914936	Sections from decalcified tibias were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, counterstained with aniline blue, and imaged using a Leica DM LB2 microscope and DFC320 digital camera (29, 33).	10940	11139
24914936	A montage of 9 overlapping fields covering an area of 1 mm2 located 0.2 mm below the growth plate was constructed for each bone.	11140	11268
24914936	BV/TV was measured, and osteoclast numbers and surface were determined in trabecular bone normalized to total bone surface (BS) (29, 33).	11269	11406
24914936	Methacrylate-embedded specimens were imaged with a Leica SP2 reflection confocal microscope at 488-nm excitation to determine the fraction of BS undergoing active bone formation (33, 36).	11407	11594
24914936	Mineral apposition rate was calculated by determining the separation between calcein labels at 20 locations per specimen beginning 0.2 mm below the growth plate.	11595	11756
24914936	BS and mineralizing surface were measured using ImageJ, and the bone formation rate was calculated by multiplying mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate.	11757	11920
24914936	Three-point bend tests were performed on tibias, with a constant rate of displacement of 0.03 mm/s until fracture, using an Instron 5543 load frame and 100N load cell (Instron Limited).	11921	12106
24914936	Biomechanical variables reflecting cortical bone strength were derived from load displacement curves (33, 37).	12107	12217
24914936	Data were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test; P < .05 was considered significant.	12218	12313
24914936	Frequency distributions of mineralization densities obtained by Faxitron and quantitative BSE were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (29, 33, 34).	12314	12469
24914936	The thyroid status of adult WT and Thra1PV/+ mice was determined following treatment with vehicle or a supraphysiological dose of T4 from weaning until 14 weeks of age (Figure 1).	12470	12649
24914936	The basal T4 concentration did not differ between WT and Thra1PV/+ mice, whereas T3 and TSH levels were increased in Thra1PV/+ mice by 1.5-fold (P < .01) and 6-fold (P < .001), respectively.	12650	12840
24914936	Thus, the characteristically reduced T4:T3 ratio identified in individuals with THRA mutations (5–7) was also present in Thra1PV/+ mice (T4:T3 ratio: Thra1PV/+ 23 vs WT 39).	12841	13014
24914936	Supraphysiological T4 treatment completely suppressed TSH in both WT and Thra1PV/+ mice.	13015	13103
24914936	Despite profound and similar suppression of TSH, the increases in circulating T4 and T3 concentrations were attenuated in Thra1PV/+ mice (T4, 3.5-fold increase; T3, 1.5-fold) compared with WT (T4, 6-fold increase, P < .001; T3, 4-fold, P < .01) indicating that they are resistant to T4 administration.	13104	13405
24914936	Delayed bone development in juvenile Thra1PV/+ mice (21) led to severe skeletal abnormalities in adults.	13406	13510
24914936	Growth plates in 14- and 20-week-old Thra1PV/+ mice were 39% and 70% wider than in WT mice (Figure 2, A and B), demonstrating persistent delay of endochondral ossification.	13511	13683
24914936	An increased degree of retention of mineralized cartilage within trabeculae revealed that bone modeling was also impaired (Figure 2C).	13684	13818
24914936	T4 administration did not affect either of these abnormalities in mutant mice (Figure 2 and data not shown).	13819	13927
24914936	Bones from 14- and 20-week-old Thra1PV/+ mice were grossly dysmorphic.	13928	13998
24914936	They were 17% and 15% shorter than WT and had splayed metaphyses, an abnormal cross-section throughout the diaphysis, and misshapen joint surfaces (Figure 3A).	13999	14158
24914936	Micro-CT analysis indicated that trabecular bone volume, number, and thickness were increased in 20-week-old Thra1PV/+ mice (BV/TV, 2.1-fold; trabecular number, 1.9-fold; trabecular thickness, 1.1-fold greater) (Supplemental Figure 1), and these findings were confirmed by back-scattered electron-scanning EM (BSE-SEM) (Figure 3B).	14159	14490
24914936	Similarly, cortical bone thickness (48% wider at 14 weeks, 43% at 20 weeks) and periosteal diameter (13% larger at 14 weeks, 20% at 20 weeks) were markedly increased in Thra1PV/+ mice (Supplemental Figure 1).	14491	14699
24914936	T4 administration had no effect on these morphologic abnormalities (Figure 3A) but resulted in a gradual increase in cortical bone thickness and diameter in Thra1PV/+ mice (Supplemental Figure 1).	14700	14896
24914936	Importantly, the endosteal diameter did not change in Thra1PV/+ mice following T4 treatment, whereas in WT mice it increased by 16% (P < .01).	14897	15039
24914936	Thus, the increase in cortical bone thickness in Thra1PV/+ mice resulted from a failure of endosteal bone resorption combined with a likely increase in periosteal bone deposition.	15040	15219
24914936	X-ray microradiography revealed that 14-week-old Thra1PV/+ mice had lower bone mineral content than WT mice, consistent with reduced mineral accrual during postnatal growth (21).	15220	15398
24914936	Thus, in Figure 4A, the pseudocolored images in 14-week-old mice show more yellow and fewer red pixels in Thra1PV/+ mice compared with WT, indicating reduced bone mineral content.	15399	15578
24914936	These differences are shown graphically in Figure 4B, in which the frequency distribution for Thra1PV/+ mice is shifted to the left.	15579	15711
24914936	By contrast, in 20-week-old mice there was a small shift to the right in the pixel frequency distribution for Thra1PV/+, mice indicating higher, rather than lower, bone mineral content in older animals (Figure 4, A and B).	15712	15934
24914936	Remarkably, supraphysiological T4 treatment further increased bone mineral content in Thra1PV/+ mice even though, as expected, it was reduced in WT mice following treatment (Figure 4, A and B).	15935	16128
24914936	Thus, Thra1PV/+ mice were resistant to T4-induced bone loss and had a paradoxical increase in bone mineral content following treatment.	16129	16264
24914936	Despite this, BSE-SEM revealed that cortical and trabecular bone mineralization density was reduced in 20 week-old Thra1PV/+ mice, the difference being greater in cortical bone, and that T4 treatment did not affect mineralization (Figure 5, A–D).	16265	16511
24914936	Thus, Thra1PV/+ mice have an increase in bone mineral content (Figure 4) despite the reduction in tissue mineralization density (Figure 5) because their trabecular and cortical bone volume is substantially increased (Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 1).	16512	16765
24914936	Overall, therefore, Thra1PV/+ mice have increased cortical and trabecular bone volume compared with WT, but their bone is less mineralized.	16766	16905
24914936	Consistent with micro-CT and BSE-SEM analysis, histomorphometry studies demonstrated increased bone volume and surface in Thra1PV/+ mice.	16906	17043
24914936	Furthermore, osteoclast surfaces were reduced and fewer osteoclasts were present in Thra1PV/+ mice compared with WT (Figure 6, A–C).	17044	17176
24914936	Thus, Thra1PV/+ mice had a smaller proportion of their increased BS covered by osteoclasts (see also Supplemental Figure 2).	17177	17301
24914936	The differences in BS, BV/TV, osteoclast surface/BS, and osteoclast number/BS between WT and Thra1PV/+ mice were accentuated following T4 treatment (Figure 6, A–C).	17302	17466
24914936	Consistent with these findings, bone resorption was generally lower in Thra1PV/+ mice (Supplemental Figure 2) but bone formation parameters were similar (Supplemental Figure 3).	17467	17644
24914936	However, it is important to note that small differences in dynamic bone formation may not have been detected in these studies because only 3 mice were analyzed per group.	17645	17815
24914936	Biomechanical testing revealed no difference in bone strength between untreated WT and Thra1PV/+ mice (Figure 7, A and B).	17816	17938
24914936	Nevertheless, T4 treatment resulted in gradual increases in yield load, maximum load, fracture load, and stiffness of bones from Thra1PV/+ mice (Figure 7, A and B).	17939	18103
24914936	Thus, prolonged T4 administration abnormally and progressively increased bone stiffness and strength in Thra1PV/+ mice.	18104	18223
24914936	During development Thra1PV/+ mice have delayed closure of the skull sutures, severe growth retardation, delayed bone age, and impaired bone mineral accrual (22).	18224	18385
24914936	The delayed ossification persists into adulthood and is accompanied by impaired bone modeling and remodeling, resulting in short stature, increased bone mass, and gross morphologic abnormalities of the bones and joints, but normal bone strength.	18386	18631
24914936	These findings suggest that, despite severe skeletal abnormalities, adults with THRA mutations are unlikely to have an increased risk of fracture.	18632	18778
24914936	However morphologic abnormalities affecting the bones and joints predict that they may be at increased risk of osteoarthritis (27, 28).	18779	18914
24914936	The abnormalities in Thra1PV/+ mice are consistent with effects of prolonged hypothyroidism on the growing and adult skeleton (38–42).	18915	19049
24914936	Hypothyroidism disrupts growth plate chondrocyte differentiation leading to delayed endochondral ossification and linear growth, impairs bone modeling, and uncouples the processes of osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation (43).	19050	19299
24914936	In adults, even though it is well established that thyroid hormones increase bone resorption and promote bone loss, it is not known whether T3 acts directly in osteoclasts or whether effects on osteoclasts are secondary to the direct actions of T3 in osteoblasts (43).	19300	19568
24914936	In Thra1PV/+ mice, prolonged impairment of chondrocyte differentiation is manifest by growth retardation and short stature in adulthood.	19569	19705
24914936	Similarly, defective osteoclastic bone resorption is evidenced by reduced metaphyseal in-wasting, abnormal diaphyseal cross-section, and increased trabecular bone volume with retention of mineralized cartilage.	19706	19916
24914936	Moreover, the grossly delayed formation of secondary ossification centers and reduced bone mineral accrual in Thra1PV/+ mice persisted throughout growth when mice were active and gaining weight.	19917	20111
24914936	Thus, unmineralized epiphyses were exposed to abnormal and greater mechanical loads, resulting in compensatory enlargement of the epiphyses and metaphyses and culminating in adult joint deformity.	20112	20308
24914936	Surprisingly, the strength of adult Thra1PV/+ bones was normal despite these structural abnormalities and is accounted for by the increased cortical bone thickness and diameter (33, 44).	20309	20495
24914936	A series of studies in genetically modified mice have shown that TRα1 is the principal mediator of T3 action in bone and cartilage (12, 21, 45–48).	20496	20643
24914936	The finding of an identical skeletal phenotype in patients with THRA mutations (5–7) now demonstrates that TRα1 has a similar essential role in human bone development.	20644	20811
24914936	Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the skeletal phenotypes in Thra mutant mice revealed decreased expression of T3 target genes including GH receptor (Ghr), insulin like growth factor-1 (Igf1), Igf1 receptor (Igf1r), fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (Fgfr1) and Fgfr3, and reduced downstream signaling responses mediated by the MAPK, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, and AKT signaling pathways in chondrocytes and osteoblasts (12, 20, 21, 45, 49, 50).	20812	21288
24914936	These data demonstrate impaired T3 action in cartilage and bone in Thra mutant mice despite a normal systemic T3 concentration and thus indicate the skeletal phenotype in individuals with THRA mutations is a consequence of local resistance to thyroid hormone.	21289	21548
24914936	The phenotypes in Thra1PV/+ mice and patients with THRA mutations result from the actions of potent dominant-negative mutant receptors.	21549	21684
24914936	However, we have previously reported that mice harboring a less severe Thra1R384C mutation have a milder phenotype with only transiently delayed ossification and growth retardation, although modeling and remodeling defects resulting in increased bone mass, cortical thickness, and diameter were present in adults (45, 47).	21685	22007
24914936	Importantly, and in contrast to Thra1PV/+ mice, treatment of Thra1R384C mice with a dose of T3 that overcomes the reduced ligand binding affinity and dominant-negative activity of the mutant receptor did ameliorate their skeletal abnormalities (45).	22008	22257
24914936	The response to thyroid hormone treatment in Thra1R384C mice suggests that individuals with THRA mutations may benefit from similar treatment.	22258	22400
24914936	Unfortunately, however, doses of T4 sufficient to normalize circulating hormone concentrations have been largely ineffective in the patients treated so far (5–8), presumably because the currently identified individuals have mutations that result in expression of mutant receptors with little or no T3 binding affinity.	22401	22719
24914936	Despite this, Van Mullem et al (8) showed that dominant-negative inhibition of TRβ by TRα1F397fs406X in vitro could be overcome partially by increasing concentrations of thyroid hormones.	22720	22907
24914936	In this context, several studies have suggested that TRβ can mediate T3 action in bone and cartilage (9–12), even though the principal physiological effects are mediated via TRα1.	22908	23087
24914936	Thus, we hypothesized that treatment of Thra1PV/+ mice with a supraphysiological dose of T4 might improve bone structure and strength.	23088	23222
24914936	However, such treatment of Thra1PV/+ mice had no beneficial effect on growth or skeletal deformity but did, nevertheless, increase cortical bone thickness and diameter.	23223	23391
24914936	These responses were likely mediated by TRβ and resulted in abnormal increases in bone stiffness and strength that may adversely affect the optimal compromise between strength and flexibility that is essential to minimize fracture risk (51).	23392	23633
24914936	Thus, prolonged treatment of individuals harboring THRA mutations with high doses of T4 may also have adverse consequences in other tissues where T3 action is predominantly mediated via TRβ.	23634	23824
24914936	GH therapy represents an alternative approach to improve linear growth and skeletal maturation in children with THRA mutations, but treatment in one individual so far was ineffective (6).	23825	24012
24914936	The reduced expression of Ghr, Igf1, and Igf1r, together with impaired signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and AKT signaling in growth plate chondrocytes in Thra mutant mice (12, 21, 50), suggests a mechanism to account for this lack of clinical response to GH.	24013	24289
24914936	Thyroid hormone metabolism is mediated by 3 iodothyronine deiodinases.	24290	24360
24914936	The type 1 enzyme (D1) catalyzes removal of an inner or outer ring iodine from T4 to generate T3 or rT3, or an outer ring iodine from rT3 to generate 3,3′-diiodothyronine.	24361	24532
24914936	D1 is expressed in liver, kidney, and thyroid and contributes to the circulating concentration of T3 (52).	24533	24639
24914936	The type 2 enzyme (D2) converts the prohormone T4 to the active hormone T3: it is expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary and peripheral target tissues, where it generates a local supply of T3 and is subject to substrate-mediated inactivation (53).	24640	24892
24914936	By contrast, the type 3 enzyme (D3) catalyzes removal of an inner ring iodine from T4 or T3 to generate the inactive metabolites rT3 or 3,3′-diiodothyronine.	24893	25050
24914936	D3 expression is induced by thyroid hormone, thus limiting the supply of T3 in conditions of thyroid hormone excess (52).	25051	25172
24914936	Remarkably, and despite complete suppression of TSH, Thra1PV/+ mice had a blunted increase in circulating thyroid hormones following a supraphysiological dose of T4.	25173	25338
24914936	This discrepancy indicates that the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis is intact in Thra1PV/+ mice, but metabolism of thyroid hormones must be increased.	25339	25493
24914936	Indeed, we previously showed that untreated Thra1PV/+ mice have a 9-fold increase in hepatic D1 mRNA expression (14) resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in enzyme activity (54).	25494	25668
24914936	It is well established that T3 acts via TRβ1 to stimulate D1 expression in the liver (55, 56) and, accordingly, hepatic D1 activity is increased further in Thra1PV/+ mice following treatment with T3 (54, 57).	25669	25877
24914936	By contrast, T3 acts via TRα1 to stimulate expression of D3 (58) and we previously demonstrated that T3 treatment of Thra1PV/+ mice fails to induce the normal increase in D3 activity observed in WT animals (54, 57).	25878	26093
24914936	We propose, therefore, that the resistance to T4 administration observed in Thra1PV/+ mice results from the markedly increased D1 activity combined with this absent D3 response (Figure 8).	26094	26282
24914936	Consistent with this model, TSH in individuals with THRA mutations was suppressed readily following T4 treatment despite only small increases in T4 and T3 concentrations (7, 8).	26283	26460
24914936	Detailed future metabolic studies will be required to confirm the precise underlying mechanisms responsible for these findings.	26461	26588
24914936	For example, because defects in TRα1 action may result in intestinal problems, it is possible that absorption of orally administered T4 could be impaired in Thra1PV/+ mice.	26589	26761
24914936	However, it should also be noted that, following oral treatment with T4, the TSH concentration was suppressed completely in both WT and Thra1PV/+ mice, indicating that intestinal absorption of T4 was unlikely to be markedly impaired in Thra1PV/+ mice.	26762	27013
24914936	Nevertheless, it would be instructive to investigate whether differences in serum T4 and T3 levels persist between WT and Thra1PV/+ mice following parenteral administration of T4.	27014	27193
24914936	The overall resistance of the skeleton to T4 treatment in Thra1PV/+ mice and the patients studied so far is likely to be a consequence of the potent dominant-negative activities of their mutant TRα1 proteins (5–7, 14, 18).	27194	27416
24914936	It is inevitable, however, that individuals with less severe THRA mutations will be identified in the future and, in such cases, T4 treatment is likely to be beneficial.	27417	27586
24914936	Thus, treatment of Thra1R384C mice with doses of T4 that overcome the reduced binding affinity of TRα1R384C rescued their skeletal phenotype by preventing delayed ossification and growth retardation, ultimately ameliorating adult bone structure and mineralization (45).	27587	27856
24914936	Taken together, these studies predict that individuals with THRA mutations will display variable degrees of skeletal deformity and different responses to T4 treatment that correlate with the functional consequences of the particular disease-causative mutation.	27857	28117
24914936	Therefore, in patients with THRA mutations, it will be important to characterize the functional properties of their mutant TRα1 because this may predict their response to T4 treatment and the optimal systemic T4 concentration required.	28118	28353
27729412	Obesity is considered to be one of the most common nutritional disorders of Western society and is characterized by a disproportionate expansion of body fat mass [reviewed in Gasbarrini and Piscaglia (1)].	0	205
27729412	In addition to being an energy storage site, white adipose tissue (WAT) also functions as a highly active metabolic regulator and major endocrine organ that secretes various adipokines (2–4).	206	397
27729412	Adiponectin is a major adipokine with strong antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic activity, and its expression is decreased in WAT under high dietary fat conditions [reviewed in Ouchi et al. (5)].	398	610
27729412	With the exception of the putative role of inflammation (6–8), the precise mechanisms that mediate this down-regulation remain to be elucidated.	611	755
27729412	Retinoids are important regulators of adipogenesis.	756	807
27729412	Diets high in vitamin A (9), dietary excess of retinoic acid (10, 11), and diets high in β-carotene (12–14) result in increased adipocyte apoptosis and inhibition of adipogenesis, while low concentrations of retinoic acid were described to be proadipogenic (reviewed in refs.	808	1083
27729412	9, 11, 15, 16).	1084	1099
27729412	Retinoids, that is, naturally occurring and synthetic retinol analogues (reviewed in refs.	1100	1190
27729412	17, 18), are responsible for activation of specific nuclear receptors: the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR).	1191	1329
27729412	Bioactive retinoic acids are formed from precursor retinaldehydes by the action of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes (RALDHs/ALDH1A) (19).	1330	1470
27729412	RALDH1/ALDH1A1–null adult mice have been shown to be resistant to high-fat (HF) diet–induced weight gain (20, 21), which suggested that ALDH1A1 and its metabolic products are necessary for HF diet–induced obesity (22–24).	1471	1692
27729412	ALDH1A1 can synthesize retinoic acids (25), such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), 9-cis-retinoic acid, and, presumably, the newly found endogenous RXR ligand, 9-cis-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid (26).	1693	1892
27729412	The last two are ligands for both RXRs and RARs, whereas ATRA only binds RAR.	1893	1970
27729412	Unfortunately, only a few studies have detected retinoic acids in low concentrations in adipose tissue (27, 28), but no study has addressed the presence of retinoic acids in WAT when comparing ALDH1A1+/+ or ALDH1A1−/− mice.	1971	2194
27729412	Whether retinoic acids, and which retinoic acids, are the major metabolites of ALDH1A1 in WAT is yet unknown.	2195	2304
27729412	Moreover, ALDH1A1 expression has been shown to be regulated by liver X receptor (LXR) (29) as well as estrogen receptor–mediated pathways (30, 31).	2305	2452
27729412	Various nuclear hormone receptor pathways are involved in adipokine secretion and adipocyte differentiation, proliferation, and lipid accumulation (reviewed in refs.	2453	2618
27729412	7, 32).	2619	2626
27729412	In particular, RXRs, the central heterodimer-forming partners, play important roles during obesity (33–35).	2627	2734
27729412	RXRα as well as RXRγ KO and RXR-antagonist treatment induce resistance to weight gain after HF diet and also promote a higher metabolic rate (36–38).	2735	2884
27729412	RXRs can also interact with several nuclear receptors, such as RAR, LXR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), or NR4A-orphan nuclear receptors (39, 40), and the activation of various so-called permissive heterodimers (RXR-PPAR, -LXR, -VDR, and -NR4A1/2) by an RXR ligand can initiate heterodimer-mediated signaling (39–41).	2885	3248
27729412	The aim of our study was to find out how HF diet reduces adiponectin expression in WAT, focusing primarily on vitamin A–mediated RAR- and RXR-dependent pathways.	3249	3410
27729412	Manually prepared diets were made with wheat starch (Weizenstärke, Foodstar, Germany; provided by Kröner-Stärke, Ibbenbüren, Germany), saccharose (purchased from a local supermarket in Hungary), casein (Sigma-Aldrich, Budapest, Hungary), cellulose (Vivapur; JRS Pharma GmbH; Rosenberg, Germany), vitamin mix (Vitamin-Vormischung C1000; Altromin GmbH, Lage, Germany), mineral mixture (Mineral-Spurenelemente-Vormischung C100; Altromin GmbH), and sunflower oil (Henry Lamotte, Bremen, Germany).	3411	3903
27729412	Animal experiments were performed in the Laboratory Animal Core Facility of the University of Debrecen.	3904	4007
27729412	Experiments were performed according to Hungarian ethical guidelines.	4008	4077
27729412	After the acclimatization period, animals received a vitamin A–deficient [0 retinol equivalent (RE)/kg diet] diet for 10 wk that contained 5% sunflower oil as a dietary lipid, which represented a diet with normal fat (NF) content (42).	4078	4313
27729412	Animals were divided into different feeding groups (n = 6 per group) and were fed for 4 wk with specific diets that contained different amounts of dietary fat and equal amounts of vitamin A (2500 RE/kg diet, normal vitamin A).	4314	4540
27729412	Sunflower oil was added as dietary fat, which contained either 2% [as weight %; low-fat (LF) diet], 5% (NF diet), or 25% (HF diet).	4541	4672
27729412	The source of the fat was always sunflower oil in different proportions added to feed.	4673	4759
27729412	On the basis of the analyzed feed of the NF diet, it contained 11.6% saturated fats, 20% monounsaturated fatty acids, and 68.4% polyunsaturated fatty acids.	4760	4916
27729412	Furthermore, dietary composition was 180 g/kg casein, 10 g/kg vitamin mix, 45 g/kg mineral mix, and 20 g/kg cellulose for all applied diets (42).	4917	5062
27729412	As a result of the increased amount of fat in the diet, the carbohydrate proportion was lower; the LF diet contained 29.5% sucrose and 43% starch, the NF diet 28% sucrose and 41.5% starch, and the HF diet 17% sucrose and 32.5% starch (42).	5063	5302
27729412	For vitamin content, diets were supplemented with vitamin mix (Vitamin-Vormischung C1000) that contained either 2500 RE/kg as normal–vitamin A diet, or for high–vitamin A diet, an additional retinyl-palmitate (RetPal) supplement (final 326,500 RE/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the normal–vitamin A diet (42, 43).	5303	5617
27729412	After euthanizing mice, blood collection was carried out by cardiac puncture.	5618	5695
27729412	Blood was centrifuged for 20 min and plasma was stored at −80°C.	5696	5760
27729412	Mice were anatomized, and WAT samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after dissection and later stored at −80°C until RNA extraction.	5761	5906
27729412	Retinoic acid response element (RARE)-Luc female mice (n = 6) were obtained from Cgene (Oslo, Norway) and received LF, NF, or HF diets for 4 wk or the oral retinoid treatments as described before (43, 44).	5907	6112
27729412	We conducted ex vivo organ analysis by bioluminescence imaging.	6113	6176
27729412	All animals were treated with 120 mg/kg d-luciferin (Bioscience, Budapest, Hungary) via intraperitoneal injections 15 min before euthanasia and further organ screening.	6177	6345
27729412	Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation.	6346	6391
27729412	After euthanasia, mouse liver, WAT, intestine, and brain were collected for bioluminescence imaging.	6392	6492
27729412	Organs were analyzed for bioluminescence signal by using an Andor-Ixon CCD camera (Belfast, United Kingdom), and analysis was performed by Andor-IQ software.	6493	6650
27729412	After imaging, integrated intensity/area was calculated for liver, WAT, intestine, and brain of each treated animal.	6651	6767
27729412	3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were seeded in 3.5-cm-diameter dishes at a density of 15 × 104 cells/well.	6768	6917
27729412	Cells were grown in DMEM that was supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, as previously reported (45, 46).	6918	7053
27729412	To induce differentiation, 2-d postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (day 0) were stimulated for 48 h with 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.25 µM dexamethasone, and 1 µg/ml insulin in DMEM that was supplemented with 10% FBS.	7054	7275
27729412	Cells were then maintained in DMEM that was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 µg/ml insulin (47).	7276	7371
27729412	To examine the effects on gene expression of ATRA (a gift from BASF AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany), an RARα agonist (BMS753), an RARγ agonist (BMS189961; both were prepared in our laboratories as described in the original patents (48, 49)], and an RXR agonist (LG268; gift from Ligand Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, USA), 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 1 µM of these molecules for 24 h, as previously reported (47).	7372	7791
27729412	Data presented are the mean of 3 independent experiments each performed in triplicate.	7792	7878
27729412	Eleven lean (body mass index: 22.5 ± 0.5 kg/m2) and 14 obese (body mass index: 31.7 ± 0.9 kg/m2) male participants were recruited, as previously reported (50).	7879	8038
27729412	Lean and obese volunteers were age 44 ± 7 and 44 ± 5 yr, respectively.	8039	8109
27729412	Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were performed between 6:30 and 7:30 am after an overnight fast.	8110	8211
27729412	Biopsies were obtained by needle aspiration in the periumbilical area under local anesthesia.	8212	8305
27729412	Adipose tissue samples were rinsed in physiologic serum, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction.	8306	8443
27729412	The experimental protocol was performed in accordance with the guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Auvergne Region (agreement No.	8444	8628
27729412	AU 800, March 2010).	8629	8649
27729412	Participants gave their written informed consent to participate in the study.	8650	8727
27729412	Analysis of total cellular RNA extracted from 3T3-L1 cells was performed in France by using Trizol reagent according to manufacturer instructions.	8728	8874
27729412	Human adipose tissue sample extraction was also performed in France, whereas WAT and liver sample analysis from mice was done in Hungary.	8875	9012
27729412	For the cell culture material in the French laboratory, cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA in 20 µl by using random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase.	9013	9202
27729412	Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses for genes were performed by using the Mx3005P Real-Time PCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) as previously described (51).	9203	9370
27729412	For each sample, expression was quantified in duplicate and 18S rRNA was used as the endogenous control in the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method.	9371	9522
27729412	For WAT and liver tissue analysis of human and murine origin, tissues were homogenized in Tri reagent solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and total RNA was isolated from tissue according to manufacturer guidelines and as previously described (52).	9523	9788
27729412	Concentration and purity of RNA was measured by using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).	9789	9901
27729412	For real-time quantitative PCR, total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by using the Super Script II First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).	9902	10064
27729412	Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out in triplicate using predesigned MGB assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an ABI Prism 7900 (Applied Biosystems, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France).	10065	10249
27729412	Relative mRNA levels were calculated by using the Ct method and were normalized to cyclophilin A mRNA.	10250	10352
27729412	Sequence Detector Software (v. 2.1; Applied Biosystems) was used for data analysis.	10353	10436
27729412	WAT samples were collected and stored in dark vials at −80°C until analysis.	10437	10513
27729412	Sample preparation was performed as previously described for retinoid (53) and eicosanoid/docosanoid (54) analysis.	10514	10629
27729412	HPLC–tandem mass spectrometry analyses for retinoids as well as eicosanoids and docosanoids, which focused on eicosanoids with known PPAR activation potential, were also performed as previously explained (53, 54).	10630	10843
27729412	To examine the effect of retinoids on adiponectin secretion, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 1 µM of the retinoids (ATRA, RARα, RARγ, or RXR ligand) for 48 h. Adiponectin quantification was realized on the culture supernatant by using adiponectin ELISA assay according to manufacturer protocol (Quantikine ELISA; R&D Systems, Lille, France).	10844	11191
27729412	Data are expressed as means ± sem.	11192	11226
27729412	Significant differences between control and treated cells/groups were determined by Student’s t test using Statview software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).	11227	11383
27729412	Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.	11384	11431
27729412	Body weight gain was observed in animals after 4 wk of HF diet compared with LF or NF dietary supplementation (LF: 1.07 ± 0.08 g; NF: 0.92 ± 0.11 g; HF: 3.24 ± 0.37 g; LF-HF P = 0.03 and NF-HF P = 0.04).	11432	11635
27729412	Food intake slightly decreased in the HF diet group (LF: 2.93 g/d/animal; NF: 2.70 g/d/animal; HF: 2.25 g/d/animal).	11636	11752
27729412	ALDH1A1 was significantly increased only in WAT (LF: 1 ± 0.80; NF: 1.83 ± 0.36; HF: 5.26 ± 0.23) of HF diet–fed mice compared with LF and NF diet–fed mice, and was tissue selective for WAT (Table 1, WAT), compared with unchanged expression in the liver (Table 1, liver).	11753	12023
27729412	ALDH1A2 expression remained unchanged in liver and WAT (Table 1).	12024	12089
27729412	ALDH1A3 was also significantly increased in adipose tissue of animals fed HF and NF diets compared with LF diet (Table 1, WAT).	12090	12217
27729412	In addition, expression of RAR pathway target genes, such as CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, remained unchanged (Table 2), whereas expression of the highly sensitive common RAR/RXR pathway target gene transglutaminase 2 (TG2) was strongly increased (Table 1; LF: 1 ± 0.36; NF: 9.56 ± 0.13; HF: 15.36 ± 0.17) in HF diet–fed mice.	12218	12535
27729412	In addition to increased retinoid signaling, expression of adiponectin was reduced in HF diet–fed mice (LF: 1 ± 0.31; NF: 0.86 ± 0.12; HF: 0.15 ± 0.37).	12536	12688
27729412	Experiments using adipose tissue biopsies from normal-weight and obese human volunteers confirmed increased ALDH1A1 (healthy volunteers were set as 1; 1.20 ± 0.07) and reduced adiponectin (0.85 ± 0.04) expression in the obese volunteers (Table 3).	12689	12936
27729412	Expression of ALDH1A1 increased (NF, normal vitamin A was set as 1: 1 ± 0.19; NF, high vitamin A: 2.32 ± 0.47) in the WAT of mice fed an NF diet with high vitamin A supplementation, whereas adiponectin expression (NF, normal vitamin A was set as 1: 1 ± 0.47; NF, high vitamin A: 0.37 ± 0.21) was decreased in WAT (Table 4).	12937	13260
27729412	Retinol levels remained stable in the WAT of LF, NF, and HF diet–fed animals, whereas ATRA (LF: 2.2 ± 0.1 ng/g; NF: 1.7 ± 0.2 ng/g; HF: 0.6 ± 0.1 ng/g) levels were lower in the WAT of HF diet–fed animals (Table 5).	13261	13475
27729412	Increased retinoid signaling was confirmed in RARE-Luc mice, with increased RARE-mediated signaling detected specifically in adipose tissue of HF compared with LF and NF diet–fed animals, whereas in liver, intestine, and brain, no increased RARE-mediated signaling was observed (Fig.	13476	13759
27729412	1).	2449	2452
27729412	Endogenous PPAR ligands [9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), 13-HODE, 13-ketooctadecadienoic acid, 12-ketoeicosatetraenoic acid, PgJ2, and d15d12PgJ2] were mainly unchanged, except the adipose tissue–specific PPARγ ligand, hepoxilin B3, which is increased in adipose tissue of HF diet–fed animals (Table 5).	13764	14075
27729412	Expression of PPARγ and PPARγ target genes retinol saturase (RETSAT)/fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4)/FADS2 in mouse WAT remained unaffected by NF and HF dietary supplementation compared with LF diet (Table 2).	14076	14290
27729412	Treatment of cultured adipocytes with synthetic RARα-selective ligands [control (CTRL) set as 1; adiponectin: 0.22 ± 0.01 and ALDH1A1 2.37 ± 0.04], RARγ-selective ligands (CTRL set as 1; adiponectin: 0.22 ± 0.01 and ALDH1A1 2.64 ± 0.01), and the natural RAR ligand ATRA (CTRL set as 1; adiponectin: 0.25 ± 0.03 and ALDH1A1 3.19 ± 0.07), in addition to a synthetic RXR agonist (LG268; CTRL set as 1; adiponectin: 0.51 ± 0.04 and ALDH1A1 1.04 ± 0.04), resulted in increased ALDH1A1 expression for RAR agonists, whereas adiponectin expression was reduced for all RAR and RXR ligands.	14291	14871
27729412	In addition, these results were confirmed at the protein level in cell culture supernatants where adiponectin secretion was reduced for all administered RAR and RXR ligands, except for the RARγ-selective ligand, which displayed a nonsignificant decrease (Table 6).	14872	15136
27729412	Obesity is classically associated with a decrease of adiponectin plasma level in humans and rodents, as well as a decreased expression in adipose tissue (5).	15137	15294
27729412	This relationship between obesity and decreased adiponectin expression is suspected to be linked to the increased inflammatory status of adipose tissue, as TNF-α, one of the main inflammatory markers produced by adipose tissue (55), is known to reduce adiponectin expression (56).	15295	15575
27729412	However, this mechanism is probably not exclusive, and other pathways—RAR signaling among them—could be involved in this regulation.	15576	15708
27729412	In this study, we reported that, in mice, reduced adiponectin expression in WAT after HF dietary supplementation was associated with an increase of ALDH1A1 expression.	15709	15876
27729412	Similar results were also obtained by comparing lean vs. obese WAT biopsies.	15877	15953
27729412	Surprisingly, increased ALDH1A1 expression in mice does not result in increased ATRA levels in WAT.	15954	16053
27729412	ALDH1A1, the major enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis using retinaldehyde as a substrate, is highly likely to play an important role in the relationship between retinoid signaling and obesity (20, 21, 57).	16054	16259
27729412	Indeed, its expression is increased in WAT during HF-induced obesity (58).	16260	16334
27729412	In ALDH1A1−/−-deficient adipocytes as well as in ALDH1A1−/− mice, adipogenesis is impaired and mice are resistant to HF diet–induced obesity (20), which is suggested to be related to altered retinoid signaling [(25) and reviewed in refs.	16335	16572
27729412	9, 11, 15].	16573	16584
27729412	Retinoic acids, the products from ALDH1A1 metabolism, are the endogenous activators of RARs and RXRs.	16585	16686
27729412	Reduced retinaldehyde and retinol levels were measured in adipose tissue of animals fed an HF diet, and ATRA levels were speculated to be increased upon ALDH1A1 activity (20).	16687	16862
27729412	However, the detection and quantification of retinoic acid levels in adipose tissue have been scarcely examined (27, 28) and, unfortunately, the connection of retinoic acids in response to ALDH1A1 expression in adipose tissue has not been studied before.	16863	17117
27729412	In the present study, we report that increased ALDH1A1 expression in mice does not result in increased ATRA levels in WAT.	17118	17240
27729412	On the contrary, ATRA levels were even lower in WAT of HF vs. LF or NF diet–fed animals.	17241	17329
27729412	Similar reduced levels of ATRA were confirmed in serum and adipose tissue of obese volunteers compared with obese volunteers after a weight-loss diet (unpublished data), which indicates that obesity is related to reduced local and systemic retinoid levels in humans.	17330	17596
27729412	These findings of reduced local retinoid levels in adipose tissue of obese animals fit well with previous studies on animals fed a vitamin A–deficient diet, which were found to become obese upon reduced ATRA synthesis, levels, and ATRA-mediated signaling [reviewed in Bonet et al. (11)].	17597	17884
27729412	In addition, it is well established that retinoids, and especially ATRA, as signaling ligands, have the ability to inhibit proliferation of adipocytes; enhance up-regulation of genes involved in lipid oxidation, energy dissipation, and insulin response; and thereby prevent obesity and insulin resistance [reviewed in Bonet et al. (11)], probably by targeting adipocyte oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondriobiogenesis (59).	17885	18313
27729412	As a result of this unclear evidence and inconclusive determination of retinoic acids levels in WAT, we opted, like others [(21, 57) plus follow-up reviews in refs.	18314	18478
27729412	15, 22], for an indirect method of detection of retinoid signaling by using a RARE-reporter mouse model (44) and we confirmed increased WAT-selective, RARE-mediated signaling in the WAT of HF vs. LF diet–fed mice (57).	18479	18697
27729412	Previous experimental studies claimed, without any analytical proof, the involvement of ALDH1A1-synthesized ATRA in adipose tissue and, only on the basis of increased RARE signaling (21, 57), that ATRA is the metabolite of ALDH1A1 in adipose tissue and that the described effects of ALDH1A1, by consequence, are mediated by ATRA-RAR signaling.	18698	19041
27729412	Furthermore, they claimed that the ALDH1A1 product ATRA must be involved in the ALDH1A1-mediated increase of adipose tissue expansion and diet-induced obesity.	19042	19201
27729412	Our solid data, generated by using HPLC–tandem mass spectrometry quantification of ATRA in adipose tissue, contradicts these claims and warns about the common obtainment of false-positive data from RARE-Luc activation models (60).	19202	19432
27729412	We concluded that either a still-uncharacterized endogenous RAR ligand must be synthesized in the WAT of HF diet–fed mice to induce WAT-selective, RARE-mediated signaling or alternative mechanisms that possibly involve transporter protein–mediated signaling (reviewed in ref.	19433	19708
27729412	61 and speculated upon in ref.	19709	19739
27729412	62) or post-translational modifications in adipocytes [(21) and reviewed in ref.	19740	19820
27729412	63] must be taken into consideration.	19821	19858
27729412	With regard to ligands other than ATRA, it is still unknown which RAR- and/or RXR-activating ligands could be synthesized upon ALDH1A1 expression in WAT, and we could not conclusively suggest a possible structure using our current analytical expertise (26, 53).	19859	20120
27729412	However, several known and unknown candidates, including 9-cis- and all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid, retinal, apo-lycopenoic acids, apo-13′-carotenone, apo-10′-carotenoic acid, and apo-14′-carotenoic acid (20, 26, 44, 47, 64–72), were recently identified and could constitute potential endogenous retinoids.	20121	20433
27729412	To further exclude the involvement of PPARγ, the key regulator of adipogenesis (7, 73), as a major nuclear receptor responsible for adiponectin reduction after an HF-supplemented diet, endogenous PPAR ligands were determined.	20434	20659
27729412	Levels in adipose tissue were mainly unaltered after LF, NF, or HF dietary supplementation (74–77).	20660	20759
27729412	Only the levels of the endogenous and adipose tissue–specific PPARγ ligand, hepoxilin B3, (78, 79) were significantly increased in HF vs. LF diet–fed animals.	20760	20918
27729412	In addition, our data show no increased expression of PPARγ and known PPARγ target genes, RETSAT, FABP4, and FADS2, in the WAT of HF diet–fed mice, which, in part, contrasts with previous studies.	20919	21115
27729412	In general, increased PPARγ expression in adipose tissue after HF diet is mainly related to omental and not subcutaneous fat in humans, as reviewed in (80).	21116	21272
27729412	In mice, increased PPARγ expression is observable just after diets with extreme HF conditions, after strong weight gain, and after a long time of HF dietary supplementation (<8 wk) (81–84).	21273	21462
27729412	Finally, it is well established that PPARγ signaling activation increases secretion of adiponectin rather than decreases it (85).	21463	21592
27729412	In summary, all these data strongly imply that PPARγ-mediated signaling in adipose tissue of animals fed an HF-supplemented diet is unlikely to be of major importance for further reduced adiponectin expression.	21593	21803
27729412	To evaluate RAR- and RXR-mediated signaling pathways in adipocytes directly, 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell culture models were used, and we determined that ALDH1A1 was increased after administration of ATRA and synthetic RARα- and RARγ-selective RAR ligands, and not by a synthetic RXR ligand, whereas adiponectin expression and secretion in the cell supernatant were decreased after administration of RAR or RXR agonists.	21804	22218
27729412	We conclude, therefore, that this direct down-regulation of adiponectin is an RAR- or RXR-mediated pathway and that ALDH1A1 expression is just regulated by an RAR ligand.	22219	22389
27729412	In summary (Fig.	22390	22406
27729412	2), we found that reduced adiponectin expression in the WAT of mice is under the control of retinoid-mediated signaling, mainly via RAR-mediated signaling pathways.	22407	22571
27729412	We suggest that altered retinoid signaling in adipose tissue is an important mechanism of HF diet–induced obesity.	22572	22686
27729412	In particular, ALDH1A1 seems to be the key enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of alternative endogenous RAR ligands selectively in WAT.	22687	22832
27729412	This increased ALDH1A1 and reduced adiponectin expression was also confirmed to occur in adipose tissue from obese human volunteers.	22833	22965
27729412	Endogenous as well as synthetic RAR ligands were shown to further directly inhibit adiponectin expression in cultured adipocytes.	22966	23095
27729412	The nature of the endogenous RAR/RXR agonists or antagonists synthesized by ALDH1A1 in WAT remains elusive and is the topic of future studies.	23096	23238
27729412	Characterization of these novel endogenous retinoids with mainly RAR, as well as potential RXR, ligand activation potential and their metabolic pathways can help clarify the controversy of the altered retinoid signaling in adipose tissue.	23239	23477
27729412	On the basis of these data, novel strategies can be developed to selectively inhibit distinct retinoid signaling, especially that which involves ALDH1A1 products under HF diet, focused on adipose tissue to enable sufficient beneficial adiponectin expression.	23478	23736
27103577	Each day, the human heart beats ∼100,000 times and pumps ∼10 tons of blood through the body, therefore requiring ∼6 kg of ATP (1).	0	130
27103577	To produce such a large quantity of ATP, the heart relies on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of a variety of metabolic fuels, including free fatty acids (FFAs) and glucose.	131	311
27103577	In theory, FFAs require ∼13% more oxygen than glucose to generate the same amount of ATP, although hearts metabolizing FFAs may require far more oxygen, owing to increased mitochondrial uncoupling (2, 3).	312	516
27103577	ATP is transported from the mitochondria to be used for contractile function via the creatine (Cr) kinase energy shuttle, in which phosphate is transferred from ATP to Cr with the formation of phosphocreatine (PCr) and ADP in a reaction catalyzed by mitochondrial Cr kinase (1):  The Cr kinase system acts to keep ATP levels constant via a fall in PCr and a rise in cytosolic free ADP concentrations ([ADP]free), which controls mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation when oxygen is not limiting (4).	517	1017
27103577	In hypoxia, when oxygen availability limits oxidative phosphorylation, the heart moves toward more oxygen-efficient carbohydrate, away from fatty acid, metabolism (5).	1018	1185
27103577	Thus, cardiac glucose uptake was increased in hypoxic rats (6) and in high-altitude-adapted humans (7), and fatty acid metabolizing enzyme [carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD)] expression was decreased by hypoxia (8–10).	1186	1464
27103577	Magnetic resonance (MR) studies have shown that cardiac PCr/ATP ratios are lower in high-altitude-adapted humans (11) and in lowlanders returning to sea level following a trek to Mount Everest Base Camp (12).	1465	1673
27103577	However, the links among limited oxygen availability, changes in substrate metabolism, ATP generation, and cardiac function have not been well defined.	1674	1825
27103577	The balance between fatty acid and glucose metabolism may be regulated, at least in part, by the nuclear PPARs.	1826	1937
27103577	Of the 3 receptor isoforms, α, δ, and γ, PPARα and PPARδ are highly expressed in the heart (13).	1938	2034
27103577	PPARα regulates several genes encoding for proteins that control fatty acid metabolism, including MCAD (14), and glucose metabolism, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) (15).	2035	2256
27103577	Hypoxia is a potential driver of metabolic reprogramming, with the oxygen-sensitive transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) elevated in ischemic cardiac myocytes (16) and in infarcted hearts (17).	2257	2476
27103577	In normoxia, HIF-α subunits are polyubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation, the constant degradation of HIF-α subunits mediated by hydroxylation via the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) or egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor (EGLN) oxygenase family.	2477	2730
27103577	In hypoxia, PHD activity is reduced, stabilizing HIF-α, which translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with HIF-1β.	2731	2847
27103577	The dimer transcriptionally activates ∼200 genes, including those involved in erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and energy metabolism (18).	2848	2983
27103577	In hypoxia-adapted Tibetans, variants of the genes EGLN1 and endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1, encoding for PHD2 (the most important of the 3 human PHDs) and the HIF-2α subunit, respectively, associated with the PPARA gene in genome-wide scans (19), and serum fatty acid concentrations in this group correlated with the PPARA haplotype (20).	2984	3336
27103577	These findings suggest that PPARα may control cardiac substrate metabolism, ATP generation, and thereby, cardiac function in hypoxia (Fig.	3337	3475
27103577	1).	127	130
27103577	Figure 1.	3480	3489
27103577	Putative mechanism for the control of cardiac substrate metabolism and function in hypoxia.	3490	3581
27103577	Decreased oxygen tension in the blood inhibits PHD activity, stabilizing HIF-α subunits and down-regulating the nuclear hormone receptor, PPARα.	3582	3726
27103577	In turn, PPARα regulates fatty acid and glucose metabolism via changes in several proteins, including MCAD and PDK4, and the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, via UCP3 and mitochondrial thioesterase 1 (MTE-1) proteins.	3727	3951
27103577	Increased glycolytic flux and decreased mitochondrial uncoupling increase the efficiency of ATP production, the ATP being consumed primarily by myocardial contraction.	3952	4119
27103577	ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase; CoA, coenzyme A; ETC, electron transport chain; FA, fatty acid; FADH2, flavin adenine dinucleotide; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NEFA, nonesterified fatty acid; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PGC-1α, PPARγ coactivator α; Pi, inorganic phosphate; RXR, retinoid X receptor; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.	4120	4450
27103577	Recent studies using cultured cells, knockout, or transgenic mice seemingly demonstrate that alterations in the HIF system, whether decreases or increases in aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT; HIF-1β) (21), HIF-1α (22–24), HIF-2α (21, 25), PHD1 (25), or von Hippel-Lindau (26) levels, increase PPARα or PPARγ (22) in heart or skeletal muscle.	4451	4803
27103577	Such apparently contradictory studies necessitate a deeper understanding of the cellular mechanisms whereby a decrease in PPARα is absolutely required to maintain ATP levels for the contractile function of the hypoxic heart.	4804	5028
27103577	Here, we show that hypoxia causes the heart to undergo a series of metabolic changes, coordinated by PPARα and designed to use the limited available oxygen as efficiently as possible.	5029	5212
27103577	We demonstrate in normal mice how a high-fat diet increases PPARα expression, which prevents the metabolic changes required for acclimation to hypoxia, thereby significantly decreasing [ATP] and myocardial contractile function.	5213	5440
27103577	We also demonstrate that the lack of myocardial PPARα prevents any metabolic response to hypoxia and that chemical induction of HIF, by inhibition of HIF hydroxylases in mechanically active cardiomyocytes, has the same effect on PPARα as hypoxia.	5441	5687
27103577	In short, for adaptation to hypoxia, it is essential that PPARα expression decreases to increase the efficiency of oxygen use, via orchestrated changes in substrate metabolism and mitochondrial respiration, so that normoxic [ATP] and cardiac function can be maintained.	5688	5957
27103577	Male wild-type 129Ev/Sv (n = 106; 14 mo) and littermate PPARα−/− (n = 72) mice were housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum.	5958	6095

27103577	Results were considered significantly different at P < 0.05.	14533	14593
27103577	To investigate functional and metabolic responses of the in vivo mouse heart to hypoxia, we used a 3-wk protocol that began with 7 d of lowering ambient oxygen concentration from 21 to 11% in daily increments to produce a graded, physiologic hypoxia (Fig.	14594	14849
27103577	2).	1670	1673
27103577	Hypoxia in wild-type, chow-fed mice increased whole-blood hemoglobin by 51% (P < 0.001) and hematocrit by 33% (P < 0.001) but did not alter body weight.	14854	15006
27103577	Established HIF-1α downstream targets, cardiac VEGF and PDK1 protein, increased 3.6-fold (P < 0.001) and 1.8-fold (P < 0.01), respectively.	15007	15146
27103577	LV mass decreased by 19% (P < 0.001) following hypoxia, whereas right-ventricular (RV) mass was unaltered.	15147	15253
27103577	Plasma metabolites in wild-type mice were unchanged by hypoxia (Supplemental Fig.	15254	15335
27103577	1).	127	130
27103577	Hypoxia in chow-fed, wild-type mice decreased cardiac PPARα mRNA levels by 36% (P < 0.05), with PPARδ mRNA and PPARγ, RXR, and PGC-1α protein levels remaining unchanged (Fig.	15340	15514
27103577	3A and Supplemental Fig.	15515	15539
27103577	2).	1670	1673
27103577	In parallel with lower PPARα mRNA levels, hypoxia decreased protein levels of downstream targets of PPARα: UCP3, MTE-1, and PDK4 (Fig.	15544	15678
27103577	3B).	15679	15683
27103577	MCAD protein levels were 24% (P < 0.05) lower, but proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration were unchanged following hypoxia (Supplemental Fig.	15684	15833
27103577	2).	1670	1673
27103577	Hypoxia increased cardiac glycolysis 2.3-fold (P < 0.01) and lactate efflux 2.4-fold (P < 0.01), measured in isolated, beating, perfused hearts using [3H] substrate labeling (Fig.	15838	16017
27103577	3C).	16018	16022
27103577	Hypoxia did not alter total cardiac GLUT4 protein or activities of glycolytic intermediates (Supplemental Fig.	16023	16133
27103577	3).	513	516
27103577	Fatty acid oxidation was 26% (P < 0.02) lower in hearts from hypoxic mice compared with normoxic controls (Fig.	16138	16249
27103577	3D), whereas myocardial TAG levels were 28% (P < 0.05) higher in hypoxic mice.	16250	16328
27103577	In isolated, perfused hearts, [PCr] was 31% (P < 0.001) lower, but [ATP] was unaltered by hypoxia, measured using [31P] NMR spectroscopy and HPLC (Fig.	16329	16480
27103577	3E); total Cr was 28% (P < 0.05) lower following hypoxia.	16481	16538
27103577	Although [ADP]free increased 2-fold (P < 0.02), the calculated ΔGATP was preserved.	16539	16622
27103577	In vivo cine MRI showed that 3 wk of hypoxia did not alter cardiac output, cardiac index, or ejection fraction, despite an 18% (P < 0.02) lower stroke volume (SV), resulting from a 17% (P < 0.05) lower end-diastolic volume (EDV) in hypoxic mice (Fig.	16623	16873
27103577	3F).	16874	16878
27103577	The cardiac metabolic and energetic changes observed in hypoxic mice may have been caused by decreased PPARα expression.	16879	16999
27103577	To investigate whether PPARα expression is central to hypoxic adaptation, we prevented PPARα down-regulation by increasing PPARα expression using high-fat (55% fat) feeding.	17000	17173
27103577	The feeding of mice a high-fat diet for 3 wk in normoxia did not alter body weight, but with hypoxia, caused a 10% (P < 0.01) loss of body weight and a 19% (P < 0.01) decrease in LV mass (Supplemental Table 1).	17174	17384
27103577	High-fat feeding increased PPARα mRNA expression in both normoxia and hypoxia (P < 0.05), preventing any hypoxia-induced decrease (Fig.	17385	17520
27103577	4A).	17521	17525
27103577	PPARδ mRNA and PPARγ, RXR, and PGC-1α protein levels were unchanged by high-fat feeding.	17526	17614
27103577	Downstream targets of PPARα, UCP3, and MTE-1 proteins, increased 2-fold (P < 0.001), and MCAD protein increased by 39% (P < 0.01) with high-fat feeding under both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig.	17615	17804
27103577	4B and Supplemental Fig.	17805	17829
27103577	2).	1670	1673
27103577	High-fat feeding did not significantly increase cardiac PDK4 protein, although it prevented the decrease caused by hypoxia in chow-fed mice.	17834	17974
27103577	High-fat feeding prevented the increase in cardiac glycolysis and lactate efflux that occurred in chow-fed mice in hypoxia, and decreased GLUT4 protein by 59% (P < 0.05), which remained unaltered by hypoxia (Fig.	17975	18187
27103577	4C).	18188	18192
27103577	High-fat feeding increased cardiac fatty acid oxidation by 22% (P < 0.05; Fig.	18193	18271
27103577	4D) and myocardial TAG content by 82% (P < 0.01), both unaffected by hypoxia.	18272	18349
27103577	High-fat feeding decreased cardiac [PCr] by 25% (P < 0.05) in normoxic mice, but [PCr] did not decrease further with hypoxia (Fig.	18350	18480
27103577	4E).	18481	18485
27103577	[ATP] was normal in normoxic high-fat–fed mouse hearts but was 31% (P < 0.05) lower in hearts from hypoxic high-fat–fed mice compared with chow-fed normoxic mice.	18486	18648
27103577	Total Cr was unaltered in normoxic high-fat–fed hearts but was 37% (P < 0.05) lower in hearts from high-fat–fed mice exposed to hypoxia.	18649	18785
27103577	[ADP]free was 55% (P < 0.05) higher in hearts from normoxic high-fat–fed mice compared with normoxic chow-fed mice and increased by a further 38% with hypoxia (P < 0.05).	18786	18956
27103577	High-fat feeding significantly lowered cardiac ΔGATP in all mouse hearts.	18957	19030
27103577	High-fat feeding under normoxia had no effect on cardiac function (Fig.	19031	19102
27103577	4F), whereas feeding a high-fat diet under hypoxia decreased in vivo cardiac output by 24% compared with normoxic chow (P < 0.01) or high-fat-fed (P < 0.05) mice.	19103	19265
27103577	This was a result of a 35% (P < 0.001) lower SV, accounted for by a 28% (P < 0.01) lower EDV and despite a significantly higher heart rate.	19266	19405
27103577	The cardiac index was decreased by 15% (P < 0.05), and ejection fractions were 12% (P < 0.02) lower than in normoxic chow-fed mice.	19406	19537
27103577	Hence, high-fat feeding prevented the adaptive molecular and metabolic responses to hypoxia that were observed in chow-fed mouse hearts, thereby causing cardiac dysfunction.	19538	19711
27103577	Having demonstrated that increased PPARα was associated with impaired function of the hypoxic heart, we next determined whether loss of PPARα altered cardiac metabolic and functional responses to hypoxia.	19712	19916
27103577	PPARα−/− mice were fed a chow diet and housed under hypoxia for 3 wk.	19917	19986
27103577	PPARα−/− mice had 13% (P < 0.05) lower body weight and 18% (P < 0.05) lower LV mass than wild-type mice, with neither altered by hypoxia (Supplemental Table 1).	19987	20147
27103577	Cardiac PPARα mRNA levels in PPARα−/− mice were negligible, although PPARδ mRNA and PPARγ, RXR, and PGC-1α protein levels were normal and unchanged by hypoxia (Fig.	20148	20312
27103577	5A and Supplemental Fig.	20313	20337
27103577	2).	1670	1673
27103577	Cardiac UCP3 protein (Fig.	20342	20368
27103577	5B) was 71% (P < 0.001) lower, and MTE-1 was 49% (P < 0.02) lower in PPARα−/− mouse hearts compared with wild-type mice, and both were unchanged by hypoxia.	20369	20525
27103577	Other key mitochondrial proteins were unaltered relative to wild-type mice (Supplemental Fig.	20526	20619
27103577	2).	1670	1673
27103577	PDK4 was 45% lower (P < 0.01), and MCAD protein was 43% (P < 0.001) lower in normoxic and hypoxic PPARα−/− mouse hearts.	20624	20744
27103577	PPARα−/− mouse hearts had 3-fold (P < 0.01) higher glycolytic rates than normoxic wild-type mouse hearts and were unaffected by hypoxia (Fig.	20745	20886
27103577	5C).	20887	20891
27103577	Glycolysis was not maximal following hypoxia, as stimulation with insulin doubled glycolytic rates in both normoxic and hypoxic PPARα−/− mouse hearts (Supplemental Fig.	20892	21060
27103577	4).	1014	1017
27103577	Lactate efflux from hypoxic PPARα−/− mouse hearts was 2-fold (P < 0.01) higher than from normoxic wild-type hearts and not different from normoxic PPARα−/− hearts.	21065	21228
27103577	Cardiac GLUT4 protein was similar in normoxic and hypoxic PPARα−/− mice.	21229	21301
27103577	Consistent with PPARα being a regulator of fatty acid metabolism, PPARα−/− mice had 24% lower (P < 0.05) cardiac fatty acid oxidation (Fig.	21302	21441
27103577	5D) than wild-type mice, which was unaltered by hypoxia.	21442	21498
27103577	Cardiac TAG content was increased by 45% (P < 0.05) in normoxic and hypoxic PPARα−/− mouse hearts.	21499	21597
27103577	Thus, the lack of PPARα prevented the metabolic changes that were observed in hypoxic wild-type mouse hearts.	21598	21707
27103577	In PPARα−/− mice, [PCr] was decreased by 43% (P < 0.001), although [ATP] was unaltered compared with normoxic wild-type mouse hearts (Fig.	21708	21846
27103577	5E).	21847	21851
27103577	Hypoxic cardiac [PCr] and [ATP] were decreased by 51% (P < 0.001) and 34% (P < 0.05), respectively, in PPARα−/− mice.	21852	21969
27103577	Total Cr was decreased by 20% (P < 0.001) in PPARα−/− mouse hearts with no effect of hypoxia.	21970	22063
27103577	As a consequence, [ADP]free was 2.7-fold (P < 0.05) higher and ΔGATP significantly lower in all PPARα−/− mouse hearts, and unaltered by hypoxia.	22064	22208
27103577	Normoxic PPARα−/− mice had normal cardiac function, but hypoxic PPARα−/− mice had 23% lower EDV (P < 0.01), 19% lower ESV (P < 0.05), 29% (P < 0.01) lower SV, and therefore, 20% lower cardiac output than normoxic wild-type mice (Fig.	22209	22442
27103577	5F).	22443	22447
27103577	Therefore, deletion of PPARα significantly altered myocardial substrate and energy metabolism and prevented any metabolic response to hypoxia, thereby impairing cardiac function.	22448	22626
27103577	To test whether high-fat feeding was operating via an alternative mechanism to PPARα regulation, PPARα−/− mice were fed a high-fat diet and housed in normoxia or hypoxia.	22627	22797
27103577	High-fat feeding had no effect on body weight or LV mass compared with chow-fed PPARα−/− mice (Supplemental Table 1).	22798	22915
27103577	Cardiac PPARα and PPARδ mRNA levels and PPARγ and RXR protein concentrations were unaltered by high fat feeding, being the same as in the chow-fed PPARα−/− mice, with no effect of hypoxia (Fig.	22916	23109
27103577	6A).	23110	23114
27103577	Cardiac UCP3, MTE-1, PDK4, and MCAD proteins were unaltered in PPARα−/− mice fed a high-fat diet compared with a chow diet, again unaffected by chronic hypoxia (Fig.	23115	23280
27103577	6B).	23281	23285
27103577	Cardiac metabolism in PPARα−/− mice was also unaltered by either high-fat feeding with or without (Fig.	23286	23389
27103577	6C, D).	23390	23397
27103577	Cardiac output in PPARα−/− mice fed a high-fat diet was 29% lower than chow-fed PPARα−/− mice (P < 0.01) and 18% lower with hypoxia (P < 0.01), similar to chow-fed PPARα−/− mice exposed to chronic hypoxia (Fig.	23398	23608
27103577	6E).	23609	23613
27103577	Cardiac index was 29% lower in PPARα−/− mice fed a high-fat diet vs. chow, with no effect of hypoxia (P < 0.01).	23614	23726
27103577	Ejection fraction was 6% lower in high-fat–fed PPARα−/− mice and unaltered by hypoxia (P < 0.05).	23727	23824
27103577	Therefore, PPARα ablation nullified the metabolic flexibility seen in healthy mice fed a high-fat diet, resulting in impaired cardiac function and unaffected by hypoxia.	23825	23994
27103577	To investigate the weight loss observed in wild-type hypoxic mice fed a high-fat diet (Supplemental Table 1), energy intake was measured during the 3-wk protocol.	23995	24157
27103577	Food consumption was not affected by hypoxia or by the high-fat diet (Fig.	24158	24232
27103577	7A).	24233	24237
27103577	However, as a result of higher calorific value, there was a 28% (P < 0.05) higher energy intake on the high-fat diet, which again was unaffected by hypoxia.	24238	24394
27103577	Cardiac levels of UCP3 and MTE-1 were elevated by high-fat feeding (Fig.	24395	24467
27103577	4B), suggesting that skeletal muscle UCPs responded to the high-fat diet in a similar manner, thereby contributing to body-weight loss in hypoxia.	24468	24614
27103577	UCP3 protein levels in skeletal (gastrocnemius) muscle were 26% (P < 0.05) lower after 3 wk of hypoxia (Fig.	24615	24723
27103577	7B and Supplemental Fig.	24724	24748
27103577	5), a similar response to that in cardiac muscle (Fig.	24749	24803
27103577	3B).	15679	15683
27103577	As found in cardiac muscle, UCP3 levels in skeletal muscle increased with high-fat feeding compared with chow-fed controls (P < 0.001) and were not altered by hypoxia.	24809	24976
27103577	Skeletal muscle MTE-1 protein levels showed identical responses to those of UCP3, being 34% (P < 0.05) lower in hypoxic, chow-fed mice and 71% (P < 0.001) higher after high-fat feeding with/without hypoxia.	24977	25183
27103577	PDK4 protein levels increased by 55% (P < 0.01) during high-fat feeding, which again prevented the adaptive responses to hypoxia.	25184	25313
27103577	Having established that adaptation to cardiac hypoxia was regulated by PPARα, we used confluent, beating HL-1 cardiac cells to investigate whether such adaptations were directly linked to the HIF system.	25314	25517
27103577	Cells were exposed to hypoxia (2% O2) for 24 h, or the HIF system was chemically induced using 24 h incubation with the selective prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, IOX3 (33).	25518	25688
27103577	Hypoxia caused a 5-fold increase in HIF-1α (P < 0.001) and a 72% increase in HIF-2α (P < 0.05) protein levels (Fig.	25689	25804
27103577	8A and Supplemental Fig.	25805	25829
27103577	5).	1182	1185
27103577	IOX3 was a more potent activator of the HIF system than hypoxia, with a 9-fold increase in HIF-1α (P < 0.001) and doubling of HIF-2α (P < 0.01) protein levels after 24 h incubation.	25834	26015
27103577	Under HIF-1α control, VEGF mRNA increased by 37% (P < 0.05) in hypoxia and 59% (P < 0.001) with IOX3.	26016	26117
27103577	PDK1 protein levels increased 34% in hypoxia (P < 0.05) and 86% with IOX3 treatment (P < 0.01).	26118	26213
27103577	GLUT1 protein levels increased by 48% (P < 0.02) with hypoxia and 3-fold (P < 0.01) with IOX3.	26214	26308
27103577	Hypoxia decreased PPARα mRNA by 23% (P < 0.01) in HL-1 cells (Fig.	26309	26375
27103577	8B), similar to that caused by in vivo hypoxia in the intact heart.	26376	26443
27103577	IOX3 produced a similar, 25% decrease in PPARα mRNA (P < 0.001).	26444	26508
27103577	PPARδ mRNA levels were unaffected by hypoxia or IOX3.	26509	26562
27103577	PPARγ mRNA levels were not altered by hypoxia but were doubled (P < 0.001) after IOX3 incubation.	26563	26660
27103577	In cultured cardiac cells, PPARα-controlled mRNA expression was altered by hypoxia in a similar manner as the respective protein in the in vivo hypoxic heart (Fig.	26661	26824
27103577	8C).	26825	26829
27103577	UCP3 levels were lowered by 27% (P < 0.01) by hypoxia but were not altered by IOX3.	26830	26913
27103577	MCAD levels were 31% (P < 0.001) lower after hypoxia and 17% (P < 0.01) lower after IOX3.	26914	27003
27103577	PDK4 levels were unaffected by hypoxia or IOX3.	27004	27051
27103577	In this study, we have demonstrated that normobaric hypoxia in mice decreased myocardial PPARα expression, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial UCP3 and increased carbohydrate metabolism; such changes allowed normoxic [ATP] and contractile function to be maintained.	27052	27321
27103577	Genetic ablation of PPARα in mice caused metabolic changes in the normoxic mouse heart that were already at the extreme of hypoxic adaptation and therefore, could not be altered by hypoxia.	27322	27511
27103577	A high-fat diet increased mouse heart PPARα expression and prevented PPARα down-regulation by hypoxia.	27512	27614
27103577	Thus, with high-fat feeding, the cardiac proteins under PPARα control (UCP3, MTE-1, PDK4, and MCAD) and fatty acid oxidation increased, whereas GLUT4 levels and glycolysis decreased; metabolic changes that remained in hypoxia.	27615	27841
27103577	Consequently, the high-fat diet plus 3 wk exposure to hypoxia significantly decreased myocardial [ATP], cardiac index, and ejection fraction.	27842	27983
27103577	To our knowledge, this is the first time that an increase in a dietary constituent, fat, has been shown to cause myocardial dysfunction in hypoxia, a finding that may have implications for altitude exposure (34) or heart failure (in which similar metabolic changes, the “fetal gene program,” occur) (1, 28, 35, 36).	27984	28299
27103577	However, the human diet typically contains ∼30% fat and probably seldom the 7.5 or 55% fat used in the mouse diets.	28300	28415
27103577	PPARα down-regulation and substrate switching are essential for the maintenance of contractile function of the hypertrophied heart (37), and there have been reports of decreased PPARα expression in the heart following in vivo hypoxia (24, 26–28).	28416	28662
27103577	In our mice, PPARα appeared to be the sole PPAR isoform involved in the myocardial metabolic changes, as neither PPARδ nor PPARγ levels changed.	28663	28807
27103577	In agreement with findings in human skeletal muscle at altitude (38), there were no changes in PGC-1α nor were cardiac RXR protein levels decreased significantly by hypoxia.	28808	28981
27103577	In cultured cardiomyocytes, however, others have demonstrated decreased hypoxia-induced PPARα/RXR DNA binding as a result of decreased RXR (39) or increased HIF-1α (24) levels.	28982	29158
27103577	PPARα has been linked to hypoxic adaptation in high-altitude tolerant humans (19), and simulated hypoxia, using cobalt chloride to inhibit prolyl hydroxylases (40), decreased PPARα mRNA (9), suggesting regulation of PPARα via the HIF system.	29159	29400
27103577	Certainly, in beating cardiomyocytes, we found that hypoxia or prolyl hydroxylase inhibition increased HIF-1α and HIF-2α, and decreased PPARα, MCAD, and UCP3 expression; beneficial adaptations to hypoxia (41).	29401	29610
27103577	Yet, studies of the HIF complex in transgenic (23) or knockout mouse hearts (21, 22, 26) or skeletal muscle (25) have yielded apparently conflicting (and confusing) results, in that decreased HIF-1β (21), HIF-1α (22, 23), or HIF-2α (21) or increased HIF-1α (26) or HIF-2α (25) are reported to increase (21, 23, 25) or not alter (22) PPARα or decrease PPARγ (22) expression with increased (21), or no change in (25), fatty acid oxidation.	29611	30048
27103577	Of course, these are not studies on the metabolic effects of hypoxia, but on the contribution of individual constituents of the HIF pathway to changes in metabolism via the PPAR transcription factors.	30049	30249
27103577	So, both increased (25) and decreased (21) HIF-2α increased PPARα expression, whereas decreased HIF-1α increased either PPARα (23) or PPARγ (22) expression.	30250	30406
27103577	It is difficult to compare such studies, as few and rarely the same measures of myocardial metabolism or function have been made, and seldom using the same techniques.	30407	30574
27103577	However, most studies reported the deposition of lipids in the heart (21–23, 26) or cardiomyocytes (24), whether HIF-1α was increased (24, 26) or decreased (22, 23).	30575	30740
27103577	We also found increased TAG in all hypoxic mouse hearts, whether PPARα levels and fatty acid oxidation were increased or decreased and unrelated to the effects of hypoxia on contractile function.	30741	30936
27103577	Indeed, both the high-fat–fed and the PPARα−/− mouse hearts had high TAG levels in normoxia that were unaltered by hypoxia, suggesting that more fatty acids were taken up than could be oxidized and that lipid deposits per se do not cause cardiac injury.	30937	31190
27103577	Carbohydrate metabolism was increased with hypoxia, but high-fat feeding prevented this potentially adaptive mechanism.	31191	31310
27103577	GLUT4 was down-regulated with activation of PPARα via high-fat feeding and was unaltered by chronic hypoxia.	31311	31419
27103577	Consistent with this finding, PPARα overexpression is known to repress GLUT4 mRNA (15), and we have shown that cardiac GLUT4 content is reduced in obesity (42).	31420	31580
27103577	Lower GLUT4 levels may have contributed to cardiac dysfunction when hypoxia was combined with a high-fat diet, preventing increased carbohydrate metabolism and resulting in lower cardiac [ATP] in hypoxic mice.	31581	31790
27103577	Ventricular mass was lower in chronically hypoxic mice, resulting in cardiac hypotrophy.	31791	31879
27103577	This reflects human studies of altitude exposure in sea-level natives (12).	31880	31955
27103577	The stimulus for such reduction in LV mass, in the absence of loss of body weight, may be a requirement to improve oxygen diffusion distances in tissue with a sustained, high-oxygen demand (43).	31956	32150
27103577	The molecular mechanisms associated with such loss of cardiac muscle are incompletely understood but may involve a reversal of the hypertrophic mechanisms associated with physiologic hypertrophy (44).	32151	32351
27103577	In hypoxic mice fed a high-fat diet, whereas absolute LV mass fell in hypoxia, cardiac hypotrophy was not evident, as hypoxic high-fat–fed animals also lost body weight.	32352	32521
27103577	The molecular mechanisms for this weight loss are unclear; however, all groups of PPARα−/− mice in this study were smaller than wild-type littermates, which potentially implicates PPARα in the regulation of body weight.	32522	32741
27103577	Not only did hypoxia decrease PPARα mRNA levels and PPARα downstream targets—UCP3, MTE-1, and MCAD protein levels—in the heart, but also in skeletal muscle.	32742	32898
27103577	In contrast to the increased PPARα observed in skeletal muscle in the PHD1−/− mouse (25), the decrease in PPARα expression is in agreement with findings in human skeletal muscle at an altitude in which UCP3 levels and β-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, a β-oxidation enzyme and PPARα target, were down-regulated (38).	32899	33221
27103577	The adaptation to hypoxia via changes in PPARα expression, observed here in heart and skeletal muscle, may be relevant to other organs that have high PPARα expression, such as liver, kidney, and intestine (45).	33222	33432
27103577	As in the heart, we found that the high-fat diet increased (and prevented any hypoxia-induced decrease in) UCP3, MTE-1, and PDK4 in mouse skeletal muscle.	33433	33587
27103577	Although the high-fat–fed mice consumed 28% more calories than those on the chow diet, they did not gain weight, possibly owing to energy wastage via increased mitochondrial uncoupling (3).	33588	33777
27103577	The normobaric, hypoxia-induced decrease in cardiac PCr in our mice has been shown in the human heart as a decrease in PCr/ATP, measured using in vivo MRS: in lowlanders following a trek to Mount Everest Base Camp (12) and in Sherpa volunteers, even after 4 wk of de-acclimation at low altitudes (11).	33778	34079
27103577	The decreased cardiac PCr/ATP in the Sherpa hearts was attributed to the requirement for a higher [ADP]free, to be closer to the Km of 110 μM (46) for ADP-requiring PK activity in glycolysis, reflecting the elevated contribution of carbohydrate-to-myocardial energy needs (7, 11).	34080	34360
27103577	Such a mechanism may be related to a decrease in PPARα levels via high-altitude adaptation of the PPARA gene in Tibetans (19) and could explain why the highest [ADP]free occurred in the highly glycolytic PPARα−/− mouse hearts in normoxia and hypoxia.	34361	34611
27103577	However, a genetic adaptation cannot explain the 18% decrease in myocardial PCr/ATP and diastolic dysfunction in human lowlanders after a trek to Mount Everest (12), which may have been exacerbated by the hypobaria and a result of the requirement for increased [ADP]free, plus the insulin resistance and elevated epinephrine observed in the same cohort (47).	34612	34970
27103577	[ADP]free is a key metabolite controlling oxidative phosphorylation (4), so it is possible that the decrease in PCr in the hypoxic mouse hearts was a result of the need for higher [ADP]free to stimulate mitochondrial respiration and to increase glycolytic flux.	34971	35232
27103577	The requirement for oxygen would have been decreased in the hypoxic hearts by the decrease in both fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial uncoupling, with increased flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase and increased glucose oxidation, all of which allowed [ATP] and contractile function to remain at normoxic levels.	35233	35548
27103577	In the mice fed a high-fat diet in normoxia, myocardial PCr decreased with no loss of total Cr to maintain normal ATP levels and cardiac function despite the increased oxygen required for fatty acid oxidation and increased oxygen wastage via mitochondrial uncoupling.	35549	35816
27103577	Such changes with high-fat diets have been observed in human (48) and rat hearts associated with decreased efficiency (3).	35817	35939
27103577	However, when the oxygen supply was restricted, the combination of greater oxygen requirement for fatty acid oxidation, plus oxygen wastage via increased mitochondrial UCP3 proteins, significantly decreased ATP, cardiac index, and ejection fraction.	35940	36189
27103577	Likewise, mice with a cardiac-specific ARNT ablation had increased PPARα expression and fatty acid oxidation with decreased ejection fraction (21).	36190	36337
27103577	The metabolic changes caused by hypoxia in wild-type mouse hearts were found to have occurred already in normoxic PPARα−/− mouse hearts and did not change further with hypoxia.	36338	36514
27103577	PPARα−/− mouse hearts maintained normal cardiac index and ejection fractions in hypoxia, owing to high [ADP]free, high glycolytic flux, low PDK4 (suggesting increased pyruvate dehydrogenase flux and glucose oxidation), low fatty acid oxidation, and low mitochondrial UCP3 and MTE-1 levels, all of which would have resulted in the most efficient use of any available oxygen.	36515	36888
27103577	Thus, metabolism in the normoxic PPARα−/− mouse heart may be viewed as at the extreme of hypoxic adaptation, which increases resistance to ischemia (49, 50), but may not support a high workload (51) with greater hypertrophy and functional impairment following aortic constriction (52).	36889	37174
27103577	It is possible that the PPARα−/− mouse hearts may have had decreased ejection fractions, in addition to the lower cardiac output and higher heart rates, with a longer duration of hypoxia.	37175	37362
27103577	As metabolism in PPARα−/− mouse hearts was at the limit of hypoxic adaptation during normoxia, with no response to hypoxia, the use of PPARα−/− mice to validate PPARα as a HIF target is questionable.	37363	37562
27103577	For example, knockout mice with decreased HIF-2α (HIF-1β−/−) (21), increased HIF-2α (Phd1−/−) (25), and decreased HIF-1α [NADPH oxidase deficient (Tg Nox−/−) transgenic mice] (22) had their metabolic phenotypes reversed in a double knockout made by crossing with PPARα−/− mice.	37563	37840
27103577	In summary, we propose that decreased myocardial PPARα expression is central to the metabolic changes required to maintain contractile function in hypoxia.	37841	37996
27103577	A high-fat diet increased PPARα expression, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial UCP levels—changes that were tolerated in normoxia, but decreased ATP and impaired cardiac function in hypoxia.	37997	38192
27103577	Finally, the metabolic changes in normoxic PPARα−/− mouse heart can be viewed as at the extreme of hypoxic metabolic adaptation, in that they have no metabolic response to hypoxia.	38193	38373
25550469	Circulating levels of testosterone, the main androgen, in females are approximately 1/10th of the levels in males.	0	114
25550469	In women, androgens are secreted by both ovaries and adrenals, but in female mice, the ovaries are the dominant producers of androgens.	115	250
25550469	In women, as in men, testosterone levels slowly decline with increasing age.	251	327
25550469	Low androgen levels may also be caused, for example, by bilateral ovariectomy, hypopituitarism, and glucocorticosteroid use, whereas androgen levels are not significantly altered across menopause (1).Substantial evidence from both human and rodent studies indicates that androgens exert important effects on atherosclerosis, body composition, and metabolism in males (2–5).	328	701
25550469	By contrast, the physiologic metabolic actions of androgens in females are poorly understood (1), and the ongoing debate concerning the possible existence of an androgen deficiency syndrome in women has mainly focused on well-being and sexual function (6, 7).	702	961
25550469	The coexistence of excess androgen production and a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia), as well as increased atherosclerosis (8), in polycystic ovary syndrome has favored the idea that androgens exert adverse metabolic effects in women (9, 10).Studies on the role of androgens in females are hampered by, for example, the concomitant loss of androgens and estrogens following ovariectomy and difficulties in assessing low serum levels of androgens in females, as well as determining appropriate doses for androgen replacement (1, 11).	962	1554
25550469	The physiologic effects of androgens are mostly mediated by activation of the ubiquitously expressed androgen receptor (AR) (12), and the development of female AR knockout (ARKO) mice has provided a valuable tool for studying the role of androgens in females (13).To determine the physiologic AR-dependent actions of androgens on the development of atherosclerosis in females, we generated female ARKO and control mice on an atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (apoE)–deficient background.Because of the vital importance of the AR in male fertility, Cre/loxP technology (14) was used to obtain female ARKO and control mice on an atherosclerosis-prone apoE-deficient background (AR−/−apoE−/− and AR+/+apoE−/−, respectively).	1555	2281
25550469	Mice expressing Cre recombinase ubiquitously and from an early embryonic stage under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase-1 promoter (PGK-Cre) (15) and mice with floxed AR exon 2 (floxAR) (14) were backcrossed to a C57BL/6 background (Charles River Laboratories) for ≥6 generations and then crossed with apoE−/− (C57BL/6 background, model APOE-M; Taconic Europe A/S, Lille Skensved, Denmark) to obtain a homozygous apoE−/− background.	2282	2722
25550469	Because of the location of the AR on the X chromosome, the infertility of AR−/Y males (14), and the fact that Cre activity starts in the diploid phase of oogenesis in PGK-Cre-expressing females and thereby causes complete recombination in Cre- offspring (15), the breeding was performed as follows: AR+/floxapoE−/− female mice and Cre+/+apoE−/− male mice were crossed to obtain heterozygous AR+/−Cre+/−apoE−/− female offspring.	2723	3150
25550469	These AR+/−Cre+/−apoE−/− females were mated with ARflox/YapoE−/− males to generate AR−/−apoE−/− (ARKO) females.	3151	3262
25550469	Female AR+/+apoE−/− (control) mice were generated by mating AR+/−Cre+/−apoE−/− females with AR+/YapoE−/− males.	3263	3374
25550469	Because Cre expression itself did not affect the metabolic phenotype and there were similar effects on atherosclerosis by ARKO in Cre+ and Cre− mice, Cre+ and Cre− animals were pooled in both the ARKO and control groups.	3375	3595
25550469	We assessed AR (14), Cre (14), and apoE (protocol from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) genotypes using PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the tail.The mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 6:00 am to 6:00 pm light cycle and fed diet and tap water ad libitum.	3596	3903
25550469	All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Care and Use in Gothenburg and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.Female ARKO and control mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) after weaning and, in separate experiments, an NCD or a high-fat diet (HFD; #821424, 21% fat from lard, 0.15% cholesterol; Special Diets Services, Essex, United Kingdom) from 8 to 16 weeks of age.	3904	4358
25550469	Some mice were kept on an NCD until 34 weeks of age.Prepubertal female ARKO and control mice (23–25 days old) were anesthetized with isoflurane (Baxter Medical AB, Kista, Sweden) and bilaterally ovariectomized.	4359	4569
25550469	From 8 to 16 weeks of age, the mice were fed an HFD as described in Protocol 1.Eight-week-old female apoE-deficient mice (Taconic Europe A/S) were bilaterally ovariectomized and implanted subcutaneously with a small slow-release pellet containing placebo or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) releasing 2.5 mg/90 days (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA).	4570	4931
25550469	From 8 to 16 weeks of age, the mice were fed an HFD as described in Protocol 1.Prepubertal male apoE-deficient mice (23–25 days old) were anesthetized with isoflurane and sham-operated or bilaterally orchiectomized.	4932	5147
25550469	From 8 to 16 weeks of age, the mice were fed an HFD as described in Protocol 1.	4570	4649
25550469	Total RNA was extracted from the liver as described below.At the study end, the circulatory system was perfused with 0.9% saline (pH 7.4) under physiologic pressure.	5228	5393
25550469	The entire aorta was dissected out from the heart to the iliac bifurcation and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.	5394	5502
25550469	For en face analysis, the aortas were dissected free from connective and adipose tissue, cut open longitudinally, and pinned flat on silicone-coated dishes.	5503	5659
25550469	The aortas were stained for lipids using Sudan IV, and images were captured.	5660	5736
25550469	The outline of the aortic surface and lesions were defined manually by a blinded observer, and lesion areas were computed by an image analysis program (BioPix Software, Göteborg, Sweden).	5737	5924
25550469	The extent of atherosclerosis was expressed as the percentage of the aortic surface covered by lesions.	5925	6028
25550469	Results were calculated for the aortic arch (from the brachiocephalic trunk to the first intercostal arteries), the thoracic aorta (from the first to the last intercostal arteries), the abdominal aorta (from the last intercostal arteries to the aortic bifurcation), and the whole aorta, respectively.Serial 10 μm cryosections were cut distally from the aortic root.	6029	6394
25550469	Sections were stained (200, 400, and 600 µm after the appearance of the aortic cusps) with Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Masson´s trichrome (Accustain Trichrome Stains–Masson; from Sigma-Aldrich).	6395	6611
25550469	For immunohistochemical staining of macrophages, aortic root cryosections (160 μm from the aortic cusps) were incubated with rat anti-mouse Mac-2 antibody (1:1000; Cedarlane, Hornby, BC, Canada) or isotype control antibody (1:1000; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), followed by horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (1:1000; GE Healthcare, London, United Kingdom) and visualized with the DAB substrate kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).	6612	7075
25550469	The areas of Oil red O staining, Mac-2 staining, and collagen staining (blue color in Masson’s trichrome) were determined using morphometric analysis (BioPix Software) and normalized to the size of the atherosclerotic lesion.	7076	7301
25550469	Lesion complexity (presence/absence of necrotic core) was evaluated in sections stained with Masson´s trichrome (200 μm from the aortic cusps).Body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar PIXImus 2 mouse densitometer; GE Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).	7302	7588
25550469	The head region was excluded from analysis following the manufacturer’s recommendations.	7589	7677
25550469	Lean, bone, and fat mass, as well as body fat percentage, were calculated by the Lunar PIXImus 2 2.10 software (GE Lunar Corporation).All blood samples were collected from random-cycling mice after 3–4 hours of fasting.	7678	7897
25550469	Blood was collected in serum gel tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany), and serum was obtained and stored at −80°C.	7898	8012
25550469	Serum levels of estradiol were analyzed using a radioimmunoassay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA).	8013	8131
25550469	Serum testosterone levels were measured by a radioimmunoassay after diethylether extraction (16).	8132	8229
25550469	Levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and serum glucose were analyzed by colorimetric assays using Infinity reagents (TR13421, TR22421, and TR15421; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).	8230	8423
25550469	The distribution of lipids within the plasma lipoprotein fractions was assessed in pooled serum (6 mice per pool) by fast-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration using a Superose 6HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) (17).	8424	8663
25550469	Insulin levels were measured using a mouse insulin ELISA (Ultra Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA; Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL, USA).Liver samples were homogenized with isopropanol using stainless steel beads (5 mm; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a TissueLyser II (Qiagen), kept for 1 hour at 4°C, and centrifuged for 5 minutes (2500 rpm, 4°C), and the supernatants were collected.	8664	9042
25550469	The triglyceride levels in the supernatants were analyzed using an Infinity reagent (Triglycerides #TR22421; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the amount of triglycerides was normalized to liver sample weights.The mice were given an intraperitoneal injection (0.25 U/kg in mice fed a normal chow diet; 0.5 U/kg body weight in HFD-fed mice) of insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark), and blood glucose was determined in serial blood samples from the tail vein using the HemoCue Glucose system (HemoCue, Ängelholm, Sweden).	9043	9574
25550469	The mice were fasted prior to the insulin injection and during the measurements until the 120-minute time point.The mice were given an intraperitoneal injection (2 mg/kg body weight in 0.9% saline) of d-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), and blood glucose was determined in serial blood samples from the tail as described above.	9575	9893
25550469	The mice were fasted prior to the injection of glucose and during the test.The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Baxter Medical AB), and a Samba transducer catheter (Samba Sensors, Gothenburg, Sweden) was placed into the left carotid artery for measurements of diastolic, systolic, and mean arterial pressure, as well as heart rate.	9894	10232
25550469	We collected data using a PowerLab data acquisition unit together with LabChart software (ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia), averaged over a period of 2 minutes, following stabilization of the arterial pressure trace.The spontaneous locomotor activity was measured for 4 hours using open-field 50 × 50 cm plexiglas cages fitted with infrared beams (Kungsbacka Mät och Reglerteknik AB, Fjärås, Sweden).	10233	10634
25550469	Activity counts were recorded each time a mouse broke an infrared beam.	10635	10706
25550469	Rectal body temperatures were recorded in anesthetized mice (isoflurane; Baxter Medical AB).	10707	10799
25550469	Food intake was measured individually over 24 hours.	10800	10852
25550469	Indirect calorimetry was analyzed at room temperature (21°C) using an indirect open circuit calorimeter (Somedic INCA; Somedic sales AB, Hörby, Sweden).	10853	11005
25550469	Briefly, the mice were placed in the individual cages in the specifically designed calorimeter chambers with a 6:00 am to 6:00 pm light cycle and ad libitum access to food and water for 24 hours.Cryosections of mesenteric adipose tissue were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and images were captured.	11006	11305
25550469	The plasma membranes of individual adipocytes were defined manually by a blinded observer, and adipocyte surface areas were computed by an image analysis program (BioPix Software).	11306	11486
25550469	An average of 300 adipocytes per mouse was analyzed.McArdle rat hepatoma cells (McA-RH 7777; LGC Standards AB, Borås, Sweden) were cultured in MEM (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Linz, Austria) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, South Logan, UT, USA).	11487	11752
25550469	For assessment of intracellular lipids, the cells were plated in 24-well plates containing glass coverslips and grown in MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum.	11753	11905
25550469	After 24 hours, the medium was changed to MEM without fetal bovine serum plus 0, 20, or 60 µM oleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and after 48 hours, the cells were treated with 1 nM DHT (dissolved in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle for 24 hours.	11906	12147
25550469	In separate experiments, the medium was changed to MEM without fetal bovine serum plus 60 µM oleic acid 24 hours after plating, and after 48 hours, the cells were treated with 1 nM DHT, 10 μM enzalutamide (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA), or vehicle for 24 hours.	12148	12410
25550469	Cells were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 5 minutes, treated with 20% isopropanol for 0.5 minutes, and stained with Oil Red O for 20 minutes.	12411	12555
25550469	Next, cells were treated with 20% isopropanol for 0.5 minutes, stained with hematoxylin for 2 minutes, and finally rinsed in tap and distilled water.	12556	12705
25550469	Cells were photographed with a Zeiss microscope and Oil Red O–stained area per cell was quantified by BioPix iQ 2.1.8 software (BioPix Software).Analysis of hepatic triglyceride secretion was performed as previously described (18).	12706	12937
25550469	Briefly, McA-RH 7777 cells were grown in MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum.	12938	13010
25550469	After 24 hours, the medium was changed to MEM without fetal bovine serum plus 20 µM oleic acid, and after 48 h, DHT (10 nM) or vehicle was added for 24 hours.	13011	13169
25550469	Cells were then incubated for 10 hours with [3H]glycerol (0.6 μCi/ml of culture medium; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) to trace triglycerides.	13170	13313
25550469	Release of [3H]glycerol was chased in cold medium, and lipids were extracted in Folch solution (chloroform/methanol 2:1).	13314	13435
25550469	Triglycerides were separated by thin layer chromatography on silica plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using a 2-phase system [first phase, chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4 v/v); second phase, petroleumether:diethylether:acetic acid (80:20:1 v/v)], and [3H]glycerol was measured by scintillation counting (BeckMan Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).Apolipoprotein B secretion was analyzed as previously described (19).	13436	13850
25550469	Briefly, McA-RH 7777 cells were incubated with MEM containing 2% fetal calf serum and 20 μM oleic acid.	13851	13954
25550469	After 24 hours, 10 nM DHT or vehicle was added for 24 hours.	13955	14015
25550469	Next, cells were incubated for 2 h with methionine-free medium (Sigma-Aldrich), pulse-labeled for 20 min with [35S] methionine (Perkin Elmer), and chased with cold medium for 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes.	14016	14222
25550469	Apolipoprotein B-100 and apolipoprotein B-48 were immunoprecipitated from the medium at each time point using a polyclonal anti-APOB apolipoprotein B antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and Pansorbin cells (Merck).	14223	14436
25550469	SDS-PAGE was carried out overnight at +4°C, 24 mA, on a 5% polyacrylamide gel.	14437	14515
25550469	The gel was exposed to a phosphor-screen, and bands were observed using Fuji FLA-3000 PhosphorImager and quantified using MultiGauge 2.0.Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen liver using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).	14516	14731
25550469	cDNA was synthesized using the high capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with random primers.	14732	14871
25550469	mRNA expression of genes of interest was analyzed with TaqMan real-time PCR in an ABI Prism 7900 HT Detection System (Applied Biosystems).	14872	15010
25550469	The following TaqMan Gene Expression assays were used: Ldlr mm00440169_m1; Vldlr mm00443281_m1; Pcsk9 mm00463738_m1; Scarb1 mm00450236_m1; Cpt1a mm00550438_m1; Mttp mm00435015_m1; Sort1 mm00490905_m1; ApoC3 mm00445670_m1; Nr1h3 (LXRα) mm00443451_m1; Srebf1 mm00550338_m1; and Srebf2 mm01306262_m1.	15011	15308
25550469	18S (Applied Biosystems) was used as an internal control.Statistical evaluations were performed with SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).	15309	15463
25550469	All variables were tested for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk normality test).	15464	15544
25550469	For variables that were normally distributed with or without log transformation, 2 group comparisons were performed by Student’s t test and 4 group comparisons by 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test.	15545	15754
25550469	Other (nonparametric) data were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test (2 groups).	15755	15835
25550469	Frequencies were compared by χ2 test.	15836	15873
25550469	P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.We evaluated atherosclerotic lesion formation in en face-mounted aortas of 16-week-old female control and ARKO mice on an apoE-deficient background fed either an NCD or an HFD from 8 weeks of age.	15874	16120
25550469	Lesion area in the whole aorta, aortic arch, thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta did not differ between ARKO and control females fed an NCD (Fig.	16121	16266
25550469	1).	525	528
25550469	By contrast, after 8 weeks on HFD, the lesion area in the whole aorta was increased by 59% in ARKO compared with control mice (Fig.	16271	16402
25550469	1A, B).	16403	16410
25550469	The lesion area was significantly increased in the aortic arch (+67%) and the abdominal aorta (+70%), but not in the thoracic aorta (Fig.	16411	16548
25550469	1C).	16549	16553
25550469	There were no differences in plaque complexity (the presence/absence of a necrotic core) or composition (area of collagen and macrophage staining) in the aortic root between the genotypes in mice fed HFD (Supplemental Table S1).Because endogenous androgens are derived solely from the ovaries in female mice (20), we postulated that the observed difference in atherosclerosis between ARKO and control mice fed an HFD would be abolished in ovariectomized mice.	16554	17013
25550469	Indeed, we observed similar levels of atherosclerosis in HFD-fed ARKO and control mice that were ovariectomized before puberty (Fig.	17014	17146
25550469	1D).We also evaluated endogenous hormone production in 16-week-old ovarian-intact mice fed an HFD.	17147	17245
25550469	Serum estradiol levels were similar in ARKO and control mice, whereas serum testosterone levels were higher in female ARKO mice (Supplemental Table S2).	17246	17398
25550469	The weights of uterus and ovaries did not differ between ARKO and controls (Supplemental Table S2).Between 4 and 16 weeks of age, body weight did not differ between ARKO and control females fed an NCD (Fig.	17399	17605
25550469	2A).	17606	17610
25550469	However, body weight was significantly higher in ARKO mice after 4 (+11%), 6, and 8 (+18%) weeks on an HFD (age 12, 14, and 16 weeks; Fig.	17611	17749
25550469	2A).	17606	17610
25550469	Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry confirmed an increase in fat mass (+101%; Fig.	17755	17834
25550469	2C) and body fat percentage (+62%; Fig.	17835	17874
25550469	2D) without any changes in absolute bone mass (data not shown) or lean body mass (Fig.	17875	17961
25550469	2B) in HFD-fed ARKO mice.	17962	17987
25550469	Further, the relative weights of dissected visceral and subcutaneous fat were increased in ARKO compared with control mice on an HFD (Fig.	17988	18126
25550469	2E, F).	18127	18134
25550469	There were no differences in fat mass, body fat percentage, visceral fat, or subcutaneous fat between ARKO and control mice fed an NCD (Fig.	18135	18275
25550469	2C–F).	18276	18282
25550469	Further, body weight (Fig.	18283	18309
25550469	2G) and visceral fat mass (25.1 ± 1.8 vs. 24.8 ± 0.7 mg/g body weight; P = not significant) were similar in HFD-fed ARKO and control mice that were ovariectomized before puberty.	18310	18488
25550469	We also monitored body weight of ARKO and control females fed an NCD until 34 weeks of age and found no difference in body weight during this time (body weight at 34 weeks: ARKO 31.4 ± 1.6 vs. control 31.8 ± 2.1 g, n = 7/group; P = not significant).	18489	18738
25550469	Despite the diet-induced obesity in female ARKO mice, we found no significant differences in locomotor activity, food intake, body temperature, oxygen consumption, or carbon dioxide production between ARKO and control females fed an HFD (Supplemental Fig.	18739	18994
25550469	S1A–E).We next investigated whether there were differences in serum lipid levels between female ARKO and control mice fed an HFD.	18995	19124
25550469	Indeed, serum total cholesterol levels were elevated by 52% and triglyceride levels by 44% in ARKO versus control mice after 8 weeks on an HFD (Fig.	19125	19273
25550469	3A), with a similar lipid distribution in lipoprotein fractions in the groups (Fig.	19274	19357
25550469	3B).	19358	19362
25550469	Further, hepatic triglyceride levels were increased in ARKO mice (Fig.	19363	19433
25550469	3C).	19434	19438
25550469	Both insulin and glucose tolerance were significantly impaired in ARKO compared with control females fed an HFD (Fig.	19439	19556
25550469	3D, E).	19557	19564
25550469	In line with an insulin-resistant phenotype, ARKO mice displayed enlarged mesenteric adipocytes after 8 weeks of an HFD (Fig.	19565	19690
25550469	3F).	19691	19695
25550469	In mice fed an NCD, there were no differences in either serum cholesterol and triglycerides (Fig.	19696	19793
25550469	3A) or insulin and glucose tolerance (Supplemental Fig.	19794	19849
25550469	S2A, B).	19850	19858
25550469	Further, HFD-fed ARKO and control mice that were ovariectomized before puberty displayed no differences in serum cholesterol or triglycerides (Supplemental Fig.	19859	20019
25550469	S2C).	20020	20025
25550469	Blood pressure did not differ between ARKO and control mice fed HFD (Supplemental Table S3).To confirm an atheroprotective action that is mediated via the AR in females, ovariectomized apoE-deficient mice were treated with the nonaromatizable AR agonist DHT or placebo for 8 weeks while simultaneously receiving an HFD.	20026	20345
25550469	DHT treatment reduced en face atherosclerotic lesion area in the thoracic aorta by 41% compared with placebo, whereas there was no significant effect in the aortic arch or the abdominal aorta (Fig.	20346	20543
25550469	4A).DHT also reduced the relative weight of subcutaneous (−44%) but not visceral fat (Fig.	20544	20634
25550469	4B).	20635	20639
25550469	Further, DHT increased skeletal muscle mass (Fig.	20640	20689
25550469	4C), and final body weight was not significantly different in DHT- versus placebo-treated mice (31.8 ± 0.9 vs. 29.7 ± 0.8 g, P = not significant).After both 2 and 8 weeks of an HFD, DHT decreased serum total cholesterol levels (by 35% and 26%, respectively; Fig.	20690	20952
25550469	4D).	20953	20957
25550469	By contrast, DHT did not affect serum triglyceride levels during the study (Fig.	20958	21038
25550469	4E).	21039	21043
25550469	Moreover, DHT treatment reduced fasting serum insulin levels after 8 weeks but not 2 weeks (Fig.	21044	21140
25550469	4F).	21141	21145
25550469	Blood glucose levels were unchanged at both time points (data not shown).Dyslipidemia is the most important risk factor leading to the development of atherosclerosis (21, 22) and is tightly coupled to alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism.	21146	21387
25550469	To study potential direct effects of androgens on hepatic lipid accumulation, we incubated McA RH-7777 hepatoma cells with DHT.	21388	21515
25550469	We found that DHT significantly reduced neutral lipid storage in hepatocytes (Fig.	21516	21598
25550469	5A).	21599	21603
25550469	This effect was blocked by concomitant treatment with the AR blocker enzalutamide (Fig 5B).As a major pathway for removal of hepatic lipids is the incorporation of triglycerides into very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and subsequent secretion, we hypothesized that DHT may affect this pathway.	21604	21900
25550469	We found an increase in the amount of secreted triglycerides (Fig.	21901	21967
25550469	5C) with no difference in the amount of apoB secreted from the cells (Supplemental Fig.	21968	22055
25550469	S3).We also measured levels of selected mRNAs that encode proteins involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in the livers of ovariectomized apoE-deficient female mice fed an HFD and treated with DHT or placebo.	22056	22272
25550469	Of 11 studied mRNAs, 3 were regulated by DHT: mRNA levels of ApoC3 (−25%) and Vldlr (−53%) were decreased and mRNA levels of Sort1 were increased (46%; Fig.	22273	22429
25550469	5D).	22430	22434
25550469	To study whether these genes are androgen regulated in males as in females, we analyzed mRNAs in the livers of intact and orchiectomized apoE-deficient male mice fed an HFD.	22435	22608
25550469	Although ApoC3 mRNA (+11%, P = not significant) was not regulated by castration in males, the castrated males showed a decrease in Sort1 mRNA (−26%, P < 0.001 by t test) and a strong increase in Vldlr mRNA (+784%, P < 0.001 by t test), in accordance with the results from DHT treatment in females.The physiologic metabolic actions of androgens in females are poorly understood.	22609	22986
25550469	The current study provides clear evidence that deletion of the AR in atherosclerosis-prone apoE-deficient female mice promotes the development of atherosclerosis, as well as obesity and dyslipidemia.This is the first study to investigate atherogenesis in an animal model of female AR deficiency.	22987	23282
25550469	Earlier studies to elucidate the effect of exogenous androgens on atherosclerosis in females report conflicting results (23–28).	23283	23411
25550469	An often-cited study reported that testosterone treatment of ovarian-intact female monkeys caused increased atherosclerosis (25); however, the treatment completely suppressed ovarian cyclicity, suggesting that a disturbed estrogen production may contribute to these results.	23412	23686
25550469	By contrast, a number of studies in ovariectomized female mice showed atheroprotection by testosterone (27, 28), and similar to our findings, 1 study showed that the nonaromatizable AR agonist DHT protected against atherosclerosis in female apoE-deficient mice (26), supporting the importance of the AR.	23687	23990
25550469	However, in all these earlier studies, pharmacologic doses of androgens were administered exogenously, and thus these studies do not provide information on the physiologic effects of endogenous androgens.In the present study, female AR deficiency resulted in increased atherosclerosis in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta with no significant difference in the thoracic aorta, whereas DHT treatment reduced atherosclerosis in the thoracic aorta only.	23991	24442
25550469	We speculate that this may be explained by regional differences in the kinetics of lesion development.	24443	24545
25550469	It is well known that lesions appear first in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta in the apoE-deficient mouse model (29).	24546	24667
25550469	Therefore, these areas may be more susceptible to factors operating early during atherogenesis (e.g., AR deficiency from embryonic stage) but less susceptible to atheroprotective factors operating in adult age (such as DHT treatment in this study) when complex atherosclerotic lesions have already developed in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta.Hypercholesterolemia is the most important risk factor for atherosclerosis and associated complications (21, 22).	24668	25128
25550469	In the present study, we found that AR deficiency increased serum lipid levels and atherosclerosis in female mice, whereas AR stimulation exerted the opposite actions.	25129	25296
25550469	Dyslipidemia in female mice with general AR deficiency has not been addressed previously.	25297	25386
25550469	In accordance with our data, previous studies report a reduction of serum lipid levels by exogenous androgens to both ovariectomized female mice (28, 30) and women (31).	25387	25556
25550469	Limited available data do not support beneficial effects of testosterone treatment on lipid profiles in postmenopausal women (32); however, dose and mode of administration, as well as background endogenous hormone production, may determine treatment effects (1, 32).It seems likely that the diet-induced obesity and associated metabolic complications, such as hepatic fat accumulation, contribute to an atherogenic dyslipidemia in female ARKO mice (22).	25557	26010
25550469	Using an in vitro model, we also show direct hepatic actions of a nonaromatizable AR agonist protecting hepatoma cells from lipid accumulation, in line with previous reports (33).	26011	26190
25550469	Interestingly, serum cholesterol levels were reduced shortly after the initiation of AR agonist treatment to female mice in vivo, and we observed hepatic regulation of genes pivotal for lipid homeostasis, encoding sortilin, VLDL receptor (VLDLr), and apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3), in these mice.	26191	26483
25550469	In accordance, we found that Sort1 and Vldlr, but not ApoC3 mRNAs were regulated by endogenous androgens (castration) in male mice.	26484	26615
25550469	Liver-specific sortilin overexpression may dramatically reduce cholesterol levels in mice, but basic studies report conflicting results on sortilin action (34).	26616	26776
25550469	The VLDLr mediates reuptake of VLDL into the liver, and downregulation of Vldlr may therefore contribute to protection from hepatic steatosis by androgens in vivo (35), although this mechanism may be less relevant in our apoE-deficient model.	26777	27019
25550469	Notably, DHT treatment to females in vivo downregulated ApoC3, a major component of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that reduces clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and is causally associated with atherogenesis (36, 37).	27020	27247
25550469	Although the regulation of ApoC3 mRNA was relatively modest (−25%) in our study, reduction of ApoC3 mRNA in this range was recently shown to effectively reduce lipid levels in mice (37).	27248	27434
25550469	Taken together, we propose that androgens reduce hepatic lipid accumulation by favoring a higher lipidation of VLDL with no changes in the total amount of secreted VLDL particles, as shown here in vitro.	27435	27638
25550469	These particles are in turn more effectively cleared from the circulation due to a relative decrease in apoC3.	27639	27749
25550469	In accordance with this notion, testosterone supplementation increased VLDL clearance in female apoE3-Leiden mice (30).	27750	27869
25550469	The clinical relevance of these data is supported by a study suggesting that testosterone supplementation may improve lipid profiles in ovariectomized women by decreasing the apoC3 concentration in lipoproteins (31).Our present results demonstrate that ARKO female mice display obesity when fed an HFD, but not an NCD.	27870	28188
25550469	This finding is in line with earlier studies that reported late-onset obesity and metabolic dysfunction in male (38, 39) but not female (38, 40–42) ARKO mice fed an NCD.	28189	28358
25550469	It is therefore clear that an HFD is required for the obese and metabolic phenotype in female ARKO mice, and possibly the apoE-deficient background of our mice and/or the lard content of the HFD further contributes to unmasking of the phenotype.	28359	28604
25550469	In comparison, we previously found increased atherosclerosis but less pronounced alterations in serum lipid levels and lower body weight in male apoE-deficient ARKO mice fed an HFD (5); these discrepancies may be partly explained by developmental defects in male ARKO mice (43).It remains a topic for future studies to determine the target organs for the metabolic effects of androgens in females.	28605	29002
25550469	Supporting the notion of the liver as a major target organ, male mice with liver-specific inactivation of the AR [hepatic androgen receptor knockout (H-ARKO)] develop diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and dyslipidemia (44).	29003	29253
25550469	Although the latter study reported no similar phenotype in female H-ARKO, it is conceivable that adjustment of experimental conditions (diet, mouse background) may reveal metabolic disturbances also in female H-ARKO.	29254	29470
25550469	Androgens may also exert direct AR-dependent effects on adipocyte differentiation and function (45), and hyperinsulinemia and visceral obesity are reported in male mice lacking the AR in adipose tissue (46), although others found no similar phenotypes (47).	29471	29728
25550469	In the present study, the weights of both visceral and subcutaneous fat depots were increased in ARKO females, whereas the AR agonist reduced the weight of subcutaneous, but not visceral, fat.	29729	29921
25550469	Androgens may affect adipocyte biology in a depot-specific manner (45), and several factors that differ between the two models (endogenous AR deficiency from embryonic stage vs. exogenous AR stimulation in adulthood, respectively) could potentially explain fat depot specificity.	29922	30201
25550469	Irrespective of mechanism, this discrepancy may indirectly support a role of AR actions at the adipose tissue level.In agreement with previous results (13), we found unchanged serum estradiol levels in female ARKO mice.	30202	30421
25550469	Further, uterus weight was unchanged, indicating that peripheral estrogen action is not disturbed in ARKO females.	30422	30536
25550469	Our finding of increased testosterone levels may suggest involvement of the AR in the feedback regulation of androgen production in females, as shown previously in males (48).	30537	30712
25550469	The increased testosterone levels are unlikely to contribute to the increased atherosclerosis in the ARKO females; testosterone should have mainly estrogenic effects in the absence of the AR (12), and exogenous testosterone reduces atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient females (28).	30713	30992
25550469	We also found that the observed difference in atherosclerosis between ARKO and control mice was abolished in ovariectomized mice.	30993	31122
25550469	This result is consistent with a protective action of endogenous androgens that is mediated via the AR, given that ovariectomy results in complete loss of endogenous androgens in female mice and that estrogen levels were unchanged in ARKO females.The main evidence in support of androgens exerting adverse metabolic effects in women is the fact that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (affecting 6–10% of all women) display both hyperandrogenism and an adverse metabolic risk profile with insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and increased atherosclerosis (8–10).	31123	31694
25550469	However, most evidence suggests that insulin resistance is central to the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome and that the androgen excess is secondary to compensatory hyperinsulinemia (49).	31695	31891
25550469	In line with our present results, several studies also report an association between low androgen levels and atherosclerosis in women (50–53).	31892	32034
25550469	Further, recent clinical studies have reported a U-shaped (54, 55) or an inverse (56, 57) association between androgen levels and cardiometabolic risk, consistent with a protective action by endogenous androgens in women.	32035	32256
25550469	In comparison, low androgen levels have been associated with both increased atherosclerosis and cardiometabolic risk in men (3, 4).To date, a definition of androgen deficiency in women is lacking (1, 6).	32257	32460
25550469	Consequently, the symptoms, signs, and clinical outcomes associated with androgen deficiency are not well characterized (1, 6), and the clinical recommendation regarding testosterone supplementation to women is an area of disagreement (7).	32461	32700
25550469	The results of the present study highlight the need for further studies on the cardiometabolic consequences of androgen deficiency and supplementation in women.In conclusion, we demonstrate that the AR confers protection against diet-induced atherosclerosis in female mice and propose that this is mediated by modulation of body composition and lipid metabolism.	32701	33063
25550469	Our results provide evidence that physiologic AR-dependent actions of androgens play a central metabolic role in females.	33064	33185
28411266	Sulfonylurea therapy remains a recommended adjunctive therapy to lifestyle modifications and metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes on the basis of low cost and efficacy in improving glycemic control (1,2).	0	213
28411266	However, the impact of sulfonylurea therapy on the risk of coronary heart disease or other cardiovascular outcomes remains uncertain.	214	347
28411266	Sulfonylurea initiation has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events in observational studies, an effect some have attributed to weight gain (3,4).	348	512
28411266	Importantly, owing to approval and marketing many years before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s call in 2008 for rigorous cardiovascular risk assessment of new antidiabetes therapies (5), an adequately powered cardiovascular outcomes trial was never performed.In the absence of gold-standard randomized clinical trial data, studies of naturally occurring genetic variation have emerged as a tool to anticipate clinical consequences of a therapy.	513	965
28411266	For example, a common variant near the HMGCR gene, the target of statins, was associated with decreased LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular event risk but an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (6,7).	966	1170
28411266	This finding was borne out in large clinical trials in which statin therapy led to reduced LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular events but an increase in incident type 2 diabetes (8).Sulfonylureas promote insulin release from pancreatic β-cells via binding to a hetero-octameric complex, with four subunits encoded by the ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 8 gene (ABCC8) and four by the Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily J Member 11 (KCNJ11).	1171	1632
28411266	The A amino acid allele at p.A1369S in ABCC8 has been associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes (9,10); the reciprocal S amino acid allele consequently lowers risk of type 2 diabetes, promotes closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in vitro (11), and is associated with higher insulin secretion after a glucose load (10), thus mimicking the effects of pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy.	1633	2035
28411266	Here, we aimed to determine the impact of such genetic variation on cardiometabolic traits and risk of coronary heart disease.We used individual-level data from 120,286 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort (12).	2036	2296
28411266	We supplemented this individual-level data with summary-level statistics from four genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia examining anthropometric traits, glycemic traits, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease, all predominantly containing individuals of European descent.The ABCC8 p.A1369S variant (rs757110) is inherited as a haplotype with a p.E23K variant (rs5219) in KCNJ11 (the additional subunit composing the ATP-sensitive potassium channel) with individuals inhering the S allele in ABCC8 almost always inheriting the E allele in KCNJ11 (r2 = 0.98 between the two variants in Europeans, and r2 = 1.0 in Africans and East Asians).	2297	2949
28411266	Because of this coinheritance, genetics studies were unable to determine which of the two variants was causally linked to channel activity (10).	2950	3094
28411266	However, subsequent in vitro analyses demonstrated the S allele of ABCC8 p.A1369S to be the causal variant in sensitivity to gliclazide and promoting closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (not p.E23K in KCNJ11) (13).	3095	3320
28411266	Therefore, in our primary analysis, we examined the effect of ABCC8 p.A1369S, a mutation that mimics sulfonylurea therapy, on type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cardiometabolic traits.	3321	3515
28411266	All traits were plotted in units of standard deviations to facilitate comparisons among traits but were displayed in clinical units for interpretation.Using the UK Biobank cohort, we also examined whether ABCC8 p.A1369S is associated with other cardiovascular disease, including stroke, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease, as well as a composite of these outcomes and coronary heart disease.	3516	3919
28411266	Last, we conducted a phenome-wide association study for 32 additional diseases in UK Biobank, including endocrine, renal, urological, gastrointestinal, neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and neoplastic disorders.Genotyping and imputation was performed in UK Biobank as previously described (14).	3920	4224
28411266	Individual-level genetic data were available from 120,286 individuals in UK Biobank, after excluding one related individual of each related pair of individuals, individuals whose genetic sex did not match self-reported sex, and 480 samples with an excess of missing genotype calls or more heterozygosity than expected.Of these individuals, 41,397 were genotyped using the Affymetrix UK Biobank Lung Exome Variant Evaluation (UK BiLEVE) array, and 78,889 were genotyped using the Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom Array.	4225	4738
28411266	Phasing and imputation were performed centrally, by UK Biobank, using a reference panel combining UK10K and 1000 Genomes samples.The S amino acid of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant (corresponding to the “A” DNA sequence allele of rs757110) has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (9,10).	4739	5038
28411266	We first sought to independently replicate the association of this variant with type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank.	5039	5153
28411266	After replication, we used this variant as an instrument to estimate the effect of genetic inhibition of the sulfonylurea receptor on cardiometabolic traits and coronary heart disease.In the UK Biobank, we estimated the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S with each outcome using logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, 10 principal components of ancestry, and a dummy variable for genotyping array.	5154	5555
28411266	For the summary-level data, this approach is equivalent to the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant with the trait or outcome of interest.For our primary outcome, coronary heart disease, a P value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.	5556	5814
28411266	For our secondary analysis of cardiometabolic traits, which included eight traits, we set a Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance of P = 0.05/8 = 0.00625 (though this may be conservative for some traits, given the higher prior probability of association in an expected direction).	5815	6099
28411266	For our phenome-wide association study of 32 phenotypes, we set a level of significance of P = 0.05/32 = 0.0016.Recent evidence suggests that excess abdominal fat increases the risk of coronary heart disease, even after adjustment for BMI (15).	6100	6344
28411266	As pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy induces weight gain, we sought to examine whether ABCC8 p.A1369S was associated with abdominal fat, which may mediate the weight gain associated with pharmacological therapy.	6345	6559
28411266	Of 120,286 participants with genotype data available in UK Biobank, 1,296 participants underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).	6560	6697
28411266	Total fat mass and the ratio of abdominal (android) fat mass to peripheral (arm and leg) fat mass were estimated using full-body DEXA.	6698	6832
28411266	We examined the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant with these three measurements in this subset of 1,296 UK Biobank participants, after adjustment for age, sex, 10 principal components of ancestry, and a dummy variable for array type.Analyses were conducted using R version 3.2.	6833	7118
28411266	All results are reported relative to the S amino acid allele of ABCC8 p.A1369S (the “A” DNA sequence allele), which promotes closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (13).ABCC8 p.A1369S genotype was available in 120,286 participants of UK Biobank, including 15,593 (13%) homozygous for the allele encoding A/A, 55,612 (46%) with A/S, and 49,081 (41%) with S/S.	7119	7485
28411266	The mean age was 57 years and 56,936 (47%) participants were men (Supplementary Table 1).As in prior published results (9,10), the S allele at ABCC8 p.A1369S was associated with a lower risk of diabetes in UK Biobank participants (odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95% CI 0.90, 0.97; P = 0.0015).	7486	7770
28411266	A meta-analysis of the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) and UK Biobank results showed ABCC8 p.A1369S to be associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes at a genome-wide level of significance (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.91, 0.95; P = 3.0 × 10−11) (Fig.	7771	8039
28411266	1).As predicted for a variant that mimics the pharmacological impact of a sulfonylurea, p.A1369S was associated with increased fasting insulin and a decrease in 2-h glucose as assessed via an oral glucose tolerance test (Supplementary Table 2 and Fig.	8040	8291
28411266	2).	210	213
28411266	Although each of these associations was nominally significant, neither reached the prespecified Bonferroni-adjusted P value.	8296	8420
28411266	Beyond glycemic traits, p.A1369S was associated with increased BMI (+0.062 kg/m2; 95% CI 0.037, 0.086; P = 8.1 × 10−7) and hip circumference (+0.095 cm; 95% CI 0.045, 0.15; P = 2.3 × 10−4) but lower waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, a marker of abdominal fat distribution (−0.00093; 95% CI −0.0014, −0.00045; P = 1.6 × 10−4) (Fig.	8421	8754
28411266	2).	210	213
28411266	p.A1369S was not associated with unadjusted waist-to-hip ratio (−0.00012; 95% CI −0.00058, 0.00036; P = 0.64).Individual-level data in the UK Biobank, restricted to 119,913 participants in whom anthropometric data were available, confirmed an increased BMI among those with genotypes encoding the A/S or S/S genotypes (P for trend = 0.0075).	8759	9100
28411266	Despite this increased overall BMI, these genotypes were associated with decreased central adiposity as assessed by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (P for trend = 2.2 × 10−4) (Table 1).	9101	9290
28411266	Direct imaging assessment of body fat mass using DEXA scanning was available in a subset of 1,296 participants.	9291	9402
28411266	The S allele p.A1369S did not relate to total fat mass but was nominally associated with a reduced ratio of android (abdominal) to peripheral fat mass, a direct measurement of abdominal fat distribution (P = 0.039) (Table 1).Overall, the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant was associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 0.99; P = 5.9 × 10−4) (Fig.	9403	9775
28411266	1) and a reduced risk of a composite cardiovascular disease phenotype (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96, 0.99; P = 1.0 × 10−4) (Fig.	9776	9896
28411266	3).	3317	3320
28411266	Although the associations of p.A1369S with stroke, heart failure, or peripheral vascular disease did not reach statistical significance, effects were directionally consistent with protection without evidence for significant heterogeneity across phenotypes (P heterogeneity = 0.74) (Fig.	9901	10187
28411266	3).	3317	3320
28411266	In a phenome-wide association study in UK Biobank, ABCC8 p.A1369S was not associated with 32 other diseases, including other endocrine disorders and cancer (Supplementary Fig.	10192	10367
28411266	1 and Supplementary Table 3).The ABCC8 p.A1369S missense variant is common in the population and is known to mimic the pharmacological impact of sulfonylurea therapy.	10368	10534
28411266	We confirm and extend previous observations of a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and elevated BMI among individual carriers of the S allele, consistent with the effects of pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy (16).	10535	10749
28411266	Furthermore, we demonstrate that, despite an increased BMI, carriers of the S amino acid have a more favorable body fat distribution and are protected from coronary heart disease.These results permit several conclusions.	10750	10970
28411266	First, these results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of the sulfonylurea receptor may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease more broadly over the long term.	10971	11166
28411266	Each copy of the S allele at ABCC8 p.A1369S was associated with a 6.9% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a 2.4% lower risk of coronary heart disease, and a 2.5% lower risk of cardiovascular disease.	11167	11362
28411266	This cardioprotective effect was noted despite an association with increased BMI and may relate to improved glycemic profile, a more favorable body fat distribution (15), or other pathways that could not be characterized in this study.	11363	11598
28411266	The magnitude of association of the p.A1369S variant in ABCC8 with coronary heart disease (OR 0.96 per 10% reduction in risk of diabetes) is similar to a similar recent report involving a missense variant in the gene encoding GLP1R (OR 0.95 per 10% reduction in risk of diabetes) (17).	11599	11884
28411266	This suggestion of cardioprotection derived from a genetic study was confirmed in subsequently completed cardiovascular outcome trials involving the GLP-1 analogs liraglutide and semaglutide (18,19).	11885	12084
28411266	Although currently available clinical trial data for sulfonylurea therapy are underpowered to determine impact on cardiovascular outcomes (20), we provide evidence that pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy may similarly lead to cardiovascular benefit.The expected magnitude of cardioprotection afforded by sulfonylurea therapy can be modeled based on previous clinical trial data.	12085	12465
28411266	In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) trial, pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy reduced the risk of an HbA1c >7% at 3 years by 33% (16).	12466	12611
28411266	Standardizing the genetic estimates observed in this study to a 33% reduction in risk of diabetes, these results would suggest that pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy would increase BMI by 0.34 kg/m2 but reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 13%.	12612	12867
28411266	The 13% predicted reduction in risk of coronary heart disease with sulfonylurea therapy is identical to the 13% reduction in risk of coronary heart disease observed in a recent trial of liraglutide (18).A genetic predisposition to decreased risk of type 2 diabetes is known to associate with protection from coronary heart disease as well (21).	12868	13212
28411266	In order to determine whether the magnitude of impact of p.A1369S in ABCC8 with coronary heart disease could be fully explained by its effect of type 2 diabetes, we compared the observed effect to that previously noted in a study of 26 type 2 diabetes genetic variants free of pleiotropy (21).	13213	13506
28411266	In this study, a 33% lower risk of diabetes is associated with a 4% lower risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.98, 0.94).	13507	13641
28411266	By contrast, for the p.A1369S variant, a 33% lower risk of diabetes is associated with a 13% lower risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.81, 0.94; P interaction = 0.03).	13642	13823
28411266	This indicates that degree of risk reduction for the p.A1369S variant on coronary heart disease exceeds that which would be predicted based on the average impact of type 2 diabetes associated variant at other genetic loci.Second, these results highlight the potential importance of examining body fat distribution in addition to BMI as measurements of adiposity.	13824	14186
28411266	As expected based on clinical experience with pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy (4), the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant was associated with increased BMI.	14187	14336
28411266	However, estimates based both on anthropometric assessment and direct quantification using DEXA imaging suggest that the variant is associated with reduced abdominal adiposity.	14337	14513
28411266	Although the impact on improved body fat distribution was modest, it may account for a portion of the reduced risk of coronary heart disease.	14514	14655
28411266	Furthermore, these genetic results suggest that therapies that increase BMI may not increase coronary heart disease risk if weight gain is mediated by fat accumulation in peripheral tissues (22).This study has several limitations.	14656	14886
28411266	First, these results are based on the lifelong impact of a constitutive genetic variant within the sulfonylurea receptor.	14887	15008
28411266	However, pharmacological therapy with sulfonylurea is initiated later in life and leads to more dramatic inhibition of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and upregulation of insulin secretion.	15009	15202
28411266	As such, our genetic modeling approach may not have fully captured adverse on-target effects of sulfonylurea therapy, such as hypoglycemia, or other off-target effects.	15203	15371
28411266	Second, our estimates of the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant with cardiometabolic traits and coronary heart disease were derived in the general population; the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant with traits and coronary heart disease among individuals with type 2 diabetes (in whom pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy is currently implemented) may differ.	15372	15745
28411266	Third, the associations of ABCC8 p.A1369S with stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure remained underpowered to detect statistically significant associations.	15746	15919
28411266	Finally, the majority of participants in the UK Biobank and included GWAS consortia were of European ancestry; future analyses will seek to validate these observations in other ethnicities as genetic data becomes available.In conclusion, genetic variation mimicking the impact of sulfonylurea therapy is associated with reduced risk of both type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease.	15920	16304
27999109	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T-cell–mediated autoimmune disease that destroys insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells (1).	0	117
27999109	It is heritable but non-Mendelian, and genetic susceptibility loci are insufficient for predicting diabetes onset; most people with risk alleles never become diabetic (2).	118	289
27999109	Interaction of genes with environmental factors has been invoked as a determinant of disease (3,4).	290	389
27999109	Viral infection, particularly with enterovirus, is believed to be a key environmental modulator of T1D, and its possible role in pathogenesis has been reviewed in detail (5,6).	390	566
27999109	The mechanisms that underlie viral triggering of T1D remain unclear; β-cell infection, bystander activation, antigenic spreading, and molecular mimicry have been proposed.	567	738
27999109	Alternatively, viruses could prevent T1D through immunoregulation or induction of protective immunity (7).To gain better insight into the mechanism of virus-induced diabetes, we used a rat model of the disease.	739	949
27999109	Rats are the only naturally occurring virus-induced T1D model that closely resembles that of human T1D in terms of histopathology, pathogenesis, lack of sex bias, and MHC class II association (8).	950	1146
27999109	Type 1–like autoimmune diabetes, both spontaneous and inducible, is relatively common among inbred rat strains, which, like humans, express a high-risk class II MHC haplotype; in rats, this is designated RT1B/Du.	1147	1359
27999109	Among susceptible rat strains, the LEW.1WR1 strain has been particularly useful.	1360	1440
27999109	About 2.5% of LEW.1WR1 rats develop T1D spontaneously, typically during their early reproductive years; both sexes are affected, and islets show insulitis (9).	1441	1600
27999109	Various perturbations of the immune system, however, can efficiently trigger autoimmune diabetes in up to 100% of animals.	1601	1723
27999109	Perturbants include regulatory T-cell (Treg) depletion, innate immune activation with thrice-weekly doses of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), and infection with Kilham rat virus (KRV) or rat cytomegalovirus.	1724	1942
27999109	LEW.1WR1 rats also develop diabetes at an increased rate (18%) after Coxsackie B serotype 4 (CVB4) infection, but only if pretreated with a low dose of poly I:C daily for 3 days before viral challenge (10).	1943	2149
27999109	Of note, weanling but not adult LEW.1WR1 rats are prone to diabetes after any viral challenge, making these animals a faithful model of the generally juvenile aspect of T1D.After poly I:C challenge or during viral infection, a cascade of cytokines, including type I interferon (IFN) (i.e., IFN-α/β [Supplementary Fig.	2150	2467
27999109	1]), could contribute to the induction of diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats.	2468	2536
27999109	Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have established associations between the risk for human T1D and polymorphisms in genes that mediate type I IFN responses, including IFIH1 (11,12), Ebi2 (13), and Tyk2 (14–16).	2537	2766
27999109	Thus, we aimed to define the role of type I IFN on the development of autoimmune diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats by disrupting the IFNAR1 subunit of the type I IFN receptor complex, a key component of IFN signaling.	2767	2976
27999109	The generation of knockout rats has previously been challenging, but advances in zinc finger nuclease gene targeting (17) and, more recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–associated protein 9 (Cas9) technology (18) have made this feasible.	2977	3254
27999109	We generated Ifnar1−/− LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and challenged weanling wild type (WT) and Ifnar1−/− rats with either poly I:C or KRV and assessed for the development of diabetes.	3255	3454
27999109	We found that IFNAR1 deficiency protects against diabetes.LEW.1WR1 rats (RT1B/Du) were from Biomere (Worcester, MA).	3455	3571
27999109	They develop spontaneous diabetes at a rate of ∼2.5% (9), but treatment with poly I:C (9) or infection with viruses from several families (10) increases the frequency of diabetes to 30–100%.	3572	3762
27999109	Animals were housed in viral antibody–free conditions, confirmed monthly to be serologically free of rat pathogens (19), and maintained in accordance with institutional and national guidelines (20).An Ifnar1 target region in exon 4, encoding the IFN-binding domain, was disrupted in the genome of the LEW.1WR1 rat using the CRISPR-Cas9 method.	3763	4106
27999109	The IFNAR1ex4_guide RNA (gRNA) 2 target site (AGGAGAGATGTAGACTA|GTATGG) includes an overlapping SpeI restriction site.	4107	4225
27999109	The IFNAR1ex4_gRNA3 target site (TCAATTACACGATACGG|ATCTGG) includes an overlapping XhoII restriction site.	4226	4332
27999109	Note that for both target sites, the cleavage site is indicated with a vertical line and the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence is underlined.	4333	4482
27999109	To confirm high activity of the single guide RNA (sgRNA)/Cas9 nucleases before embryo injection, the guide sequences were cloned into plasmid pX330 (Plasmid #42230; Addgene, Cambridge, MA) (21), using the following primers:IFNAR1ex4_gRNA2_F 5′-gtggaaaggacgaaacaccgAGGAGAGATGTAGACTAGTA-3′IFNAR1ex4_gRNA3_F 5′-gtggaaaggacgaaacaccgTCAATTACACGATACGGATC-3′IFNAR1ex4_gRNA2_R 5′-ctatttctagctctaaaacTACTAGTCTACATCTCTCCT-3′IFNAR1ex4_gRNA3_R 5′-ctatttctagctctaaaacGATCCGTATCGTGTAATTGA-3′The full target sites, including PAM sequence, were cloned into the nuclease reporter plasmid M427 (provided by M.

27999109	Nuclease activity was confirmed by examining green fluorescent protein–positive cells after cotransfection into 293T cells with the corresponding nuclease plasmid or with a negative control.Capped and tailed Cas9 mRNA was prepared using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and gRNA was prepared using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) as previously described (23).	5540	5971
27999109	Linear DNA templates for Cas9 mRNA synthesis and sgRNA synthesis through T7 RNA polymerase were prepared by PCR using the pX330 sgRNA plasmids and the following oligonucleotides:Cas9T7_F 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGGACTATAAGGACCACGAC-3′Cas9T7_R 5′-GCGAGCTCTAGGAATTCTTAC-3′IFNAR1ex4_gRNA2_vT7F 5′-ttaatacgactcactataggAGGAGAGATGTAGACTAGTA-3′IFNAR1ex4_gRNA3_vT7F 5′-ttaatacgactcactataggTCAATTACACGATACGGATC-3′gRNA_RsEq 5′-AAAAAAgcaccgactcggtgccac-3′Two independent in vitro–transcribed sgRNAs (50 ng) were coinjected with Cas9 mRNA (50 ng) in 0.5-day-old LEW.1WR1 single-cell embryos by intracytoplasmic microinjection to create site-specific DNA double-strand breaks, thereby stimulating targeted gene disruptions.	5972	6685
27999109	After injection, LEW.1WR1 embryos were transferred into pseudopregnant Sprague Dawley female rats.	6686	6784
27999109	Embryonic injections and transfers were performed at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Medical School Transgenic Animal Modeling Core facility.	6785	6934
27999109	Genomic DNA was isolated from tail samples.	6935	6978
27999109	The genotypes of individual pups (i.e., presence of insertions/deletions [indels]) were determined by PCR, restriction enzyme digests, and sequencing (Macrogen, Rockville, MD).Of nine rats born, five founder animals that contained monoallelic or biallelic mutations in Ifnar1 were identified by nuclease screening and used for further breeding (Fig.	6979	7328
27999109	1B) to establish two distinct homozygous lines, designated IFNAR1Δ81 and IFNAR1Δ81+4, that were based on the indels present.	7329	7453
27999109	Total RNA was extracted from heart and brain samples of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)–infected rats 2 days postinfection using TRIzol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).	7454	7631
27999109	One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.	7632	7796
27999109	For RT-PCR analysis, primers targeting a 574-base pair (bp) region between exons 2 and 5 of the Ifnar1 gene (IFNAR1-F [5′-CCGTAGCCTCAGGTGAAGAC-3′] and IFNAR1-R [5′-GCTGTGTCTCTGAAGCGATG-3′]) were designed using Primer-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast).	7797	8062
27999109	As a control, primers targeting a 543-bp region between exons 1 and 5 were designed for the Ifnar2 gene (IFNAR2-F [5′-AAGCCCAGAACAGGGGAAAC-3′] and IFNAR2-R [5′-CCAACCACTCGTCAGTCACA-3′]).	8063	8249
27999109	The reference cDNA sequences used for rat Ifnar1 and Ifnar2 are NM_001105893.1 and XM_006248107.2, respectively.	8250	8362
27999109	A 50-μL PCR master mix comprising HotStartTaq Master Mix (QIAGEN), nuclease-free water, forward and reverse primers (0.2 μmol/L each), and cDNA (2 μL per reaction) was prepared.	8363	8540
27999109	For PCR cycling conditions, initial denaturation at 95°C for 15 min was followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 40 s, 59°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 45 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.	8541	8729
27999109	Amplified products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide under ultraviolet illumination after electrophoresis.Spleens were isolated from rats of either sex and immediately washed with PBS (Corning, Manassas, VA) and then minced and passed through a 40-μm sterile nylon mesh with a 3-mL rubber syringe plunger.	8730	9069
27999109	Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 3 min.	9070	9132
27999109	The supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 7 min at room temperature.	9133	9275
27999109	After removal of erythrocytes, the splenocytes were washed once with PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in appropriate volumes of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, counted, and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well.	9276	9516
27999109	Cultured splenocytes were stimulated with 1,000 units/mL of recombinant rat IFN-β or IFN-α (PBL Assay Science, Piscataway, NJ) for 18 h, then cell lysates were harvested for total RNA preparation using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN).cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.	9517	9887
27999109	Gene expression was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) with the QuantiTect Primer Assay (Rn_Isg15_1_SG, Rn_Oas1a_1_SG) for interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 and OAS1a.	9888	10066
27999109	Expression levels were normalized to GusB (Rn_GusB_1_SG QuantiTect Primer Assay).	10067	10148
27999109	The QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN) was used for real-time PCR amplification according to the manufacturer’s protocol on a Mastercycler ep realplex (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY).To determine splenic KRV transcript levels, total RNA was extracted from spleens of KRV-infected WT and IFNAR1Δ81 rats.	10149	10450
27999109	cDNA was synthesized by using 1 μg of total RNA followed by RT-qPCR as described above.	10451	10538
27999109	We used previously published primers (24) with the following sequences: forward primer 5′-GGAAACGCTTACTCCGATGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AACCGATGTCCTTCCCATTT-3′.	10539	10699
27999109	The expression levels of viral transcripts were normalized to GusB.All real-time PCR reactions were run in duplicate, including a no-template control reaction.	10700	10859
27999109	Fold changes in gene expression of test and control samples were determined by using the 2−ΔΔCt method.Studies of induced diabetes were performed in WT LEW.1WR1 and Ifnar1−/− LEW.1WR1 rats (backcrossed ≥ F5) using two different perturbants known to trigger autoimmunity in WT animals and one not previously tested.	10860	11174
27999109	High-molecular-weight poly I:C (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) was administered to rats of either sex at 21–25 days of age by using a dose of 1 μg/g body weight by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection three times weekly for 3 weeks as previously described (9).	11175	11426
27999109	Rats were monitored for a total of 39 days after the first injection with poly I:C, defined as day 0.	11427	11528
27999109	Spleens, pancreata, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs), and sera were collected at day 4 from age-matched animals injected on days 0 and 2 with either saline or poly I:C in one experiment.In a second set of experiments, weanling WT and Ifnar1−/− rats 21–25 days of age were infected with a single i.p. dose of KRV-UMass strain (1 × 107 plaque-forming units [PFU]) on day 0 and monitored for a total of 39 days for diabetes.	11529	11947
27999109	KRV was prepared as previously described (25).	11948	11994
27999109	Spleens, pancreata, PLNs, and sera were collected from age-matched uninfected (i.e., injected with culture media) or KRV-infected animals at day 5 postinoculation in one experiment.In a third set of experiments, weanling WT LEW.1WR1 rats were infected with a single dose of 1 × 107 PFU of EMCV (ATCC strain VR-129 propagated in BHK-21 cells) by i.p. injection on day 0 and monitored for diabetes for a total of 40 days.	11995	12414
27999109	EMCV has not been previously tested in the LEW.1WR1 rat model.	12415	12477
27999109	In one experiment, adult WT and Ifnar1−/− LEW.1WR1 rats were infected with 1 × 107 PFU of EMCV i.p. and monitored for 14 days.	12478	12604
27999109	Rats were euthanized if they exhibited gross signs of illness (e.g., ruffling, hunching).	12605	12694
27999109	Some adult WT and Ifnar1−/− rats were euthanized 48 h after infection with 1 × 107 PFUs of EMCV, and serum and select organs were harvested and stored at −80°C until used for quantifying viral titers.Blood glucose concentrations were measured at least three times weekly with a glucometer (Breeze2; Bayer, Carlsbad, CA).	12695	13015
27999109	Rats were diagnosed as diabetic when the blood glucose concentration exceeded 250 mg/dL on 2 consecutive days.EMCV was measured in rat serum and organs based on previously published methods (26).A ProcartaPlex kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to measure cytokines and chemokines (CCL2, interleukin 1β [IL-1β], CCL5, CXCL10) in rat samples.	13016	13410
27999109	Insulin was measured in serum samples by using an ultrasensitive insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO, Salem, NH).After the diagnosis of diabetes or at the conclusion of an experiment, rats were euthanized, and pancreata were removed and fixed in 10% buffered formalin.	13411	13668
27999109	Paraffin-embedded sections of pancreas were sectioned and prepared for light microscopy in the UMass Medical School Morphology Core laboratory (www.umassmed.edu/morphology/protocols).	13669	13852
27999109	Sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) were scored for insulitis as previously described (9) by an experienced reader (J.P.M.)	13853	13986
27999109	who was not aware of the animal’s glycemic status.	13987	14037
27999109	Intensity of insulitis was scored as follows: 0, no inflammatory mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration; 1+, small numbers of infiltrating MNCs with preservation of islet architecture; 2+, moderate infiltrating MNCs with preservation of architecture; 3+, many MNCs, with most islets affected and distortion of islet architecture; 4+, florid infiltration and distorted islet architecture or end-stage islets with or without residual inflammation.	14038	14480
27999109	Histology images in Fig.	14481	14505
27999109	3 were adjusted for clarity by setting the white point for each image using Adobe Photoshop CS6.Statistical procedures were carried out with either GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) or SPSS version 19 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) software.	14506	14771
27999109	Survival and disease-free survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology; equality of survival distributions was tested by the log-rank statistic (27).	14772	14930
27999109	Parametric data are given as arithmetic means ± 1 SD or ± SE as indicated in the figure legends and Table 1.	14931	15039
27999109	Fisher exact test was used to analyze 2 × 2 tables, and the χ2 test was used for larger tables.	15040	15135
27999109	For comparisons of three or more means, we used one-way and two-way ANOVAs and either Bonferroni correction or the least significant differences procedure for posteriori contrasts (27).	15136	15321
27999109	P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.We induced mutations in rat Ifnar1 using a CRISPR-Cas9 strategy.	15322	15436
27999109	Two sgRNAs were designed to target exon 4 of rat Ifnar1, which, together with exon 5, encodes an IFN-binding domain (Fig.	15437	15558
27999109	1A).	15559	15563
27999109	The sgRNAs were coinjected with Cas9 mRNA into single-cell LEW.1WR1 rat embryos.	15564	15644
27999109	We assayed Ifnar1 somatic mutations in F0 pups and identified either deletions spanning the region between the two sgRNA/Cas9 target sites (Fig.	15645	15789
27999109	1B, lower bands) or small indels at the individual target sites (data not shown).	15790	15871
27999109	Two lines with germline mutations due to error-prone nonhomologous end joining repair were established and designated IFNAR1Δ81 and IFNAR1Δ81+4, and confirmed by sequencing rat genomic DNA from F0 founder, F1 heterozygous, and F2 homozygous animals.	15872	16121
27999109	Sequences of IFNAR1Δ81 and IFNAR1Δ81+4 F2 homozygous animals are shown in Fig.	16122	16200
27999109	1C.	16201	16204
27999109	PCR on cDNA using primers spanning exons 2–5 of Ifnar1 yielded the appropriate-sized product in WT rats but truncated products in IFNAR1Δ81 and IFNAR1Δ81+4 rats (Fig.	16205	16371
27999109	1D, left panel).	16372	16388
27999109	Sequence analysis of Ifnar1 PCR products confirmed that the amplicons contained the predicted mutations (data not shown).	16389	16510
27999109	In contrast, PCR analysis of Ifnar2 cDNA, which was not targeted, revealed the expected products for WT and both IFNAR1 rat lines for a region spanning exons 1–5 (Fig.	16511	16678
27999109	1D, right panel).We tested several commercially available antibodies against rat IFNAR1 but were unable to validate their target specificity.	16679	16820
27999109	Therefore, we confirmed the IFNAR1 deficiency phenotype of our mutant rats using two approaches.	16821	16917
27999109	First, we isolated splenocytes from WT IFNAR1Δ81+4 rats and IFNAR1Δ81 rats and challenged them in vitro with either recombinant rat IFN-β or IFN-α.	16918	17065
27999109	At 18 h postchallenge with IFN-β or IFN-α, robust induction of Isg15 was present with WT but not with IFNAR1Δ81+4 and IFNAR1Δ81 splenocytes (Fig.	17066	17211
27999109	2A).	17212	17216
27999109	A second ISG, Oas1a, was similarly induced by IFN-β in WT but not IFNAR1-deficient rat splenocytes.	17217	17316
27999109	The inability to respond to recombinant type I IFNs indicates that the cognate type I IFN receptor was lacking in the Ifnar1-targeted rats.Second, we examined rat survival after challenge with EMCV, which has been shown to induce type I IFN by engaging the IFIH1-encoded melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 (MDA5) (28,29).	17317	17649
27999109	Ifnar1−/− mice are highly susceptible to EMCV infection compared with control mice (28,30).	17650	17741
27999109	In addition, viral titers in Ifnar1−/− mice are much higher than in controls after challenge with viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and Semliki Forest virus (30,31).	17742	17916
27999109	Thus, we expected that rats lacking IFNAR1 would have a heightened susceptibility to EMCV.	17917	18007
27999109	After EMCV challenge, all WT adult rats survived >14 days postinfection without exhibiting signs of disease.	18008	18116
27999109	In contrast, 100% of IFNAR1Δ81+4 rats and 80% of IFNAR1Δ81 rats died by 4–5 days postinfection (P = 0.0013 and 0.0070, respectively) (Fig.	18117	18255
27999109	2B).	18256	18260
27999109	Serum and heart from IFNAR1-targeted rats also showed high viral titers compared with WT rats 48 h after inoculation with EMCV (Fig.	18261	18393
27999109	2C and D), indicating that the type I IFN response is impaired in these rats.	18394	18471
27999109	The consistent findings between the two IFNAR1-targeted lines suggest that off-target effects from the CRISPR-Cas9 editing are unlikely.	18472	18608
27999109	From this point on, we considered the two lines equivalent and henceforth term these Ifnar1−/− rats.In mice, only certain strains of EMCV are diabetogenic (32), whereas EMCV pathogenesis in rats has been only partly characterized (33).	18609	18844
27999109	Therefore, we challenged weanling WT LEW.1WR1 rats (n = 7) with 1 × 107 PFU EMCV and monitored for diabetes for 40 days.	18845	18965
27999109	None of the rats became diabetic over the course of the experiment (data not shown).Previous studies established that spontaneous diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats occurs with a cumulative frequency of ∼2.5%, but administration of poly I:C to weanling rats leads to diabetes in 100% of rats (9).	18966	19253
27999109	We challenged WT and Ifnar1−/− rats with poly I:C and monitored them for diabetes.	19254	19336
27999109	Poly I:C administration resulted in diabetes in 13 of 15 (87%) WT rats by 23 days after the first dose (Fig.	19337	19445
27999109	3A).	19446	19450
27999109	In contrast, only 2 of 11 (18%) Ifnar1−/− rats became diabetic and not until day 28 at the earliest.	19451	19551
27999109	This difference was highly significant (P < 0.0001).	19552	19604
27999109	Of note, the difference between WT and Ifnar1−/− rats was statistically significant regardless of whether the rats were of IFNAR1Δ81+4 or IFNAR1Δ81 lineage (Supplementary Fig.	19605	19780
27999109	2), again indicating that protection from diabetes is not simply because of an off-target effect.For poly I:C experiments, animals were euthanized at the time of diabetes or at the end of the study, and serial sections of pancreas were stained for H-E, insulin, and glucagon.	19781	20056
27999109	Histopathological analysis revealed that insulitis was more severe in diabetic WT animals after poly I:C treatment compared with nondiabetic animals.	20057	20206
27999109	Islet pathology for all WT animals was associated with a mean insulitis score of 3.11 ± 0.45 (Table 1).	20207	20310
27999109	End-stage insulitis was present in diabetic WT animals, which was associated with distorted islet architecture, shrunken size, and presence of few residual infiltrating lymphocytes (Fig.	20311	20497
27999109	3B).	20498	20502
27999109	Moderate insulitis was present (2+) in one WT animal that was normoglycemic at the end of the study (Fig.	20503	20608
27999109	3B); other WT normoglycemic animals had no evidence of insulitis.	20609	20674
27999109	In contrast, all normoglycemic Ifnar1−/− rats were completely free of insulitis, with normal islet size and structure (Fig.	20675	20798
27999109	3B).	20498	20502
27999109	However, insulitis was observed in the two Ifnar1−/− rats that were diabetic.	20804	20881
27999109	The mean insulitis score was 0.64 ± 0.43 among all poly I:C–treated Ifnar1−/− animals (Table 1).	20882	20978
27999109	The overall concordance between the diabetes phenotype and insulitis scores agrees with our previous findings (34).Immunohistochemical staining on samples from all WT animals revealed abundant glucagon-positive cells, with a marked decrease in insulin-positive cells in diabetic WT rats and moderate loss of insulin-positive cells in normoglycemic poly I:C–treated WT animals (Fig.	20979	21360
27999109	3B).	20498	20502
27999109	Both insulin and glucagon were abundant in islets of all normoglycemic poly l:C–treated Ifnar1−/− animals, with some loss of insulin-positive cells only in the small number of Ifnar1−/− diabetic animals (Fig.	21366	21574
27999109	3B).	20498	20502
27999109	Insulin was measured in all available terminal serum samples; Table 1 shows the mean serum insulin values for WT versus Ifnar1−/− rats regardless of diabetes status.	21580	21745
27999109	Overall, WT rats had significantly lower levels of terminal serum insulin compared with Ifnar1−/− rats, as anticipated.We assessed cytokines and chemokines in organs harvested from WT and Ifnar1−/− animals 4 days after the administration of poly I:C (or saline control).	21746	22016
27999109	CXCL10 and CCL5, whose expression is mediated by IFN, were significantly decreased in spleens from poly I:C–challenged Ifnar1−/− rats compared with poly I:C–challenged WT rats (Fig.	22017	22198
27999109	3C).	22199	22203
27999109	In contrast, differences were not observed in IL-1β or CCL2 in spleens of WT versus Ifnar1−/− rats after poly I:C challenge (Fig.	22204	22333
27999109	3C).	22199	22203
27999109	Cytokines and chemokines were also measured in total pancreata, PLNs, and sera.	22339	22418
27999109	Ifnar1−/− rats challenged with poly I:C had decreased levels of CXCL10, CCL5, and CCL2 in pancreata as well as decreased CXCL10 in sera compared with poly I:C–challenged WT rats (Supplementary Fig.	22419	22616
27999109	3A).KRV infection induces autoimmune diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats (10).	22617	22685
27999109	We conducted KRV infection studies with weanling Ifnar1−/− rats with two goals: 1) to establish whether rats deficient in IFNAR1 could survive infection with this parvovirus and 2) to see whether the frequency of diabetes would be reduced compared with WT rats.	22686	22947
27999109	Diabetes was observed in 3 of 16 (19%) Ifnar1−/− rats infected with KRV and monitored over a 40-day period (Fig.	22948	23060
27999109	4A).	23061	23065
27999109	No other morbidities occurred in these animals over the course of the study.	23066	23142
27999109	Thus, although Ifnar1−/− rats succumbed to EMCV infection, they tolerated and survived KRV infection.	23143	23244
27999109	Nine of 17 (53%) WT rats became diabetic after infection with KRV (Fig.	23245	23316
27999109	4A), a rate consistent with that previously reported in KRV-infected LEW.1WR1 rats (10).	23317	23405
27999109	The difference in the frequency of diabetes in WT versus Ifnar1−/− rats was statistically significant (P = 0.0461), indicating that the absence of IFNAR1 is partially protective against KRV-induced diabetes.	23406	23613
27999109	Pancreatic sections from all the normoglycemic KRV-infected Ifnar1−/− rats at the end of the study showed the complete absence of insulitis, whereas all diabetic rats, whether WT or IFNAR1 deficient, had classical end-stage insulitis (data not shown).KRV has been reported to be present in spleens of LEW.1WR1 rats after infection by the i.p. route (35).	23614	23968
27999109	To establish whether IFNAR1 deficiency results in altered cytokine responses after KRV challenge, we measured select cytokines and chemokines in spleens collected from weanling rats that were uninfected or 5 days after KRV infection.	23969	24202
27999109	CXCL10 and CCL5 were each significantly decreased in spleens from KRV-infected Ifnar1−/− rats compared with KRV-infected WT rats (Fig.	24203	24337
27999109	4B), illustrating an overall diminished type I IFN–driven response in splenic cells after KRV infection in Ifnar1−/− rats.	24338	24460
27999109	Of note, levels of IL-1β and CCL2 were significantly higher in KRV-infected Ifnar1−/− rat spleens compared with KRV-infected WT rat spleens (Fig.	24461	24606
27999109	4B).	24607	24611
27999109	We measured KRV transcript levels in these WT and Ifnar1−/− rat spleens to determine whether viral replication was altered in the absence of functional IFNAR.	24612	24770
27999109	Although viral transcript levels were slightly (approximately twofold) higher in Ifnar1−/− rat spleens compared with WT, the difference was not statistically significant (Fig.	24771	24946
27999109	4C).	24947	24951
27999109	Total pancreatic, PLN, and serum cytokines and chemokines were also measured from these animals, but only limited differences were observed between KRV-infected WT and Ifnar1−/− rats (Supplementary Fig.	24952	25154
27999109	3B).Collectively, these data underscore the importance of type I IFN-mediated signaling for the development of autoimmune diabetes.	25155	25286
27999109	The role of IFN signaling has been implicated in the initiation of islet autoimmunity and development of T1D (36).	25287	25401
27999109	A strong IFN gene signature was identified in the peripheral blood of at-risk children before initiation of islet autoimmunity (37,38).	25402	25537
27999109	The current findings in Ifnar1−/− LEW.1WR1 rats firmly define a role for type I IFN and downstream signaling pathways in poly I:C– and KRV-induced diabetes in the rat model and agree with a previous study in which anti-IFN-α antibody administration to T1D-prone BB rats resulted in a trend toward a later onset of poly I:C–induced diabetes (39).	25538	25883
27999109	They also support human GWAS findings for human T1D risk associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes such as IFIH1 that participate in IFN-regulated pathways.	25884	26064
27999109	Specifically, a nonsynonymous SNP in IFIH1 resulting in an amino acid change of alanine to threonine at 946 (A946T) of MDA5 is associated with an increased risk of diabetes (11).	26065	26243
27999109	MDA5 recognizes cytoplasmic long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates generated during the replication cycle of CVB or intracellularly delivered synthetic dsRNA analog poly I:C, leading to potent IFN-α/β induction (40).	26244	26468
27999109	Funabiki et al. (41) characterized a constitutively active form of MDA5 caused by the amino acid mutation G821S that results in type I IFN hyperexpression and causes lupus-like nephritis; they also similarly associated hyperexpression of type I IFN with A946T .	26469	26730
27999109	The resulting increase in IFN is associated with severe autoimmune disease.In contrast, four rare-variant nonsynonymous SNPs in IFIH1 were found to be protective against T1D in GWAS (12); at least two of these variants, E627X and I923V, are predicted to decrease MDA5 function with loss of type I IFN responses after viral challenge (42).	26731	27069
27999109	Recent data have also shown that NOD mice heterozygous for MDA5 were protected from T1D when infected with CVB4; this protective effect was attributed to a unique type I IFN signature that led to expansion of Tregs at the site of autoimmunity (43).	27070	27318
27999109	Similarly, Ebi2, a regulator of the interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)–driven inflammatory network (IDIN), including human IFIH1 (13), was associated with an increased risk of T1D; the specific Ebi2 polymorphism is associated with increased expression of IDIN genes (13).	27319	27593
27999109	Finally, the human Tyk2 gene, which was mapped to the possible T1D susceptibility locus (15), encodes the IFNAR1-associated molecule tyrosine kinase 2, and its deficiency results in a reduced antiviral response (14).	27594	27810
27999109	These data support the critical contribution of IFN-regulated pathways in the development of T1D following environmental insult.Rat models are particularly useful for understanding the pathogenesis of T1D, specifically in defining the roles of genetic and environmental factors, including viral infection.	27811	28116
27999109	The mechanism by which KRV induces diabetes in rats has been partially dissected and involves both innate and adaptive immune responses (8).	28117	28257
27999109	KRV infection of LEW.1WR1 rat primary islets and splenic cells reportedly activates the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 signaling pathway, leading to the activation of two major transcription factors, IRF7 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through the adaptor protein MyD88 (35,44).	28258	28531
27999109	Treg depletion synergizes with KRV to induce diabetes (45).	28532	28591
27999109	In our studies, the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)–regulated chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10 are decreased in spleens of KRV-infected Ifnar1−/− rats, whereas NF-κB–driven IL-1β and CCL2 are significantly increased (Fig.	28592	28821
27999109	4B), confirming roles for both IRF7 and NF-κB in KRV infection.	28822	28885
27999109	Of importance, IL-1β is an inflammatory cytokine that has long been implicated in the development of T1D (46,47).	28886	28999
27999109	The robust IL-1β induction suggests that IL-1β may not be a major contributor in the early stages of diabetes in this model.	29000	29124
27999109	Of note, loss of IFNAR1 does not affect the overall survival of KRV-infected rats in the manner that it affects survival of EMCV-infected rats.	29125	29268
27999109	Type I IFN production is elicited by several pathways in the infected host, depending on the specific virus, and each virus may have a unique means of antagonizing or evading the IFN response.	29269	29461
27999109	For example, a murine parvovirus has been shown to efficiently evade host type I IFN (48), so rodent parvoviruses may possess unique mechanisms to counteract IFN-induced antiviral effectors.	29462	29652
27999109	Although the impact of type I IFN on KRV replication is not completely defined, ISGs are induced during KRV infection and could contribute to autoimmunity.Figure 5 provides an overview of IFN signaling pathways in virus-induced diabetes in the context of this study as well as others (49,50).	29653	29945
27999109	Viral nucleic acid structures are recognized by pattern recognition receptors, including MDA5 and TLR3, after viral infection of β-cells, leading to the activation of the key transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB (51), which is followed by induction of the transcription and synthesis of IFN-β, a subset of ISGs (40), and inflammatory cytokines; the magnitude of these responses may depend on the genetic susceptibility of the host.	29946	30384
27999109	IFN-β binds to the type I IFN receptor and exerts its antiviral effects through the trimolecular ISGF3 (IFN-stimulated gene factor 3) complex STAT1-STAT2-IRF9, which binds to the ISRE and induces the expression of ISGs for the recruitment of immune cells (e.g., lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells), leading to insulitis and diabetes.	30385	30723
27999109	Type I IFNs also affect β-cell survival during infections with viruses linked to human T1D (49).	30724	30820
27999109	We show that the absence of functional IFNAR tempers the onset of diabetes.We found the incidence of diabetes in our WT LEW.1WR1 rats to be comparable to previously published reports: 38% for KRV (10) and close to 100% for poly I:C (9).	30821	31057
27999109	Of note, IFNAR1 deficiency results in an incidence of diabetes of ∼18%, regardless of whether the trigger is poly I:C or KRV.	31058	31183
27999109	This suggests a common mechanism of diabetes and insulitis in IFNAR1 deficiency.	31184	31264
27999109	The mechanism behind diabetes during IFNAR1 deficiency remains undefined but may relate to IFN production that precedes IFNAR1 signaling events or that may depend on TLR-mediated activation of NF-κB [TLR9 for KRV (44); TLR3 for poly I:C (52)] with subsequent T-cell recruitment.	31265	31543
27999109	Virus-induced diabetes that occurs independently of the IFNAR1 pathway can be further explored in the rat model and, perhaps, eventually defined through generation of double-knockout rat lines.	31544	31737
27999109	We have already dissected important genetic factors in virus-induced diabetes in rats.	31738	31824
27999109	The genome-encoded T-cell receptor element Vβ13 controls genetic susceptibility to diabetes (53); depletion of Vβ13+ T cells prevents poly I:C–induced diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats (54).	31825	32007
27999109	Additional genetic studies define diubiquitin as a susceptibility gene for virus-induced diabetes in rats (55).	32008	32119
27999109	With continued advancements in genomics and in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we anticipate exciting developments in autoimmune diabetes in the near future through rat models of diabetes.In summary, these data advance our understanding of how innate immunity influences the development of T1D.	32120	32410
27999109	These studies help us to better understand why certain individuals with specific polymorphisms in IFIH1 are either predisposed to or protected from T1D.	32411	32563
27999109	Viral infection and innate immune activation may initiate early events in β-cells and/or immune cells that ultimately lead to autoimmune attack and T1D in genetically susceptible individuals.	32564	32755
27999109	In the long term, findings from these studies could be transitioned to diabetes models involving human islets and human immune cells (56) in which type I IFN pathways are disrupted.	32756	32937
27999109	The current data reinforce the need for novel approaches to diabetes prevention and treatment, such as viral vaccine development (57,58) or even cytokine-modulating therapies.	32938	33113
28151486	Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with an estimated 1 676 600 new cases and 521 900 deaths according to GLOBOCAN 2012.1 Cancer cells, including breast cancer cells, usually manifest aberrant gene expression that leads to malignancy, such as sustaining proliferation, metastasis and evasion of apoptosis.2 Identification of the deregulated gene expression may advance the understanding of cancer pathogenesis and provide insights into potential new therapeutic strategies.	0	549
28151486	Recent advances reveal mRNA 3′end processing as a highly regulated process and an important mechanism for posttranscriptional gene expression.3 This process controls stability, translocation and translation of mRNAs and plays a critical role in human physiology and pathology, including cancer.4 Star-PAP, a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase encoding by gene TUT1, is a component of the 3′end processing complex required for a subset of pre-mRNAs.5, 6, 7 Star-PAP regulates the expression of target genes involved in various cellular processes, such as oxidative response and apoptosis, through processing their mRNAs.8, 9, 10 However, the physiological and pathological roles of Star-PAP largely remain unknown.	550	1260
28151486	Recently, it was reported that Star-PAP inhibits the lipogenesis and thus the cell proliferation in osteosarcoma cells in vitro.11 However, the functional role of Star-PAP in cancer development and treatment is unclear.	1261	1480
28151486	Given the clues above, the function of Star-PAP in human breast cancer was investigated in this study.	1481	1583
28151486	We observed that breast cancer manifests a downregulated expression of Star-PAP.	1584	1664
28151486	Ectopic expression of Star-PAP inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells, and Star-PAP induced the mitochondrial apoptosis through regulating the expression of BIK (BCL2-interacting killer).	1665	1864
28151486	Moreover, Star-PAP relieved breast cancer progression in vivo and sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutics.	1865	1983
28151486	This study indicated that Star-PAP has a potential tumor-suppressing function in breast cancer and can be a valuable molecular target for breast cancer therapy and prevention.	1984	2159
28151486	To investigate whether Star-PAP involves in human breast cancer pathogenesis, we first examined the expression of Star-PAP in a panel of breast cancer cell lines.	2160	2322
28151486	When compared with the untransformed mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A and MCF12A), breast cancer cells showed downregulated protein levels of Star-PAP, determined by western blot (Figure 1a).	2323	2514
28151486	Breast cancer cells also had reduced mRNA levels of Star-PAP as shown by qPCR (Figure 1b) and further confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 1c).	2515	2649
28151486	We further analyzed the expression pattern of Star-PAP in Oncomine, a publicly accessible cancer informatics database, with the Neve cell line data set that includes the transcriptional profiles of 51 breast cell lines.12, 13 Among this collection of cell lines (n=51), the breast cancer cell lines (n=48) also exhibited lower Star-PAP expression levels than the immortalized breast epithelial cell lines (n=3; HBL-100, MCF10A, MCF12A) (Figure 1d).	2650	3098
28151486	Collectively, the above results indicated that the downregulation of Star-PAP is a manifestation of breast cancer cells.	3099	3219
28151486	Next, the expression of Star-PAP in human breast cancer tissues was examined by analyzing the public data sets.14, 15, 16 Although highly expressed in normal mammary tissues, Star-PAP was downregulated in ductal carcinoma in situ (Figure 1e), invasive ductal carcinoma (Figure 1f) and even the stroma of invasive ductal carcinoma (Figure 1g).	3220	3562
28151486	These data proved that the expression of Star-PAP is also downregulated in clinical breast cancer progression, thus suggesting that Star-PAP may play a potential tumor-suppressing role in breast cancer.	3563	3765
28151486	To elucidate the functional role of Star-PAP in breast cancer progression, we first overexpressed Star-PAP in MCF7 and SUM-159PT cells.	3766	3901
28151486	In both breast cancer cell lines, the cell proliferation (Figure 2b and Supplementary Figure S1c) as well as the colony-forming ability (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure S1b) was inhibited by the increased expression levels of Star-PAP (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure S1a).	3902	4181
28151486	Moreover, ectopic expression of Star-PAP also induced apoptosis of cancer cells (Figure 2d).	4182	4274
28151486	Together, these findings indicated that Star-PAP functions as a possible suppressor for breast cancer cells.	4275	4383
28151486	We then exploited KM-plotter, an online cancer survival analysis database,17 to investigate the correlation between Star-PAP levels and clinical prognosis.	4384	4539
28151486	When evaluated across the entire spectrum of breast cancer patients, high levels of Star-PAP were associated with relatively increased overall survival and relapse-free survival (Figure 2e).	4540	4730
28151486	When looking into each of the four major breast cancer subtypes (basal-like, her2-enriched, luminal A and luminal B), elevated levels of Star-PAP also indicated an improved relapse-free survival, especially in basal-like and her2-enriched subtype (Supplementary Figures S2a–d).	4731	5008
28151486	Thus, in breast cancer patients, high levels of Star-PAP correlated with an improved prognosis.	5009	5104
28151486	Considering that Star-PAP induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Figure 2d), we then investigated the mechanism underlying the apoptosis-inducing activity of Star-PAP.	5105	5275
28151486	We observed that Star-PAP overexpression caused approximately fivefold loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) than control (Figure 3a).	5276	5424
28151486	Moreover, ectopic Star-PAP expression triggered the release of cytochrome c, a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, and increased the activation of downstream Caspase 9 and Caspase 3 (Figure 3b).	5425	5626
28151486	As the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis manifests the loss of ΔΨm and the release of cytochrome c,18 the above results suggested that Star-PAP induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway.	5627	5847
28151486	The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is tightly regulated by the BCL-2 protein family through the interaction between its subgroup members.	5848	5989
28151486	BIK is an inducer of mitochondrial apoptosis by activating BAX.19, 20, 21, 22, 23 It has been reported that Star-PAP associates with BIK mRNA and thus facilitates BIK expression by processing its mRNA 3′end in HEK293 cells.9 For this reason, we speculated that the Star-PAP-induced mitochondrial apoptosis of breast cancer cells is mediated by BIK.	5990	6338
28151486	In human breast cancer cells, the association between Star-PAP and BIK mRNA was firstly verified by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by RT-PCR (Figure 3c).	6339	6500
28151486	Moreover, Star-PAP increased both mRNA (Figures 3d and e) and protein levels (Figure 3b) of BIK.	6501	6597
28151486	Therefore, these results indicated that Star-PAP regulates the expression of BIK in the context of breast cancer cells.	6598	6717
28151486	Targeting BIK with two distinct shRNAs (shBIK#1, shBIK#2) effectively relieved the loss of ΔΨm triggered by Star-PAP overexpression (Figure 3a).	6718	6862
28151486	The release of cytochrome c and the activation of Caspase 9 and Caspase 3 were also effectively inhibited by BIK knockdown (Figure 3b).	6863	6998
28151486	As a consequence of the increased BIK level after Star-PAP overexpression, the activation of BAX was also elevated (Figure 3f), whereas BIK knockdown mostly counteracted this alteration (Figure 3f).	6999	7197
28151486	It is reported that Star-PAPD218A, a polymerase-dead mutant of Star-PAP, loses the poly(A) polymerase activity as well as the ability to control the expression of BIK.9 We found that Star-PAPD218A failed to induce the loss of ΔΨm (Figure 3a) and the activation of BAX (Figure 3f), thus suggesting that the polymerase activity of Star-PAP is necessary for its apoptosis-inducing ability that is mediated by BIK.	7198	7608
28151486	Collectively, these results suggested that Star-PAP, by regulating the expression of BIK, induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway.	7609	7774
28151486	To clarify the influence of Star-PAP on breast cancer in vivo, by stably transfecting MDA-MB-468 cells with a Tet-On plasmid encoding Star-PAP, we established a cell line with doxycycline-inducible Star-PAP expression.	7775	7993
28151486	In the presence of doxycycline, highly expressed Star-PAP was induced and, consequently, the elevated expression of BIK was also detected (Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure S3a).	7994	8173
28151486	As observed above, in MDA-MB-468 cells, the doxycycline-induced Star-PAP overexpression also inhibited cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure S3b) and provoked cell apoptosis (Supplementary Figures S3c and d).	8174	8385
28151486	Moreover, the apoptosis of cells induced by the doxycycline-controlled Star-PAP overexpression also depended on BIK (Figure 4b).	8386	8514
28151486	We then incubated the Tet-On Star-PAP cells into the fourth inguinal mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice and the same amount of Tet-On control cells into the contralateral mammary fat pad.	8515	8700
28151486	The mice were immediately supplied with the diet containing doxycycline.	8701	8773
28151486	Tumor volume was measured weekly, and mice were killed for necropsy at the end of experiment.	8774	8867
28151486	As revealed by tumor volume and necropsy, the growth of breast cancer xenografts was significantly inhibited by the induced overexpression of Star-PAP (Figures 4c and d).	8868	9038
28151486	As shown by western blot using the lysates from tumor xenografts, the observed inhibition of tumor was probably caused by the BIK-mediated cell apoptosis (Figure 4e).	9039	9205
28151486	In conclusion, Star-PAP inhibited the progression of breast cancer in vivo.	9206	9281
28151486	The initiation of mitochondrial apoptosis is a key step that determines the effect of various chemotherapeutic agents and the drug sensitivity of cancer cells.24, 25 As shown above, Star-PAP induces apoptosis in the mitochondrial pathway, and therefore we investigated whether Star-PAP overexpression affects the drug sensitivity of breast cancer cells.	9282	9635
28151486	In MDA-MB-468 cells, doxycycline-induced upregulation of Star-PAP conferred drug sensitivity to cisplatin (~3-fold decrease in IC50) as well as doxorubicin (~4-fold decrease in IC50) (Figure 5a) and consequently increased the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (~35% increase) (Figure 5b).	9636	9920
28151486	Similarly, ectopic expression of Star-PAP sensitized SUM-159PT cells to cisplatin (~2.5-fold decrease in IC50) and doxorubicin (~2-fold decrease in IC50) (Supplementary Figures S4a and b) and thus augmented the apoptosis caused by doxorubicin (~30% increase) (Supplementary Figures S4c and d).	9921	10214
28151486	These results implied that increased Star-PAP levels may improve the effect of chemotherapeutics on tumor in vivo.	10215	10329
28151486	This notion was then verified by using Tet-On Star-PAP tumor xenografts in NOD/SCID mice.	10330	10419
28151486	When the tumors were palpable, doxorubicin was administered, and diet containing doxycycline was supplied at the beginning of treatment.	10420	10556
28151486	As evaluated by the tumor volume (Figure 5c) and weight (Figures 5d and e), the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin was markedly improved by overexpression of Star-PAP.	10557	10725
28151486	Taken together, these findings indicated that Star-PAP sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Inactivation or loss of tumor suppressor predisposes normal cells to the acquisition of oncogenic transformation.	10726	10974
28151486	We had shown that Star-PAP has potential tumor-suppressing activity in breast cancer, and then we wondered whether Star-PAP knockdown transforms normal breast cells.	10975	11140
28151486	To determine the role of Star-PAP in mammary epithelial cells, we first knocked down Star-PAP in untransformed breast cell MCF10A using two independent siRNAs (siStar-PAP#1, siStar-PAP#2).	11141	11329
28151486	When introduced separately into MCF10A cells, both of these siRNAs evidently decreased the levels of Star-PAP (Supplementary Figures S5a and b) and significantly promoted proliferation of cells (Supplementary Figure S5c).	11330	11551
28151486	We generated the stable Star-PAP knockdown cells by lentivirus-mediated transfection of shRNA.	11552	11646
28151486	As determined by soft agar colony-formation assay (Figure 6c) using two different clones (shStar-PAP#1, shStar-PAP#2; Figures 6a and b), these cells acquired the ability of anchorage-independent growth after Star-PAP knockdown.	11647	11874
28151486	However, when incubated in the mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice, Star-PAP knockdown MCF10A cells failed to form tumors (Figure 6d).	11875	12006
28151486	In addition, as shown by the change of cell morphology (Figure 6e) and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers (Figure 6f), Star-PAP knockdown induced MCF10A cells to undergo the process of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT).	12007	12237
28151486	Collectively, these data suggested that Star-PAP knockdown partially transforms the mammary epithelial cells.	12238	12347
28151486	Star-PAP is a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase that controls the expression of a subset of genes involved in various cellular processes.6 However, the physiological and pathological roles of Star-PAP largely remain unknown.	12348	12570
28151486	Here, we have shown that breast cancer manifests reduced Star-PAP expression and high Star-PAP level implies a better prognosis for breast cancer patients.	12571	12726
28151486	By regulating BIK expression, Star-PAP induced apoptosis of cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway, inhibited progression of breast cancer and sensitized breast tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs.	12727	12929
28151486	This study proved that Star-PAP has a potential tumor-suppressing role in breast cancer pathogenesis.	12930	13031
28151486	Star-PAP is encoded by gene TUT1 that is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues and has putative family members from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to homo sapiens.6, 8 In this study, we examined the expression of Star-PAP, both mRNA and protein levels, in breast cancer cells as well as clinical breast tumors, and we observed a consistent differential Star-PAP expression existing between the normal and cancerous breast condition (Figure 1).	13032	13479
28151486	Recently, the downregulation of Star-PAP has also been observed in osteosarcoma, the most common type of bone cancer, by PCR microarray using cDNA from clinical cancer tissues.11 These evidences suggest that a consistent dysregulation of Star-PAP may exist in various cancer types.	13480	13761
28151486	However, in order to comprehensively define the functional role of Star-PAP in human cancer, more investigations should be conducted in other tumor types.	13762	13916
28151486	In breast cancer cells, Star-PAP induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway that is tightly regulated by the BCL-2 protein family.	13917	14056
28151486	It has been established that Star-PAP controls the expression of BIK, a member of the BCL-2 family proapoptotic proteins,18, 26 through regulating 3′end processing of its mRNA in HEK293 cells.9 Therefore, we inspected the relation between Star-PAP and BIK in breast cancer cells (Figure 3c).	14057	14348
28151486	We revealed that by regulating the expression of BIK, Star-PAP acquires the ability to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (Figures 3a–e).	14349	14533
28151486	We also observed that the apoptosis-inducing ability of Star-PAP is abolished by BIK knockdown (Figures 3a, b and f).	14534	14651
28151486	Therefore, in breast cancer cells, the apoptosis induced by Star-PAP overexpression is dependent on BIK.	14652	14756
28151486	Given the fact that BIK is just one of the many target genes of Star-PAP, this finding gives a hint that Star-PAP may fulfill various physiological and pathological roles through its different target genes.	14757	14963
28151486	In this study, we proved that Star-PAP, by regulating expression of BIK, induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway.	14964	15112
28151486	Recently, several reports have suggested that the function of BIK goes beyond the regulation of apoptosis.	15113	15219
28151486	Through changing its subcellular localization, BIK is involved in response to oxidative stress caused by chemotherapy in several breast cancer cell lines.27 Moreover, BIK controls the expression of miRNAs as well as the autophagic flux in MDA-MB-231 cells.28 Thus, it would be interesting to investigate whether Star-PAP is involved in these new functions of BIK.	15220	15583
28151486	The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is commonly deregulated in cancer cells and plays a key role in cancer development.29, 30 Mitochondrial apoptosis is also a key factor that determines the effect of various chemotherapeutic agents and the drug sensitivity of cancer cells.24, 31 Because of the fact that BIK is an inducer of mitochondrial apoptosis, activating BIK has been used as an anticancer strategy.	15584	15991
28151486	However, it is a challenge to drug BIK by chemical compounds at the present time.	15992	16073
28151486	Several alternative ways to increase BIK expression have been established, such as vector-mediated BIK expression,32 adenovirus-mediated BIK expression and BIK-based gene therapy.33, 34, 35, 36 By promoting the polyadenylation of BIK mRNA, Star-PAP increases BIK expression and induces mitochondrial apoptosis of cancer cells (Figure 3b), indicating that Star-PAP overexpression may sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs.	16074	16502
28151486	In this study, utilizing breast cancer xenografts in NOD/SCID mice, we showed that ectopic overexpression of Star-PAP significantly inhibits cancer progression and sensitizes tumor to doxorubicin in vivo (Figures 4 and 5).	16503	16725
28151486	Although Star-PAP indicated an improved prognosis in breast cancer patients (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S2), it is not as good as in the xenografts.	16726	16881
28151486	We noticed that when Star-PAP was ectopically overexpressed, the levels of Star-PAP increased ~20-fold in xenografts (Figure 4e).	16882	17011
28151486	However, breast cancer patients have a low expression level of Star-PAP, and even the patients defined as Star-PAP-high group just have a slightly higher Star-PAP level than the Star-PAP-low group.	17012	17209
28151486	This may be the reason for the difference mentioned above.	17210	17268
28151486	Moreover, Star-PAPD218A, a mutant without poly(A) polymerase activity, lost the capacity of increasing BIK expression and failed to induce cell apoptosis, demonstrating that the polymerase activity of Star-PAP is necessary for the expression of BIK and the apoptosis-inducing role of Star-PAP (Figures 3a and d–f).	17269	17583
28151486	Considering that the polymerase activity of Star-PAP can be activated by chemical compounds, the enzyme activators of Star-PAP may indirectly augment BIK expression and thus facilitate BIK-based anticancer strategy for clinical treatments.	17584	17823
28151486	Therefore, Star-PAP is a valuable target for drug discovery.	17824	17884
28151486	Although both in vitro and in vivo evidences indicated that Star-PAP serves as a potential tumor-suppressing protein, knock down of Star-PAP only partially transformed mammary epithelial cells (Figure 6).	17885	18089
28151486	The Star-PAP knockdown MCF10A cells acquired the anchorage-independent growth ability, a crucial step in the acquisition of malignancy,37 but failed to produce tumors in NOD/SCID mice (Figures 6c and d).	18090	18293
28151486	These data suggested that partial loss of Star-PAP is not enough for the initiation of breast cancer, and also indicated that some other genetic alteration may be required to collectively complete the process of oncogenesis.	18294	18518
28151486	Moreover, Star-PAP knockdown induced EMT, a central driver of tumor malignancy,38, 39, 40 in mammary epithelial cells (Figures 6e and f).	18519	18656
28151486	It will be interesting to investigate how the lack of Star-PAP expression influences EMT and tumorigenesis.	18657	18764
28151486	In conclusion, we discovered the tumor-suppressing activity of Star-PAP in human breast cancer.	18765	18860
28151486	Star-PAP is downregulated in breast cancer and correlated with prognosis of breast cancer patients.	18861	18960
28151486	Star-PAP induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway, inhibits breast cancer progression and sensitizes breast cancer to chemotherapy drugs.	18961	19132
28151486	These findings advanced the understanding of breast cancer pathogenesis and suggested an alternative way to augment BIK expression for improving the clinical outcome of cancer chemotherapy treatments.	19133	19333

28151486	The colonies were visualized by Staining with Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C.	23530	23644
28151486	All animal procedures were conducted under the guidelines approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.	23645	23763
28151486	Female NOD/SCID mice (Vital River, Beijing, China) were used as host for breast cancer xenografts.	23764	23862
28151486	For tumor growth assay, the same amount (2 × 106 in 20% matrigel) of control and Tet-On Star-PAP cells were incubated into the contralateral fourth inguinal mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice.	23863	24053

28151486	Tumor was measured weekly and the volume was calculated as 1/2 × length × (width)2.	24415	24498
26684240	Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are relatively rare tumors accounting for about 0.5% of all human cancers [1–6].	0	136
26684240	Their incidence is significantly increasing based on data from recent population-based studies, and this phenomenon is explained by increased awareness of the disease entity and increased detection by advanced diagnostic modalities [1–6].	137	375
26684240	However, there has been no significant improvement in clinical outcome over the same period based on UK and US databases.	376	497
26684240	Recently, the FDA approved a few targeted agents for pancreatic NETs including sunitinib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and everolimus, an inhibitor of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signal pathway.	498	688
26684240	In pancreatic NET, sunitinib was compared to a placebo in a phase III trial of 171 pancreatic NET patients, and the median progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in the sunitinib arm (11.4 versus 5.5 months).	689	912
26684240	Based on these data, sunitinib was approved in the US for the treatment of progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic NET.	913	1036
26684240	In randomized controlled trials, everolimus demonstrated a 65% decrease in the risk for tumor progression in pancreatic NETs and a 23% decrease in patients with non-pancreatic NETs.	1037	1218
26684240	In an analysis of 159 patients with NETs, everolimus showed a response rate of 7.7% with a progression-free survival of 12 months.	1219	1349
26684240	We recently conducted a phase II trial for pazopanib in metastatic GEP-NET patients.	1350	1434
26684240	Our phase II study demonstrated an objective response rate of 18.9% (7 of 37, 95% CI 8.0 – 35.2) and a disease control rate (CR + confirmed PR + stable disease) of 75.7% (28 of 37, 95% CI, 58.8 – 88.2) in metastatic GEP-NETs.	1435	1660
26684240	Through this trial, we observed that a small subset of NET patients responded to pazopanib for > 6 months.	1661	1767
26684240	Recently, pancreatic NETs were characterized as having recurrent somatic mutations in MEN1, DAXX, ATRX, TSC, and PTEN on the basis of exome sequencing of 10 pancreatic NETs.	1768	1941
26684240	Small intestinal NETs showed recurrent somatic mutations and deletions in CDKN1B by whole exome and whole genome sequencing of 50 small intestinal NETs.	1942	2094
26684240	However, in another study of 48 small intestinal NETs by exome sequencing, recurrent mutations were not identified.	2095	2210
26684240	Rather, 197 single nucleotide variations in a preponderance of cancer-related genes were identified; 33% of small intestinal NET patients showed PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alteration, and 72% had therapeutically actionable genomic alterations.	2211	2449
26684240	The understanding of genomic profiles in GEP-NETs is still incomplete and the genetic alterations associated with drug responses have not been extensively studied.	2450	2613
26684240	In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study of pazopanib.	2614	2779
26684240	The mean number of somatic mutations varied widely from 20 to 4682, and the mutation counts for each case are shown in Figure 1.	2780	2908
26684240	One case with 4682 somatic mutations showed a mutation in MLH1 and additional missense mutations (ATR, PARP2, RBBP8, and RIF1) and splice site (XPC) mutations in DNA repair-related genes, and was thus classified as having a “hypermutated” phenotype.	2909	3158
26684240	Among 12 samples, eight showed mutations of more than one of the cancer-related genes (TP53, CNBD1, RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL) described by Lawrence et al. (Figure 2).	3159	3419
26684240	TP53 was recurrently mutated in three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were identified in two cases.	3420	3526
26684240	In our data set, we found the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in one primary NET from the small intestine, which was further confirmed by Sanger direct sequencing.	3527	3690
26684240	To exclude the possibility of the occurrence of mixed adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine features, or both, we performed an independent pathology review in terms of architecture, tumor grade, and chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 immunoreactivity by IHC (Supplementary Table 1).	3691	3969
26684240	All of the pathological features corresponded to GEP-NET, rather than mixed adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features.	3970	4090
26684240	The patient with BRAF V600E mutation was 52 years old and had a metastatic grade 1 neuroendocrine tumor.	4091	4195
26684240	The primary mass originated from the duodenum and had metastasized to multiple and distant lymph nodes at diagnosis.	4196	4312
26684240	The patient received capecitabine and oxaliplatin as a palliative first-line treatment.	4313	4400
26684240	After disease progression following the first-line therapy, the patient was enrolled in the pazopanib clinical trial.	4401	4518
26684240	Before starting pazopanib, mutational profiles of the primary tumor tissue were evaluated.	4519	4609
26684240	After two cycles of pazopanib therapy, the follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed tumor growth corresponding to disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria (Figure 3A).	4610	4793
26684240	Hence, this small intestinal NET patient with BRAF V600E mutation showed tumor progression after pazopanib treatment, although at the time of clinical trial enrollment, the genomic information was not available to the clinician because this trial was not a genome-selected trial.	4794	5073
26684240	We also identified the TP53 mutation in a patient with a dramatic response to pazopanib.	5074	5162
26684240	The patient had a grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinoma with gastric primary tumor location and extensive abdominal lymph node and peritoneal seeding nodule involvement.	5163	5327
26684240	After failing to respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy, the patient was treated with pazopanib.	5328	5419
26684240	After 2 cycles of pazopanib, the patient presented stable disease per the RECIST 1.1 criteria (Figure 3B).	5420	5526
26684240	At 4 months, CT evaluation (after 4 cycles) revealed definite radiologic tumor shrinkage corresponding to a partial response based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria (Figure 3B), which lasted for > 6 months.	5527	5726
26684240	Next, we surveyed the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NET patients.	5727	5833
26684240	We included GEP-NETs from the rectum (n = 26 consisting 19 G1, 4 G2 and 3 G3), colon (n = 7 consisting 6 G3 and one G1), pancreas (n = 4, G2), small intestine (n = 3 consisting one G3 and 2 G2), stomach (n = 3 consisting 2 G3 and one G1) and appendix (n = 1, adenocarcinoid).	5834	6109
26684240	We found BRAF V600E (G1 NET from rectum and two G3 NETs from colon) and BRAF G593S (G2 NET from pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%) in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs by Sanger sequencing.	6110	6303
26684240	The cohort consisted of GEP-NET from rectum (n = 27), colon (n = 6), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1).	6304	6453
26684240	All G1 and G2 NETs were positive for synaptophysin while rectal NETs and G3 NETs were negative for chromogranin (Figure 4).	6454	6577
26684240	The pathology and immunohistochemical staining of the four NETs with BRAF V600E or G593S mutation are shown in Figure 4 (G1, 1-cm rectal NET; G2, 8.5 cm pancreatic NET; G3, 6.5 cm colon NET; and G3, 3.2 cm colon NET).	6578	6795
26684240	The copy number profile of Korean GEP-NETs clearly demonstrates a difference in CNV pattern for each primary organ (Supplementary Figure 1).	6796	6936
26684240	The copy number of pancreatic NET relatively fluctuated interchromosomally.	6937	7012
26684240	In contrast, there was no concordance of arm-level copy number in small intestinal NET (Supplementary Table 2).	7013	7124
26684240	Our copy number results are similar to those of a previous small intestinal NET study.	7125	7211
26684240	Moreover, arm-level amplification of 19q13.31 (q value, 0.49) frequently occurred in the pancreas, i.e., in three of four amplification samples (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).	7212	7387
26684240	Fourteen CNV genes (MCL1, DNMT3A, MLJ1, MYD88, NOTCH1, HRAS, AKT1, TSC2, CREBBP, MARK3, CDH1, TP53, RARA, and BCL2) that may potentially be actionable are illustrated in Figure 2.	7388	7567
26684240	Whole exome sequencing results in two cases showed an exceptional response to pazopanib.	7568	7656
26684240	In these two cases, we could not find mutations in any of the 272 recurrently mutated genes.	7657	7749
26684240	Furthermore, we investigated the mutation status of genes in four pathways (hsa04010, MAPK signaling pathway; hsa04020, calcium signaling pathway; hsa04060, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction; hsa05200, pathways in cancer) involved in the primary mechanism of action of pazopanib.	7750	8034
26684240	We found a novel p.I16fs MAPKAPK5 mutation involved in the MAPK signaling pathway in a patient with pancreatic NET (Supplementary Figure 2).	8035	8175
26684240	As our GEP-NETs included various primary organs, we integrated our results with previously published results for pancreatic and small intestinal NETs [12, 13].	8176	8335
26684240	Most of the mutated genes did not overlap among the three datasets, suggesting different genomic alterations according to the primary location of the tumor (Supplementary Figure 3).	8336	8517
26684240	In this analysis, we found 272 recurrently mutated genes irrespective of the organ, and we used those recurrently mutated genes to construct a gene interaction network.	8518	8686
26684240	Finally, a network of 65 genes and 89 interactions was generated after genes that did not pass the GSEA test were trimmed (Supplementary Figure 4 and Table 2).	8687	8846
26684240	Genes related to cell cycle, Wnt signaling, E2F transcription factor network, DNA damage, p53 pathway, EGFR signaling, FGFR signaling, ERBB2 signaling, PDGFR signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were mostly associated with these genes (Table 2).	8847	9098
26684240	TP53 was the gene with the most recurrent mutations, as mutations were observed in 6 cases in various organs (Figure 5).	9099	9219
26684240	CDKN1B mutation was found in five cases of small intestinal NET, whereas MEN1 mutation was found in five cases of pancreatic NET.	9220	9349
26684240	Mutations of RB1, ATM, and TP53BP1 were each identified in four cases.	9350	9420
26684240	Overall, 46 of 72 samples (64%) had at least one mutation in at least one cancer-related gene.	9421	9515
26684240	The overall mutational profile of all GEP-NETs, including ours, is presented in Figure 5.	9516	9605
26684240	In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, phase II study of pazopanib and constructed a gene interaction network based on recurrently mutated genes with sequencing data from 72 GEP-NETs from three datasets [12, 13].	9606	9888
26684240	TP53 (n = 6), CDKN1B (n = 5), MEN1 (n = 5), RB1 (n = 4), ATM (n = 4), and TP53BP1 (n = 4) were frequently mutated genes.	9889	10009
26684240	CDK1B mutation was identified only in small intestinal NET, whereas MEN1 mutation was identified in pancreatic NET.	10010	10125
26684240	These genes are related to the cell cycle, Wnt, E2F transcription factor, and DNA damage pathways.	10126	10224
26684240	Overall, 46 of 72 samples (64%) had at least one mutation in cancer-related genes.	10225	10307
26684240	Importantly, we found one BRAF V600E mutation in small intestinal NET that did not respond to pazopanib and further confirmed that 3 (6.8%) of 44 GEP-NET patients harbored the BRAF V600E mutation.	10308	10504
26684240	BRAF V600E is an actionable mutation in melanoma with significantly prolonged survival when a BRAF inhibitor is administered in patients with this mutation, but it is not actionable in colorectal adenocarcinoma.	10505	10716
26684240	To exclude the possibility of mixed histology of adenocarcinoma and NET, we performed an independent pathology review and confirmed that all of the NET cases were not adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation.	10717	10935
26684240	Hence, BRAF V600E is a novel mutation found in NET that could potentially confer clinical benefit in this subset of patients.	10936	11061
26684240	BRAF V600E mutations have been reported as oncogenic mutation or resistant mutation to drugs in melanoma [26, 27] and thyroid cancer, GIST, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, and pediatric metanephric tumors.	11062	11274
26684240	The clinical implications of the BRAF V600E mutation in metastatic GEP-NET should thus be evaluated in clinical trials.	11275	11394
26684240	Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated a durable response to pazopanib, either as PR or achievement of stable disease (Figure 2).	11395	11541
26684240	The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is mutated in many cancer types, and various TP53 mutations (missense, frameshift [fs], or nonsense [*], leading to gain or loss of function) have been identified during tumorigenesis and metastasis.	11542	11772
26684240	Cancer cells with mutated TP53 have accelerated tumor growth associated with increased VEGF expression and neovascularization, which represents an important survival pathway [7, 8], resulting in a therapeutic advantage of anti-angiogenesis inhibitors in TP53 mutant cancer patients.	11773	12055
26684240	Although our findings should be confirmed in larger patient cohort, we postulate that GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutation may have enhanced angiogenesis that may be treated using an anti-angiogenesis inhibitor, such as pazopanib.	12056	12285
26684240	Only a few reports have described the sequencing data of GEP-NETs, and most of them were performed for NETs from a specific organ.	12286	12416
26684240	Jiao et al. performed exome sequencing in 10 pancreatic NETs and found recurrently mutated genes as follows: MEN1 (n = 5), DAXX (n = 3), PTEN (n = 2), and TSC2 (n = 2).	12417	12585
26684240	In a validation set of 68 cases, MEN1 was mutated in 44% cases, and DAXX and ATRX, which interacts with DAXX to form a chromatin remodeling complex, were mutated in 25% and 18% cases, respectively, with a mutually exclusive pattern.	12586	12818
26684240	Another important finding was that at least one gene involved in the mTOR pathway, such as TSC2 or PTEN, was mutated in 14% of cases.	12819	12952
26684240	This finding is consistent with observed clinical responses in pancreatic NET patients with the recently approved mTOR inhibitor everolimus.	12953	13093
26684240	Banck et al. performed exome sequencing of 48 small intestinal NETs and identified 197 protein-altering somatic single nucleotide variations with a preponderance of cancer-related genes such as FGFR2, MEN1, HOOK3, EZH2, MLF1, CARD11, VHL, NONO, and SMAD1.	13094	13349
26684240	However, most of these mutations were not recurrently identified.	13350	13415
26684240	Using an integrated approach combining mutational and copy number data, Banck et al. found that 33% of small intestinal NET patients showed PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alteration and 72% had therapeutically actionable genomic alterations.	13416	13648
26684240	Francis et al. identified mutations of 1,230 genes by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing of 50 small intestinal NETs.	13649	13771
26684240	Approximately 90% of mutations were not recurrently mutated, and only CDKN1B was recurrently mutated in 10% of patients.	13772	13892
26684240	Moreover, only a small number of mutated genes overlapped with previously reported small intestinal NETs or pancreatic NETs, suggesting different genomic alterations according to the primary location of the tumor or that many of the observed mutations were passenger and not driver mutations.	13893	14185
26684240	In our data sets where our results were combined with previously published results [12, 13], we confirmed that most of the mutated genes did not overlap among the three datasets, including ours.	14186	14380
26684240	Therefore, we constructed a gene interaction network of 65 genes and 89 interactions using 272 recurrently mutated genes.	14381	14502
26684240	As a result, traditional cancer-associated pathways, such as cell cycle, Wnt signaling pathway, E2F transcription factor network, DNA damage, p53 pathway, EGFR signaling, FGFR signaling, ERBB2 signaling, PDGFR signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were mostly associated with the 65 genes.	14503	14796
26684240	Notably, 46 of 72 samples (64%) showed at least one mutation of these 65 genes, suggesting that about two-thirds of GEP-NET patients may have a benefit from a drug targeting these pathways.	14797	14986
26684240	In this study, we found that a novel MAPKAPK5 mutation involved in the MAPK signaling pathway affected the mechanism of action of pazopanib in a pazopanib responder.	14987	15152
26684240	MAPKAPK5 is known to be involved in tumor suppression, angiogenesis, and cytoskeletal remodeling through interaction with a variety of substrates and is associated with neurological processes, including neurosecretion.	15153	15371
26684240	However, MAPKAPK5 mutations have not been documented in GEP-NET.	15372	15436
26684240	Our results will facilitate the identification of biomarkers for the pazopanib response and will form the basis for a further large-scale genomic study.	15437	15589
26684240	The limitation of this study is that it was performed in a relatively small number of samples from various primary organs.	15590	15712
26684240	To overcome this limitation, we tried to integrate our results with previously published data of pancreatic and small intestinal NETs.	15713	15847
26684240	To our knowledge, the current study is the first using NET samples from patients enrolled in a clinical trial to identify genetic alterations associated with drug responses.	15848	16021
26684240	We performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NET tumor specimens from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study after obtaining written informed consent, and the samples were processed using protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards.	16022	16307
26684240	We extracted DNA from fresh tumor tissue (n = 2) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (n = 10) as previously described.	16308	16440
26684240	The primary sites of GEP-NETs included rectum (n = 3), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 2), stomach (n = 1), and unknown primary sites (n = 2), and all the cases had hepatic metastasis at presentation.	16441	16648
26684240	An independent pathologic review by an expert gastrointestinal pathologist (G.L.)	16649	16730
26684240	is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.	16731	16770
26684240	The histological grade was categorized as follows: carcinoid tumors and well differentiated NETs were classified as Grade 1 tumors, atypical carcinoid and well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas were classified as Grade 2 tumors, and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas were classified as Grade 3 tumors.	16771	17093
26684240	For validation of the BRAF mutation in an independent cohort, we extracted DNA from 44 primary GEP-NETs (> 1cm in size or > Grade 2) and Sanger-sequenced them as previously described.	17094	17277
26684240	All research involving human participants have been approved by SMC Institutional Review Board (IRB), and all clinical investigation has been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.	17278	17499
26684240	Sequencing data were generated using a protocol that has been detailed previously [13, 17].	17500	17591
26684240	Briefly, exonic regions were captured using the Agilent V2 capture probe set and sequenced by 76-bp paired-end reads using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument.	17592	17748
26684240	A median of 129,621,217 total reads was generated for each sample, 97.72–99.28% reads of which were aligned to the target exome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA), resulting in a median coverage of each base of 100X.	17749	17970
26684240	Downstream sequencing analysis was performed as previously described [13, 17].	17971	18049
26684240	Before mutation and indel calling, sequencing reads were locally realigned to improve the detection of indels and decrease the number of false-positive SNVs caused by misaligned reads, particularly at the 3′ end as previously described [13, 17].	18050	18295
26684240	For mutation detection, > 14 reads in the tumors and > 8 reads in the normal samples were necessary to call candidate somatic base substitutions, and indels were detected using MuTect.	18296	18480
26684240	Germline mutations were detected using the UnifiedGenotyper.	18481	18541
26684240	All somatic mutations were manually reviewed and visually confirmed using the Integrated Genomics Viewer (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/).	18542	18684
26684240	Copy number variation (CNV) was analyzed by GISTIC 2.0, and we investigated GEP-NET CNV genes from drug targets defined in a previous study.	18685	18825
26684240	To investigate the genetic characteristics of GEP-NET, we integrated our mutation profiles with previously published data for pancreatic NETs (n = 10) and small intestinal NETs (n = 50).	18826	19012
26684240	To compose the gene set, silent mutations were eliminated and then recurrently mutated genes (mutations in greater than or equal to 2) were selected.	19013	19162
26684240	As a result, 136 genes were entered as a gene set.	19163	19213
26684240	The interaction network was constructed from the input gene set by ReactomeFI of Cytoscape [22, 23] [PMID: 20482850, PMID: 14597658].	19214	19347
26684240	Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the reactome pathway was performed within a cutoff FDR of ≤ 0.01.	19348	19453
26684240	Finally, the interaction network was trimmed to only include genes that passed the GSEA and first neighbors of GSEA genes.	19454	19576
27090298	The multifunctional protein complex FASN (fatty acid synthase) is indispensable in the synthesis of saturated straight-chain fatty acids from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), via malonyl-CoA1.	0	184
27090298	Excess energy intake and increased insulin levels has the effect of upregulating the FASN gene expression23; suggesting this enzyme is implicated in energy homeostasis.	185	353
27090298	Altered FASN activity/expression has been reported in metabolic syndrome and overweight subjects who exhibit obesity, inflammation, hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis, indicating a relationship between FASN and the pathogenesis of hypertension and metabolic dysfunction45.	354	658
27090298	Adipose tissue from hypertensive individuals showed decreased levels of FASN mRNA6.	659	742
27090298	The subcutaneous adipose tissue of the obese subjects also showed decreased FASN expression compared to lean subjects7891011, and has exhibited negative correlation with insulin resistance markers such as glucose, HbA1c and HOMA-IR678.	743	978
27090298	In adipose tissue of insulin resistant type 2 diabetic patients, FASN mRNA expression is markedly decreased in response to reduced insulin signalling12.	979	1131
27090298	In vivo, the cellular concentrations of poly-unsaturated fatty acids and sterols are the main factors regulating the expression of FASN, when their concentrations decrease in the cell, the transcription of the FASN gene increases.	1132	1362
27090298	FASN can be actively removed out of the cell when AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) is activated9.	1363	1483
27090298	Circulating FASN is thus thought to reflect previous intracellular enzymatic activity9.	1484	1571
27090298	In normal cells, low levels of FASN are present due to abundant dietary lipids.	1572	1651
27090298	However, FASN is highly expressed in hepatic, adipose tissue and in neoplastic cells, where FASN expression and the synthesis of new fatty acids are up-regulated as a survival advantage to low-fuel supply1314.	1652	1861
27090298	The placenta also expresses high amounts of FASN1516.	1862	1915
27090298	Trophoblastic cells may use de novo lipid synthesis in order to maintain essential placental actions for development.	1916	2033
27090298	This strategy may also be an evolutionary favoured compensatory mechanism, as the lipid supply from food intake may become limited during pregnancy.	2034	2182
27090298	The role of FASN in human pregnancy is poorly studied.	2183	2237
27090298	A recent report indicates that maternal obesity and gestational diabetes are related to less expression of FASN in adipose tissue of subcutaneous and visceral origin17.	2238	2406
27090298	In mice with a lipid-poor diet during gestation, an augmented expression of FASN in adipose tissue was reported18.	2407	2521
27090298	Despite the core physiological role of FASN in maintaining normal levels of lipids and glucose, as well as energy homeostasis and its high expression in placenta, the relationship between the circulating form of this molecule, blood pressure and metabolism during human pregnancy has not been characterized.	2522	2829
27090298	In this work, we studied the associations of circulating FASN with blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters in normal human pregnancy.	2830	2982
27090298	We also studied whether circulating FASN was related to placental FASN expression.	2983	3065
27090298	Table 1 summarizes the clinical and laboratory findings of the study subjects.	3066	3144
27090298	Second- and third-trimester SBP decreased with increasing circulating FASN.	3145	3220
27090298	Higher circulating FASN was also related to a more favourable metabolic condition, specifically lower fasting glucose and insulin, post load glucose, HbAc1, HOMA-IR and C-peptide (all p < 0.05 to p < 0.001; Table 2).	3221	3437
27090298	Circulating FASN was inversely related to placental weight and birth weight (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01; Table 2), and directly associated with placental FASN mRNA expression (p < 0.001; Table 2).	3438	3628
27090298	Placental FASN expression was also inversely related to the weight of the placenta (p < 0.05), however, it was unrelated to blood pressure or to metabolic parameters in pregnant women (data not shown).	3629	3830
27090298	A threshold association was evident for circulating FASN and BP, metabolic variables and the parameters of newborns, with women in the highest tertile of circulating FASN exhibiting lower SBP in the second and third trimester of gestation, DBP in the third trimester, fasting glucose and insulin, post load glucose HOMA-IR, placental FASN expression, placental weight and birth weight SDS, and higher HMW-adiponectin compared to other tertiles of circulating FASN (Table 3 and Fig.	3831	4312

27090298	In multiple regression analyses (Table 4), circulating FASN remained independently related to the second- (β = −0.231, p = 0.008) and third- (β = −0.333, p < 0.001) trimester SBP, fasting and post-load glucose (β = −0.204, p = 0.028 and β = −0.261, p = 0.004, respectively), HOMA-IR (β = −0.257, p = 0.006), and placental and birth weight (β = −0.214, p = 0.030 and β = −0.194, p = 0.015, respectively), even when confounding variables where introduced in the model.	4334	4800
27090298	Placental FASN expression also remained correlated to placental weight (β = −0.238, p = 0.047) independently of confounding variables in multivariate analyses (Table 5).	4801	4970
27090298	Higher circulating FASN was associated with a more favourable blood pressure and metabolic profile, with lower placental weight and birth weight and with higher placental FASN expression in healthy pregnant women.	4971	5184
27090298	The independent associations of circulating FASN with blood pressure and with glucose- and insulin-related markers concur with previous reports in overweight and hypertensive subjects that showed decreased FASN expression in their fat depots619.	5185	5430
27090298	Additionally, a negative relation between FASN expression and insulin resistance markers, has been reported in adipose tissue of healthy subjects without diabetes68.	5431	5596
27090298	Evidence, however, exists for an increased FASN expression and higher circulating FASN in obesity-related disorders520.	5597	5716
27090298	These discrepancies may be explained, at least in part, by the apparently opposing effects of insulin on FASN, causing both long-term upregulation of FASN expression and short-term FASN inactivation; the latter being dependent on the insulinemic state of the individual21.	5717	5989
27090298	Our study was based on healthy pregnant women with no comorbidities.	5990	6058
27090298	These associations may vary in patients with chronic insulin resistance including patients with vascular or metabolic comorbidities and long-standing obesity.	6059	6217
27090298	Although the metabolic regulation of FASN is not yet completely understood, these current results suggest that circulating FASN may be among the factors integrating blood pressure regulation and energy metabolism during gestation.	6218	6448
27090298	AMPK may provide a plausible molecular mechanism for these associations.	6449	6521
27090298	Into the cell, FASN activity is limited by the activation of the nuclear AMPK enzyme that removes FASN from the cytosolic milieu into the extracellular space9.	6522	6681
27090298	AMPK activation is also known to protect mice from developing hypertension22 and metabolic disease.	6682	6781
27090298	Preeclampsia is a systemic disorder of pregnancy originating in the placenta.	6782	6859
27090298	Research has demonstrated that several placental antiangiogenic factors are liberated into circulation during pregnancy and cause widespread endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and other systemic manifestations of preeclampsia23.	6860	7091
27090298	Besides adipose tissue, FASN is highly expressed in normal trophoblastic cells15.	7092	7173
27090298	FASN provides trophoblasts with an alternative mechanism to maintain a regular supply of fatty acids to keep up with the metabolic demands of this organ.	7174	7327
27090298	Changes in FASN activity may thus cause trophoblastic cell dysfunction which may, in turn, affect the regulation of blood pressure and energy metabolism during gestation.	7328	7498
27090298	Recent data indicate that FASN expression in human placenta is influenced by maternal cholesterolemia and glycemia16.	7499	7616
27090298	We do not exclude the possibility that mRNA FASN levels may be also associated with metabolic parameters in pregnant women with comorbidities, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia.	7617	7819
27090298	Our present results suggest a better correlation of protein rather than mRNA levels with energy metabolism in healthy pregnant women.	7820	7953
27090298	Our results showed negative associations of placental weight and/or birth weight with circulating FASN and placental FASN expression.	7954	8087
27090298	The human placenta is comprised by a trophoblast layer that physically limits maternal and fetal blood flows.	8088	8197
27090298	Maternal plasma lipoproteins cross the placenta to supply the fetus with lipids24.	8198	8280
27090298	Fetal tissues and the placenta also synthetize fatty acids and cholesterol to compensate for a possible lipid deficiency during pregnancy25.	8281	8421
27090298	Therefore, we would suggest that the changes in FASN expression in smaller placentas may be a compensatory mechanism to regulate maternal blood pressure and metabolic parameters in normal pregnancies with lower fetoplacental growth.	8422	8654
27090298	Increased FASN expression may regulate the fatty acid outflow from other tissues, such as adipose tissue, preventing placentas from being too big or too small, as well as contributing to an improvement in the physiological insulin-resistant state that is observed during pregnancy.	8655	8936
27090298	In this sense, during pregnancy, to compensate for a poor lipid diet, several adaptations of the maternal metabolism may be the increasing expression of those genes implicated in the synthesis of fatty acids (among them FASN) in the maternal tissues including liver, adipose tissue and the mammary glands18.	8937	9244
27090298	We are aware of some limitations in our study.	9245	9291
27090298	A cause-effect relationship cannot be described between circulating FASN and blood pressure or metabolic variables in pregnant women by the present study design.	9292	9453
27090298	The exact link between circulating FASN and blood pressure in women with pathological conditions, such as preeclampsia or metabolic disorders cannot be discerned in our healthy study population.	9454	9648
27090298	Moreover, circulating FASN was taken at a single point in the second trimester.	9649	9728
27090298	Serial measurements of FASN throughout the pregnancy and in maternal hypertensive or dysglycemic conditions would have added greater value to our present results.	9729	9891
27090298	In conclusion, circulating FASN was associated with a more favourable blood pressure and metabolic profile and with lower placental and birth weight.	9892	10041
27090298	Circulating FASN and placental FASN expression were closely related.	10042	10110
27090298	Future studies will clarify whether circulating FASN of placental origin regulates placental and fetal growth, and (thereby) has a favourable effect on blood pressure and insulin sensitivity in the pregnant mother.	10111	10325
27090298	115 pregnant Caucasian women experiencing normal pregnancies and delivering normal birth weight infants were included in the study.	10326	10457

27090298	Birth weight and length were adjusted for gestational age and sex according to regional norms28.	11865	11961
27090298	All serum samples for assessing circulating FASN and metabolic markers were obtained under fasting conditions between 24 and 28 gestation weeks, when glucose tolerance assessment was carried out.	11962	12157
27090298	All women were subjected to fasting glucose and oral glucose tolerance test (1 h with 50 g glucose).	12158	12258

28075473	Although the immune system generally recognizes abnormal proteins on tumor cells as tumor antigens, spontaneous immune responses are too weak to suppress tumor growth.	0	167
28075473	To overcome this problem, a variety of adjuvants, including toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, are investigated to potentiate antitumor immunity.	168	312
28075473	The bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), historically known for its effective adjuvant properties, is often used in the treatment of cancer patients (1).	313	461
28075473	The innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns expressed on microorganisms through corresponding TLRs, and the activation of innate immunity by TLRs produces proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12, leading to the subsequent induction of adaptive immune responses (2,3).	462	783
28075473	IL-12 is produced by macrophages (MΦ) and dendritic cells (DC) and dictates the differentiation of CD4 Th1 cells, which produce interferon (IFN)-γ and activate natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic CD8 T cells (4).	784	1000
28075473	IFN-γ plays an important role in the prevention of primary tumor development and intracellular pathogen invasion (5–7).	1001	1120
28075473	Among the different TLR ligands, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria exhibits antitumor activity in addition to marked toxicity (8).	1121	1270
28075473	The study of the bioactivity of LPS from various species revealed that LPS prepared from Bordetella pertussis and a synthetic analog of the LPS lipid A subunit are less toxic than E. coli LPS, and display antitumor effects (9,10).	1271	1501
28075473	Recent studies have revealed that IL-23/IL-17 signaling plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in humans and in mice (11–16).	1502	1644
28075473	IL-17 is primarily produced by T cells and acts on tumor cells and tumor-associated stromal cells to induce angiogenesis and the production of IL-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinases.	1645	1830
28075473	IL-23 is produced by Mϕ/DC and facilitates the expansion and survival of IL-17-producing CD4 T (Th17) cells and therefore, the production of IL-17 (17,18).	1831	1986
28075473	Moreover, it has become evident that a combination of IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β induces Th17 differentiation from naive T cells (19,20).	1987	2141
28075473	Since Mϕ/DC produces both antitumor (IL-12) and tumor-promoting (IL-6/IL-23) cytokines upon stimulation with TLR ligands (21,22), the regulation of this balance is critical for TLR-based cancer immunotherapy (17,18).	2142	2358
28075473	Moreover, IL-17 stimulates tumor cells and tumor-surrounding cells to induce IL-6 expression, which in turn leads to the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (16,23).	2359	2561
28075473	STAT3 is linked to numerous oncogenic signaling pathways and is constitutively activated both in tumor cells and in immune cells under tumor microenvironment-like conditions.	2562	2736
28075473	Thus, ideal candidate molecules for tumor immunotherapy are TLR-based immunomodulators that do not induce or partially induce IL-6/IL-23.	2737	2874
28075473	While exploring TLR4 responsiveness of the material extracted from algae and cyanobacteria (24), we found that LPS phenol-water extracts from Spirulina (Arthrospira) were able to induce IL-12.	2875	3067
28075473	Noteworthy, Spirulina LPS showed a much lower in vitro induction of IL-6 and IL-23 by Mϕ/DC than E. coli LPS.	3068	3177
28075473	Spirulina is a gram-negative, oxygenic, photosynthetic, filamentous cyanobacterium (blue-green alga), and since the Aztec civilization in Mexico, it has been widely used as a nutritional and therapeutic supplement (25).	3178	3397
28075473	Spirulina LPS is reported to be less toxic compared to LPS from Salmonella abortus (26), but its effects on cytokine production or antitumor activities have not been studied extensively.	3398	3584
28075473	Thus, it would be very interesting to study how Spirulina LPS affects tumor growth and in vivo production of inflammatory cytokines.	3585	3717
28075473	Although most experiments examined the in vitro production of IL-17-associated inflammatory cytokines thus far, the expression patterns of these cytokines in tumor host tissue remain to be established.	3718	3919
28075473	We report here that Spirulina LPS did not induce or only partially induced IL-6 and IL-23 and efficiently suppressed the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma MH134 in a TLR4-dependent manner, by reducing the serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23, while increasing those of IFN-γ.	3920	4191
28075473	Interestingly, anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) clearly suppressed tumor growth as efficiently as Spirulina LPS.	4192	4310
28075473	Furthermore, Spirulina LPS was quite effective in inhibiting spontaneous development of mammary tumors in an oncogene transgenic mouse model.	4311	4452

28075473	Spirulina or E. coli LPS was added at the initiation of the culture to evaluate its effect on IL-17 production.	9488	9599
28075473	The levels of IL-17 in the culture supernatants were evaluated by ELISA.	9600	9672
28075473	Whole spleen cells (8×105/well) were cultured in flat-bottomed 96-well plates in 10% FCS RPMI-1640 medium in the presence or absence of graded doses of Spirulina LPS or E. coli LPS.	9673	9854
28075473	Five days later, the cultured cells were collected and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-B220 mAb (RA3-6B2, rat IgG2a, no.	9855	9977
28075473	553088, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).	9978	10021
28075473	B220+ cells were counted as B cells using a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).	10022	10127
28075473	Briefly, 2.5×106 target cells were labeled with 25 µCi of 51Cr sodium chromate for 60 min at 37°C in 10% FCS RPMI-1640 medium.	10128	10254
28075473	After washing, 51Cr-labeled target cells (1×104) and effector cells were mixed in flat-bottomed 96-well plates at the indicated effector/target (E/T) ratio.	10255	10411
28075473	After 4 h of incubation, the radioactivity in the cell-free supernatants was measured using a 1470 Automatic Gamma Counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).	10412	10567
28075473	Percentage-specific lysis for 51Cr release was calculated according to the following formula: % specific lysis = [(experimental - spontaneous) release] / [(maximal - spontaneous) release] ×100.	10568	10761
28075473	Cytokine levels in serum or culture supernatants were quantified by sandwich ELISA.	10762	10845
28075473	The following pairs of capture and biotinylated detection rat anti-mouse mAbs were used: R4-6A2 (no.	10846	10946
28075473	551216) and XMG1.2 (no.	10947	10970
28075473	554410) for IFN-γ, TC11-18H10 (no.	10971	11005
28075473	555068) and TC11-8H4 (no.	11006	11031
28075473	555067) for IL-17, 9A5 (no.	11032	11059
28075473	554658) and C17.8 (no.	11060	11082
28075473	554476) for IL-12(p35/40), MP5-20F3 (no.	11083	11123
28075473	554400) and MP5-32C11 (no.	11124	11150
28075473	554402) for IL-6, and A75-2 (no.	11151	11183
28075473	555052) and A75-3 (no.	11184	11206
28075473	555053) for TGF-β1 (all were purchased from BD Biosciences).	11207	11267
28075473	For IL-23(p19/40), rat anti-mouse IL-23p19 (G23-8, no.	11268	11322
28075473	14-7232-85, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and biotinylated anti-IL-12p40 (C17.8, BD Biosciences) were used.	11323	11433
28075473	The ELISA assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	11434	11511
28075473	Differences in mean values between groups were calculated using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fischer's exact test.	11512	11662
28075473	P-values of the Student's t tests are shown unless otherwise indicated.	11663	11734
28075473	To examine the antitumor activities of Spirulina LPS in comparison with that of E. coli LPS, we inoculated hepatocellular carcinoma MH134 cells i.d.	11735	11883
28075473	into syngeneic C3H/HeN and TLR4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice (30), followed by i.p. administration of different doses of Spirulina LPS or E. coli LPS 6 days later.	11884	12038
28075473	The injection with different doses of Spirulina LPS suppressed the tumor growth in C3H/HeN but not in C3H/HeJ mice, to the same degree as E. coli LPS treatment (Fig.	12039	12204
28075473	1A).	12205	12209
28075473	This suggests that Spirulina LPS as well as E. coli LPS reduced tumor growth in a TLR4-dependent manner.	12210	12314
28075473	In order to assess the involvement of T cells in the Spirulina LPS-induced antitumor effect, we administered anti-CD4 and/or anti-CD8 mAbs to deplete the T-cell subsets before Spirulina LPS injection.	12315	12515
28075473	While injection of both anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAbs completely abolished the antitumor activity of Spirulina LPS, anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 mAb alone did not result in a strong effect (Fig.	12516	12699
28075473	1B).	12700	12704
28075473	In accordance with the results of the in vivo T-cell depletion, immunohistochemical examinations revealed the enhancement of infiltration of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the tumor masses upon administration of Spirulina LPS (Fig.	12705	12933
28075473	1C).	12934	12938
28075473	These results suggest that CD4 and CD8 T cells are both involved in the antitumor effect induced by Spirulina LPS.	12939	13053
28075473	To examine whether Spirulina LPS induces immunity against MH134 tumors, we reinoculated MH134 cells into C3H/HeN mice that had been implanted with an MH134 tumor and were treated with saline, E. coli, or Spirulina LPS, followed by surgical resection of primary tumors 5 days before the re-challenge.	13054	13353
28075473	The growth rate of the reimplanted tumors reduced even in saline-treated mice, compared with that in untreated mice implanted with only new tumor cells without the first inoculum of MH134 tumor cells (Fig.	13354	13559
28075473	2A), implicating the induction of antitumor immunity without LPS administration when the primary tumor was removed.	13560	13675
28075473	Spirulina LPS induced a stronger resistance to reimplanted MH134 tumors than saline (Fig.	13676	13765
28075473	2A).	13766	13770
28075473	In contrast, the tumor growth rate in E. coli LPS-treated mice was comparable to that in saline-treated mice (Fig.	13771	13885
28075473	2A).	13766	13770
28075473	These results suggest that while Spirulina LPS facilitated the generation of immunity against MH134 tumors, E. coli LPS did not enhance secondary antitumor immune response.	13891	14063
28075473	Since E. coli LPS was effective in the prevention of primary tumor growth as shown in Fig.	14064	14154
28075473	1A and is known to exhibit antitumor activity partly through activation of NK cells, we evaluated the ability of E. coli and Spirulina LPS to activate NK cells.	14155	14315
28075473	Indeed, spleen cells from C3H/HeN mice injected with E. coli LPS showed remarkable toxicity towards NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells and a weak but significant toxicity towards MH134 cells, whereas Spirulina LPS failed to activate NK cells (Fig.	14316	14553
28075473	2B).	14554	14558
28075473	NK activation was not induced in C3H/HeJ mice, not even when E. coli LPS was administered (Fig.	14559	14654
28075473	2B).	14554	14558
28075473	Thus, this result may explain why E. coli LPS elicited antitumor effects against the primary tumor, regardless of its failure to enhance adaptive immunity to tumors.	14660	14825
28075473	IFN-γ plays a crucial role in the prevention of tumor development (6), whereas IL-17 and IL-23 are considered to promote tumor growth by inducing inflammation and by regulating the expansion/survival of Th17 cells, respectively (11,14–16).	14826	15065
28075473	We measured serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-23 in tumor-bearing C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice treated with saline, E. coli, or Spirulina LPS.	15066	15207
28075473	E. coli and Spirulina LPS (100 µg) markedly increased serum IFN-γ levels in C3H/HeN mice with a peak response at days 7 and 14 after tumor inoculation, respectively (Fig.	15208	15378
28075473	3A).	15379	15383
28075473	A low dose of Spirulina LPS (20 µg) induced slight but significant IFN-γ production from days 7 to 14.	15384	15486
28075473	However, the serum levels of IFN-γ were not elevated in C3H/HeJ mice at any time, not even after injection of either LPS.	15487	15608
28075473	The treatment with anti-CD4 mAb or a combination of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAbs abrogated the increase in serum IFN-γ in C3H/HeN mice receiving Spirulina LPS, whereas anti-CD8 mAb alone slightly diminished the activity of Spirulina LPS to induce IFN-γ (Fig.	15609	15865
28075473	3D).	15866	15870
28075473	On the other hand, serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23 in saline-treated C3H/HeN mice gradually increased during tumor progression and reached a maximum on day 21 (Fig.	15871	16035
28075473	3B and C).	16036	16046
28075473	However, serum levels of IL-6 only showed an approximately 2-fold increase in saline-treated tumor-bearing mice even on day 21 as compared to non-treated mice (data not shown).	16047	16223
28075473	Noteworthy, Spirulina LPS significantly reduced IL-17 and IL-23 levels, while E. coli LPS hardly suppressed IL-17 production on day 21 (Fig.	16224	16364
28075473	3B and C).	16036	16046
28075473	On the contrary, E. coli LPS enhanced serum levels of IL-23 in tumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice on day 7 and 14.	16376	16482
28075473	Taken together, these results support the notion that Spirulina LPS induces antitumor immune responses through the induction of IFN-γ mostly by CD4 T cells and suppressed serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23, whereas E. coli LPS exerts its antitumor effect primarily through activation of NK cells.	16483	16776
28075473	We have previously shown that antigen-presenting cells (APCs)-expressing tumor Ag and tumor-reactive T cells are both stimulated in vivo in tumor-bearing mice, and that in vitro culture of spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice at early stages leads to cytokine production without exogenous addition of tumor Ag as a result of the collaboration between antitumor T cells and APCs (29,31).	16777	17163
28075473	We tested whether in vivo treatment with E. coli or Spirulina LPS affects the in vitro production of IFN-γ by culturing spleen cells from MH134 tumor-bearing mice.	17164	17327
28075473	Spirulina LPS clearly enhanced IFN-γ production in spleen cells of tumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice, whereas E. coli LPS was unable to upregulate IFN-γ production (Fig.	17328	17490
28075473	3D).	15866	15870
28075473	These results implicate that Spirulina LPS enhances IFN-γ production through the generation of memory T cells.	17496	17606
28075473	Since Spirulina LPS reduced serum IL-17 levels in tumor-bearing mice while increasing IFN-γ levels and because IFN-γ negatively regulates the generation of Th17 cells (32,33), we investigated whether IL-17 downregulation by Spirulina LPS occurs via inhibition of the induction of IL-17-producing cells by facilitating IFN-γ production, or alternatively by directly downregulating IL-17-producing cells.	17607	18009
28075473	To address this question, spleen cells from OVA-specific TCR transgenic DO11.10 mice were stimulated by OVA with or without E. coli or Spirulina LPS and in the presence or absence of anti-IFN-γ mAb.	18010	18208
28075473	Spirulina LPS significantly suppressed IL-17 production by DO11.10 spleen cells in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of the presence of anti-IFN-γ mAb.	18209	18362
28075473	However, E. coli LPS augmented IL-17 production (Fig.	18363	18416
28075473	4A), possibly because of its ability to induce IL-6 (Fig.	18417	18474
28075473	5A).	18475	18479
28075473	In addition, it is noteworthy that anti-IFN-γ mAb enhanced IL-17 production by DO11.10 spleen cells in response to OVA without the addition of either LPS (Fig.	18480	18639
28075473	4A), indicating that IFN-γ regulates IL-17-producing cells.	18640	18699
28075473	Thus, Spirulina LPS suppresses the in vivo production of IL-17 with or without involvement of IFN-γ.	18700	18800
28075473	Moreover, although Spirulina LPS inhibited IL-17 production when CD4 T cells from OVA-primed C3H/HeJ mice were co-cultured with C3H/HeN APCs in the presence of OVA, it failed to suppress IL-17 production when OVA-primed C3H/HeJ CD4 T cells were stimulated with OVA in the context of C3H/HeJ APCs (Fig.	18801	19102
28075473	4B).	19103	19107
28075473	These results suggest that Spirulina LPS acted on APCs to inhibit the generation of Th17 cells in a TLR4-dependent manner.	19108	19230
28075473	Thus far, our results are consistent with the notion that the antitumor effect of Spirulina LPS is caused by the downregulation of IL-17 production.	19231	19379
28075473	To examine whether neutralization of IL-17 by anti-IL-17 mAb would result in a reduction of tumor growth in mice in the absence of Spirulina LPS, we injected anti-IL-17 or anti-IFN-γ mAb into C3H/HeN mice 1 day before and 4 days after MH134 tumor implantation, and monitored tumor development.	19380	19673
28075473	As expected, anti-IL-17 mAb markedly suppressed tumor growth compared to control rat IgG antibodies, whereas anti-IFN-γ mAb slightly enhanced tumor development (Fig.	19674	19839
28075473	4C).	19840	19844
28075473	Importantly, mice receiving anti-IL-17 mAb exhibited high levels of serum IFN-γ (Fig.	19845	19930
28075473	4D).	19931	19935
28075473	In addition, in vitro culture of spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice treated with anti-IL-17 mAb resulted in the production of large amounts of IFN-γ (Fig.	19936	20092
28075473	4D).	19931	19935
28075473	These results indicate that IL-17 provides an environment suitable for tumor growth partly by inhibiting the generation of IFN-γ-producing T cells.	20098	20245
28075473	It was recently reported that IL-17 is mainly produced by Th17 cells, and that both IL-6 and TGF-β are indispensable for the generation of Th17 cells (20).	20246	20401
28075473	To test the ability of Spirulina LPS to induce IL-6 and TGF-β, normal C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice were injected i.p. with E. coli or Spirulina LPS and serum cytokine levels were measured 4 h later.	20402	20596
28075473	C3H/HeN mice produced high levels of IL-6 in response to E. coli LPS, but showed only a small response upon stimulation with Spirulina LPS (Fig.	20597	20741
28075473	5A).	18475	18479
28075473	Contrary to IL-6, the substantial TGF-β levels present in serum of untreated groups of both strains were not significantly elevated when stimulated with E. coli LPS (Fig.	20747	20917
28075473	5A).	18475	18479
28075473	However, Spirulina LPS slightly reduced TGF-β levels, but only in C3H/HeN mice (Fig.	20923	21007
28075473	5A).	18475	18479
28075473	Noteworthy, E. coli LPS elicited a considerable increase in IL-23 levels, only in C3H/HeN mice, while Spirulina LPS showed almost no induction of IL-23 even in C3H/HeN mice (Fig.	21013	21191
28075473	5A).	18475	18479
28075473	Thus, Spirulina LPS seems to be inferior to E. coli LPS in terms of stimulating immune cells.	21197	21290
28075473	The possibility that Spirulina LPS has a general defect in the stimulation of immune system was excluded, because both E. coli and Spirulina LPS induced B cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.	21291	21497
28075473	5B).	21498	21502
28075473	Since IL-12 and IFN-γ are known to play a crucial role in the differentiation of IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells (4), we measured the serum levels of IL-12 in tumor-bearing mice that were treated with saline, E. coli, or Spirulina LPS.	21503	21732
28075473	Spirulina LPS augmented IL-12 production more than E. coli LPS.	21733	21796
28075473	In contrast to a transient increase of IL-12 by E. coli LPS, the enhanced IL-12 production by Spirulina LPS was still observed after 14 days (Fig.	21797	21943
28075473	5C).	21944	21948
28075473	Of note, these high IL-12 serum levels on day 14 decreased when C3H/HeN mice were injected with anti-CD4, but not anti-CD8 mAb (Fig.	21949	22081
28075473	5D), implicating CD4 T cell-dependent IL-12 production.	22082	22137
28075473	Taken together, these findings support the notion that Spirulina LPS facilitates the priming of CD4 T cells with tumor cells and the subsequent CD4 T cell-dependent activation of APCs, leading to IL-12 production, which in turn induces IFN-γ-producing T cells.	22138	22398
28075473	We finally examined whether Spirulina LPS is also effective in suppressing the spontaneous development of mammary tumors in female transgenic mice carrying the activated HER-2/neu oncogene.	22399	22588
28075473	HER-2/neu transgenic mice display apparent hyperplasia in the mammary glands at 10 weeks of age and develop palpable mammary tumors around 24 weeks (28).	22589	22742
28075473	Female HER-2/neu mice were injected with Spirulina LPS or PBS once per week between 120 and 240 days after birth.	22743	22856
28075473	Spirulina LPS delayed the appearance of tumors and significantly reduced both tumor incidence and growth (Fig.	22857	22967
28075473	6).	1641	1644
28075473	The IL-12/IFN-γ pathway is crucial for antitumor immunity by inducing IFN-γ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells (4,6,7,34).	22972	23089
28075473	In this context, various adjuvants including microbial products are explored to potentiate antitumor immunity.	23090	23200
28075473	On the other hand, IL-23/IL-17 signaling plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in humans and mice by inducing angiogenesis and IL-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinase expression (11–17).	23201	23406
28075473	Since most adjuvants induce IL-6, which is indispensable for Th17 differentiation, adjuvants that do not induce or slightly induce IL-6 are desired for tumor immunotherapy.	23407	23579
28075473	The present study demonstrates that Spirulina LPS is a very poor inducer of IL-6 and IL-23 and that it elicits strong antitumor immunity by suppressing IL-17 induction while enhancing IFN-γ production through the TLR4 pathway.	23580	23806
28075473	In a tumor-based mouse model, Spirulina LPS treatment enhanced serum levels of IFN-γ at early stages of tumor development and decreased serum IL-17 and IL-23 levels at later stages (Fig.	23807	23993
28075473	3).	780	783
28075473	Spirulina LPS also induced IL-12 production in a CD4 T cell-dependent manner, probably through CD4 T cell-APC interaction (Fig.	23998	24125
28075473	5C and D), and induced IFN-γ production primarily by CD4 T cells.	24126	24191
28075473	Based on previous reports on the inhibition of Th17 differentiation by IFN-γ (32,33), these results can be interpreted as follows: Spirulina LPS facilitates the differentiation of tumor-primed CD4 T cells to Th1 cells.	24192	24410
28075473	Subsequently, Th1-derived IFN-γ prevents Th17 differentiation and promotes CD8 T-cell activation.	24411	24508
28075473	In addition, Spirulina LPS might also suppress IL-17 production through IFN-γ-independent pathways as shown in our in vitro experiments (Fig.	24509	24650
28075473	4A).	24651	24655
28075473	Alternatively, it is possible that although IL-17 elevation during tumor progression could prevent the generation of IFN-γ-producing T cells, Spirulina LPS might restore the generation of Th1 cells by reducing IL-17 production (Fig.	24656	24888
28075473	3).	780	783
28075473	Recent experiments have revealed IL-17-mediated inhibition of Th1 differentiation (35).	24893	24980
28075473	It is also conceivable that Spirulina LPS inhibits tumor growth by reducing IL-17-induced angiogenesis, as previously reported (11–13,36).	24981	25119
28075473	Of note, administration of anti-IL-17 mAb into tumor-bearing mice induced marked tumor regression accompanying IFN-γ production (Fig.	25120	25253
28075473	4C and D), consistent with a recent report showing tumor growth inhibition by IL-17 neutralization (15).	25254	25358
28075473	Regardless of the pathway, Spirulina LPS inhibits tumor growth by skewing the balance between IFN-γ and IL-17 responses toward IFN-γ production.	25359	25503
28075473	In this study, Spirulina LPS was shown to inhibit the in vitro generation of IL-17-producing cells through its action on APCs in a TLR4-dependent manner (Fig.	25504	25662
28075473	4A and B).	25663	25673
28075473	There are reports demonstrating that CD86, but not CD80, on APCs plays an important role in the regulation of IL-17 production by T cells (37), and that IL-27 produced by Mϕ/DC negatively regulates the development of Th17 cells (38).	25674	25907
28075473	Thus, Spirulina LPS-mediated TLR4 signaling may induce a change in APC status by modulating the expression patterns of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines, leading to the attenuation of Th17 cell development.	25908	26119
28075473	However, the precise mechanisms by which Spirulina LPS suppresses IL-17 and IL-23 remain to be elucidated.	26120	26226
28075473	In contrast to the tumor-promoting effects of the IL-17/IL-23 signaling axis, demonstrated in IL-17- or IL-23-deficient mice, several groups have described that Th17 cells or IL-17 promote tumor inhibition by increasing the generation of tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells (39,40).	26227	26510
28075473	Thus, whether Th17 cells or IL-17 induce tumor progression or antitumor immunity might be dependent on the varied main effector cells in the distinct tumor-host relationship (41).	26511	26690
28075473	Namely, Th17 cells/IL-17 could activate CD8 T cells, while inhibiting Th1 type of CD4 T cells.	26691	26785
28075473	Otherwise, the strength of tumor immunogenicity or frequency of tumor-specific effector T cells might cause a discrepancy in the function of Th17 cells/IL-17, because adoptive transfer of tumor-reactive Th17 cells obtained from TCR transgenic mice or from in vitro stimulation with tumor inhibits tumor development (39,40).	26786	27109
28075473	In either case, IL-17-induced angiogenesis seems to be required to some extent for effector T cells to migrate into tumor tissue.	27110	27239
28075473	Even in an IL-17-deficient host, IL-17 secreted by tumor cells may contribute to T-cell infiltration.	27240	27341
28075473	Despite these possible explanations, the paradox in the function of Th17 cells/IL-17 is still unresolved.	27342	27447
28075473	IL-17 is also produced by certain tumors and IL-17 receptors have been detected in virtually all cells (12).	27448	27556
28075473	It has been reported that IL-17 stimulates tumor cells to proliferate and upregulates the expression of various cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors, leading to angiogenesis (16,42–44).	27557	27748
28075473	However, we did not detect expression of IL-17 and IL-17 receptor in MH134 tumor cells (data not shown), indicating the importance of IL-17 responses in host-derived cells in MH134 tumor growth.	27749	27943
28075473	Moreover, although TLR4 was expressed on MH134 tumor cells, E. coli and Spirulina LPS had virtually no effect on the in vitro growth of tumor cells (data not shown).	27944	28109
28075473	Interestingly, we found that MH134 tumor cells expressed IFN-γ receptors and that cellular in vitro growth was inhibited by exogenous addition of IFN-γ (data not shown).	28110	28279
28075473	Thus, in vivo induction of IFN-γ by E. coli and Spirulina LPS may partly contribute to the antitumor effects by virtue of the IFN-γ direct action on the tumor.	28280	28439
28075473	E. coli LPS induced antitumor effects against a primary tumor, but failed to enhance secondary immune responses in the same tumor after reimplantation (Fig.	28440	28596
28075473	2A).	13766	13770
28075473	E. coli LPS induced high levels of IL-6 and IL-23, favoring the development of Th17 cells, and it considerably activated NK function (Fig.	28602	28740
28075473	2B).	14554	14558
28075473	Thus, it is conceivable that E. coli LPS inhibits primary tumor growth via activation of NK cells, but prevents the generation of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity through IL-17 induction.	28746	28935
28075473	The effects of E. coli and Spirulina LPS involve TLR4 pathways, but Spirulina LPS was different from E. coli LPS in terms of cytokine induction.	28936	29080
28075473	The structure of LPS of all gram-negative bacteria consists of a polysaccharide attached to a lipid component, lipid A, which is assumed to be responsible for the induction of cytokines.	29081	29267
28075473	Although lipid A molecules from different bacteria were initially thought to be similar, recent evidence suggests structural and functional differences among LPS from different species (25,45).	29268	29461
28075473	Differences in the three-dimensional conformation of lipid A have been proposed to determine the strength of fitness to TLR4-CD14-MD2 complex, leading to the activation of intracellular signaling for cytokines (46,47).	29462	29680
28075473	LPS fractions from E. coli and Salmonella spp.	29681	29727
28075473	are more potent cytokine inducers than those from Bordetella pertussis and Bacteroides fragilis (48,49), while lipid A analog and LPS from Rhodobacter spp.	29728	29883
28075473	have antagonistic properties against cytokine stimulation (47,50).	29884	29950
28075473	Although the structure of Spirulina LPS remains to be analyzed, the molecular conformation of E. coli LPS seems to be different from that of Spirulina LPS based on its ability to downregulate IL-17 with minimum induction of IL-6 and IL-23.	29951	30190
28075473	Moreover, Spirulina LPS failed to induce endotoxin shock in contrast to E. coli LPS (20% and 100% survival in mice given 25 µg of E. coli and Spirulina LPS, respectively, 36 h after administration).	30191	30389
28075473	Experiments using different Spirulina preparations free of LPS have demonstrated antitumor activity.	30390	30490
28075473	A calcium-chelating, sulfated polysaccharide from S. platensis suppressed metastasis of murine melanoma (51).	30491	30600
28075473	Oral administration of hot water extract of Spirulina is reported to suppress tumor growth through IFN-γ-mediated activation of NK cells but not CD8 T cells (52).	30601	30763
28075473	However, it was not clear whether IL-17 and IL-23 production were involved in the experimental system of that specific study.	30764	30889
28075473	In contrast to those Spirulina preparations, we used a Spirulina LPS fraction extracted with phenol-water.	30890	30996
28075473	Differences in the components of the Spirulina extracts may cause distinct bioactivities.	30997	31086
28075473	In conclusion, Spirulina LPS suppressed tumor growth by downregulating serum IL-17/IL-23 with concomitant induction of IFN-γ through TLR4.	31087	31225
28075473	Furthermore, Spirulina LPS showed limited or no induction of IL-6 and IL-23 and altered the cytokine milieu in the tumor-bearing host from the Th17 to the Th1 type.	31226	31390
28075473	Thus, we confirmed the importance of a balance between IFN-γ and IL-17/IL-23 levels in the regulation of tumor growth.	31391	31509
28075473	It is noteworthy that Spirulina LPS was able to suppress spontaneous development of mammary tumors.	31510	31609
28075473	Our results provide novel insights into the exploitation of TLR-based immunomodulators for cancer immunotherapy.	31610	31722
27509880	The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reported that colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.	0	200
27509880	Drug combinations and administration protocols, and the development of molecular targeted drugs have greatly improved the chemotherapeutic efficiency for CRC.	201	359
27509880	Fluoropyrimidines, especially 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), remain the most important chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of CRC.	360	487
27509880	5-FU is reported to induce cellular toxicity by inhibiting its target enzyme, thymidylate synthase (TS); it also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the incorporation of fluoronucleotides into RNA and DNA leading to thymidylate depletion (1).	488	738
27509880	5-FU is the central component in the FOLFIRI regimen with the addition of irinotecan, and the FOLFOX regimen with the addition of oxaliplatin.	739	881
27509880	These combination chemotherapies have resulted in improved response rates and significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival (2,3).	882	1032
27509880	However, despite recent advances in CRC chemotherapy, the occurrence of drug resistance hinders effective control of the disease.	1033	1162
27509880	Moreover, most advanced CRC patients cannot be cured with these refined chemotherapies.	1163	1250
27509880	Histone acetylation and deacetylation are biological processes that regulate the modification of chromatin structures and are important for gene regulation.	1251	1407
27509880	Recently, a number of anticancer drugs such as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) have been developed.	1408	1549
27509880	DNMT and HDAC inhibitors cause DNA demethylation and repressive complex disintegration.	1550	1637
27509880	This leads to the reactivation of critical genes and the reversal of genome-wide epigenetic alterations in cancer through resetting multiple cellular processes including, lineage commitment, immunomodulation, major cell signaling pathways, cell proliferation, and cell death (4,5).	1638	1919
27509880	Overexpression or under-expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules, such as p53 and bcl-2, can be modulated by various HDAC inhibitors (6).	1920	2073
27509880	Inhibitors of HDACs are known to exert effects including apoptosis, retardation of cell cycle progression, and cancer cell differentiation, which are specific depending on cancer cell type (7,8).	2074	2269
27509880	Therefore, a number of HDAC inhibitors have been investigated clinically.	2270	2343
27509880	Vorinostat, entinostat, panobinostat, valproic acid, depsipeptide, and belinostat have been approved and clinically used.	2344	2465
27509880	HDAC inhibitors are also used in combination therapy with DNMT inhibitors and other HDAC inhibitors (9).	2466	2570
27509880	A basic study on combinations of valproic acid and gemcitabine has also been conducted (10).	2571	2663
27509880	DNMT inhibitors, such as 5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, and zebularine have been studied for various cancers in clinical trials (11).	2664	2805
27509880	The therapeutic benefits of HDAC inhibitors have been verified as a monotherapy for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and in other malignancies (12).	2806	2955
27509880	Epigenetic agents are also known to have the ability to reverse the resistance of anticancer drugs (13,14).	2956	3063
27509880	Furthermore, synergistic or additive effects have been reported when combining epigenetic agents with existing anticancer drugs (15–17).	3064	3200
27509880	Depsipeptide (Dep, also known as FR901228, FK228 and romidepsin), isolated from Chromobacterium violaceum strain WB968, is a unique bicyclic peptide with a non-cysteine disulfide bridge.	3201	3387
27509880	It is a stable prodrug, which is activated by reduction in cancer cells, to inhibit HDAC class I enzymes, and has been shown to convert H-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells to normal morphology.	3388	3577
27509880	Thus, Dep is a promising anticancer agent, and indeed, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment for CTCL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (18,19).	3578	3728
27509880	The glutathione-mediated activation also implicates its clinical usefulness for counteracting glutathione-mediated drug resistance in chemotherapy (20).	3729	3881
27509880	In addition to their use as monotherapy, there are several studies on the effects and mechanisms of the combination of 5-FU and HDAC inhibitors for CRC treatment.	3882	4044
27509880	Lee et al reported that trichostatin A enhanced 5-FU cytotoxicity by downregulating the expression of both TYMS mRNA and TS protein in colon cancer cells (21).	4045	4204
27509880	Tumber et al reported that belinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, synergized with 5-FU to inhibit colon cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and this combination therapy increased DNA fragmentation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and downregulated TYMS in HCT116 cells (22).	4205	4484
27509880	Di Gennaro et al found that modulation of TYMS and p53 expression by vorinostat resulted in synergistic antitumor effects in combination with 5-FU or raltitrexed (23).	4485	4652
27509880	Fazzone et al reported that panobinostat suppressed TYMS gene expression and synergized with fluoropyrimidines in colon cancer cells (24).	4653	4791
27509880	Little is known concerning the combinatorial effects of 5-FU and Dep for CRC, which prompted us to investigate the combination of HDAC inhibitors, namely, Dep, apicidin, and oxamflatin, with 5-FU.	4792	4988
27509880	We previously found that among these HDAC inhibitors, Dep potentiated the cytotoxicity of 5-FU against human colon cancer cells, HCT-116.	4989	5126
27509880	Thus, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the mode of the combined effect of 5-FU and Dep in HCT-116 cells (i.e., additive or synergistic), and to elucidate the genetic mechanism of the drug-drug interaction in a cell-based model using microarray analysis.	5127	5390
27509880	Human colon carcinoma HCT-116 (no.	5391	5425

27509880	HT29 cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded for the colony formation assay in 60-mm dishes at 10,000 cells/dish.	7512	7629
27509880	After incubation for 7 to 10 days, the colonies were stained with crystal violet and the numbers of positive colonies were counted.	7630	7761
27509880	Colonies containing more than 50 cells were regarded as positive and were scored, and each assay was conducted in triplicate and three separate assays were performed on three different days.	7762	7952
27509880	We measured cell viability in SW48 cells by direct staining of the cells using crystal violet assay (25) as SW48 cells have poor colony-forming ability.	7953	8105
27509880	SW48 cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded for the crystal violet assay in 6-well plate at 50,000 cells/well.	8106	8221
27509880	After incubation for 7 days, the medium was removed and any adherent cells were fixed to the plate with 10% formaldehyde in PBS.	8222	8350
27509880	The cells were then stained with an aqueous solution of 0.5% crystal violet followed by elution of the dye with 33% aqueous acetic acid.	8351	8487
27509880	Absorbance at 550 nm was determined with a micro-plate reader, Infinite F500 (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland).	8488	8608
27509880	Each assay was conducted in triplicate and three separate assays were performed on three different days.	8609	8713
27509880	Luminescent caspase-3/7 activation assay was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Caspase-Glo™ 3/7 assay; Promega, Madison, WI, USA).	8714	8866
27509880	HCT-116 cells were inoculated into each well of a white-walled 96-well plate (4,000 cells/well), treatment reagents were added and incubated was carried out for 0, 24 and 48 h. After incubation for 1 h with Caspase-Glo™ reagent, the enzymatic activity of caspase-3/7 was measured using a microplate reader, Infinite F500 (Tecan Group Ltd.).	8867	9207
27509880	The background luminescence associated with the cell culture and assay reagent (blank reaction) was subtracted from the experimental values.	9208	9348
27509880	Mean values of four replicates were used to represent caspase-3/7 activity.	9349	9424
27509880	To enable normalization of data to total cellular protein content, the Lowry assay (26) was conducted for all samples according to the manufacturer's instructions (Protein Assay Lowry kit; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan).	9425	9644
27509880	Data are expressed as relative light units (RLU)/µg of protein.	9645	9708
27509880	Total RNA was extracted from three independent HCT-116 cell cultures using the Rneasy Mini kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany).	9709	9876
27509880	Total RNAs (1 µg) were used for cDNA synthesis using a cDNA synthesis kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).	9877	9979
27509880	Using first-strand cDNA, real-time PCR was performed using a 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan).	9980	10102
27509880	The sequences of amplification primers are shown in Table I.	10103	10163
27509880	For DNA microarray analysis, total RNA (50 ng) was labeled with cyanine-3 using a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).	10164	10330
27509880	The labeled targets were hybridized to SurePrint G3 Human 8×60K oligo DNA microarrays and hybridized micro-arrays were scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner (both from Agilent Technologies, Inc.).	10331	10533
27509880	Image analysis and raw array data generation were processed using Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).	10534	10657
27509880	Normalization of the raw array data was performed using GeneSpring software.	10658	10734
27509880	Following quantile normalization of the raw data, data sets were further reduced by filtering noise of the signal, including gIsSaturated, gIsFeatNonUnifOL, gIsFeatPopnOLg, and gIsWellAboveBG.	10735	10927
27509880	Finally, we identified gene lists that showed at least 1.5-fold upregulation or downregulation.	10928	11023
27509880	The PANTHER classification system (www.pantherdb.org/tools/genexAnalysis.jsp) was used for functional classification of genes.	11024	11150
27509880	Mi et al discussed the procedure for classification of proteins using PANTHER, a web tool for analyzing protein family trees and functions (27).	11151	11295
27509880	The overall process of PANTHER Protein Library data generation consisted of three major steps: family clustering, phylogenetic tree building, and annotation of tree nodes.	11296	11467
27509880	The requirements for being family clusters in PANTHER are as follows: The family must contain at least five members among which at least one gene must be listed as a Gene Ontology (GO) reference genome.In order to support phylogenetic inference, the family should be aligned with high quality sequence data.A certain length of aligned sequences stored in at least 30 sites should be aligned across 75% or more of the family members for creation of proper family clusters.	11468	11939
27509880	A statistical enrichment test was performed for each molecular function, biological process, or cellular component.	11940	12055
27509880	The genes associated with a particular ontology term were evaluated according to the likelihood of the numerical values of genes that were drawn randomly from the overall distribution of values.	12056	12250
27509880	The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the P-value.	12251	12309
27509880	A number of genes, which were induced in large extent by our microarray analysis, were classified according to a number of statistical tests that were performed by the PANTHER classification system.	12310	12508
27509880	As a result, PANTHER classification concluded that induction of a considerable number of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes was a characteristic change in global gene expression caused by the present drug combination of 5-FU and Dep (discussed in Results).	12509	12784
27509880	The details of using this tool are described in the PANTHER user manual for PANTHER 9.0.	12785	12873
27509880	Data are represented as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) and analyzed for statistical significance using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer test as a post hoc test.	12874	13076
27509880	A P-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant result.	13077	13158
27509880	The approximate IC50 value of the HCT-116 cells to 5-FU was 1.90 µM.	13159	13227
27509880	However, Dep was almost 2,000-fold active in terms of molar concentration to inhibit colony formation ability of HCT-116 compared with 5-FU.	13228	13368
27509880	Fig.	13369	13373

27509880	1C shows the reduction of survival fraction for the combination of 5-FU and Dep, 5-FU alone, and Dep alone.	13450	13557
27509880	The combination of 1.75 µM 5-FU and 1 nM Dep suppressed colony formation to 30% compared with vehicle-only.	13558	13665
27509880	This combination suppressed colony formation ability with statistical significance compared with 5-FU only (P<0.01).	13666	13782
27509880	HCT-116 cells became less sensitive to 5-FU in combination with 0.1 nM Dep compared with 5-FU only, which was not marked.	13783	13904
27509880	The approximate IC50 value of HT29 to 5-FU was 0.68 µM.	13905	13960
27509880	However, Dep was almost 2,000-fold active in terms of molar concentration to inhibit colony formation ability of HT29 cells compared with 5-FU.	13961	14104
27509880	Fig.	13369	13373
27509880	1D and E shows the dose-response curves of 5-FU and Dep, respectively.	14110	14180
27509880	Fig.	13369	13373
27509880	1F illustrates the reduction in survival fraction for the combination of 5-FU and Dep, 5-FU alone, and Dep alone.	14186	14299
27509880	The combination of 0.625 µM 5-FU and 0.375 nM Dep suppressed colony formation to 35% compared with vehicle-only.	14300	14412
27509880	This combination suppressed colony formation ability with statistical significance compared with 5-FU-only (P<0.01).	14413	14529
27509880	The approximate IC50 value of SW48 to 5-FU was 1.15 µM.	14530	14585
27509880	However, Dep was almost 5,000-fold active in terms of molar concentration to inhibit cellular viability of the SW48 cells compared with 5-FU.	14586	14727
27509880	Fig.	13369	13373
27509880	1G and H shows the dose-response curves of 5-FU and Dep, respectively.	14733	14803
27509880	Fig.	13369	13373
27509880	1I illustrates the reduction in survival fraction for the combination of 5-FU and Dep, 5-FU alone, and Dep alone.	14809	14922
27509880	The combination of 0.875 µM 5-FU and 0.2 nM Dep suppressed cellular viability to 25% compared with vehicle alone.	14923	15036
27509880	This combination suppressed cellular viability with statistical significance compared with 5-FU alone (P<0.01).	15037	15148
27509880	As shown in Fig.	15149	15165
27509880	2, the time course of caspase-3/7 activation was examined in the HCT-116 cells following treatment with 5-FU (1.75 µM) alone, Dep (1 nM) alone, and the combination of 5-FU and Dep.	15166	15346
27509880	At 24 h, the combination of 5-FU and Dep markedly enhanced caspase-3/7 activation compared to the vehicle control (3.8-fold-change, P<0.01).	15347	15487
27509880	Dep alone also showed a 2.0-fold increase (P<0.01) compared to the vehicle control.	15488	15571
27509880	At 48 h, the combination of 5-FU and Dep increased caspase-3/7 activation compared to the vehicle control (2.8-fold-change, P<0.01).	15572	15704
27509880	5-FU alone and Dep alone slightly increased caspase-3/7 activation compared to the vehicle control (1.4-fold, P<0.05; and 1.5-fold, P<0.01, respectively).	15705	15859
27509880	To examine the gene expression profile after drug exposure, we conducted a microarray analysis of the cells treated for 7 days with the vehicle control, 5-FU alone, Dep alone, and the combination of 5-FU with Dep as described in Materials and methods.	15860	16111
27509880	Results of the gene expression profile were analyzed by gene ontology in order to clarify what mRNAs were upregulated (Table II) or down-regulated (Table III) after treatment with each drug alone or with combination of 5-FU and Dep.	16112	16344
27509880	To indicate the biological significance of cellular processes affected by the combination treatment, we listed the fold enrichment in descending order in Tables II and III.	16345	16517
27509880	Analysis of PANTHER GO-Slim biological Process and Cellular Component revealed a marked increase in mRNA levels of MHC class-related gene ontologies (GO:000254 and GO:0042611, respectively).	16518	16708
27509880	We examined levels of mRNAs encoded by various genes in the cells treated with 5-FU or Dep alone, and the combination of 5-FU and Dep by qRT-PCR method (Fig.	16709	16866
27509880	3).	1029	1032
27509880	The levels of TS mRNA encoded by the TYMS gene were decreased by 42% in the cells treated with the combination of 5-FU and Dep with statistical significance (P<0.01).	16871	17037
27509880	Slight, but statistically significant downregulation was observed for HDAC1 mRNA in the cells treated with the 5-FU and Dep combination.	17038	17174
27509880	Dep alone and the combination of 5-FU and Dep decreased cellular p16 mRNA levels by 60 and 64%, respectively.	17175	17284
27509880	Regardless of the presence of Dep, 5-FU induced p21 levels; marked changes in p21 levels by 396% were observed without Dep, and by 764% with combination of 5-FU and Dep with statistical significance (P<0.01).	17285	17493
27509880	Dep reduced TP53 levels by 75%.	17494	17525
27509880	5-FU alone also slightly decreased TP53 levels by 42%.	17526	17580
27509880	5-FU considerably decreased the bCL2 mRNA level to 59%, which was apparently restored in the presence of Dep (to 103% in the combination with 5-FU).	17581	17729
27509880	An unremarkable change was observed in bAK1 mRNA in the cells following treatment with either 5-FU alone or Dep alone (138 and 86%, respectively).	17730	17876
27509880	The combination of these drugs slightly increased the bAK1 mRNA level to 160%, which was statistically significant compared with the vehicle control (P<0.05), and with Dep only (P<0.01).	17877	18063
27509880	Regarding BAX, 5-FU increased the BAX mRNA level to 163%.	18064	18121
27509880	The combination of Dep with 5-FU decreased bAX mRNA to 49% of the vehicle control, which was statistically significant compared with 5-FU only (P<0.01), and with the vehicle control (P<0.05).	18122	18313
27509880	We examined levels of MHC class II and I mRNA by qRT-PCR in the cells treated with 5-FU or Dep alone, and a combination of 5-FU and Dep (Fig 4).	18314	18458
27509880	MHC class II genes, including HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1 were markedly upregulated in combination with 5-FU and Dep (P<0.01) to 432, 298, 667 and 847%, respectively, compared to the vehicle controls.	18459	18673
27509880	Dep alone slightly increased levels of MHC class II genes, including HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1 by 52, 38, 157 and 168%, respectively.	18674	18823
27509880	Compared with Dep alone, the combination with 5-FU greatly elevated mRNA levels of these MHC class II genes, namely, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1 with statistical significance (P<0.01).	18824	19022
27509880	In the HT29 and SW48 cells, increased expression level of HLA-DRA (MHC class II gene) was observed with statistical significance in combination of 5-FU and Dep by real-time PCR (data not shown).	19023	19217
27509880	No change in the levels of MHC class I genes including HLA-A, HLA-B-HLA-C were observed following treatment with 5-FU, Dep, or 5-FU plus Dep.	19218	19359
27509880	We further analyzed the results of our global analysis of gene expression, which were focused on genes involved in the molecular regulation of MHC class II genes.	19360	19522
27509880	As described in Table IV, we found the highest degree of increased expression levels of PCAF, CREB3, CREB5, and CIITA after the combination of 5-FU and Dep.	19523	19679
27509880	PCAF, a histone acetyltransferase, is related to apoptotic cell processes, and CREB3, CREB5 and CIITA are related to MHC class II gene expression.	19680	19826
27509880	On the contrary, ATF4, a member of the CREB family, was slightly downregulated following treatment with 5-FU or Dep alone, and markedly downregulated by the combination of 5-FU and dep.	19827	20012
27509880	In the present study, we found the HDAC inhibitor, Dep, potentiated 5-FU cytotoxicity via inhibition of colony formation ability in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells (Fig.	20013	20183
27509880	1).	735	738
27509880	The primary findings of our study were that Dep augments the effects of 5-FU in HCT-116 cells, and that activation of caspase-3/7 is the underlying mechanism.	20188	20346
27509880	Moreover, the importance of MHC class II and p21 (CDKN1A) upregulation (Figs.	20347	20424
27509880	4 and 3, respectively) in the effect of the combination of 5-FU and Dep was revealed.	20425	20510
27509880	Dep was previously reported to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in small cell lung cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway by suppressing the expression of BCL2 family members (28).	20511	20697
27509880	In contrast, the present study did not show a marked reduction in HCT-116 cells.	20698	20778
27509880	These results indicated that the sensitization of HCT-116 cells to the combination of 5-FU and Dep was not likely to be mediated by changes in expression of BCL2 family members (28).	20779	20961
27509880	Exposure of cancer cells to 5-FU elevated the expression of p21 (CDKN1A), and the combination of Dep with 5-FU further enhanced this mRNA expression of p21 (CDKN1A) (Fig.	20962	21132
27509880	3).	1029	1032
27509880	Induction of p21 using a tetracycline-inducible vector system showed that p21 plays an important role in the induction of growth arrest in tumor cells (29).	21137	21293
27509880	A critical role of p21 has been described as a critical mediator of cytotoxicity of 5-FU (30).	21294	21388
27509880	These results are consistent with our present results that the 5-FU-induced and Dep-enhanced p21 (CDKN1A) expression are both associated with cell cycle arrest.	21389	21549
27509880	Our present microarray and the successive gene ontology analyses revealed that combination of 5-FU and Dep markedly increased the mRNA levels of MHC class II genes, namely, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1 (Fig.	21550	21770
27509880	4).	3060	3063
27509880	This marked activation of MHC class II gene expression, however, was not noted following treatment with 1.75 µM 5-FU alone, or 1 nM depsipeptide alone.	21775	21926
27509880	The HCT-116 cells treated with the combination underwent caspase 3/7-associated apoptosis.	21927	22017
27509880	Therefore, activation of MHC class II expression may have some relationship with the cell apoptotic process.	22018	22126
27509880	Ting and Trowsdale described positively regulated control of MHC class II expression, which was mediated by DNA binding factors including NF-Y, CREB, and RFX, and the coactivator, CIITA, general transcription factors, and histone acetyltransferases including P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) (31).	22127	22425
27509880	Among them, PCAF was reported to accelerate cancer cell apoptosis by counteracting the anti-apoptotic cellular process (32).	22426	22550
27509880	In addition, an HDAC inhibitor was reported to enhance MHC class II expression in both CIITA-dependent and -independent manners (33).	22551	22684
27509880	Our present results of augmentation of MHC class II gene expression after the treatment with 5-FU combined with an HDAC inhibitor, depsipeptide, may be collateral antitumor events for the induction of cellular apoptosis by 5-FU.	22685	22913
27509880	Our global analysis of gene expression indicated marked induction of MHC class II members together with PCAF (also called KAT2B), CREB3, CREB5, and CIITA (Table IV), which may be correlated with a number of apoptotic cell processes, by the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide.	22914	23191
27509880	In fact, higher 5-FU concentrations revealed dose-dependent MHC class II induction (unpublished data).	23192	23294
27509880	Collectively, our present results may indicate a closer relationship between the elevation of MHC class II expression and cellular apoptosis induced by antitumor agent, 5-FU.	23295	23469
27509880	Furthermore, we are investigating whether induction of MHC class II proteins after 5-FU-based chemotherapy is a prognostic marker.	23470	23600
27509880	On the other hand, previous reports have documented the importance of histone acetylation as a positive regulator of MHC class II transcription and that HDAC inhibitors augment the expression of tumor cell MHC class II (34–36).	23601	23828
27509880	Dep may affect the differentiation of colon cancer cells because of the close correlation already shown between the expression of HLA-DR antigen and the differentiation of tumor cells using gastric carcinoma models (37,38).	23829	24052
27509880	West et al recently proposed that HDAC inhibitors require the immune system to exert their anticancer effects (39).	24053	24168
27509880	Downregulation of immune-system-related genes including MHC class II genes was shown to associate cooperatively with the metastatic potential of early stage colorectal carcinoma (40).	24169	24352
27509880	Our present results are in agreement with concepts raised very recently that immune systems where MHC class II genes are involved have a considerable relationship with successful cancer chemotherapy and/or less cancer cell malignancies.	24353	24589
27509880	Therefore, our present results imply that 5-FU combined with Dep synergistically enhances the expression of tumor cell surface immunological proteins (i.e., marked inductions of MHC class II genes).	24590	24788
27509880	This is consistent with what is known concerning the concerted mechanisms of therapeutic drugs and immune systems in cancer chemotherapy.	24789	24926
27509880	In conclusion, the combination of 5-FU and Dep sensitized human colon cancer HCT-116, HT29, and SW48 cells.	24927	25034
27509880	The sensitization in the HCT-116 cells likely occurred through apoptosis induction shown by caspase-3/7 activation, induction of cell cycle arrest shown by p21 (CDKN1A) upregulation, and induction of MHC class II gene expression.	25035	25264
27509880	MHC class II gene induction may render cancer chemotherapy more effective through a possible cooperation of the immune system with cancer chemotherapy.	25265	25416
27509880	Epigenetic modulation of existing anticancer drugs may be considered for development of novel cancer chemotherapy.	25417	25531
28260077	Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an acute renal failure, which occurs following the use of contrast medium (CM) for diagnostic imaging and interventional procedures, including angiography.	0	193
28260077	It is the third leading cause of hospital-acquired renal failure worldwide (1).	194	273
28260077	There is no specific therapy or standard preventive procedure, with the exception of hydration and minimizing the dosage of CM, which do not provide optimal prevention (2,3).	274	448
28260077	In previous years, several clinical investigations have been performed, and it has been confirmed that CIN results in increased medical costs, prolonged admissions, disease deterioration, dialysis, long-term decline in renal function and associated mortality rates (4–6).	449	720
28260077	Thus, it is important and urgent to improve current understanding of the mechanism by which CIN occurs and develop novel preventive therapies.	721	863
28260077	Apoptosis is considered to be a characteristic of acute kidney injury, including ischemia and anoxia, inflammatory reactions and damage from drug toxicity (3).	864	1023
28260077	The apoptosis of renal tubular cells is an important pathological alteration in the pathogenesis of CIN, and the occurrence of apoptosis is expected to be important in therapy for improving nephropathy (7,8).	1024	1232
28260077	Statins exert several effects through their non-lipid-associated mechanisms.	1233	1309
28260077	These so-called pleiotropic effects encompass several mechanisms, which modify inflammatory responses, endothelial function, plaque stability and apoptosis (9,10).	1310	1473
28260077	The effectiveness of statin pretreatment in reducing the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) has been examined in a number of observational and randomized investigations (11–12).	1474	1674
28260077	There is a general consensus that statins merit further investigation for the prevention of CIAKI.	1675	1773
28260077	The present study investigated whether atorvastatin can ameliorate iopamidol-induced apoptosis in CIN rats and HK2 cells.	1774	1895
28260077	Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are recognized molecular chaperones and function as cytoprotective proteins.	1896	1999
28260077	HSPs protect other intracellular proteins from denaturation and aggregation, which occur in response to oxidative stress (13).	2000	2126
28260077	Hsp27 is a ubiquitous HSP, the expression of which is induced in response to a wide variety of unfavorable physiological and environmental conditions (13,14).	2127	2285
28260077	Classically, the activation of the expression of Hsp27 occurs be due to an increase in the total protein expression of Hsp27 and/or due to increased activation of an upstream kinase, which phosphorylates Hsp27 (13).	2286	2501
28260077	It has been reported that Hsp27 protect cells from otherwise pathological circumstances, predominantly through their involvement in pathways of cell death, including necrosis and apoptosis (13,14).	2502	2699
28260077	However, the intracellular signaling modulation of Hsp27 in CIN remains to be elucidated.	2700	2789
28260077	Therefore, the present study was designed to determine whether atorvastatin can protect against CIN due to anti-apoptotic effects and to identify the possible mechanisms of Hsp27 regulation.	2790	2980
28260077	All experimental procedures were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (15) and were in compliance with the guidelines specified by the Chinese Heart Association policy on research in animal use and the Public Health Service policy on the use of laboratory animals.	2981	3284
28260077	Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the present study, which, in addition to the basal diet used, were purchased from Sun Yat-Sen University Laboratory Animal Centre (Guangzhou, China).	3285	3467
28260077	A total of 40 male rats weighing between 280 and 320 g were used in the experiment.	3468	3551
28260077	The rats were housed in multiple mouse racks and acclimated for 1 week in groups (five mice per cage) with free access to a mycotoxin-free diet and tap water.	3552	3710
28260077	The rats were housed at a constant temperature (25±2°C) and constant humidity (60±5%), with artificial lighting every 12 h. The rats were acclimated for 7 days and then divided into four groups (n=10/group), as follows: Control rats (CR); rats+atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day; CA); rats + iopamidol (CM); rats+iopamidol+atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day; CMA).	3711	4059
28260077	CIN was induced using nonionic low-osmolar iopamidol, as previously described (16).	4060	4143
28260077	Following a 16-h dehydration period, the iopamidol (Shanghai Bracco Sine Pharmaceutical Corp. Ltd., Shanghai, China) was administered intravenously into the internal carotid artery for 5 min at a dose of 2.9 g iodine/kg body weight.	4144	4376
28260077	The control rats received an equal volume of normal saline.	4377	4436
28260077	The plasma and kidney samples were collected, and the rats were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection with 10% chloral hydrate (300mg/kg) and subsequently sacrificed.	4437	4605
28260077	7 days post-iopamidol injection.	4606	4638
28260077	Atorvastatin was donated by Pfizer, Inc. (New York, NY, USA).	4639	4700
28260077	Iopamidol was obtained from Bracco S.p.A. (Milan, Italy).	4701	4758
28260077	The experimental animals received no water for 16 h prior to injection of the left internal carotid artery with contrast agents, 0.3% pentobarbital sodium and 1 ml/100 g anesthesia.	4759	4940
28260077	The iopamidol 370 (2.9 g iodine/kg; 5-min injection) was injected through the left internal carotid artery, whereas the animals in the control group received saline.	4941	5106
28260077	The CMA group was treated with atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 2 ml of saline) 1 day prior to CM injection and 3 days following CM injection.	5107	5257
28260077	The CA group was treated with atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 2 ml of saline) for 4 days without CM injection.	5258	5377
28260077	Blood was collected from the left femoral artery, and the serum was separated by 12,000 × g centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C to assess renal function.	5378	5528
28260077	The kidneys were removed for biochemical and histopathological investigations.	5529	5607
28260077	The concentrations of creatinine (Scr) and urea (BUN) in the serum and urine were analyzed as indicators of injured glomerular function.	5608	5744
28260077	Creatinine clearance (ml/min) was calculated according to the following formula: UV / P, where U represents creatinine concentration in the urine (mg/dl), V represents urine volume (ml/min) and P represents serum creatinine (mg/dl).	5745	5977
28260077	The fractional excretion of sodium was calculated according to the following formula: (Urine sodium / serum sodium) × (serum creatinine / urine creatinine) × 100.	5978	6140
28260077	Urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1) was measured using ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).	6141	6255
28260077	TUNEL staining for cell apoptosis in renal tissues was used to evaluate the extent of apoptosis according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).	6256	6432
28260077	Tissues were imaged using a fluorescent microscope.	6433	6484
28260077	The HK2 cells lines were grown in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-F12 mixture (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 2 mmol/l L-glutamine and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2.	6485	6786
28260077	The cells were routinely passaged when 80–85% confluent.	6787	6843
28260077	The media, sera and antibiotics for cell culture were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany).	6844	6964
28260077	Prior to treatment, the cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 low glucose (5 mM) for 24 h. Basal (5 mM) glucose culture media was produced as described previously (11).	6965	7127
28260077	Protein electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (Richmond, VA, USA).	7128	7227
28260077	The HK2 cells were pretreated with atorvastatin at a dose of 0.2 µmol/l at 37°C with 5% CO2.	7228	7320
28260077	The dose of atorvastatin was selected according to the standard doses used in cell lines.	7321	7410
28260077	When the cells culture was at ~80% confluence, the cells were serum-starved for 12 h at 37°C with 5% CO2, following which they were used in the following experiments: i) Time-course experiments.	7411	7605
28260077	The HK2 cells (~80% confluence) were treated with iopamidol (200 mg/ml) for 0, 4, 8, 16, 24 or 48 h at 37°C with 5% CO2.	7606	7726
28260077	The cells were analyzed using a cell titer proliferation assay and harvested for reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses to determine the expression levels of Hsp27, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved/total caspase-3.	7727	7989
28260077	The cell activity levels were assessed by cell death quantification.	7990	8058
28260077	ii) Investigation of the effect of atorvastatin on iopamidol-induced cell apoptosis.	8059	8143
28260077	The HK2 cells (~80% confluence) were treated in the following groups at 37°C with 5% CO2: Control group; atorvastatin (0.2 µmol/l); iopamidol (200 mgI/ml); iopamidol (200 mgI/ml) + atorvastatin (0.2 µmol/l).	8144	8351
28260077	The cells were harvested for western blot analysis to determine the expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved/total caspase-3 and Hsp27.	8352	8487
28260077	The levels of apoptosis were assessed using TUNEL staining.	8488	8547
28260077	iii) Investigation of the role of Hsp27 in mediating iopamidol-induced HK2 cell apoptosis.	8548	8638
28260077	The HK2 cells (~80% confluence) were treated in the following groups at 37°C with 5% CO2: Iopamidol (200 mgI/ml); iopamidol (200 mgI/ml) + Hsp27 siRNA (400 pmol); iopamidol (200 mgI/ml) + pcDNA3.1-Hsp27 (2 µg) for 24 h. The expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved/total caspase-3 was analyzed by western blot analysis.	8639	8961
28260077	The levels of apoptosis were assessed using TUNEL staining.	8488	8547
28260077	The assay was performed with the use of the Colorimetric CaspACE assay system (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.	9022	9181

28260077	The results of the various proteins were normalized by the corresponding results of β-actin and are presented as the mean ± standard deviation from at least five independent experiments, which were performed with cells from different isolations.	14598	14843
28260077	Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test (SPSS v23.0; IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA).	14844	14996
28260077	P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.	14997	15070
28260077	In the present study, 10 rats were randomly divided into each group.	15071	15139
28260077	All the rats survived until the end of the study.	15140	15189
28260077	Atorvastatin decreased levels of SCr, BUN, urine microprotein and uKIM-1 in the CIN rats.	15190	15279
28260077	The animals subjected to CIN in the iopamidol groups presented with significantly increased levels of SCr, BUN and uKIM-1, compared with those in the control group.	15280	15444
28260077	However, the levels of SCr, BUN, urine microprotein and uKIM-1 were all decreased in the rats treated with atorvastatin, as shown in Table II.	15445	15587
28260077	Thus, atorvastatin attenuated the levels of renal function parameters.	15588	15658
28260077	As shown in Table III, no significant differences were found between the CR and CA group in the levels of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6.	15659	15831
28260077	Compared with the CR group, the CM group had higher serum levels of TNF-α (P<0.01), IL-1β (P<0.05) and IL-6 (P<0.05).	15832	15949
28260077	However, compared with the CM group, treatment with atorvastatin reduced the CM-induced increase in TNF-α (P<0.05), IL-1β (P<0.05) and IL-6 (P<0.05).	15950	16099
28260077	In the CA group, the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were lower, compared with those in the CR group, however, this difference was not statistically significant.	16100	16260
28260077	TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 are known inflammatory parameters, which can lead to apoptosis.	16261	16346
28260077	The findings of the present study suggested that atorvastatin attenuated CM-induced renal damage by modulating inflammatory responses.	16347	16481
28260077	As shown in Fig.	16482	16498
28260077	1Aa and b, renal injury was more severe in the CM group, compared with the CR and CA groups (P<0.01), however, the degree of injury was less severe in the CMA group, compared with the CM group (P<0.05), suggesting that atorvastatin significantly protected the kidney against CIM.	16499	16778
28260077	The TUNEL staining (Fig 1B) was also more intense in the CM group, compared with either the CR or CA groups.	16779	16887
28260077	The percentage of apoptotic cells was lower in the CR group, compared with the CM group (P<0.01; Fig.	16888	16989
28260077	1C), whereas the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the CM group, compared with the CMA group (P<0.05).	16990	17116
28260077	As shown in Fig.	16482	16498
28260077	2, the RT-qPCR and western blot analyses revealed the expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3.	17134	17242
28260077	The mRNA levels of Bax were increased in the CM group and decreased in CMA group (Fig.	17243	17329
28260077	2A), however, Bcl-2 was negatively correlated with Bax (Fig.	17330	17390
28260077	2B).	17391	17395
28260077	Bax (Fig.	17381	17390
28260077	2Ca and b) and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig.	17406	17444
28260077	2Da and b) were significantly increased in the CM group (P<0.01), and decreased in the CMA group (P<0.05).	17445	17551
28260077	However, the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly decreased in the CM group and increased in the CMA group (P<0.05).	17552	17669
28260077	The exposure of HK2 cells to iopamidol induced a decrease in cell viability (Fig.	17670	17751
28260077	3A).	17752	17756
28260077	This reaction was evident at 12 h and reached a peak 24 h following iopamidol treatment.	17757	17845
28260077	It was also found that iopamidol increased the mRNA expression levels of Bax in a time-dependent manner (Fig.	17846	17955
28260077	3B), which was similar with the levels of cell viability.	17956	18013
28260077	Notably, the mRNA level of Bcl-2 (Fig.	18014	18052
28260077	3B) and Hsp27 (Fig.3C), and the protein expression levels of Bcl-2 and Hsp27 (Fig.	18053	18135
28260077	3Da and b) decreased at 12 h and reached a peak at 24 h, which was negatively correlated with the levels of cell apoptosis.	18136	18259
28260077	The protein expression of Bax increased in a time-dependent manner.	18260	18327
28260077	Furthermore, caspase-3 activity was upregulated at 12 h and reached a peak at 24 h (Fig 3E).	18328	18420
28260077	Exposure of the HK2 cells to iopamidol also induced an increase in the activities of Bax (Fig.	18421	18515
28260077	4Aa and b) and caspase-3 (Fig.	18516	18546
28260077	4Ba and b), and a decrease in the activity of Bcl-2 (Fig.	18547	18604
28260077	4A).	18605	18609
28260077	Following treatment with atorvastatin, the activities of Bax and caspase-3 decreased, whereas that of Bcl-2 increased (Fig.	18610	18733
28260077	4A and B).	18734	18744
28260077	TUNEL staining (Fig.	18745	18765
28260077	4Ca and b) was also more intense in the presence of iopamidol, and was weakened following atorvastatin treatment (P<0.05).	18766	18888
28260077	In the HK2 cells exposed to iopamidol, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Hsp27 were reduced at 12 h, peaked at 24 h (Fig.	18889	19018
28260077	3C and D), and were negatively correlated with the levels of cell apoptosis.	19019	19095
28260077	Furthermore, although exposure of the HK2 cells to iopamidol induced a decrease in the level of Hsp27, treatment with atorvastatin resulted in an increase in the level of Hsp27 (Fig.	19096	19278
28260077	4A), which was negatively correlated with the levels of cells apoptosis in the TUNEL staining (P<0.05; Fig.	19279	19386
28260077	4C).	19387	19391
28260077	As shown in Fig.	16482	16498
28260077	5Aa and b, immunohistochemical staining for Hsp27 was decreased in the CM group, but upregulated in the presence of atorvastatin.	19409	19538
28260077	In addition, it was shown that CM induced a decrease in the mRNA levels of Hsp27 (P<0.05), and these increased significantly following atorvastatin treatment (P<0.05; Fig.	19539	19710
28260077	5B).	19711	19715
28260077	Similar changes were found in Hsp27 protein via western blot analysis (Fig.	19716	19791
28260077	5Ca and b).	19792	19803
28260077	The upregulation of Hsp27 was accompanied by improvements in levels of cell apoptosis, which was associated with a reduction in inflammatory markers and improvements in renal function (Tables II and III).	19804	20008
28260077	Following transfection with Hsp27 siRNA or the Hsp27 plasmid, it was found that the expression levels of Bax/caspase-3 (Fig.	20009	20133
28260077	5D and E) were increased and reduced by the inhibition and overexpression of Hsp27, respectively, with negative correlation with Bcl-2 (Fig.	20134	20274
28260077	5D), as detected using western blot analysis.	20275	20320
28260077	Iopamidol also induced cell apoptosis (Fig.	20321	20364
28260077	5Fa and b).	20365	20376
28260077	This suggested that the iopamidol-induced downregulation of Hsp27 may be one of the causes for HK2 cell apoptosis.	20377	20491
28260077	The foundation of the prophylaxis of CIAKI is hydration; however, strategies to prevent CM-induced renal cell apoptosis appear to have indispensable clinical involvement.	20492	20662
28260077	Previous clinical trials have been performed with the use of various antioxidant compounds with the aim of lowering the occurrence of CIAKI (2,4).	20663	20809
28260077	The present study showed the protective effect of atorvastatin on CM-induced renal cell damage.	20810	20905
28260077	CIN is a type of renal injury caused, not only due to the toxicity of contrast media, but also due to renal ischemia, inflammatory reactions and cell apoptosis.	20906	21066
28260077	According to the results of the present study, atorvastatin ameliorated renal injury, cell apoptosis and the deterioration of renal function.	21067	21208
28260077	Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the inflammatory reaction, suppressed caspase-3 activity, and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in vivo and in vitro.	21209	21360
28260077	Notably, the results of the present study suggested that iopamidol-induced HK2 cell apoptosis may be caused by the downregulation of Hsp27.	21361	21500
28260077	The inflammatory reaction is important in the pathogenesis of CIN.	21501	21567
28260077	TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 are pro-inflammatory cytokines, which recruit numerous mediators associated with endothelial and tissue injury.	21568	21701
28260077	In a mouse model of nephrotoxicity and in clinical trials, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 have been shown to be central in activation of the inflammatory cytokine response (11,16).	21702	21873
28260077	The results of the present study further confirmed these previous findings, and demonstrated that the levels of inflammatory markers, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, were increased in the rats with CIN.	21874	22067
28260077	Our previous studies and clinical investigations have shown that SCr, urine microprotein and uKIM-1 are important indices for CIN prediction (4,6,19).	22068	22218
28260077	The present study further confirmed that SCr, urine microprotein and uKIM-1 increased following iopamidol treatment.	22219	22335
28260077	Apoptosis is an important mechanism of acute kidney injury, including CIN.	22336	22410
28260077	Suppressing apoptotic pathways may attenuate pathological alterations in CIN (7).	22411	22492
28260077	It has been reported that mitochondrial and intrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved in the tubular injuries of CIN (8).	22493	22614
28260077	Bax is pro-apoptotic protein, whereas Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, which can inhibit caspase-3.	22615	22717
28260077	Increased levels of Bcl-2 and decreased levels caspase-3 activity may contribute to reduced apoptosis (7,8,20).	22718	22829
28260077	In the present study, renal tubular cell apoptosis was observed in the CIN kidney, consistent with previous results.	22830	22946
28260077	In addition, increased Bax/caspase-3 activity and decreased expression levels of Bcl-2 were detected in the CIN rats and HK-2 cells treated with iopamidol.	22947	23102
28260077	Thus, iopamidol-induced cell apoptosis may be associated with activation of Bax/caspase-3 and inhibition of Bcl-2.	23103	23217
28260077	Statins reduce the levels of intracellular pro-inflammatory factors in several cellular systems by acting on the inhibition of producing enzymes (12,21,22).	23218	23374
28260077	In the rat model used in the present study, pretreatment with atorvastatin reduced the iopamidol-induced release of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, and improved renal function, including the levels of SCr, urine microprotein and uKIM-1.	23375	23602
28260077	In addition, the increased expression of Bax/caspase-3 and decreased expression of Bcl-2 were partially reversed by atorvastatin in the CIN rats and HK2 cells treated with iopamidol.	23603	23785
28260077	Accordingly, the protective effect of atorvastatin in CIN may be associated with the Bcl-2/caspase-3 anti-apoptotic pathway.	23786	23910
28260077	Hsp27 is a small HSP, which is important in stress tolerance in several cellular processes.	23911	24002
28260077	The local tissue expression of Hsp27 reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, and protects cells the against oxidative stress caused by renal tubular cell apoptosis in ischemia-induced acute kidney injury (6,19,23).	24003	24243
28260077	However, whether Hsp27 has a protective effect in CIN, and the underlying molecular mechanism, remain to be elucidated.	24244	24363
28260077	In the present study, western blot analysis demonstrated that Hsp27 was upregulated in the CMA rats and downregulated in the CM rats, which was negatively correlated with the expression of Bax/caspase-3 and the levels of apoptosis in the HK2 cells.	24364	24612
28260077	Hsp27 inhibits the release of caspase-3 and the gene expression of Bax, which leads to reduced apoptosis and organ injury.	24613	24735
28260077	Following treatment with atorvastatin, Hsp27 was upregulated, together with improvements in HK2 cell apoptosis.	24736	24847
28260077	Furthermore, through transfection with Hsp27 siRNA and the Hsp27 plasmid, it was found that iopamidol induced cell apoptosis, and that the activity of Bax/caspase-3 was enhanced and reduced by inhibition and overexpression of Hsp27, respectively.	24848	25094
28260077	These findings suggested that iopamidol aggravated renal tubular injury via the downregulation of activated Hsp27, which weakened its anti-apoptotic effects, resulting in an increase in renal tubular apoptosis.	25095	25305
28260077	In conclusion, the data obtained in the present study suggested that atorvastatin exhibited renal protection in the CIN model via the anti-inflammatory reaction and upregulation of Hsp27.	25306	25493
28260056	Hypoxia is a fundamental biological phenomenon that is strongly associated with tissue damage and cell viability under stress conditions.	0	137
28260056	It is widely accepted that hypoxic foci are present in the microenvironment during ischemic injuries, including neurological (1), intestinal (2), myocardial (3) and liver (4) damage.	138	320
28260056	These affect mitochondrial respiratory chain functions, mitochondrial enzymes and adenosine triphosphate synthesis (5).	321	440
28260056	In addition, hypoxia develops in normal tissues following radiation exposure and is associated with increased inflammatory corpuscle accumulation and activation, oxidative stress, and profibrogenic cytokine activity, thus contributing to radiation-induced normal tissue injury (6,7).	441	724
28260056	Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent apoptosis via attenuation of mitochondrial function and signaling pathways, has been demonstrated to be a major cause of hypoxia-associated tissue injury (8–11).	725	926
28260056	Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) functions to promote a survival and proliferation in specific tissues by initiating signaling cascades following binding to extracellular IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which results in IGF-1 activation and phosphorylation (12).	927	1186
28260056	IGF-1R is a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor superfamily, which is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (12).	1187	1345
28260056	A previous study demonstrated that IGF-1R is involved in apoptosis induction through the reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction (13).	1346	1479
28260056	The protective mechanisms associated with IGF-1R involve preservation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduction of caspase-3 activity (13).	1480	1631
28260056	A previous study indicated that IGF-1R in the endothelium maintains the endothelial barrier by stabilizing the vascular endothelial (VE)-protein tyrosine phosphatase/VE-cadherin complex (14).	1632	1823
28260056	Furthermore, decreased IGF-1R expression impairs endothelial function and increases renal fibrosis, which is associated with kidney disease (14).	1824	1969
28260056	Similarly, IGF-1R is essential in mediating IGF activity during neuronal cell development.	1970	2060
28260056	IGF-1R in neuronal cells is critically important for their survival following hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) injury (1).	2061	2173
28260056	IGF-mediated upregulation of the neuronal cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, contribute to IGF/IGF-1R protection against neuronal apoptosis following H/I injury (1).	2174	2383
28260056	In addition, IGF/IGF-1R have been demonstrated to protect against intestinal and cardiomyocyte ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) injury (2,3).	2384	2519
28260056	Hypoxia is one of the factors involved in the regulation of the IGF system (15,16).	2520	2603
28260056	IGF-1R expression and concentration are altered when cells, such as human hepatocytes and growth neuronal cones, are exposed to hypoxic conditions (15,16).	2604	2759
28260056	Additionally, IGF-1/IGF-1R protect cultured human cells against a variety of injuries, such as oxidative stress and hypoxia, through the activation of associated proteins including nuclear factor-κB and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein (17–19).	2760	3035
28260056	However, the mechanisms associated with its anti-apoptotic effects remains unknown.	3036	3119
28260056	The present study demonstrates an association between IGF-1R and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/threonine protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR signaling pathway and autophagy.	3120	3326
28260056	In addition, these results provide evidence supporting the protective role of IGF-1R against oxidative stress under hypoxic conditions.	3327	3462

28260056	Subsequently, the cells were harvested in a trypsin-EDTA acid solution.	8896	8967
28260056	Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 175 × g for 5 min at 37°C, then the supernatant was removed.	8968	9065
28260056	The intensity of DCHF-DA fluorescence was measured and calculated by flow cytometry analysis (FC 500 MPL; Beckman Coulter, Inc.).	9066	9195
28260056	All experiments were performed in triplicate.	9196	9241
28260056	Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.	9242	9295
28260056	Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t-test with SPSS software, version 22.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA) considering the variances unequal.	9296	9460
28260056	P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.	9461	9534
28260056	R+ cells exhibited significantly higher levels of mRNA expression compared with that of R- cells (Fig.	9535	9637
28260056	1).	923	926
28260056	Following treatment of hypoxia for 24 or 48 h, R+ cells and R- cells all exhibited increased apoptotic ratios compared with that of normoxic treatment, respectively.	9642	9807
28260056	Further analysis showed hypoxia induced more apoptosis in R- cells compared with that of R+ cells under hypoxic conditions (Fig.	9808	9936
28260056	2).	1183	1186
28260056	To investigate whether IGF-1R alters cellular ROS levels under hypoxic conditions, ROS production in R- and R+ cells under hypoxic conditions for 24 and 48 h was examined.	9941	10112
28260056	As shown in Fig.	10113	10129
28260056	3, ROS production levels in R- and R+ cells was increased significantly under hypoxic conditions compared with those under normoxic conditions.	10130	10273
28260056	Additionally, R+ cells produced significantly lower ROS levels under hypoxic conditions.	10274	10362
28260056	Under hypoxic conditions, the ROS levels were significantly higher in R- cells than in R+ cells (Fig.	10363	10464
28260056	3).	1476	1479
28260056	As presented in Fig.	10469	10489
28260056	4, hypoxia increased the presence of autophagosome in all R- and R+ cells compared with that of normoxic treatment.	10490	10605
28260056	In addition, R+ cells exhibited higher levels of autophagy when compared with R− cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, which suggests that IGF-1R may promote autophagy.	10606	10781
28260056	ROS production and apoptosis were higher in R- cells compared with those in R+ cells.	10782	10867
28260056	Further investigation indicated that ROS production and apoptosis were increased after autophagy inhibition (3MA) treatment in all R+ cells and R- cells compared with those without autophagy inhibition (3MA) treatment (Fig.	10868	11091
28260056	5).	437	440
28260056	These suggested that autophagy may serve a protective role from ROS production and apoptosis.	11096	11189
28260056	As shown in Fig.	10113	10129
28260056	6, the R+ cells displayed lower expression levels of PI3K-110 and mTOR, and higher expression of LC3-II under normoxic and hypoxic conditions relative to R- cells.	11207	11370
28260056	Further study indicated that p-AKT was decreased in R+ cells compared with that of R- cells under normoxic conditions, however was increased significantly in R+ cells following hypoxia treatment.	11371	11566
28260056	When treated with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor LY294002, R+ and R- cells displayed lower levels of PI3K/p-Akt/p-mTOR and high LC3-II expression.	11567	11710
28260056	These results indicated that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway may be involved in autophagy under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, which may be closely associated with IGF-1R.	11711	11888
28260056	Hypoxia is a toxic factor that induces cell death through mitochondrial dysfunction, which is primarily caused by the production of ROS under hypoxic conditions (23,24).	11889	12058
28260056	Various pathological conditions, including myocardial I/R, stroke, cancer and irradiation, lead to tissue hypoxia, which alter biological characteristics, including the production of ROS, autophagy and apoptosis.	12059	12271
28260056	The results of the present study, demonstrated that low concentrations of oxygen induce ROS production and apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.	12272	12420
28260056	In addition, overexpression of IGF-1R may serve a protective role in cell death under hypoxic conditions through altering autophagy levels and ROS production.	12421	12579
28260056	The role of IGF-1R has received extensive attention due to its protective role in the neuronal system.	12580	12682
28260056	It protects neural cells from loss and infarcted volume, and increases glial proliferation in the brain in a cerebral ischemia model (25–28).	12683	12824
28260056	In addition, it serves a role in protecting against renal fibrosis-associated kidney disease, intestinal I/R injury and myocardial ischemia (2,3,14).	12825	12974
28260056	Autophagy is an intracellular lysosomal degradation process that maintains cellular homeostasis via the degradation and recycling of long-lived proteins and intracellular aggregates as well as damaged organelles, in order to generate small reusable molecules (29,30).	12975	13242
28260056	It is essential for the promotion of cell survival in stress conditions, such as starvation, oxidative stress, and hypoxia; however, unregulated autophagy induces progressive consumption of cellular contents and results in autophagic cell death (31).	13243	13493
28260056	Autophagy serves a protective role in cell survival in cells through the reduction of ROS.	13494	13584
28260056	Inhibition of autophagy through chloroquine administration, or via prevention of K63 ubiquitination increases the formation of ROS (32,33).	13585	13724
28260056	Hypoxia is a known inducer of autophagy (34).	13725	13770
28260056	The present study demonstrated that the induction of autophagy and ROS production under hypoxic conditions, and autophagy inhibition by 3MA, led to a higher level of ROS production and cell apoptosis in R+ and R− cells, which is in agreement with a previous study (35).	13771	14040
28260056	The signaling pathways involved in the progression of autophagy are complex, and the PI3K/Akt pathway has been widely studied (36,37).	14041	14175
28260056	The anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-1 are mediated by IGF-1R, together with the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and other signaling pathways (38).	14176	14327
28260056	However, the role of IGF-1 in autophagy remains unknown.	14328	14384
28260056	An inhibitory effect of IGF-1 on autophagy has been observed in rat cardiomyocytes (39), human fibroblasts (40), and vascular cells from patients with atherosclerotic lesions (41).	14385	14565
28260056	These effects are associated with rescuing mitochondrial metabolism and controlling the potentially harmful autophagic response.	14566	14694
28260056	By contrast, IGF-1 promotes autophagy in H9c2 cell lines (42), HeLa cells (43) and Purkinje neurons (44).	14695	14800
28260056	The depletion of IGF-1R inhibits mTORC2 and reduces the activation of protein kinase C, which decreases the rate of clathrin-dependent endocytosis and impacts autophagosome-precursor formation (43).	14801	14999
28260056	Furthermore, IGF-1 prevents the accumulation of autophagic vesicles and cell death by increasing the rate of autophagosome-to-lysosome fusion and degradation, thereby contributing to cell survival (44).	15000	15202
28260056	The current study investigated the effects of the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the progression of autophagy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.	15203	15354
28260056	The results indicated that IGF-1R-overexpressing cells exhibit lower expression of PI3K-110, p-Akt, p-mTOR/mTOR and higher expression levels of LC3-II under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.	15355	15544
28260056	When treated with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor LY294002, these cell types exhibited lower PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling activation and higher autophagy levels, which indicated that IGF-1R-induced cell survival during hypoxia, which may be dependent on autophagy initiation by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR-signaling pathway.	15545	15862
28260056	The present study demonstrated that overexpression of IGF-1R is correlated with reduced ROS production, increased autophagy and cell viability under hypoxic conditions.	15863	16031
28260056	It is possible that, binding of IGF-1 to IGF-1R suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which promoted autophagy and scavenging of redundant cellular ROS during hypoxia.	16032	16209
28260056	These results reveal novel mechanisms for IGF-1R-associated cell survival, which may be good to know I/R- and H/I associated hypoxia-agravated normal tissue injury well.	16210	16379
27959382	Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a c\hronic and progressive disease characterized by diffuse inflammation, interstitial fibrosis and the distortion of the lung architecture, which contributes to extensive damage and dysfunction of the lungs (1).	0	239
27959382	However, the explicit pathogenesis of PF remains inadequately understood, and there is an unmet need for effective treatments.	240	366
27959382	Novel strategies aimed at enhancing the therapeutic effects have gained significant interest.	367	460
27959382	Previous studies have demonstrated that the imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants caused by oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of PF (2–4), including bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF (5,6).	461	670
27959382	Thus, the key components involved in oxidative stress have been receiving increased attention and are considered as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of PF.	671	841
27959382	The transcription factor Bach1, which is a member of the cap 'n' collar family of basic leucine zipper, is known to be involved in the regulation of oxidative stress response (7).	842	1021
27959382	Bach1 executes transcriptional inhibition via competitive binding to the Maf-recognition element closely related to antioxidant response element (ARE), thus antagonizing the activation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (8,9).	1022	1267
27959382	Nrf2 functions as one of the most important molecules involved in oxidative stress that promotes the expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes and proteins (10,11).	1268	1437
27959382	It has been reported that Nrf2 deficiency is associated with the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis in mice and humans (12,13).	1438	1560
27959382	Nrf2 agonists protect against PF by regulating the lung oxidant levels in mice with BLM-induced lung fibrosis (14).	1561	1676
27959382	Furthermore, ARE/Nrf2-dependent antioxidants, including glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) may be critical in pulmonary protection (15–17).	1677	1883
27959382	Additionally, the expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidants can be suppressed by the transcriptional induction of Bach1 (8).	1884	2008
27959382	Although the evidence suggests that Bach1 is a transcriptional repressor of Nrf2, the inhibitory effects of Bachl on Nrf2-dependent antioxidants and fibrotic processes in pulmonary tissue remain still poorly understood.	2009	2228
27959382	To date, there are no available published studies investigating whether targeting Bachl attenuates BLM-induced lung fibrosis, at least to the best of our knowledge.	2229	2393
27959382	As BLM causes cell damage, and the emergence of free radicals and the subsequent induction of oxidative stress ultimately results in inflammation and fibrosis (18,19), it is currently the most commonly used animal model to investigate PF (20).	2394	2637
27959382	It has been demonstrated that multiple factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, interleukin (IL)-1 and -6, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are implicated in the development and progression of PF (21,22).	2638	2898
27959382	A previous study found markedly increased levels of TGF-β1 and IL-6 in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in the serum of mice following exposure to BLM (23).	2899	3067
27959382	TGF-β1 has been identified as a key mediator of lung fibrosis, and it induces the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts, as well as the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (24,25).	3068	3267
27959382	In this context, TGF-β1 and IL-6 are considered to be useful parameters for observing the progression of PF.	3268	3376
27959382	Small interfering RNA (siRNA), which can attain target-specific gene silencing, may be a potent tool for gene therapy (26,27).	3377	3503
27959382	In this study, we focused on Bach1, since it is an important mediator of oxidative stress and may be a critical target for PF therapy.	3504	3638
27959382	Based on these reasons, we hypothesized that adenovirus-mediated Bach1 siRNA may be effective in silencing Bach1 transcripts in vitro and in vivo, representing a potential means with which to promote the expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidants and ameliorate fibrotic process in BLM-induced lung fibrosis.	3639	3946
27959382	For our experiments, Bach1 siRNAs were administered to mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) and to mice with BLM-induced PF in order to monitor the antioxidant and anti-fibrotic effects via the measurement of antioxidant factors, fibrosis-related cytokines and histological changes.	3947	4222
27959382	Taken together, the findings of our study may provide novel insight into the role of Bach1 in the regulation of oxidative stress involved in the pathogenesis of PF, thus leading to the development of promising strategies for the treatment of PF.	4223	4468
27959382	Two siRNAs targeting mouse Bach1 mRNA were designed using a software available at www.ambion.com via a cDNA sequence (SEQ ID, XM_006522879), and an empty adenoviral vector was used as a negative control.	4469	4672
27959382	The specific siRNA coding sequences were designed to contain the target sequences and their reverse complement 19-nucleotide sequences which are separated by 9-nucleotide sequences of stem-loop structure (Table I).	4673	4887
27959382	The forward and reverse oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and annealed to form a duplex.	4888	4987
27959382	Two siRNA sequences were cloned into the plasmid vector, pGenesil-1.	4988	5056
27959382	The siRNA expression cassette was subsequently excised from pGenesil-1 using EcoRI and HindIII, and also ligated into the linearized adenoviral shuttle vector, pShuttle-CMV.	5057	5230
27959382	The ligation products were transformed into E. coli DH5α, and positive clones were selected.	5231	5323
27959382	The recombinant adenovirus vectors were obtained by homologous recombination with pShuttle-CMV-Bach1-siRNA and the skeleton plasmid of pAdeasy-1 in bacteria BJ5183.	5324	5488
27959382	The recombinant cosmids titled Ad-siBach1 carrying either Bach1 siRNA or adenoviral vector with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were linearized by PacI digestion and then transfected 293A cells (Wuhan Cell Marker Biotechnology, Wuhan, China) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).	5489	5796
27959382	The success of Bach1 siRNA insertion into adenoviral plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing and the titer of each virus stock was determined by plaque assay on 293A cells.	5797	5969
27959382	Finally, the siRNA adenoviral vector was calculated as 1.1×109 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml and the empty adenoviral vector was 1.4×109 PFU/ml.	5970	6114
27959382	The virus was purified by double CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation used for in vivo experiments.	6115	6211
27959382	The transfection efficiency was monitored by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.	6212	6300
27959382	The silencing efficiency of target gene and protein were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis.	6301	6469
27959382	The selected siRNA sequence with the highest inhibitory effect was used in the animal experiments.	6470	6568
27959382	Seven-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (body weight, 18–20 g) were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China).	6569	6689
27959382	The animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and kept for 1 week prior to use.	6690	6791

27959382	All animals had free access to rodent chow and water.	6905	6958
27959382	The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups as follows: a control with saline (n=5), BLM (n=5), BLM + control siRNA (n=5) and BLM + Bach1 siRNA groups (n=5).	6959	7117
27959382	For the model of PF, 5 mg/kg BLM (Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in 50 μl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were administered intratracheally to the mice; the control animals were injected intratracheally with the same volume of sterile saline.	7118	7368
27959382	BLM and saline were administered only once.	7369	7412
27959382	The mice in the control siRNA and Bach1 siRNA group were injected with control siRNA or Bach1 siRNA, respectively, via the tail vein (one injection every other day), with a total dose of 1×109 PFU viruses per mouse after 2 weeks of BLM administration.	7413	7664
27959382	At the designated time points (28 days post-BLM administration), the mice were humanely sacrificed by an overdose of the anesthesia (inhalation of ether) for serum, BALF and histological measurements.	7665	7865
27959382	We lavaged the lungs using 0.9% saline using a tracheal cannula for 3 times and collected 1.5 ml BALF in each mouse.	7866	7982
27959382	The blood of the experimental mice was collected using a capillary through the conjunctiva and into the orbital sinus.	7983	8101
27959382	Following centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min at 4°C), the serum and supernatants were stored at −80°C until use.	8102	8214
27959382	In addition, the lungs were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80°C until further processing.	8215	8344
27959382	All procedures involving animals were approved by the Ethics Committee of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China and complied with guidelines on the Use of Experimental Animals.	8345	8526
27959382	The left lung tissues from the mice were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.	8527	8611
27959382	After 24 h, the tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin.	8612	8677
27959382	Paraffin blocks of 3–4 μm thickness were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's reagent (Solarbio, Beijing, China) for the assessment of PF histopathology.	8678	8856
27959382	The histological severity of pulmonary alveolitis was scored as previously described (28), and PF was scored as described in the study by Ashcroft et al (29).	8857	9015
27959382	The MLF cell line (MIC-CELL-0040) was purchased from PriCells Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd. (Hubei, China) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin.	9016	9302
27959382	The cells were plated at 1×105 cells/100 mm and cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.	9303	9402
27959382	We used 0.25% trypsin for digestion and the cells were filled in 2 culture flasks for passage (1:2).	9403	9503
27959382	All experiments proceeded using cells between 3 and 4 cell passages.	9504	9572
27959382	For the induction of fibrosis using the recombinant protein, TGF-β1, the cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1×105 cells/well and starved for 24 h and then incubated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) in complete medium for 24 h. To knockdown Bach1 expression, the MLFs were infected with the Bach1 siRNA at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 for 2 h and were then washed to remove the virus.	9573	9973
27959382	The cells in in the control group (control siRNA) were transfected with empty vector.	9974	10059
27959382	The cells were then cultured for a further 48 h and then analyzed for their GFP intensity using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA) and directly observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).	10060	10316
27959382	Total RNA was isolated from the mouse pulmonary tissue samples and the MLFs using the simple Total RNA kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	10317	10513
27959382	RNA was reverse transcribed using the Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Shanghai, China) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China).	10514	10773
27959382	The initial denaturation step was at 95°C for 10 min, and then PCR amplification was achieved by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min.	10774	10919
27959382	The process of RT-qPCR was implemented by ABI Prism 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).	10920	11020
27959382	The sequences of the primers used are listed in Table II.	11021	11078
27959382	The level of gene expression was quantified using a standard curve and the comparative CT method normalized to GADPH mRNA expression.	11079	11212
27959382	We used the formula 2−ΔΔCT to calculate the relative expression levels of genes.	11213	11293
27959382	Both samples were examined in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated at least 3 times.	11294	11385
27959382	Cell pellets or lung tissues were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Applygen Technologies, Inc., Beijing, China) on ice, and the concentration of the sample proteins was tested using the BCA method before being mixed in 5X SDS loading buffer.	11386	11669
27959382	Following heat denaturation at 100°C for 5 min, equal amounts of lysate (60 mg) were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Applygen Technologies, Inc.).	11670	11917
27959382	The membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies against β-actin (1:500; sc-130301; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Bach1 (1:300; ab49657), HO-1 (1:500; ab13248), GPx1 (1:1,000; ab140883) and NQO1 (1:500; ab28947) (all from Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4°C overnight.	11918	12279
27959382	The following day, the membranes were incubated with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (1:10,000; 600-101-096; Rockland, Inc., Gilbertsville, PE, USA) for 1 h at room temperature, and the bands were visualized using a double-infrared laser scanning imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).	12280	12590
27959382	Protein expression was analyzed and normalized to that of β-actin.	12591	12657
27959382	BALF and blood from the mice were sampled at the end of 4 weeks after the initiation of the animal experiment.	12658	12768
27959382	The supernatants of MLFs were also collected after 48 h of the transfection of siRNA for measurements.	12769	12871
27959382	We then used the BALF, serum and cell supernatants to analyze the levels of cytokines in lung fibrosis.	12872	12975
27959382	ELISA was used to detect TGF-β1 and IL-6 using respective ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).	12976	13081
27959382	The supernatants of MLFs, serum and BALF of mice were diluted according to different proportions along with reagents and standard dilutions prepared before the experiment.	13082	13253
27959382	Standard, control and samples (100 μl/well) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature.	13254	13341
27959382	They were then washed with wash buffer 5 times and 100 μl of conjugate was then added for 2 h followed by substrate solution for 30 min away from light.	13342	13494
27959382	After the addition of 100 μl of stop solution, the sample concentrations were determined to measure the absorbance at a 450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).	13495	13677
27959382	Both assays were performed in duplicate.	13678	13718
27959382	Data were analyzed using a statistical software package (SPSS 13.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and expressed as mean ± SD.	13719	13845
27959382	One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for multiple group comparisons.	13846	13928
27959382	A value of P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference and a value of P<0.01 was considered to indicate a marked statistically significant difference.	13929	14108
27959382	The successful construction of Bach1 siRNA adenoviral vectors was determined by gene sequencing.	14109	14205
27959382	To demonstrate the transfection efficiency of Bach1 siRNA on MLFs and its targeting in vivo, we used a fluorescent microscope and flow cytometric analysis.	14206	14361
27959382	After the Bach1 siRNA was transfected into the MLFs, >90% GFP was expressed in the fluorescence states (Fig.	14362	14470
27959382	1A), and the results of flow cytometry also suggested that the transfection efficiency of Bach1 siRNA was 93.6% (Fig.	14471	14588
27959382	1B).	14589	14593
27959382	After 2 weeks of siRNA administration, GFPs were observed in the tissue sections of the lungs of mice, suggesting that Bach1 siRNA targeted the lungs (Fig.	14594	14749
27959382	1C).	14750	14754
27959382	The MLFs were incubated with recombinant protein TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for the induction of fibrosis prior to transfection with control siRNA, or Bach1 siRNA#1 and #2 in vitro.	14755	14926
27959382	Similarly, superior Bach1 siRNA (Bach#1) was injected into the mice with BLM-induced PF in vivo.	14927	15023
27959382	The inhibitory effects of Bach1 siRNA on Bach1 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis.	15024	15150
27959382	As shown in Fig.	15151	15167
27959382	2A, the mRNA level of Bach1 in the TGF-β1 group was significantly increased compared with that of the blank group (P<0.05), suggesting that TGF-β1 promoted Bach1 generation.	15168	15341
27959382	The mRNA expression of Bach1 in the MLFs following transfection with Bach1 siRNA#1 or #2 was significantly decreased compared with that of the TGF-β1 group or the control siRNA group (P<0.01), and was also significantly decreased by 15.3 and 22%, respectively (P<0.01) compared with the blank group (P<0.01) (Fig.	15342	15655
27959382	2A).	15656	15660
27959382	Similarly, the results of western blot analysis also revealed that the protein expression of Bach1 in the MLFs following transfection with Bach1 siRNA#1 or #2 was markedly decreased (Fig.	15661	15848
27959382	2C).	15849	15853
27959382	To further characterize Bach1 expression in vivo, we detected Bach1 expression in the lungs of mice and found that Bach1 mRNA and protein expression in the mice was decreased significantly following the administration of BLM and Bach1 siRNA, compared with the control group and the control siRNA group (Fig.	15854	16161
27959382	2B and D).	16162	16172
27959382	To examine the mechanisms through which Bach1 siRNA affects the expression of antioxidant factors, such as HO-1, GPx1 and NQO1, we examined their mRNA and protein expression levels in the MLFs and lungs of mice.	16173	16384
27959382	The results of RT-qPCR revealed that the mRNA levels of HO-1 and GPx1 were decreased following exposure of the MLFs to TGF-β1 compared with the blank group (both P<0.05; Fig.	16385	16559
27959382	3A and B), and the knockdown of Bach1 significantly increased the HO-1 and GPx1 mRNA levels compared with the TGF-β1 group (P<0.01; Fig.	16560	16696
27959382	3A and B).	16697	16707
27959382	The effect of Bach1 siRNA#1 was more prominent than that of Bach1 siRNA#2 in the MLFs.	16708	16794
27959382	Furthermore, as shown in Fig.	16795	16824
27959382	3D and E, we observed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of HO-1 and GPx1 in the lung tissues of mice following treatment with Bach1 siRNA compared with the BLM group (P<0.05 and P<0.01).	16825	17019
27959382	Concomitantly, the knockdown of Bach1 significantly increased the protein levels of HO-1 and GPx1 in the MLFs in the blank group or TGF-β1 group, and in the lung tissues from mice in the control group or BLM group (Fig.	17020	17239
27959382	3G and H).	17240	17250
27959382	However, Bach1 siRNA did not alter the mRNA and protein levels of NQO1 neither in the MLFs nor in the lung tissues (Fig.	17251	17371
27959382	3C and F).	17372	17382
27959382	The results of protein expression were similar to those of mRNA expression.	17383	17458
27959382	All these results suggest that Bach1 siRNA promotes the generation of oxidation resistance factors, and it may thus inhibit the oxidative stress induced by TGF-β1 and BLM.	17459	17630
27959382	Due to the important role of TGF-β1 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of PF, we analyzed their concentrations in the supernatant of MLFs, and in serum and BALF from mice.	17631	17796
27959382	The levels of TGF-β1 and IL-6 in serum and BALF from mice with BLM-induced lung fibrosis were significantly increased compared with the control group (both P<0.01; Fig.	17797	17965
27959382	4A–D).	17966	17972
27959382	Their concentrations in the supernatant of the MLFs following stimulation with TGF-β1 were significantly increased compared with the blank group (both P<0.01; Fig.	17973	18136
27959382	4E and F).	18137	18147
27959382	Additionally, the levels of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in serum and BALF from the mice in the Bach1 siRNA group were significantly decreased compared with those of the mice BLM treated with control siRNA or in the control group (both P<0.01; Fig.	18148	18383
27959382	4A–D).	17966	17972
27959382	The results of the analysis of the expression of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in the supernatant of MLFs were similar to those obtained from the serum and BALF of mice.	18391	18546
27959382	These results suggest that the use of Bach1 siRNA suppresses the expression of TGF-β1 and that of related cytokines in BLM-induced fibrosis.	18547	18687
27959382	For histological analysis, the lung tissues of mice were stained with H&E and Masson's staining.	18688	18784
27959382	The degree of lung fibrosis was accessed by alveolitis, fibering and the integrity of the structure.	18785	18885
27959382	Intact alveoli, a normal interstitium and a few inflammatory cells in the lung tissues were observed in the control group (Fig.	18886	19013
27959382	5A).	19014	19018
27959382	Nevertheless, H&E staining of the BLM-adminstered mice (at 28 days) revealed the extensive destruction of alveoli (collapsed and disappeared), the extensive thickening of the lung interstitium, peribronchial and interstitial infiltrations of inflammatory cells, predominant lymphocytes, and multiple focal fibrotic lesions.	19019	19342
27959382	There were milder inflammatory infiltrations and the destruction of alveoli following treatment with Bach1 siRNA compared with the BLM group and control siRNA group (Fig.	19343	19513
27959382	5A).	19014	19018
27959382	As shown by Masson's trichrome staining, we observed massive fibrosis (blue dye), the accumulation of inflammatory cells and the extensive destruction of alveoli in the BLM group (Fig.	19519	19703
27959382	5B).	19704	19708
27959382	The same change was detected in the control siRNA group.	19709	19765
27959382	However, treatment with Bach1 siRNA significantly attenuated these fibrosis-related changes in the mice with BLM-induced fibrosis (Fig.	19766	19901
27959382	5B).	19704	19708
27959382	The alveolitis and fibrosis scores indicated that the mice in the Bach1 siRNA group had significantly lower alveolitis and fibrosis scores than those in the BLM group and control siRNA group (P<0.05 and P<0.01; Fig.	19907	20122
27959382	5C).	20123	20127
27959382	Therefore, treatment with Bach1 siRNA potentially inhibits the histopathological progress of BLM-induced lung fibrosis in mice.	20128	20255
27959382	Oxidative stress is considered a prominent mechanism associated with the pathogenesis of PF (30,31).	20256	20356
27959382	The decline in antioxidant capacity and the elevated oxidant burden contribute to the progression of lung fibrosis via the activation of inflammation and growth regulatory cytokines, the regulation of related enzymes essential to the induction of antioxidants, and the stimulation of the production of myofibroblasts and ECM (32).	20357	20687
27959382	Bach1 is involved in the induction of oxidative stress by competing with Nrf2 and negatively regulating ARE-mediated gene expression (33,34).	20688	20829
27959382	Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of Nrf2 and its antioxidant pathway in PF (12–14), suggesting that Bach1 may play a potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease.	20830	21014
27959382	In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression of Bach1 was markedly increased in both MLF following TGF-β1 stimulation and in the lung tissues of mice with BLM-induced fibrosis.	21015	21204
27959382	It has been established that fibroblasts are associated with PF due to the conversion from fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which is one of the principal characteristics of the pathogenesis of PF (35).	21205	21406
27959382	TGF-β1 stimulation results in the proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts, and in the increase of matrix synthesis in the lungs related to the subsequent development of PF (36).	21407	21593
27959382	The use of BLM results in the elevation of TGF-β1 in fibroblasts, advanced inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), subsequent progressive fibrosis, and the exacerbated destruction of pulmonary structure in animal models (37).	21594	21837
27959382	Furthermore, the model of BLM-induced lung fibrosis is rather an acute lung injury with major oxidative and inflammatory responses (18).	21838	21974
27959382	The results of the present study supported our hypothesis that the overexpression of Bach1 may be associated with the pathogenesis of PF by affecting the antioxidant/oxidant balance.	21975	22157
27959382	To suppress a target gene, siRNA is considered a powerful tool due to the same effects as a knockout gene (38).	22158	22269
27959382	Our data demonstrated that two adenovirus-mediated Bach1 siRNAs were successfully transfected into MLFs and specifically targeted the lungs of mice by custom designing.	22270	22438
27959382	More importantly, adenovirus-mediated siRNAs effectively suppressed Bach1 expression in MLFs following TGF-β1 stimulation.	22439	22561
27959382	For in vivo experiments, the superior Bach1 siRNA was systemically administered to mice with lung fibrosis to silence Bach1, and the evidence suggested that the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bach1 were markedly inhibited in the lung tissues of mcie with BLM-induced fibrosis.	22562	22845
27959382	A key mechanism in the cellular defense against oxidative stress is mediated by the transcriptional induction of ARE-driven genes that include stress-response genes (e.g., HO-1), direct antioxidants (e.g., GPx) and phase 2 detoxifying enzymes (e.g., NQO1) (13).	22846	23107
27959382	Nrf2 forms a heterodimer with basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors for ARE binding and ARE-driven gene transcription that may be critical in pulmonary protection (13).	23108	23295
27959382	Bach1 binds to ARE-like sequences, functioning as a competitive antagonist of Nrf2, thus inhibiting the transcriptional activation of ARE-driven genes (8).	23296	23451
27959382	The inhibition of Nrf2 and ARE-driven antioxidants enhances the oxidative burden and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PF (39).	23452	23588
27959382	The altered expression of ARE-driven antioxidants in PF also suggests that oxidative stress may contribute to pathogenesis of PF.	23589	23718
27959382	Among these ARE-driven antioxidants, GPx has been regarded as the direct antioxidant whose functional roles in oxidative tissue stress have been widely defined (40,41).	23719	23887
27959382	The phase 2 detoxifying enzyme, NQO1, contributes to facilitate the excretion of oxidized, reactive secondary metabolites via xenobiotic detoxification (42).	23888	24045
27959382	In addition, the stress-response protein, HO-1, protects cells from various oxidant insults (39).	24046	24143
27959382	A previous study demonstrated that the deficiency of ARE antioxidative signaling in mice exacerbates BLM-induced lung injury and fibrosis (15).	24144	24287
27959382	It has been found that GPx activity and GPx1 expression are decreased in C57BL/6 mice with BLM-induced fibrosis (17).	24288	24405
27959382	The downregulation of NQO1 and HO-1 have been observed in the lung tissues of BLM-treated animals (43).	24406	24509
27959382	Furthermore, Nrf2 siRNA has been shown to decrease NQO1 and HO-1 mRNA expression in fibroblasts, and induces the conversion from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts (44).	24510	24674
27959382	As previously described, our results demonstrated that the downregulation of antioxidants, such as HO-1 and GPx1 was observed in MLFs following TGF-β1 stimulation and in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice following exposure to BLM.	24675	24897
27959382	We also investigated whether Bach1 siRNA regulates ARE-driven antioxidants involved in lung fibrosis.	24898	24999
27959382	Whether Bach1 affects the expression of other ARE-dependent genes remains controversial.	25000	25088
27959382	Previous studies have reported that Bach1 represses the expression of ARE-dependent genes, such as HO-1 and NQO1 (33,45).	25089	25210
27959382	However, in studies in which the effects of Bach1 siRNA on ARE-dependent gene expression were examined by microarray analysis or qPCR, little or no effect on the expression of genes other than HO-1 was observed (46,47).	25211	25430
27959382	In this study, our data demonstrated that the suppression of HO-1 and GPx1 in TGF-β1 and BLM-induced lung fibrosis was alleviated by Bach1 siRNA; however, no effect was observed on the expression of NQO1, thereby indicating that Bach1 siRNA participates in the mechanism of protection in TGF-β1 and BLM-mediated oxidative stress in PF.	25431	25766
27959382	The complete mechanisms involved are not known, although it has been postulated that Bach1 is involved in regulating the expression of antioxidant genes.	25767	25920
27959382	The present study further supports the notion that Bach1 siRNA alleviates fibrotic processes in pulmonary tissues.	25921	26035
27959382	There are several growth factors and fibrogenic cytokines contributing to lung fibrosis, including TGF-β1 and IL-6 (21).	26036	26156
27959382	These molecules result in the proliferation and differentiation of lung fibroblasts that are responsible for remodeling of the ECM (23).	26157	26293
27959382	Choe et al (23) demonstrated that TGF-β1 and IL-6 were upregulated in BALF and serum following the exposure of mice to BLM.	26294	26417
27959382	In this study, we provide compelling evidence that BLM induced a marked increase in the levels of TGF-β1 and IL-6 in both BALF and serum of mice.	26418	26563
27959382	By contrast, Bach1 siRNA inhibited the expression of fibrosis-related cytokines, such as TGF-β1 and IL-6 in the serum and BALF of mice with BLM-induced fibrosis.	26564	26725
27959382	Moreover, the elevation of TGF-β1 and IL-6 expression was also found in MLFs following TGF-β1 stimulation, and Bach1 siRNA significantly decreased the expression of these two cytokines.	26726	26911
27959382	To further explore whether Bach1 siRNA exerted anti-fibrotic effects on lung fibrosis, we determined the pathological changes in lung tissues.	26912	27054
27959382	The results revealed that the administration of BLM led to the thickness of alveolar septa, narrowing of the alveolar space, the extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells, and the accumulation of collagen deposition in the lungs, which is consistent with results of previous studies (48,49).	27055	27349
27959382	In addition, Bach1 siRNA markedly attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration, the destruction of alveoli and the accumulation of collagen deposition.	27350	27498
27959382	On the whole, our findings demonstrated that the silencing of Bach1 attenuated the histopathological changes in the lung tissues from mice with BLM-induced fibrosis and suppressed the expression of fibrosis-related cytokines.	27499	27724
27959382	On the basis of these findings, we believe that Bach1 represents a crucial molecule in the pathogenesis of PF, thereby highlighting Bach1 as a potential therapeutic target in PF.	27725	27903
27959382	In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the silencing Bach1 inhibited TGF-β1 and BLM-induced PF.	27904	28011
27959382	This anti-fibrotic effect was associated with the expression of antioxidants and the regulation of antioxidant capabilities.	28012	28136
27959382	Bach1 siRNA may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PF and may have potential for use in the treatment of lung fibrosis.	28137	28267
27959382	Further studies on the role of Bach1 may provide further insight into the mechanisms responsible for the development of PF.	28268	28391
27840894	Inherited hypophosphatemic rickets, characterized by bone mineralization disorders due to hypophosphatemia, secondary to a leak of phosphate from the kidneys, was first introduced by Albright et al (1).	0	202
27840894	The clinical characteristics of the disease include growth retardation, bending of the weight-bearing extremities, and the resistance to vitamin D therapy during early childhood.	203	381
27840894	Subsequently, patients suffer from spontaneous dental abscesses, extensive bone pain and arthropathy with aging.	382	494
27840894	X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH; OMIM 307800), with an occurrence of appproximately 1 in 20,000 live births, is known as the most prevalent form of inherited hypophosphatemic rickets (2,3).	495	691
27840894	The mutation in the phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidase on the X chromosome (PHEX; MIM 300550) was identified in 1995 as the causative gene for the disease (4).	692	875
27840894	Thereafter, the genetic basis of other less prevalent types of inherited hypophosphatemic rickets, such as autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR; OMIM 193100) and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR1; OMIM 241520), was successively clarified (5,6).	876	1151
27840894	Nevertheless, the underlying pathogenesis for some sporadic cases without known genetic mutations remains to be determined and the significant findings of key roles of microRNAs (miRNAs of miRs) involved in bone formation may provide potential research issues (7–9).	1152	1418
27840894	The PHEX gene, located on X chromosome Xp22.1, is composed of 22 exons spanning 243 kb and encodes for 749 amino acid proteins (10).	1419	1551
27840894	It exhibits great homology to the M13 zinc metallopeptidases, a class of type 2 integral membrane glycoproteins that includes neprilysin (NEP), endothelin-converting enzymes 1 and 2 (ECE-1 and ECE-2), as well as the Kell antigen (KELL) (11).	1552	1793
27840894	These proteins show the common structural traits of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane hydrophobic region and a large extracellular domain.	1794	1960
27840894	The latter contains 10 highly conserved cysteine residues and two zinc-binding motifs and is involved in the secondary structure conformation or catalytic activity of the protein (11).	1961	2145
27840894	It has been demonstrated that the tissue-specific expression of the PHEX gene and its mRNA expression is predominantly detected in bone lineage cells; for instance, osteoblasts, osteocytes and odontoblasts (10,12).	2146	2360
27840894	However, the exact mechanisms through which inactivated PHEX leads to abnormal skeletal and renal manifestations in XLH have not yet been fully clarified.	2361	2515
27840894	Studies have suggested the existence of phosphatonin that is responsible for the regulation of phosphate homeostasis in the Hyp mouse (13), an animal model of XLH with a 3′ deletion of the PHEX gene.	2516	2715
27840894	Based on the finding of increased fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) transcripts in the Hyp mouse, FGF23 was then regarded as a leading candidate for phosphatonin downstream of PHEX (14).	2716	2904
27840894	An extensive mutation analysis of the genetic defects of the PHEX gene only revealed a few cases in China (15–21).	2905	3019
27840894	In the present study, we screened a total of 18 affected families for mutations in the PHEX gene in order to interpret the mutation traits in Chinese patients and potentially provide evidence of a critical domain in PHEX protein.	3020	3249
27840894	Moreover, the serum FGF23 levels in affected individuals were also measured as this may also contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of XLH.	3250	3405
27840894	This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital (Shanghai, China) and all subjects or their guardians (for the under-aged participants) provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.	3406	3668
27840894	The subjects enrolled in this study were from the Department of Osteoporosis and Bone Diseases in Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China over the past 3 years.	3669	3871
27840894	A total of 18 unrelated Chinese families with hypophosphatemic rickets was examined and all subjects were of Han ethnicity.	3872	3995
27840894	The pedigrees of the families with hypophosphatemic rickets are shown in Fig.	3996	4073
27840894	1.	4074	4076
27840894	The diagnosis of hypophosphatemic rickets was mainly based on a history of childhood rickets, clinical manifestations and biochemical tests indicating hypophosphatemia along with elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatases.	4077	4303
27840894	Patients with secondary rickets due to malnutrition, medication or tumor-induced osteomalacia were excluded.	4304	4412
27840894	Finally, 65 individuals, including 43 patients, and 250 unrelated healthy controls were recruited and subjected to blood sampling followed by DNA analyses.	4413	4568
27840894	In addition, another 95 healthy controls with normal serum phosphate and calcium levels and normal renal function were randomly selected to carry out measurements of serum levels of FGF23 in order to derive a reference range.	4569	4794
27840894	To detect mutations in the PHEX gene, all DNA samples from the probands were initially analyzed.	4795	4891
27840894	When a PHEX mutation was confirmed, DNA from first-degree relatives, as well as the symptomatic individuals was then screened for the detected mutation.	4892	5044
27840894	A proband was identified as a sporadic case if the PHEX mutation was not detected in the parents, namely if both were asymptomatic.	5045	5176
27840894	Mutation analyses of the affected individuals were performed by the direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products amplified from genomic DNA.	5177	5334
27840894	The DNA was extracted from peripheral white blood cells by proteinase K digestion followed by purification with phenol/chloroform and isopropyl alcohol precipitation.	5335	5501
27840894	The DNA sequence for the PHEX gene was obtained from the available online database (NCBI Reference Sequence Accession no.	5502	5623
27840894	NG_007563.2).	5624	5637
27840894	All the 22 exons with their adjacent intronic sequences of the PHEX gene were amplified by PCR with 21 pairs of sequencing primers designed using Primer 3 software (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/).	5638	5840
27840894	The primer sequences are presented in Table I.	5841	5887
27840894	Direct sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit, version 3.1 and the PCR products were directly sequenced using an automated ABI PRISM 3130 sequencer (both from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).	5888	6139
27840894	Simultaneously, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using PolyPhred (http://droog.gs.washington.edu/polyphred/) and novel mutations were identified using HGMD (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/).	6140	6346
27840894	Mutations were checked using Mutalyzer 2.0 (http://mutalyzer.nl/check).	6347	6418
27840894	The DNA sequences obtained were aligned with homologous sequences that had been deposited into GenBank using the CluxtalX 1.83 algorithm.	6419	6556
27840894	To predict the impact of missense mutations on protein structure and function, Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2; http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2) (22) and Sorting Tolerant from Intolerant (SIFT; http://sift.jcvi.org) (23) were used based on sequence alignments.	6557	6830
27840894	Serum FGF23 leels were measured using an intact human FGF23 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit obtained from Kainos Laboratories Inc. (Tokyo, Japan).	6831	6991
27840894	The detectable concentration ranged from 3 to 800 pg/ml.	6992	7048
27840894	This assay has been validated in previous studies (16,24).	7049	7107
27840894	Normally distributed variables are presented as the means ± SD, and non-normally distributed variables as the median (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles).	7108	7256
27840894	Comparisons between groups were made using unpaired Student's t-tests for normal data, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-normal data.	7257	7395
27840894	Values of P<0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences.	7396	7479
27840894	Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 software.	7480	7541
27840894	The baseline clinical data and PHEX gene mutation analyses of 65 participants originating from 18 families are summarized in Table II.	7542	7676
27840894	A total of 43 patients was confirmed to have XLH according to their clinical and genetic evidence.	7677	7775
27840894	All the patients exhibited varying degrees of growth retardation, bending legs, dental anomalies, hypophosphatemia, markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels and normal serum calcium.	7776	7969
27840894	The median (25th and 75th percentiles) age of the patients was 22.0 (8.3, 29.5) years and the median serum phosphate levels were 0.70 (0.57, 0.80) mmol/l.	7970	8124
27840894	We identified 17 different mutations in the PHEX gene from 18 unrelated families and the distribution of PHEX mutations were 6 alternative splicing mutations (35.3%), 5 missense mutations (29.4%), 3 nonsense mutations (17.6%), 2 deletion mutations (11.8%) and 1 insertion mutation (5.9%) (Fig.	8125	8418
27840894	2).	2357	2360
27840894	Among these, 7 mutation sites were identified as novel and they were respectively detected from families 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13 and 16: c.1483-1G>C in intron 13 at splicing acceptor sites leading to truncated protein, c.1234delA (p.Ser412ValfsX12) in exon 11, c.436_436+1delAG in intron 4 at splicing donor sites leading to truncated protein, c.824T>C (p.Leu275Pro) in exon 7, c.304G>A (p.Gly102Arg) in exon 3, c.229T>C (p.Cys77Arg) in exon 3 and c.528delT (p.Glu177LysfsX44) in exon 5.	8423	8905
27840894	PolyPhen−2 and SIFT were performed to assess the missense mutational consequence of PHEX, and all 3 missense mutations were predicted to be probably damaging with a score of 0.930 for L275R, 0.917 for G102R and 1.000 for C77R, and a SIFT score of <0.05.	8906	9159
27840894	Notably, the amino acid residues at p.275, p.102 and p.77 were evolutionarily highly conserved across 12 different species as shown in Fig.	9160	9299
27840894	3.	5632	5634
27840894	In addition, the probands from families 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18 were identified as sporadic cases and the detected PHEX mutations were likely to be de novo, and the 6 probands were all female patients.	9303	9505
27840894	Serum FGF23 levels were not normally distributed in either the normal controls or the XLH patients.	9506	9605
27840894	The median value for intact serum FGF23 levels from the 95 healthy individuals aged between 22 to 77 years was 40.6 pg/ml and the reference range (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) was from 24.6 to 136.8 pg/ml (Table III).	9606	9824
27840894	For the patients with XLH, as shown in Table IV, the serum FGF23 levels were below the reference range in 4 of 11 subjects, within the range in 4 subjects, and mildly elevated in 3 subjects.	9825	10015
27840894	The serum FGF23 levels exhibited a wide variation in the patients with XLH, and no significant differences were found when compared with those of the normal controls (p>0.05).	10016	10191
27840894	Based on the PHEX mutation database (http://www.PHEXdb.mcgill.ca), the frequencies of different mutation types were 25% frameshifts, 23% alternative splicing, 22% missense, 18% nonsense, 8% deletion and 4% polymorphisms.	10192	10412
27840894	The mutations were scattered throughout the gene and the majority would potentially influence the pattern of post-translational modification of the protein and alter its secondary structure, resulting in the loss of PHEX function (25,26).	10413	10651
27840894	In this study, we identified 17 different PHEX mutations from 18 unrelated Chinese families, and to the best of our knowledge, 7 were novel.	10652	10792
27840894	Three novel missense mutations, namely, Cys77Arg, Gly102Arg and Leu275Pro, were detected.	10793	10882
27840894	The residue p.77 was amongst the 10 highly conserved cysteine residues that were critical for disulfide-bond formation and protein folding (25,26).	10883	11030
27840894	Thus, the single base change at this position would likely alter the secondary structure of the protein and render it out of action.	11031	11163
27840894	Gly102 has been found to be conserved among NEP, PHEX and ECE-1 according to the multiple sequence alignment analysis in molecular research (27).	11164	11309
27840894	Additionally, the glycine to arginine exchange was likely to increase the local charge of the PHEX gene product as arginine was positively charged, while glycine had an uncharged polar group.	11310	11501
27840894	Therefore, it is possible that this base alteration plays a role in a different spatial conformation.	11502	11603
27840894	The novel missense mutation detected in exon 7 involved a substitution of proline for leucine at residue 275.	11604	11713
27840894	To date, there are only 14 different mutations confirmed in exon 7 and it is among the rarest mutant exons in line with the PHEX mutation database.	11714	11861
27840894	Moreover, this site was estimated to be conserved with the replaced leucine occurred in both ECE-1 and PHEX.	11862	11970
27840894	The 3 novel missense mutations identified in this study were shown to be highly conserved under the protein alignment of the PHEX gene from 12 different species and were verified to be pathogenic by bioinformatics tools (PolyPhen-2 and SIFT), which also rendered the evidence of their potential value for the phenotype in patients with XLH.	11971	12311
27840894	Three nonsense mutations: Lys432X in exon 11, Arg291X and Gln311X in exon 8 were detected in this study, all of which would cause the translation of truncated protein with accidental loss of C-terminal region.	12312	12521
27840894	It was demonstrated that the C-terminal region in the large extracellular domain was abundant in conserved cysteine residues and contained the zinc-binding motifs in exons 17 and 19 (10,11).	12522	12712
27840894	The cysteine residues are responsible for the secondary structure formation and contribute to conformation integrity.	12713	12830
27840894	The highly conserved zinc-binding motifs among NEP, PHEX, ECE-1 and KELL, are essential for the catalytic activity of the protein.	12831	12961
27840894	Therefore, these 2 nonsense mutations would inevitably lead to impaired PHEX protein function.	12962	13056
27840894	Six of the 17 PHEX mutations were identified as alternative splicing mutations, including 3 splice acceptor mutations and 3 splice donor mutations.	13057	13204
27840894	Among these, 2 were novel mutations: 436_436+1delAG in the splice donor site of exon 4 and an alteration of C to G in intronic sequence 5' to initiate exon 11, -1 bp upstream.	13205	13380
27840894	These 2 splicing mutations were predicted to result in the skipping of exons 4 and 11, respectively.	13381	13481
27840894	Notably, both of the 2 affected exons comprised one conserved cyteine residue that was relevant for secondary structure transformation and thus protein function.	13482	13643
27840894	That is, the newly identified 2≈splicing mutations were associated with the onset of XLH.	13644	13733
27840894	The remaining 3 mutations were 1234delA in exon 11, c.528delT in exon 5 and 1843dupA in exon 18, characterized as frameshift mutations.	13734	13869
27840894	The mutation occurring in exon 18 was first reported by Gauche et al (28).	13870	13944
27840894	It caused the replacement of aspartic acid for threonine at residue 615 and opened a new reading frame for 6 amino acids and deemed to disrupt the overall integrity of the PHEX protein.	13945	14130
27840894	Moreover, the hetero-PHEX protein.	14131	14165
27840894	Moreover, the heteroprotein.	14166	14194
27840894	Moreover, the hetero zygous deletion of one adenine nucleotide and one thymine nucleotide in exons 11 and 5 were 2 novel mutations identified in our study.	14195	14350
27840894	These mutations would result in premature termination of the PHEX protein.	14351	14425
27840894	No hotspot mutations were found in XLH according to the present study in accordance with previous studies on PHEX mutations in Chinese patients (15–21).	14426	14578
27840894	However, it was valued that exceeding 50% mutations occurred around exons 18 to 22 in the C-terminal region based on the mutation analyses in PHEXdb and it was speculated that this region may be the critical domain for PHEX function (29).	14579	14817
27840894	We failed to determine the gene dosage effect on disease severity by comparing the phenotypes of hemizygous males to those of heterozygous females from the same family.	14818	14986
27840894	An evidence-based study also indicated that there was no difference in severity of the disease between genders in mutant Hyp mouse (30).	14987	15123
27840894	Theoretically, heterozygous females should have a less severe phenotype due to random X-inactivation, the process of transcriptional silencing of one of the X chromosomes bringing about half of the normal alleles, while males have none.	15124	15360
27840894	Sabbagh et al owed the absence of gene dose effect to a threshold of PHEX activity that was required for maintaining normal protein function (25).	15361	15507
27840894	In addition to the gender impact, questions remain as to the possibility of correlations among either mutation location or type with phenotype severity.	15508	15660
27840894	In the present study, the association between genotype and phenotype in patients with XLH was not observed.	15661	15768
27840894	It has been proposed that there is a trend towards a more severe phenotype with mutations located in the C-terminal region or with truncating mutations (31); however, this has yet to be verified in a larger sample size.	15769	15988
27840894	The aberrant activity of FGF23 was revealed as a common fundamental mechanism for the development of defects in phosphate and vitamin D metabolism in several hypophosphatemic diseases, including ADHR, XLH and tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) (5,32,33).	15989	16241
27840894	The Hyp mouse, an animal model of XLH, provided evidence of increased levels of FGF23 transcripts due to the inactivated mutations of PHEX.	16242	16381
27840894	Furthermore, an injection of FGF23 antibodies or the deletion of Fgf23 from the Hyp mouse has been shown to ameliorate or reverse the phosphate metabolic disorders (14,34).	16382	16554
27840894	These findings strongly indicate the essential role of FGF23 in the regulation of systemic phosphate homeostasis in the Hyp mouse.	16555	16685
27840894	However, we failed to observe a significant increase in serum FGF23 levels in all affected individuals compared with the healthy controls.	16686	16824
27840894	Moreover, 4 of 11 patients with XLH even exhibited serum FGF23 levels below the reference range.	16825	16921
27840894	Despite of the effect of confounding factors, the wide variation in serum FGF23 levels in XLH, as well as the overlapping FGF23 levels in XLH and healthy controls revealed its limited diagnostic value in patients with suspected XLH.	16922	17154
27840894	Moreover, it was speculated that other factors, such as parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D, were responsible for hypophosphatemia in patients with XLH with inappropriate low to normal serum FGF23 levels, and for the normal serum phosphorus in healthy subjects with high serum FGF23 levels (33,34).	17155	17465
27840894	Additionally, it was suggested that hypophosphatemia alone was not entirely responsible for the skeletal phenotype in XLH and the potential direct local effects of FGF23 may be involved in bone mineralization independent of its systematic action in phosphate homeostasis (35,36).	17466	17745
27840894	In conclusion, we identified 17 different mutations in the PHEX gene in 18 unrelated Chinese families with hypophosphatemic rickets and 7 of these were novel.	17746	17904
27840894	It should be noted that that 6 of the 17 PHEX mutations have been proven to be de novo, which suggests the frequent occurrence of sporadic cases of XLH in the Chinese population.	17905	18083
27840894	The findings of the present study highlight the major role of PHEX gene mutations in hypophosphatemic rickets and emphasize the significance of genetic diagnosis in suspected cases to ascertain the clinical diagnosis of XLH, enabling timely intervention.	18084	18338
27840894	Further studies are warranted in order to perform more extensive mutation analyses in affected individuals in order to elaborate the key domain in PHEX and the identification of unequivocal FGF23 function in the pathogenesis of XLH, subsequently, exploring for more effective treatments, not only for XLH, but also for associated diseases sharing similar molecular mechanism.	18339	18714
28101574	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most prevalent type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide (1–3).	0	144
28101574	Epidemiological studies show that the incidence of HCC is markedly varied across geographical regions, ancestry groups and between genders (4).	145	288
28101574	HCC incidence is highest in East Asia and Africa and rapid increases in prevalence have occurred in Western countries (5).	289	411
28101574	The typical characteristics of HCC include fast infiltrating growth, abnormal cell differentiation, high-grade malignancy, early metastasis and poor prognosis (6,7).	412	577
28101574	Therefore, identifying novel and reliable biomarkers to identify, predict and treat HCC are urgently needed.	578	686
28101574	NEK2 [NIMA (never in mitosis gene A)-related expressed kinase 2], a serine/threonine centrosomal kinase, plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle and mitosis by centrosome splitting during the cell division process (8).	687	916
28101574	Uncontrolled NEK2 activity can result in chromosome instability (CIN) and abnormal chromosome content (9,10).	917	1026
28101574	NEK2 overexpression has been demonstrated in several types of human cancers, such as breast (11–14), prostate (11), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (15) and colorectal cancer (16).	1027	1196
28101574	Additionally, some reports have indicated NEK2 as a potential biomarker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer prognosis (17,18), but NEK2 has rarely been investigated with regard to HCC.	1197	1413
28101574	With the advancements in the next generation of sequencing technologies, RNA-seq has become a powerful tool for deciphering global gene expression patterns, including an unprecedented capability to discover novel genes, alternative transcript variants, chimeric transcripts, expressed sequence variants and allele-specific expressions (19–22).	1414	1757
28101574	RNA-seq has expanded the study of cancer transcriptomics in the areas of gene expression, chimeric events and alternative splicing in search of novel biomarkers for the disease (23).	1758	1940
28101574	By integrating the RNA-seq data for the cells in the present study and the tissues in the study by Huang et al (24), we found that NEK2 expression was significantly upregulated and associated with a poor prognosis in patients with HCC.	1941	2176
28101574	Therefore, NEK2 may be a very promising prognostic biomarker for predicting HCC.	2177	2257
28101574	Furthermore, the possible mechanisms responsible for NEK2 overexpression in HCC also were investigated.	2258	2361
28101574	A total of 63 patients who were diagnosed with HCC and treated with partial liver resection surgery at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from 2010 to 2013 were enrolled in this study.	2362	2571
28101574	These patients included 52 males and 11 females, with a mean age of 47.86 years (range, 28–71 years) at the time of the operation.	2572	2702
28101574	The patients were pathologically diagnosed with HCC of histological grade II (n=28), grade III (n=20) and grade IV (n=15) according to the modified nuclear grading scheme outlined by the Edmondson and Steiner system.	2703	2919
28101574	A summary of the patient characteristics and the pathological characteristics is presented in Table I.	2920	3022
28101574	For validation using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), HCC tissues and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues from 5 different HCC patients (aged 42–68 years) were provided by the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University in 2014.	3023	3310
28101574	No prior treatments (including chemotherapy or radiotherapy) were conducted before the liver resection surgery.	3311	3422
28101574	This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Guangxi Medical University.	3423	3505
28101574	All patients provided written informed consent in order to participate in this study.	3506	3591
28101574	All HCC tissues and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues were obtained immediately after hepatectomy and were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C or collected in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for histopathological analysis.	3592	3840
28101574	The human HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and primary human normal liver cell line HL-7702 were purchased from the Committee on Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).	3841	4034
28101574	All cell lines were maintained under recommended culture conditions.	4035	4103
28101574	Cells were incubated in a 37°C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.	4104	4174
28101574	For whole transcriptome sequencing, RNA from 1×107 SMMC-7721 and HL-7702 cells was extracted using the TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and then quantified using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).	4175	4413
28101574	The whole transcriptome RNA-seq procedure was performed using the Ion Total RNA-Seq kit, the Ion PI™ Chip kit, the Ion PI™ Template OT2 200 kit, and the Ion PI™ Sequencing 200 kit based on the protocols of Life Technologies Corp. (Waltham, MA, USA).	4414	4663
28101574	In brief, mRNA was purified using oligo-dT beads from 100 µg of total RNAs for each sample and then fragmented.	4664	4775
28101574	The cleaved RNA fragments were reverse-transcribed into First-Strand cDNA, followed by Second-Strand cDNA synthesis.	4776	4892
28101574	Then, a single 'A' base was added to the cDNA fragments at the 3′ end.	4893	4963
28101574	The cDNAs were ligated to adapters and enriched by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate the final cDNA library.	4964	5082
28101574	After amplifying the sequencing template, RNA-seq was performed using the Ion Proton System (Life Technologies) with the standard protocol.	5083	5222
28101574	Total RNA was extracted from cell lines and liver specimens using the TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	5223	5370
28101574	To avoid any DNA contamination, isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) and quantified by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).	5371	5524
28101574	The RNA samples were measured using optical density at 260 nm and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the M-MLV First-Strand system for the qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols.	5525	5737
28101574	qRT-PCR was performed using the FastStart Universal SYBR-Green Master (Roche Diagnostics, Shanghai, China) and repeated three times in an ABI 7500 system.	5738	5892
28101574	The primer sequences used to detect mRNA were as follows: NEK2, forward 5′-CTTCCCGGGCTGAGGACTAT-3′ and reverse 5′-TCAGCTTCTGTCATGGAGCC-3′; β-actin, forward 5′-GGGAAATCGTGCGTGACAT-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGAG-3′.	5893	6113
28101574	The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial melting at 95°C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 sec and 60°C for 64 sec.	6114	6254
28101574	Analysis of the melting curve for the primers was conducted to confirm the specificity of the PCR product, and the threshold cycle (Ct) value for triplicate reactions was averaged.	6255	6435
28101574	The relative expression of NEK2 mRNA for each sample was calculated as follows: ΔCt = Ct (sample) − Ct (β-actin), ΔΔCt (sample) = ΔCt (sample) − ΔCt (calibrator).	6436	6598
28101574	The fold changes in mRNA were calculated through relative quantification (2−ΔΔCt).	6599	6681
28101574	Immunohistochemical studies on NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections obtained from the aforementioned patients with HCC and were performed according to the standard procedures.	6682	6916
28101574	Sections were cut at a thickness of 5 µm and heated in a 60°C oven.	6917	6984
28101574	Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and boiled in 0.01 mol/l sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven for 10 min for antigen epitope retrieval.	6985	7159
28101574	Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min.	7160	7233
28101574	Then, the sections were blocked for 30 min using 10% normal goat serum and were separately incubated with the primary antibodies directed against NEK2 (ab55550, 1:1,000 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), phospho-AKT (Ser473) (#4060, 1:50 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) and MMP-2 (ab86607 1:500, dilution; Abcam) at 37°C for 3 h. After washing, the sections were incubated for 30 min with biotinylated secondary antibody (Envision™ Detection kit; Gene Tech, Shanghai, China) at 37°C.	7234	7725
28101574	The staining of the tissue sections was performed using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2.	7726	7857
28101574	The complex was visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin.	7858	7949
28101574	The sections were then dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol, cleared in xylene and mounted onto glass slides.	7950	8063
28101574	The staining was quantified by digital image analysis with Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) according to the method developed by Xavie et al (25).	8064	8249
28101574	Briefly, an area of interest in each section was first selected at ×40 magnification, and 10 digital images at 1360×1024 pixel resolution and ×400 magnification were captured using an AX-70 microscope equipped with a DP70 CCD camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).	8250	8507
28101574	Identical settings were used for each field.	8508	8552
28101574	The measurement parameter was integrated optical density (IOD).	8553	8616
28101574	Optical density was calibrated, and the area of interest was set as follows: hue, 0–30; saturation, 0–255; and intensity, 0–255.	8617	8745
28101574	The values were then counted.	8746	8775
28101574	The TCGA project provides multimodal data on 359 HCC cases, which can be acquired from the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/).	8776	8918
28101574	The dataset was searched for HCC cases based on the RNASeqV2 data.	8919	8985
28101574	The expression value of the NEK2 gene was collected for each case and was divided into the high-expression and the low-expression groups using the cut-off point.	8986	9147
28101574	Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the survival differences between the high-expression and low-expression subgroups, with P-values calculated using the log-rank test.	9148	9333
28101574	Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).	9334	9429
28101574	Relationships between the expressions of NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 and the clinicopathological parameters were determined using the two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test.	9430	9601
28101574	Significance among three groups was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Duncan's new multiple range test.	9602	9730
28101574	The correlations between the NEK2 expression with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expressions were studied using the Spearman's coefficient.	9731	9861
28101574	Data are shown as the means ± standard error of the means.	9862	9920
28101574	P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences.	9921	9993
28101574	RNA-seq of the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and the normal liver cell line HL-7702 was performed using the Ion Proton System.	9994	10114
28101574	On average, ~78.1 million 96-bp-long sequencing reads and 7.5 G of raw sequence data were obtained for samples sequenced on one lane.	10115	10248
28101574	The normalized gene expression was measured as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM).	10249	10365
28101574	To evaluate differential gene expression, the absolute value of the log2-transformed fold change (FC) ≥1 and the q-values <0.05 were used as the criteria to determine the significance of gene expression differences.	10366	10581
28101574	A total of 610 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were revealed in the transcriptome comparison, 297 of which were upregulated and 313 were downregulated in HCC.	10582	10746
28101574	Huang et al (24) performed RNA-seq analyses of 10 matched pairs of cancerous and non-cancerous tissues from HCC patients on the Solexa/Illumina GAII platform.	10747	10905
28101574	The results showed that a total of 1378 DEGs with 808 upregulation and 570 downregulation in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues.	10906	11061
28101574	An integrated analysis was then performed on the RNA-seq data of the cells and tissues.	11062	11149
28101574	As shown in the Venn diagram in Fig.	11150	11186
28101574	1A, 12 common differential genes were found between the HCC cells and the normal cells and between the HCC tissues and the adjacent tissues, 10 of which were upregulated and 2 were downregulated in HCC (Table II).	11187	11400
28101574	Excitingly, NEK2 exhibited the most significant difference in expression of all the DEGs in the cell and tissue RNA-seq data and was therefore listed as an HCC candidate biomarker for further verification (Fig.	11401	11611
28101574	1B and C).	11612	11622
28101574	NEK2 expression status in the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and the primary HCC tissue samples was assessed using qRT-PCR.	11623	11739
28101574	The NEK2 mRNA transcript level was 0.024±0.0026 in the HCC cell line SMMC-7721, which was 1.71-fold higher than the NEK2 mRNA level of 0.014±0.0003 in the normal liver cell line HL-7702 (P=0.002) (Fig.	11740	11941
28101574	2A), as evidenced by qRT-PCR analysis using β-actin as a loading control.	11942	12015
28101574	In 5 matched HCC and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue samples, the NEK2 mRNA level in the HCC tissues was 5.60±3.69, which was 16.47-fold higher than the NEK2 mRNA level of 0.34±0.38 in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (P=0.013) (Fig.	12016	12255
28101574	2B).	12256	12260
28101574	The expression of NEK2 in 63 cases of HCC and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues was examined using immunohistochemical staining.	12261	12399
28101574	The NEK2 protein is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm, and we quantified its expression using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 digital image analysis software.	12400	12545
28101574	We found that NEK2 expression presented as positive staining in HCC tissues and negative staining in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (Fig.	12546	12688
28101574	2C).	12689	12693
28101574	Furthermore, the expression of NEK2 protein was significantly higher in the HCC tissues than in the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (P<0.001) (Fig.	12694	12845
28101574	2D).	12846	12850
28101574	To evaluate the clinical significance of NEK2 overexpression, the correlation between the survival and the expression of NEK2 in the cases of 359 patients with HCC was analyzed using RNASeqV2 data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website.	12851	13102
28101574	According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we defined RPKM=52.73 as the cut-off point to distinguish HCC patients with high and low NEK2 expression levels (Fig.	13103	13284
28101574	3A).	13285	13289
28101574	The sensitivity and specificity of NEK2 in the diagnosis of HCC were 0.98 and 0.82, respectively.	13290	13387
28101574	Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of HCC patients was performed based on the expression levels of NEK2.	13388	13488
28101574	The results revealed that HCC patients with a high expression of NEK2 had a poor prognosis (log-rank test, P=0.0145) (Fig.	13489	13611
28101574	3B).	13612	13616
28101574	Previous studies suggested that the overexpression of NEK2 promotes activation of AKT, a potent and critical oncogene for a variety of malignancies (26,27).	13617	13773
28101574	Moreover, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays an important role in upregulating MMP expression (28).	13774	13875
28101574	Therefore, to further investigate the relationship between the NEK2 expression and the expression of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 in HCC, we assessed the expression of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 in 63 cases of HCC and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues using immunohistochemical staining.	13876	14161
28101574	The staining for phospho-AKT and MMP-2 was mostly positive in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells (Fig.	14162	14262
28101574	4A and C).	14263	14273
28101574	We found that the expression of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 was increased in HCC tissues compared with matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (P=0.048 and 0.027) (Fig.	14274	14440
28101574	4B and D).	14441	14451
28101574	Table I summarizes the relationships between the expression of NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 and the clinicopathological parameters of patients with HCC, including patient age, gender, AFP level, tumor size, portal vein thrombosis, diolame complete, tumor nodule number, Edmondson grade, cirrhosis, HBV DNA and recurrence.	14452	14772
28101574	The results showed that NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expression in the HCC tumor size ≤10 cm group was 1.58-fold (P=0.024), 2.24-fold (P=0.041), and 2.29-fold (P=0.013) higher, respectively, than that in the HCC tumor size >10 cm group (Fig.	14773	15013
28101574	5A).	15014	15018
28101574	NEK2 and MMP-2 expression in the HCC diolame incomplete group was 1.91-fold (P<0.001) and 2.04-fold (P=0.009) higher, respectively, than that in the HCC diolame complete group, but no obvious change was observed in phospho-AKT expression in the HCC diolame incomplete group (P=0.948) (Fig.	15019	15308
28101574	5B).	15309	15313
28101574	NEK2, p-AKT and MMP-2 expression in the HCC multinodular group was 1.62-fold (P=0.012), 2.40-fold (P=0.046), and 2.04-fold (P=0.024) higher, respectively, than that in the HCC uninodular group (Fig.	15314	15512
28101574	5C).	15513	15517
28101574	NEK2 and p-AKT expression in the HCC recurrence group was 2.09-fold (P=0.004) and 3.24-fold (P=0.045) higher, respectively, than that in the HCC non-recurrence group, but no obvious change was observed in MMP-2 expression in the HCC non-recurrence group (P=0.992) (Fig.	15518	15787
28101574	5D).	15788	15792
28101574	Additionally, to explore whether the NEK2 expression level was correlated with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expression, the protein expressions of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 were examined in 63 cases of HCC tissues using immunohistochemical staining.	15793	16031
28101574	Therefore, the correlations between NEK2 expression with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expression were analyzed.	16032	16136
28101574	The results showed that there was indeed evident positive correlation between the protein expression level of NEK2 and phospho-AKT (r=0.883, P<0.01) (Fig.	16137	16291
28101574	6A).	16292	16296
28101574	Notably, a significant positive correlation was observed between the protein expression levels of NEK2 and MMP-2 (r=0.781, P<0.01) (Fig.	16297	16433
28101574	6B).	16434	16438
28101574	NEK2 is a serine-threonine protein kinase of the NIMA-related kinase family that localizes to the centrosomes, which are the microtubule-organizing centers of a cell that regulate its separation (8).	16439	16638
28101574	The NIMA-related kinase (Nek) family consists of eleven members (NEKs 1–11) (29).	16639	16720
28101574	In humans, NEK2 exhibits the greatest sequence identity to NIMA (8).	16721	16789
28101574	In the process of cell division, NEK2 promotes centrosome splitting at the beginning of mitosis by the phosphorylation of multiple linker components (30).	16790	16944
28101574	In addition to centrosome separation, NEK2 also regulates the microtubule organization capacity of the centrosome (31,32).	16945	17067
28101574	Recent studies have shown that an elevated expression of NEK2 induces abnormal tumor proliferation and drug resistance in breast and ovarian cancers (13,33,34).	17068	17228
28101574	Furthermore, the significant upregulation of NEK2 has been demonstrated to be associated with the progression and poor prognosis of a series of malignant tumors originating in different organs and tissues, such as colorectal carcinoma (35), breast carcinoma (36) and myeloma (27).	17229	17509
28101574	However, whether NEK2 expression is elevated and associated with the clinicopathological features and prognosis of HCC remains unclear.	17510	17645
28101574	In this study, we first assessed the expression of NEK2 in cells and tissues and found that NEK2 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC cells and tissues.	17646	17809
28101574	Additionally, we examined the expression of NEK2 in a relatively large population of patients diagnosed with HCC and correlated it with the clinicopathological parameters and prognosis to verify whether this biomarker could predict HCC outcomes.	17810	18055
28101574	The present study revealed that the overexpression of NEK2 was significantly correlated with diolame complete, tumor nodule number and recurrence.	18056	18202
28101574	Thus, these results strongly confirm the intriguing possibility that the alteration of NEK2 protein levels may contribute to the invasion and metastasis of HCC.	18203	18363
28101574	Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis demonstrated that HCC patients with a high expression of NEK2 had a poor prognosis, suggesting that NEK2 may be a potential prognostic factor for HCC patients.	18364	18573
28101574	Therefore, NEK2 can be used as a novel prognostic biomarker to identify, distinguish, and predict HCC.	18574	18676
28101574	The main limitation of this analysis is that, due to clinical covariates on HCC cases on TCGA website are not available, the multivariate Cox's regression survival model cannot be performed to assess the relative contribution of the risk group when assessed after adjusting for clinical variables.	18677	18974
28101574	Despite the important role of NEK2 in centrosome regulation and spindle formation, the mechanism of the abnormal expression and regulation of NEK2 remains unclear.	18975	19138
28101574	Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism that underlies the role of NEK2.	19139	19223
28101574	Previous studies suggested that NEK2 may be involved in tumor progression through the influence of other tumor pathways.	19224	19344
28101574	The elevation of NEK2 contributes to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, a potent and critical oncogene for a variety of malignancies (26,27).	19345	19501
28101574	Moreover, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays an important role in upregulating MMP expression (28), and aberrant AKT signaling could promote cell proliferation in HCC cells (37).	19502	19682
28101574	Therefore, we sought to verify whether such a mechanism may contribute to HCC progression induced by NEK2.	19683	19789
28101574	In this study, we found that the expression level of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 proteins was increased in HCC and positively correlated with NEK2, which indicated that overexpression of NEK2 may result in the high expression of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 proteins in HCC.	19790	20051
28101574	Furthermore, the AKT signaling pathway has been reported to play a key role in HCC cell invasion and metastasis by promoting the expression of MMP-2 (37), which is a key factor in HCC invasion and metastasis (38).	20052	20265
28101574	The expression level of MMP-2 significantly reflects the aggressiveness of malignant tumor cells and is associated with poor prognosis in multiple tumor types (37).	20266	20430
28101574	Combining the above findings with our results, we suggest that the invasion and metastasis effect of NEK2 in HCC may occur through the activation of AKT signaling and promotion of MMP-2 expression.	20431	20628
28101574	In conclusion, our data revealed that high expression of the NEK2 protein was common in HCC tissue samples and cultured hepatoma cell lines and was significantly associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable clinicopathological factors in HCC.	20629	20873
28101574	Moreover, the NEK2 expression level was positively correlated with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expression.	20874	20974
28101574	Our results suggest that NEK2 is important for the progression, migration and invasion of HCC and may be a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC.	20975	21117
27959387	Excessive chronic alcohol intake is a widely acknowledged risk factor for breast cancer.	0	88
27959387	In a previous study, we summarized the epidemiology and known pathology pertaining to alcohol consumption and breast cancer (1).	89	217
27959387	Briefly, consumption of three or more drinks per day leads to a 40–50% increase in risk and there are ~50,000 alcohol-attributable breast cancer cases per year, worldwide (2–4).	218	395
27959387	The risk of breast cancer increases with the quantity of alcohol consumed, showing a linear dose-response (5).	396	506
27959387	There is a greater risk for lobular rather than ductal breast cancer (5–7), and tumors are more likely to be ER− and HER2+ in the women with high alcohol consumption (8,9).	507	679
27959387	One proposed mechanism for the putative alcohol carcinogenicity involves stimulation of estrogen levels and/or estrogen responsiveness but other possibilities include effects unrelated to estrogen (2,3,9–13) such as inhibition of DNA methylation, interaction with retinoid metabolism, or oxidative stress.	680	985
27959387	Such changes could operate either by direct ethanol effects and/or through the first ethanol metabolite, acetaldehyde.	986	1104
27959387	As summarized previously (1), a few studies in mice and rats have shown that ethanol consumption promotes mammary tumors via the estrogen pathway (14).	1105	1256
27959387	The estrogen dependence was originally shown and partially explained in the widely used MCF-7 cell line, a human breast cancer luminal epithelial cell line which is estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and lacks ERBB2 gene amplification or Her2/neu protein overexpression (15–18).	1257	1544
27959387	It was also shown that ethanol stimulates the in vitro growth, invasiveness and migration of these cells (17–24).	1545	1658
27959387	However, the common denominator of the previous studies on MCF-7 cells is that the ethanol exposure was limited to <1 week, concentrations were >50 mM, and the effects were modest.	1659	1839
27959387	A similar situation occurred with studies conducted on other types of more malignant breast cancer cell lines, such as T47D and erbB2 transformed cells (25–30).	1840	2000
27959387	Another potential mechanism of ethanol's carcinogenicity is through enrichment of a subpopulation of cancer stem cells, but there are no reports on the effects of ethanol on this type of stem cells (31–33).	2001	2207
27959387	Cancer stem cells are postulated to be involved in the generation of primary breast tumors and their progression to undifferentiated tumors and metastasis, and are claimed to be enriched within mammospheres (34,35).	2208	2423
27959387	Although ethanol affects the proliferation and differentiation of normal embryonic and adult stem cells (36,37), it is not known whether it activates and/or increases the number of cancer stem cells.	2424	2623
27959387	The latter process, as well as the regulation of breast cancer genes in general, is partially regulated by microRNAs (miR) (34,38–41), particularly with regard to the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) (42,43).	2624	2839
27959387	Ethanol affects the expression of certain miRs in alcoholic liver injury and other pathologies (44,45), but no reports link this to breast cancer.	2840	2986
27959387	In contrast, there is a substantial recent literature on miRs in relation to estrogen effects, particularly in MCF-7 cells (46–48), but none has been directly linked to ethanol exposure.	2987	3173
27959387	In our previous study on the non-malignant epithelial human breast cell line MCF-12A (1) we found that ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, induced oncogenic features and EMT, and stimulated the expression of a collection of mRNAs and miRs, including those associated with these processes, and also stimulated certain protein markers for stem-related properties.	3174	3530
27959387	In this study, the effects of short- and long-term exposures to physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol, and acetaldehyde up to supraphysiological levels were studied using MCF-7 monolayers and mammospheres.	3531	3749
27959387	Stem cell markers, global transcriptional gene expression signatures including miRs, and in vitro responses in oncogenic assays were carried out to better understand the mechanism of action of alcohol on malignant progression in breast cancer.	3750	3993
27959387	The aim was to clarify: a) whether the epidemiological relationship between excessive and long-term alcohol consumption and the malignant progression of breast cancer can be elucidated by defining the effects of ethanol on an accepted epithelial breast cancer cell line such as MCF-7 in vitro; b) whether ethanol intensifies some of the MCF-7 malignant features in a dosage- and/or duration of exposure-dependent way; c) the potential mediation of these effects by stem cell enrichment in both monolayers and mammospheres; d) the possible role of acetaldehyde in mediating those changes; and e) the impact of both alcohol and acetaldehyde on the mRNA and miR global signatures, so as to define the more affected pathways and to evaluate putative estrogen mediation.	3994	4759
27959387	The human adherent epithelial adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line was obtained from ATCC (Catalog HT-22™ Manassas, VA, USA), and routinely cultured on monolayers at ≤80% confluence in MEME (minimum essential medium Eagle's, ATCC), 10% FBS and 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).	4760	5052
27959387	For most experiments, cells were incubated on 6-well plates with 0-25 mM ethanol (Fisher, molecular grade ethanol) or 0–12.5 mM acetaldehyde (Sigma, ACS), using freshly prepared solutions.	5053	5241
27959387	Medium was replaced 2–3 times/week, including addition of ethanol or acetaldehyde, and cultures were maintained for 1 week (short-term incubations), or for 4 weeks (long-term incubations).	5242	5430
27959387	In the latter case, cells were passaged on average once a week, with a 1:3 splitting.	5431	5516
27959387	Mammospheres were generated for 1 week experiments by seeding 50,000 cells onto Corning Ultra Low Attachment 6-well-plates with 2 ml/well of MEBM medium (Fisher, mammary epithelial cell growth medium), adding 2% (v/v) of B27 Supplement (B27 serum-free supplement, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin, and then adding ethanol or acetaldehyde.	5517	5883
27959387	For 4-week incubations, monolayers were cultured for this period with ethanol or acetaldehyde and used for mammosphere generation that were maintained in the presence of these agents for an additional week.	5884	6090
27959387	Their number and total area were determined by applying quantitative image analysis (QIA) to digital photographs taken with a Nikon digital camera of 0.005% crystal violet stained mammospheres contained in individual wells of a 6-well plate, using ImagePro-Plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).	6091	6410
27959387	After images were calibrated for background lighting, integrated optical density (IOD = area × average intensity) was calculated.	6411	6540
27959387	Inverted microscopy images were taken under phase contrast at 40× and 100× using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope and a Leica VCC digital camera.	6541	6683
27959387	Medium was decanted from wells and cells were washed twice with PBS at pH 7.4.	6684	6762
27959387	Boiling buffer (1% SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 and protease inhibitors) was added to each well, cells were scraped from each well and passed several times through a 26-gauge needle to reduce viscosity, incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min, then 20–40 μg of protein was run on 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunodetection using antibodies against: i) Oct-4, (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA); ii) CEACAM-6 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA); iii) NANOG (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000, AVIVA Systems, San Diego, CA, USA) and iv) GAPDH (mouse monoclonal, 1:3,000, Chemicon).	6763	7532
27959387	Membranes were incubated with secondary polyclonal horse anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000; BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA or 1:5,000; Amersham GE, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), bands were visualized with luminol (SuperSignal West Pico, Chemiluminescent, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).	7533	7868
27959387	For the negative controls the primary antibody was omitted.	7869	7928
27959387	Cultures were grown in 8-well-removable-chamber slides, subjected to immunofluorescence detection by quenching in 0.3% H2O2, blocking with goat (or corresponding) serum, and incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody for Oct-4 or NANOG.	7929	8175
27959387	This was followed by a secondary anti-mouse IgG biotinylated antibody (goat, 1:200, Vector Laboratories) and this complex was detected with streptavidin-Texas Red.	8176	8339
27959387	After washing with PBS, the sections were mounted with Prolong antifade/DAPI (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA).	8340	8455
27959387	Negative controls in all cases omitted the first antibodies or were replaced by IgG isotype.	8456	8548
27959387	Control and 25 mM ethanol-incubated MCF-7 cells were grown in GM-20, washed twice with Hanks buffered salt solution, disaggregated by repeated pipeting in CellStripper (Mediatech, Manassas VA, USA), pelleted, and resuspended in staining buffer consisting of PBS, 3% FBS (SB).	8549	8824
27959387	Cells were incubated in the presence of antibodies for 30 min on ice, washed twice with SB, and resuspended in SB for flow cytometry on an LSR II (BD Biosciences).	8825	8988
27959387	Controls included samples without any antibody as well as samples including all combinations of antibodies so as to determine that the Ceacam6 stained cells and the CD44 stained cells were accurately identified.	8989	9200
27959387	Data analysis and plotting were done using FACSDiva Version 6.1.1 software.	9201	9276

27959387	GSE72013.	9876	9885
27959387	Cells were trypsinized, suspended in 1 ml/well of warm (37°C) 0.3–0.5% agar in MEME-10% FBS-bovine serum albumin (soft agar layer) and 10,000 cells/ml were plated in duplicate or triplicate above a layer of 1 ml of 1% agar in the same medium that had previously been allowed to solidify on 6-well plates at 4°C (hard layer agar).	10918	11247
27959387	Cultures were allowed to grow for 3–4 weeks and when foci were visible, they were stained with 0.005% crystal violet in Hanks solution for 1 h, wells were photographed as described in 'Cell culture', and colonies were counted, also as described above.	11248	11499
27959387	Matrigel™ basement membrane matrix was diluted 1:5 with serum free culture medium containing 0.5% BSA according to the manufacturer's instructions.	11500	11647
27959387	Trypsinized cells were added at 25,000 cells/well to Transwell® Permeable Support 8.0-μm inserts containing Matrigel and culture medium, and cultured in a 24-well plate using FBS as the chemoattractant for 40 h. Cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue.	11648	11914
27959387	MCF-7 cells (control vs 4 weeks 25 mM ethanol) were incubated in estrogen-depletion medium (EDM): phenol red-free DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) containing 5% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (Gibco) for 3 days, washed with Hanks, trypsinized, resuspended in EDM and plated at 1,000 cells/well into a 96-well plate.	11915	12225
27959387	4-OH-tamoxifen was added to a concentration of 0, 1, 2, 5 or 10 μM (6-wells for each concentration).	12226	12326
27959387	Cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4 days, washed once with Hanks, followed by the addition of 100 μl of EDM.	12327	12444
27959387	After 30-min additional incubation, each well received 20 μl of the metabolic activity indicator CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and cells were further incubated (37°C in 5% CO2) for 30 min.	12445	12692
27959387	The absorbance at 490 nm was measured using an automated plate reader.	12693	12763
27959387	Statistical values are expressed as the mean (± SEM).	12764	12817
27959387	The normality distribution of the data was established using the Wilk-Shapiro test.	12818	12901
27959387	Multiple comparisons were analyzed by a single factor ANOVA, followed by post hoc comparisons with the Newman-Keuls test.	12902	13023
27959387	Differences among groups were considered statistically significant at p<0.05.	13024	13101
27959387	To investigate the possibility that ethanol exerts its oncogenic effects through the stimulation of cancer stem cell proliferation, we carried out experiments to ascertain the effects on the key stem cell marker proteins Oct4 and Nanog.	13102	13338
27959387	MCF-7 monolayer cultures were incubated at 30–80% confluence for 7 days with 1–25 mM ethanol and subjected to western blot analysis for Oct4 and Nanog (Fig.	13339	13495
27959387	1).	214	217
27959387	The highest concentration of ethanol is roughly equivalent to peak serum levels of alcohol in women within 1 h of consumption of 3–4 glasses of wine.	13500	13649
27959387	The stemness-related nuclear Oct4a isoform (45 kDa) was increased after exposure to 1 and 5 mM ethanol, and was reduced at 10 and 25 mM.	13650	13786
27959387	Triplicate samples of the 25 mM treatment show downregulation.	13787	13849
27959387	The cytoplasmic Oct4b (33 kDa), unrelated to stemness, was expressed at low levels and remained unchanged.	13850	13956
27959387	The main 39 kDa Nanog isoform was increased after exposure to 1–10 mM ethanol, and analogous to the Oct4 result, was also decreased at 25 mM.	13957	14098
27959387	The nuclear localization of Oct4a, consistent with its known stemness function, and, in addition, the nuclear localization of Nanog, were confirmed by double immunofluorescence with Texas red for the specific antigen and DAPI for nuclei in MCF-7 cells incubated in the absence of ethanol (data not shown).	14099	14404
27959387	In order to investigate whether ethanol effects are mediated by its first oxidation product, acetaldehyde, a range of acetaldehyde concentrations was applied to MCF-7 monolayers and the effect on Oct4 expression was analyzed.	14405	14630
27959387	Acetaldehyde over the range of 0.5–12.5 mM and over the same time of incubation did not affect the expression of Oct4 (Fig.	14631	14754
27959387	2).	14755	14758
27959387	These acetaldehyde concentrations, considerably lower than the respective ethanol concentrations, were chosen based on the fact that they are marginally to considerably higher (i.e., approximately one log value) than the acetaldehyde values that would be expected in human serum after substantial drinking.	14759	15065
27959387	These levels have been measured to be as much as 0.2 mM (49).	15066	15127
27959387	Even at these levels acetaldehyde had little or no effect on Oct4 levels.	15128	15201
27959387	Gene expression analysis of MCF-7 cells grown in monolayer in the presence or absence of ethanol (25 mM) for 1 and 4 weeks was carried out by subjecting RNA samples to DNA microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST system.	15202	15440
27959387	The longer exposure was intended to better model the situation that exists in vivo in chronic drinkers.	15441	15544
27959387	In order to determine the global transcriptional signature that differentiates the malignant MCF-7 cells from a normal counterpart, we compared the MCF-7 cell line with the spontaneously immortalized but otherwise benign breast epithelial line MCF-12A (1).	15545	15801
27959387	For each gene sequence, the ratio of MCF-7 expression to MCF-12A expression was determined from duplicate samples.	15802	15916
27959387	We refer to the collection of MCF-7/MCF-12A gene expression ratios shown in Table I as the MCF-7 oncogenic signature.	15917	16034
27959387	Some genes related to oncogenic processes were substantially changed, being up- or downregulated by a factor ≥2.0.	16035	16149
27959387	This transcriptional signature was characterized by 15 genes upregulated by a factor ≥2.4, and 3 oncogenesis-related genes downregulated to a factor of ≤0.27, including some associated with oncogenic transformation and some associated with growth-related hormone receptors.	16150	16423
27959387	We then investigated whether an oncogenic signature reflected the effects of ethanol treatment on MCF-7 by itself.	16424	16538
27959387	Short-term ethanol incubation for 1 week had little or no effect on the expression of this group of 18 genes (Table I), whereas 4-week exposure increased CEACAM5, CEACAM6, and progesterone receptor (PGR) gene expression (Table I).	16539	16769
27959387	Neither 1-nor 4-week exposures to ethanol or acetaldehyde affected the transcriptional expression of Oct-4 or Nanog (Table II).	16770	16897
27959387	In view of the interesting results on the transcriptional expression of the malignancy related CEACAMs, we evaluated by western blot analysis the effects of long-term ethanol exposure on Ceacam6, an oncogenic protein associated with breast cancer (50), along with the Oct4 and Nanog proteins.	16898	17190
27959387	Fig.	13491	13495
27959387	3 shows that 25 mM ethanol upregulates the expression of these proteins, with particularly strong upregulation in Oct4 and Ceacam6, and a visible but non-significant increase of Nanog.	17196	17380
27959387	In the case of Oct4, this suggests a post-transcriptional modulation induced by ethanol (see Discussion).	17381	17486
27959387	These results potentially may also indicate the induction of higher stem cell number or the selection of a subpopulation of cells with some stem-like features.	17487	17646
27959387	In order to determine whether Ceacam-6 upregulation represented a global increase or was restricted to a subpopulation of cells, untreated control MCF-7 monolayers and monolayer cells exposed to 25 mM ethanol for 4 weeks were analyzed by flow cytometry.	17647	17900
27959387	Fig.	13491	13495
27959387	4 (center) shows that a fraction of the cells did show enrichment of Ceacam-6 following ethanol treatment, from 2.11% in controls to 8.18% in ethanol-treated cells, consistent with levels of upregulation observed in western blot analyses and PCRs.	17906	18153
27959387	The control forward- and side-scattering (Fig.	18154	18200
27959387	4, left) indicate that the ethanol treatment did not appreciably affect cell size or internal complexity, as shown by the lack of observed changes.	18201	18348
27959387	In view of the assumption that mammospheres are enriched in stem cells, we investigated whether ethanol affects mammosphere formation and composition.	18349	18499
27959387	MCF-7 cells were maintained in monolayer culture in the presence or absence of ethanol, following which mammospheres were prepared from each sample.	18500	18648
27959387	The mammospheres derived from control and ethanol treated cultures were maintained for an additional week in control medium or ethanol medium respectively.	18649	18804
27959387	The number of mammospheres and their morphology did not visually appear to be modified by ethanol exposure (data not shown).	18805	18929
27959387	Despite the observed increase in Oct4a and Nanog proteins induced by long-term 25 mM ethanol treatment in MCF-7 monolayers, it is of interest that these effects were not replicated in mammospheres obtained from these cultures and maintained for an additional week in the presence of ethanol.	18930	19221
27959387	Fig.	13491	13495
27959387	5 shows that the previously observed increase in Oct4a and Nanog in monolayer was not observed in mammospheres where stem cells should be enriched, but Ceacam6 did remain upregulated.	19227	19410
27959387	More surprisingly, taking into account our original assumption, when mammospheres were quantitated by determining both size and number, long-term exposure to ethanol did not significantly increase their yield, as judged by their relative area (29,352 control vs. 33,889 ethanol-treated), or by their numbers either by counting stained mammospheres under the microscope (1,337 control vs. 1,295 ethanol) or as determined using quantitative image analysis (1,314 control vs. 1,357 ethanol-treated).	19411	19907
27959387	RNA was isolated from the mammospheres obtained under 1-week exposure to ethanol or acetaldehyde and subjected to DNA microarray analysis.	19908	20046
27959387	Table II shows that mammospheres were not enriched in the expression of a collection of stem cell genes.	20047	20151
27959387	Neither ethanol nor acetaldehyde stimulated the expression of these genes in mammospheres or their original monolayers, which is noteworthy since some are related to breast cancer, such as: ALDH2, SOX4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, HEY1, JAG1, DNER or Dll1 (51).	20152	20404
27959387	No parallel assay was conducted in the mammospheres exposed long-term to ethanol.	20405	20486
27959387	As stated above, CEACAM6 protein upregulation induced by long-term ethanol exposure as shown on western blot analyses was in general agreement with mRNA upregulation, so we investigated whether other CEACAM mRNAs or those from other gene families were also upregulated.	20487	20756
27959387	Table III shows that gene expression of the CEACAMs, cytokines and HLAs were all stimulated by 25 mM ethanol, by factors ranging from 1.7 to 8.1.	20757	20902
27959387	Long-term incubation with ethanol also induces other changes of oncogenic relevance, as confirmed by the substantial upregulation of a series of genes related to breast cancer such as STEAP4, SERPINA3, SAMD9, GDF-15, TP63, PGR, and others, with the transcriptional expression of 13 genes being increased ≥2.0 in two experiments (Table IVA).	20903	21243
27959387	To confirm the DNA microarray results, selected RNAs from the second of the two experiments were subjected to RT-PCR for some genes in the families mentioned above (Fig.	21244	21413
27959387	6).	21414	21417
27959387	The correspondence between the RT-PCR and DNA microarray values was good to excellent (Table IVB), thus showing that ethanol indeed upregulated these cancer-related genes, and validating in general the DNA microarray data.	21418	21640
27959387	Of particular interest, a family of genes, the metallothioneins (MTs), is known to be induced by ethanol (52,53).	21641	21754
27959387	Short-term 25 mM ethanol upregulated the mRNA expression of multiple members of this family (MT1F, MT1X, and MT2A, by a factor of ≥2) (Table V).	21755	21899
27959387	This effect was specific to ethanol, as it was not seen in response to treatment with 2.5 mM acetaldehyde.	21900	22006
27959387	The upregulation detected by DNA microarray analysis was also confirmed by RT-PCR, as for example MT1X (Fig.	22007	22115
27959387	7).	22116	22119
27959387	However, this significant upregulation seemed to be short-lived, since after the 4-week exposure, it declined to only a marginal increase (not shown) suggesting the adaptation of MCF-7 to ethanol in terms of metallothionein expression.	22120	22355
27959387	MicroRNAs (miRs) function by suppressing the activities of specific target mRNAs.	22356	22437
27959387	Although it is possible for multiple miRs to affect a specific mRNA, sometimes an inverse relationship is observed between the expression level of a particular miR and the prevalence of the polypeptide coded by its target mRNA.	22438	22665
27959387	Therefore, identifying the global miR transcriptional signature in response to ethanol exposure is important in clarifying the mechanism(s) of action of ethanol on breast cancer, particularly in evaluating its putative estrogen-like effects.	22666	22907
27959387	We therefore carried out 4-week incubations of MCF-7 monolayers with and without 25 mM ethanol in duplicate experiments to investigate changes in miR prevalence.	22908	23069
27959387	Changes in the global expression signature of miRs induced by ethanol are presented in Table VI, showing that out of 1,904 miRs analyzed, 18 miRs were consistently upregulated in two separate assays by a factor of >2.0 and another 24 were downregulated by at least an equivalent factor (to ≤0.5).	23070	23366
27959387	Of these, 4 miRs showed substantial upregulation (by >3.0) and 9 miRs were substantially downregulated (to ≤0.33).	23367	23481
27959387	Within the group of 4 upregulated genes, 3 are linked to cancer, namely miR-3170 which is downregulated in Merkel cell carcinoma (54), miR-335-5p which is linked to fibrosarcoma (55) and colorectal cancer but was negative in at least one study in MCF-7 (56), and miR-424-5p which is increased in breast cancer through an estrogen stimulated pathway (57) but is anti-invasive in another system (58).	23482	23880
27959387	Within the group of 9 downregulated miRs, 5 are also related to cancer: miR-2861 is upregulated in thyroid carcinoma with lymph node metastases (59) but has been suggested as one element in a circulating miR screen for cervical cancer (see Discussion), miR-3185 for chordoma (60), miR-1915 whose downregulation would predict an antiapoptotic effect (and therefore potential oncogenicity) mediated through Bcl-2 (61), miR-4492 potentially linked to breast cancer (62), and miR-1469 downregulation linked to lymphatic metastasis in gastric cancer (63) but a stimulatory factor for apoptosis in lung cancer cells (64).	23881	24496
27959387	In Table VII, we group other miRs affected by long-term ethanol exposure of MCF-7, focusing on whether these miRs may be related to two additional important issues that may underlie the observed intensification of MCF-7 malignant features: a) the finding of upregulation of Oct4 and Ceacam6 protein expression; and b) the putative mediation of alcohol effects by estrogen-like mechanisms.	24497	24885
27959387	In Table VII, miRs whose expression was affected in general by a factor of >2 are listed based on a relationship with one or more of these issues.	24886	25032
27959387	In terms of the Oct4 regulation, Let-7 has been reported to repress Oct4 protein expression (65) and after ethanol treatment it is substantially downregulated from high levels seen in the non-exposed control.	25033	25241
27959387	Considering the observed lack of OCT4 gene transcriptional upregulation in the presence of ethanol, concomitant with the observed stimulation of Oct4 protein, this miR change is very pertinent in this context.	25242	25451
27959387	In turn, with respect to possible miRs targeting Ceacam6, only one likely miR was downregulated (149-3P) (66) which would be consistent with Ceacam6 upregulation, although three (15a-5P, 16-5P and 195-5P) were upregulated, but their relationship with Ceacam6 is less clear.	25452	25725
27959387	In terms of a possible relationship with estrogen pathways, Table VII shows several miRs affected by long-term ethanol exposure that are known to modulate or be modulated by estrogen-mediated processes or estrogen responsiveness, specifically 6 that are upregulated (16, 27a, 27b, 200a, 203, and 342) and 3 downregulated (let7b, 7c and 7d) (see Discussion).	25726	26083
27959387	In order to determine whether long-term exposure to ethanol or acetaldehyde stimulates anchorage-independence, an in vitro marker of oncogenic transformation, incubations with 2.5–25 mM ethanol or 2.5 mM acetaldehyde were carried out for 4 weeks followed by 3–4 weeks growth in the clonogenic soft agar assay.	26084	26393
27959387	Fig.	13491	13495
27959387	8 shows that 25 mM ethanol treatment substantially and significantly increases the number of anchorage-independent foci by 5.6-fold (4 separate experiments, each in triplicate), which agrees with the protein expression and transcriptional signature changes related to stem cell and oncogenic features.	26399	26700
27959387	In addition, after exposure to a lower ethanol concentration (10 mM), there was a substantial and significant increase in anchorage-independence of 3.85-fold (p=0.014) for triplicate ethanol wells and duplicate control wells.	26701	26926
27959387	However, exposure to further ethanol dilutions, 2.5 or 5 mM, had no significant effect.	26927	27014
27959387	As in the case of 1-week incubation, long-term treatment with 2.5 mM acetaldehyde did not stimulate foci formation (data not shown).	27015	27147
27959387	In contrast to the clonogenic assay, incubation of 25,000 cells with 25 mM ethanol for 4 weeks was not associated with the stimulation of invasiveness in the Matrigel assay (data not shown).	27148	27338
27959387	It should be noted that the MCF-7 cell line is not invasive per se.	27339	27406
27959387	There were only trace numbers of positive cells (mean of 4 samples each: control mean 11.25±2.4 SE; ethanol mean 14.5±2.9 SE) and there was no statistical significance (p=0.68, two-tailed t-test).	27407	27603
27959387	Moreover, there was no induction of tamoxifen resistance after incubation for 4 weeks with 25 mM ethanol as analyzed by cellular metabolism in the presence of increasing levels of the drug (data not shown).	27604	27810
27959387	To our knowledge this is the first report on the in vitro long-term effects of ethanol on breast cancer cells at doses comparable to peak exposures in humans, and describing multiple targets of potential cancer-related impact.	27811	28037
27959387	These effects are not exerted by acetaldehyde, and are largely inconsistent with respect to estrogen-mediated effects.	28038	28156
27959387	Therefore, our results do not support the prevalent hypothesis that ethanol action in cancer-related processes functions mainly through estrogenic or acetaldehyde mediation, although future, more mechanistic work is needed to test this assumption, particularly in relation to the potential estrogen mediation.	28157	28466
27959387	In a previous study (1), we investigated the effects of ethanol exposure on a non-malignant, spontaneously immortalized breast epithelial cell line, MCF-12A.	28467	28624
27959387	We found that relatively low doses of ethanol stimulated markers for epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), as shown by changes in mRNAs and miRs.	28625	28773
27959387	We also found some upregulation in the stem-related proteins Oct4 and Nanog, as well as in the oncogenic marker Ceacam6.	28774	28894
27959387	The results with respect to these phenomena are remarkably similar in this study of MCF-7, although the levels of ethanol necessary to achieve the observed changes differed.	28895	29068
27959387	Ethanol incubation induced a gene expression signature in MCF-12A that includes short-term upregulation of one gene family in particular, the metallothioneins, similar to that observed in MCF-7.	29069	29263
27959387	In this study, we have shown that: i) an exposure as short as 1 week to 25 mM ethanol stimulates the transcriptional expression of the metallothionein gene family in MCF-7, showing that even in an established cancer cell line, the effect of ethanol on MT expression occurs; this short-term ethanol treatment does not, however, induce any substantial change in the global transcriptional signature related to the expression of stem cell or oncogenic markers in monolayers or mammospheres; ii) in contrast, longer (4-week) exposure of MCF-7 monolayers to 5–25 mM ethanol leads to upregulation of the key stem cell proteins Oct4 and Nanog, and of a key oncogenic protein, Ceacam6, demonstrating that phenomena previously observed in MCF-12A are maintained in the established cancer line MCF-7; iii) in MCF-7 mammospheres incubated long-term with ethanol, only Ceacam6 remains upregulated, and there is no effect on mammosphere number or size; iv) changes in Ceacam6 protein expression are reflected in RNA expression, but the same phenomenon is not observed for Oct4 or Nanog protein expression, suggesting their regulation at the translational level.	29264	30412
27959387	In addition, of even more significant pathological relevance, we showed that: v) in MCF-7 monolayers, long-term effects induced by 25 mM ethanol include substantial changes in the global transcriptional signature, including upregulation of immune-related genes, HLAs, and in particular, a series of genes involved in breast cancer; vi) this long-term oncogenic intensification of the transcriptional signature by ethanol is associated with the stimulation of anchorage-independence, a marker of increased malignancy; vii) this putative transformation exerted by ethanol is not associated with induction of tamoxifen resistance, potentially related to estrogen effects, or of invasiveness; viii) ethanol effects on miR expression are largely inconsistent with the hypothesis that ethanol effects are entirely or even largely mediated through estrogenic pathways; rather, there are conflicting effects such that some miR expression follows this pattern and other miR expression goes in the direction that is opposite to what would be expected under the estrogenic hypothesis; ix) most of the alterations we observed following ethanol treatment do not appear to be mediated by acetaldehyde.	30413	31600
27959387	We do not have a conclusive explanation for the temporal pattern showed by oncogenic effects due to long-term exposure to ethanol, but speculate as to two possible mechanisms: i) ethanol effects on gene expression may result from a cascade of regulatory events that requires multiple cell divisions to complete; or ii) longer term exposure to ethanol not only affects gene expression, it selects for a subset of cells within the original population; thus the partially toxic effects of ethanol might be reflected in gene expression changes that accumulate over the course of several cell division cycles.	31601	32205
27959387	Before analyzing the mechanistic significance of these alterations, it is important to stress the limitations of this study, in that it is essentially an in vitro proof-of-concept approach, based on the cell line, MCF-7, similar to what we cautiously stated regarding our previous study on the normal MCF-12A cell line (1).	32206	32529
27959387	The malignant MCF-7 cell line was derived from a metastatic site of a breast cancer tumor and is widely used as a model for breast cancer studies.	32530	32676
27959387	Our results need to be confirmed and extended in vitro using lower concentrations of ethanol and by examination of the interconnections between observed gene expression alterations.	32677	32858
27959387	It should be noted that in our previous study on MCF-12A cells, considerably lower levels of ethanol led to substantial effects on protein, mRNA, and miR prevalence, and that their long-term exposure to high 25 mM levels arrested their growth and ultimately was toxic to the cells.	32859	33140
27959387	In a simplistic comparison, this would mean that the stimulation of malignant features (MCF-7) requires a higher concentration of ethanol than their induction (MCF-12A).	33141	33310
27959387	To better extrapolate these MCF-7 results to the human, in vivo confirmation is required in experimental animals.	33311	33424
27959387	Although the in vitro exposure to ethanol concentrations of 5–25 mM, roughly equivalent in women to peak human serum concentrations after 0.6–3 glasses of wine taken during a 2-h period, was maintained continuously, its duration of only 4 weeks is certainly much shorter than the cumulative years of exposure that a human drinker experiences in a lifetime.	33425	33781
27959387	There is no easy calculation of the equivalence between cell culture incubations and breast tumor tissue exposures, particularly because MCF-7 cultures may not reflect the complex stromal/epithelial interactions involved in breast cancer progression.	33782	34032
27959387	Despite the above limitations, this study calls attention to the existence of molecular alterations in breast tumor cells induced by ethanol that may open up directions to further investigations on breast cancer in women.	34033	34254
27959387	It is of interest that the metallothioneins are members of a family of genes known to be induced by ethanol (52) and comprising members such as MT-I and MT-II that are antiapoptotic, proliferative, angiogenic, and oncogenic (53).	34255	34484
27959387	The expression of MT-I and MT-II is increased in breast cancer and other tumors, correlating with higher tumor grade/stage, increased recurrence and poor survival in the highly malignant invasive ductal breast carcinomas, and predicting poor prognosis in estrogen receptor-negative patients.	34485	34776
27959387	Although the stimulation of metallothionein gene expression is indicative of gene expression effects beginning as soon as a few days after the administration of alcohol, the stimulation of metallothionein gene expression did not persist in our model system, so the long-term effect of these gene changes with respect to oncogenesis remains uncertain.	34777	35127
27959387	As noted above, the temporal course of action in MT genes are similar for both the malignant MCF-7 cells and the non-malignant MCF-12A cells.	35128	35269
27959387	A consistent pattern of changes induced by long-term ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, is the correlation between the upregulation of the key stem cell proteins Oct4a and Nanog (67) and an important cancer marker, Ceacam6 (50), in addition to the induction of anchorage-independence evidenced by soft agar growth.	35270	35580
27959387	OCT4 is well known as a key gene responsible for the stemness network, and the main factor in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS).	35581	35730
27959387	More recently, OCT4 has emerged as a key oncogenic factor related to the role of cancer stem cells (68).	35731	35835
27959387	For instance, expression of the Oct4 protein is higher in cancerous tissues than in adjacent-tumor tissues, is related to histological type, lymph node status and molecular type of breast cancer, and together with Her-2, is an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer (69,70), although it seems to occur later than SOX2 activation (71,72).	35836	36182
27959387	In MCF-7 cells, estrogen stimulates and metformin reduces the size and number of mammospheres and their expression of Oct4 (73).	36183	36311
27959387	However, our current results must be viewed as speculative as to whether they connect the observed upregulation of Oct4 to increased malignancy, since in another study, silencing OCT4 promoted invasion and metastasis in MCF-7 cells by inducing EMT (74).	36312	36565
27959387	The very low expression of Oct4 detected by us in MCF-7 monolayers in the absence of ethanol is consistent with observations from other studies (75,76), and the potentially oncogenic upregulation by ethanol has not been previously reported.	36566	36806
27959387	As to NANOG, there is extensive evidence linking it to breast cancer directly or through its activation by SOX2, alone or in conjunction with KLF4 (77), and it is known that ethanol induces Nanog in embryonic stem cells and hepatic carcinogenesis (78).	36807	37059
27959387	The upregulation of CEACAM6 after long-term 25 mM ethanol exposure is consistent with a more aggressive phenotype of MCF-7 cells in vitro (75).	37060	37203
27959387	Ceacam6, a membrane-associated cell adhesion protein, is overexpressed in breast cancer and a variety of other tumors, and is considered to be a marker of invasiveness and metastasis, a predictor of breast cancer recurrence, and specifically of invasive breast cancer in women with atypical ductal hyperplastic tissues (79–82).	37204	37531
27959387	There are no previous reports of ethanol effects on CEACAM6, or on a link between CEACAM6 and OCT4 expression in any other context save our previous study on non-malignant cells (1), and the correlation of this upregulation to the intensification of anchorage-independence has not been reported previously except in our previous report (1), thus showing that this phenomenon is observed in both malignant and non-malignant cells derived from breast epithelium.	37532	37992
27959387	Similarly, the stimulation of MCF-7 growth in soft agar due to exposure to ethanol at a dose as low as 10 mM has not been described before except in the previous report (1), since previous studies (20–26) used high concentrations of ethanol (90–110 mM), short periods of exposure (48 h), and in some cases, breast cancer cell lines other than MCF-7.	37993	38342
27959387	The stimulation by long-term ethanol of the expression of Ceacam6 protein is in agreement with the observed transcriptional upregulation of CEACAM6 and CEACAM5 and with other CEACAMs.	38343	38526
27959387	The observed stimulation is also paralleled by the increase in mRNA levels for a series of oncogenesis-related genes, STEAP4 (83,84), SERPINA3 (84), SAMD9 (85), GDF-15 (86), KRT15 (87), TP53INPI (88), IF16 or G1P3 (89), and HLA-G (90) as well as other members of the HLA family, all of which have in common their breast cancer-related expression and the fact that none has been reported as being upregulated by ethanol.	38527	38946
27959387	Some of these genes (SERPINA3, GDF15, IFI6) are also modulated by estrogen, but only one, GDF15, was previously studied in MCF-7.	38947	39076
27959387	Surprisingly, no reports are available on the relationship of any of these genes with either OCT4 or CEACAM6.	39077	39186
27959387	No evidence of preferential stimulation of stem cell accumulation following ethanol treatment in either MCF-7 monolayers or mammospheres could be found by gene expression analysis, as judged by the lack of meaningful changes in the transcriptional expression of a series of stem cell genes, including OCT4 and Nanog.	39187	39503
27959387	This finding is in agreement with the similarity between the transcriptional signatures of mammospheres and monolayers in the absence of ethanol.	39504	39649
27959387	This is puzzling within the framework of the significant upregulation of Oct4 and Nanog protein expression induced by long-term ethanol.	39650	39786
27959387	OCT4 and NANOG are key stem cell genes in a network of other genes involved in stemness, but which are expressed transcriptionally in this study at only a low level, and not changed by ethanol treatment.	39787	39990
27959387	A possible explanation could involve translational regulation mediated by miRs (see below).	39991	40082
27959387	It is also conceivable that OCT4 and NANOG act as oncogenic factors per se, unrelated to stem cell activation, or speculatively may be due to the failure of stem cells to form mammospheres, but no supporting data exist in these in respect of other than OCT4 overexpression in breast cancer and other tumors.	40083	40390
27959387	The seeming contradiction between Oct4 protein upregulation in the absence of detectable Oct4 mRNA increase suggests a model in which untreated cells exist in a state of translational repression of Oct4 due to some miR or combination of miRs.	40391	40633
27959387	According to this hypothesis, some miRs such as Let-7A-5P (which is reduced in prevalence by ethanol exposure) allows the induction, by its partial absence, of overexpression of the Oct4 protein.	40634	40829
27959387	Other Let-7 family members are also substantially expressed in control cells and reduced by ethanol.	40830	40930
27959387	Let-7A has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in head and neck cancers and in their associated tumor initiating cells, where it is significantly decreased when OCT4 expression was increased (65).	40931	41136
27959387	However, it is not clear that this is only translational repression and NANOG is also affected, so it is possible that Let-7 might not be responsible by itself for the selective upregulation of Oct4 protein, and it works in conjunction with the opposite effects of Lin 28b.	41137	41410
27959387	Another miR, miR-145 functions as a protective miRNA in tumor tissues of lung adenocarcinoma patients and binds to the OCT4 3′-untranslated region (UTR) thus blocking protein expression correlated with anti-oncogenic action (91–93), but we did not detect significant changes in this miR.	41411	41698
27959387	The same uncertainty applies to the putative interaction between the downregulation of miR-149-3p by long-term ethanol, that would be consistent with the observed upregulation of CEACAM6 mRNA and protein, and the counterintuitive upregulation of miR-15A-5p, 16-5p, and 195-5p that could potentially oppose this effect.	41699	42017
27959387	However, these are inferences based purely on sequence analogies in the miRBase 18.0 (94) and without mechanistic proof as yet.	42018	42145
27959387	Therefore, the roles of the changes in miR levels in relation to the upregulation of Oct4, Nanog, and Ceacam6 induced by long-term ethanol in MCF-7 require further study.	42146	42316
27959387	The molecular signature of miRs related to estrogen responsiveness is key to understanding whether ethanol may act via estrogenic pathways on luminal-like breast tumor cells, such as the MCF-7, to induce or stimulate their proliferation, survival, and functional status through the estrogen receptor α.	42317	42619
27959387	Alcohol is assumed to increase sex hormone levels in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women (6) by: a) increased aromatase activity; b) decreased hepatic catabolism of androgens; c) modulation of adrenal steroid production; and d) by increasing the expression or transcriptional activity of ERα.	42620	42920
27959387	Alcohol may also preferentially enhance cellular proliferation and ERα content in ER-positive cell lines (15–18).	42921	43034
27959387	Therefore, it might be expected that long-term ethanol effects on miRs in MCF-7 would mimic those exerted by estrogen or those related to estrogen responsiveness, but no reports are available on ethanol effects on any miR profile except in our recently published study on non-malignant cells (1).	43035	43331
27959387	One of the miRs we found upregulated in MCF-7, miR-424, was also shown to be induced by 17-β-estradiol in at least two (95,96) of the multiple studies conducted in MCF-7.	43332	43502
27959387	In some cases, ethanol induced upregulation is also seen after estrogen treatment, such as in miR-27a and b (96).	43503	43616
27959387	The fact that ethanol affected any particular miR in this study did not necessarily coincide with affects on other miRs that would be expected to change comcomitantly if ethanol action were limited to one specific pathway such as the estrogenic pathway: thus upregulated miRs such as miR-107, miR-424, miR-570, miR-618, and miR-760 (95), miR-21 (28), miR-34b (97), miR-98 (98), miR-19A and miR-24 (96), miR-26a and b (99), miR-17 (100,101), miR-7 (102), or miR-190a (103); or downregulated miRs such as miR-16, miR-143, or miR-203 (104).	43617	44154
27959387	Interestingly, the latter is the opposite of what we observed with ethanol.	44155	44230
27959387	Although there are 4 miRs where both ethanol and estradiol induce the same changes in MCF-7, there are at least 18 miRs known to be affected by estrogen that can target a significant number of transcripts belonging to one or more estrogen-responsive gene clusters, but were not modified by ethanol in this study.	44231	44543
27959387	In turn, 5 of our ethanol responsive changes have not been reported in global miR transcription studies conducted with estrogen or estrogenic compounds in MCF-7.	44544	44705
27959387	The scope of this report does not cover the elucidation of how these miRs may act in terms of oncogenic or tumor suppressor effects.	44706	44838
27959387	However, it is worth mentioning that out of the miRs whose levels have previously been shown to be regulated by estrogen and/or to modulate its receptor, and that were found in our work to be changed by ethanol, only the miR-27a and miR-27b levels were modulated as predicted by their role in estrogen responsiveness.	44839	45156
27959387	It is also known that miR-27a is oncogenic in the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, and indirectly regulates E2-responsiveness in MCF-7 cells through suppression of ZBTB10, thereby enhancing expression of ERα (47,48).	45157	45392
27959387	In turn, miR-27a is upregulated in endometrial adenocarcinoma and precancerous lesions in response to estrogen overexposure.	45393	45517
27959387	However, let-7 behaves similarly in the hyperplastic endometrium (98,105) and most members of this family (b, c and d) are considered to be pro-estrogenic.	45518	45673
27959387	In this study they were uniformly reduced.	45674	45716
27959387	The lack of consistency between the ethanol modulation of miR levels and their relationship with estrogen responsiveness is confirmed by our results with miR-16 (106), miR-200a (47), miR-203 (47), and miR-342 (107), which, as in the case of let-7a, b, and c, are opposite to what could be expected from an estrogen-like effect.	45717	46044
27959387	However, since miRs exert pleiotropic effects, a mere association with estrogen-mediated pathways is not sufficient to conclude that those may not be involved in the observed ethanol effects on MCF-7 cultures.	46045	46254
27959387	It should be emphasized that many of these miRs also affect other processes different from estrogenic effects, as described in a large and growing literature.	46255	46413
27959387	For example, the Let-7 family is highly conserved and is involved in development, stem cell modulation, oncogenesis, and the cardiovascular system among other things (108), while the miR 15/107 group containing miR-15 and miR-16 affects BRCA1 expression (109), and miR-195 and miR-29 have been linked to aortic aneurism (110).	46414	46740
27959387	Regarding the ethanol/estradiol comparison of miR signatures, we note the limitation that our study was long-term, whereas the previous estrogen studies varied in duration, but we propose that estradiol effects do not seem to define more than a small proportion of the changes in the global miR transcriptional signature of MCF-7 induced by ethanol.	46741	47090
27959387	The ethanol induced changes are specific and at least partially different from estrogen-induced changes.	47091	47195
27959387	Thus this study does not provide strong support for the hypothesis that estrogen mediates ethanol effects.	47196	47302
27959387	Further studies are needed, vis-à-vis ethanol and estrogen, and with anti-estrogenic agents, to clarify the estrogenic mediation of long-term ethanol effects on MCF-7.	47303	47470
27959387	A recent review lists a large number of miRs that are involved in cancer-related processes ranging from tumor suppression to various oncogenic features (111).	47471	47629
27959387	We note that several miRs listed in that review show ethanol effects in this study, including miRs 15a, 16, the Let-7 family, 27a, 148a, and 149.	47630	47775
27959387	We should also point out that ethanol does not necessarily promote oncogenesis in every case, for example tumor suppressors miR-15a and miR-16 are upregulated in response to ethanol treatment.	47776	47968
27959387	However, the same two miRs were found to be upregulated in a biomarker test distinguishing sepsis from systemic inflammatory response (112).	47969	48109
27959387	In this study, we found that exposure of MCF-7 cells to ethanol results in detectable changes in the expression of miRs such as miR-29a associated with inflammation (113).	48110	48281
27959387	Interestingly, miR-15a upregulation is found in the serum of humans exposed to particulate air pollution (114).	48282	48393
27959387	In another study, it was found that miR-29a is potentially able to stimulate the conditions for metastasis by binding to Toll-like receptors (115).	48394	48541
27959387	Some miRs that have been proposed for inclusion as circulating cancer markers in the clinical setting show changes in expression levels in response to ethanol.	48542	48701
27959387	This suggests that such markers should be considered carefully with regard to the ethanol intake status of the patient.	48702	48821
27959387	For example, miR-424 has been proposed for inclusion in a group of circulating biomarkers for breast cancer (116), and miR-2861 is upregulated in thyroid carcinoma with lymph node metastases (59) but has been suggested as one element in a circulating miR screen for cervical cancer, where it has been shown to be decreased (117).	48822	49151
27959387	In conclusion, our overall results suggest that prolonged exposure to ethanol may lead to the intensification of a series of novel oncogenic features in breast cancer by mechanisms that are not directly related to acetaldehyde and which do not strongly indicate estrogen mediation.	49152	49433
27959387	These features require further clarification, with the caveat that the in vitro incubations using a breast cancer cell line are not directly extrapolatable to alcohol consumption in women.	49434	49622
27959387	Our results may suggest some kind of stem cell involvement, but one which so far shows contradictory transcriptional and translational aspects.	49623	49766
27959387	However, in conjunction with our findings on the induction of oncogenic features in a normal breast epithelial cell line (1), the current data may constitute the first comparison of global transcriptional signatures elicited by long-term ethanol exposure on normal and cancer breast cells, and the defining of potentially oncogenic features exacerbated by alcohol.	49767	50131
27959387	Moreover, miRs in circulation are now being proposed as a diagnostic tool for both carcinomas and metatatic carcinomas (118).	50132	50257
27959387	Therefore, the observation that ingested ethanol affects miR levels may have clinical significance, particularly with respect to miR values measured in heavy drinkers.	50258	50425
27860244	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease, which is characterized by the hyperplasia of synovial tissues (STs) and progressive destruction of articular cartilage, bone and ligaments 1.	0	189
27860244	Inflammatory factors were essential in the initiation and development of synovial inflammation in RA 2.	190	293
27860244	Moreover, fibroblast‐like synoviocytes (FLSs) in the synovial intimal lining played a central role in RA pathogenesis 3.	294	414
27860244	Stable, activated RA FLSs exhibited tumour‐like characteristics 4, 5 and were critical in the development of pannus through migrating and invading to the cartilage and bone 6, 7, 8.	415	596
27860244	Therefore, modulation of synovial inflammation and the aggressive behaviours of activated FLSs was a novel therapeutic strategy for RA.	597	732
27860244	Arginine methylation is an abundant post‐translational modification that occurs in mammalian cells and is catalysed by proteins of the arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family.	733	909
27860244	PRMT5, a member of PRMT family, is localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of mammalian cells 9, 10.	910	1018
27860244	PRMT5 participates in many cell processes, including transcriptional repression 11, RNA splicing 12, signal transduction 13 and piRNA pathway activation 14.	1019	1175
27860244	Overexpression of PRMT5 has been found in many kinds of tumours, including leukaemia 15, lymphoma 16, lung cancer 17, colorectal cancer 18 and breast cancer 19.	1176	1336
27860244	The overexpression of PRMT5 was associated with tumour cell growth.	1337	1404
27860244	Recent studies also indicated that PRMT5 was a key enzyme in regulating endothelial cell inflammation, cell proliferation as well as differentiation 20.	1405	1557
27860244	However, it was still unclear whether PRMT5 was involved in RA.	1558	1621
27860244	We hypothesized that PRMT5 might regulate the inflammation and invasive behaviours in RA FLSs.	1622	1716
27860244	To investigate the validity of the hypothesis, we first examined the expression of PRMT5 in STs and FLSs.	1717	1822
27860244	We then used a PRMT5 inhibitor and siRNA to study the influence of PRMT5 on the inflammation, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of RA FLSs.	1823	1971
27860244	Finally, we verified the signal pathway involved in this process.	1972	2037
27860244	STs were gained from RA patients or osteoarthritis (OA) patients, who went through synovectomy or joint arthroplasty.	2038	2155
27860244	Briefly, STs were incised into pieces by pieces, then digested with collagenase I (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 3 hrs at 37°C, 5% CO2.	2156	2350
27860244	After centrifugation, the cells were fostered in DMEM/F12 medium that containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml strep at 37°C in a constant humidified incubator of 5% CO2, 21% O2 and 75% N2.	2351	2553
27860244	The cells were trypsinized when the cells reached assemble and transited.	2554	2627
27860244	The cells at passages of 3–7 were used in this study.	2628	2681
27860244	Normal control FLSs were isolated from STs obtained by arthroscopic biopsy from patients that had menisci injuries without history of acute or chronic arthritis, which were kind gifts from Prof. Hanshi Xu in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat‐Sen University.	2682	2946
27860244	The study was sanctified by the Medical Ethical Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, SYSU, China, and executed on the basis of the Declaration of Helsinki.	2947	3109
27860244	STs were placed in 10% formalin overnight, paraffin‐imbed, incised into 5‐μm sections and put to 3‐aminopropyltriethoxysilane‐coated slides.	3110	3250
27860244	Then, the sections were deparaffinized by xylene and ethanol which was rehydrated, and using microwave heating with antigen retrieval.	3251	3385
27860244	Endogenous peroxidase activity was then inhibited by hatching the parts in 1% hydrogen peroxide about 30 min.	3386	3495
27860244	The segment were then fostered with main antibodies against PRMT5 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4°C overnight.	3496	3602
27860244	Then, the samples was washed three times with PBS for 5 min.	3603	3663
27860244	each and hatched with the respective horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐conjugated secondary antibodies, substrates and counterstained with haematoxylin.	3664	3811
27860244	For the transfection of PRMT5 siRNA (Santa Cruz, California, USA), FLSs were fostered in six‐well plates; 100 nM siRNA and 10 mg/ml lipofectin in serum‐free medium as a transfection mixture was added to medium‐aspirated cells for 6 hrs.	3812	4048
27860244	Then, the cells before experiments were incubated with total including 10% FBS DMEM/F12 for 48 hrs.	4049	4148
27860244	Chemotaxis analysis of FLSs was preformed through the transwell (Corning, New York, NY, USA) migration assay.	4149	4258
27860244	Filled with DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS, the bottom chambers were used as a chemical enticement.	4259	4362
27860244	The top chambers were cultured in 200 μl DMEM/F12 medium (without FBS) and FLSs with PRMT5‐specific inhibitor EPZ015666 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, USA) or FLSs transfected with PRMT5 siRNA for 48 hrs.	4363	4565
27860244	After 12 hrs, through a cotton swab, the cells which had not migrated were removed from the filter top.	4566	4669
27860244	The migrated cells, on the bottom of the membrane, were immersed in methanol and dyed with 0.1% Crystal Violet.	4670	4781
27860244	Through the ZEISS digital microscope dealing with images, we counted the stained cells for each analysis via the mean number of cells per five random areas.	4782	4938
27860244	The in vitro invasion test was performed by inserting a Matrigel basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK).	4939	5058
27860244	Under a microscope, numbers of invaded cells were randomly selected and counted in 10 high‐power fields.	5059	5163
27860244	These experiments were performed three times.	5164	5209
27860244	Wounding migration assays were performed as described previously 21.	5210	5278
27860244	Briefly, RA FLSs were plated to confluence on 35‐mm culture dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml, where 90% confluence allowed one parallel wound.	5279	5428
27860244	The following day, wounds were created in a cell monolayer using 1‐ml sterile micropipette tips.	5429	5525
27860244	Then starving media were used to wash detached cells, and RA FLSs were treated with or without 10% FBS.	5526	5629
27860244	After 24 hrs of incubation, migration was quantified with Image J software by counting the cells that moved beyond a reference line.	5630	5762
27860244	5‐Ethynyl‐2′‐deoxyuridine (EdU) is a thymidine analogue; when cells are dividing, it is incorporated into replicating DNA and then applied to sign proliferating cells.	5763	5930
27860244	RA FLSs were trypsinized, seeded into 96‐well plates and then calculated with a density of 1 × 104 cells/well.	5931	6041
27860244	Then, RA FLSs were grown to 80% confluence and were pre‐treated with or without EPZ015666 or transfected with siRNA for 48 hrs and then treated with TNF‐α or IL‐β for 24 hrs.	6042	6216
27860244	The cell multiplication was detected through a Cell‐Light EdU DNA Cell Proliferation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).	6217	6333
27860244	Each test was replicated three times according to the manufacturer's recommendation.	6334	6418
27860244	RA FLSs or OA FLSs were seeded on sterile cover glass in 35‐mm dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml.	6419	6522
27860244	When became approximately 60% confluent, the FLSs were stimulated with IL‐1β or TNF‐α for 24 hrs.	6523	6620
27860244	Then, they were disposed with paraformaldehyde and infiltrated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X‐100.	6621	6722
27860244	The cells were hatched with anti‐PRMT5 antibody all night to measure PRMT5.	6723	6798
27860244	The cells were then incubated with DAPI, and the coverslips were put on the glass slides with antifade equipment media and then examined by a confocal fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM710, Wetzlar, Germany).	6799	7007
27860244	After the designated treatments with EPZ015666 or transfected with siRNA for 48 hrs and then treated with TNF‐α or IL‐1β for 12 hrs, total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol (Sigma‐Aldrich) and were reverse‐transcribed to cDNA using miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (TaKaRa Biomedical Technology, Kusatsu, Japan ).	7008	7322
27860244	The mRNA expression of PRMT5, IL‐6 and IL‐8 was analysed by real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) which was performed on cDNA using QuantiTect SYBR Green RT‐PCR Kit on StepOnePlusTM Instantaneous analyse PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).	7323	7599
27860244	The expression of relative mRNA was more normalized to the GAPDH.	7600	7665
27860244	The used RT‐PCR primers were listed in Table S1.	7666	7714
27860244	For each Western blot experiment, 2 × 105 cells were seeded.	7715	7775
27860244	When subconfluence (~80%) was reached, RA FLSs were pre‐processed with EPZ015666 for 24 hrs or transfected with siRNA for 48 hrs.	7776	7905
27860244	Then, RA FLSs were stimulated with or without TNF‐α for 10 min.	7906	7969
27860244	Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (CST) in an ice bath for 15 min., and then, the lysates were centrifuged at 14000 g for 15 min.	7970	8105
27860244	at 4°C.	8106	8113
27860244	Supernatants were incubated with 2× laemmli sample buffer (Sigma‐Aldrich) for 5 min.	8114	8198
27860244	at 100°C.	8199	8208
27860244	The samples with same amounts were then separated with SDS‐PAGE gel and shifted to NC membranes and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies: antiphosphor‐AKT (Cell signal transduction), anti‐AKT (Cell signal transduction), anti‐NF‐κB p65 (Cell signalling), antiphosphor‐IKBα (Cell signal transduction), anti‐IKBα (Cell signal transduction) and antiphosphor‐IKK (Cell signal transduction).	8209	8601
27860244	After the designated treatments with EPZ015666 or transfected with siRNA for 48 hrs and then disposed with TNF‐α for 12 hrs, RA FLSs' (1 × 105 cells/ml, 80% cell confluence) culture supernatants were collected for the measurement of IL‐6 and IL‐8 by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), through employing a commercial tool on the basis of the guidance of the manufacturer (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA).	8602	9023
27860244	RA FLSs were pre‐processed with EPZ015666 at different concentrations (0.1, 1 and 5 μM) for 48 hrs.	9024	9123
27860244	The supernatants were removed.	9124	9154
27860244	The adherent cells were cultured with 3‐(4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium salt solution (1 mg/ml in PBS) at 37°C for 30 min.	9155	9296
27860244	Dark blue formazan was melted in acidified isopropanol, and formazan quantification was performed at a trial wavelength of 570 nm.	9297	9427
27860244	The wavelength of 620 nm was used as a reference.	9428	9477
27860244	The software of SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was utilized.	9478	9547
27860244	Data were present as means ± standard deviation of the mean (S.E.M.).	9548	9617
27860244	The differences between each group were detected by t‐test or anova.	9618	9686
27860244	P values less than 0.05 were significant.	9687	9728
27860244	We first investigated the expression of PRMT5 in STs.	9729	9782
27860244	Positive stained cells of anti‐PRMT5 antibody were more prominent in STs from RA when compared with OA patients (Fig.	9783	9900
27860244	1A).	9901	9905
27860244	We next examined the expression of PRMT5 in FLSs by IF staining.	9906	9970
27860244	As a result, RA FLSs exhibited a markedly enhanced staining for PRMT5 and localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.	9971	10089
27860244	Whereas, expression of PRMT5 protein was much less prominent in normal samples and in OA FLSs (Fig.	10090	10189
27860244	1B).	10190	10194
27860244	The constitutive expression of PRMT5 in FLSs was further confirmed by Western blotting.	10195	10282
27860244	A higher level of PRMT5 expression was detected in RA FLSs than that in OA FLSs or in FLSs from normal controls (Fig.	10283	10400
27860244	1C).	10401	10405
27860244	RA FLSs were stimulated with TNF‐α or IL‐1β.	10406	10450
27860244	As shown in Figures 2A and B, PCR and Western blotting indicated that TNF‐α and IL‐1β significantly enhanced the PRMT5 mRNA expression and the protein level of PRMT5, respectively.	10451	10631
27860244	The overexpression of PRMT5 in RA FLSs stimulated by proinflammatory mediators was also confirmed by IF staining (Fig.	10632	10750
27860244	2C).	10751	10755
27860244	To investigate the role of PRMT5 on inflammatory response in RA FLSs, a specific PRMT5 inhibitor (EPZ015666) or transfected with PRMT5 siRNA were used.	10756	10907
27860244	As shown in Figure 3A, TNF‐α‐induced mRNA expression and secretions of IL‐6 and IL‐8 were reduced by treatment with different concentrations of EPZ015666 (0.1~5 μM).	10908	11073
27860244	Transfection with PRMT5 siRNA also decreased TNF‐α‐induced mRNA and secretions of IL‐6 as well as IL‐8 (Fig.	11074	11182
27860244	3B).	11183	11187
27860244	Moreover, IL‐1β‐induced mRNA expression of IL‐6 and IL‐8 was reduced by treatment with different concentrations of EPZ015666 or transfection with PRMT5 siRNA (Fig.	11188	11351
27860244	S1A).	11352	11357
27860244	Recent studies indicated that inhibition of PRMT5 suppressed proliferation in tumour cell lines.	11358	11454
27860244	Therefore, we explore whether PRMT5 regulates proliferation of RA FLSs, which was measured by EdU incorporation.	11455	11567
27860244	We showed that pre‐treatment with EPZ015666 and PRMT5 siRNA reduced TNF‐α‐induced proliferation of RA FLSs (Fig.	11568	11680
27860244	3C).	11681	11685
27860244	Furthermore, pre‐treatment with EPZ015666 and PRMT5 siRNA also reduced IL‐1β‐induced proliferation of RA FLSs (Fig.	11686	11801
27860244	S1B).	11802	11807
27860244	MTT test was used to evaluate the toxic effect of EPZ015666 on RA FLS viability.	11808	11888
27860244	Up to 5 μM, EPZ015666 did not reduce the viability of RA FLSs, which indicated that the inhibitory effects of EPZ015666 were not as a result of drug cytotoxicity (data not shown).	11889	12068
27860244	Then, we explored the role of PRMT5 in the invasion and migration of RA FLSs using a specific PRMT5 inhibitor (EPZ015666) or PRMT5 siRNA transfection.	12069	12219
27860244	Treatment with EPZ015666 and PRMT5 siRNA markedly inhibited FBS‐induced migration of RA FLSs (Fig.	12220	12318
27860244	4A).	12319	12323
27860244	Wound closing was significantly slowed in RA FLSs pre‐treated with EPZ015666 and transferred with PRMT5 siRNA (Fig.	12324	12439
27860244	4B).	12440	12444
27860244	We also observed that treatment with EPZ015666 and PRMT5 siRNA suppressed invasion of RA FLSs (Fig.	12445	12544
27860244	4C).	12545	12549
27860244	The above results revealed that PRMT5 played a crucial role in regulating RA FLSs migration and invasion.	12550	12655
27860244	Under proinflammatory stimulation, activation of NF‐κB pathway required the activation of IκB kinase (IKK).	12656	12763
27860244	Activated IKK promoted the phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor of NF‐κB (IκB), and phosphorylation of p65.	12764	12883
27860244	We further explore the association between PRMT5 and NF‐κB.	12884	12943
27860244	As shown in Figure 5A, a specific inhibitor of PRMT5 decreased phosphorylated IKK (pIKK), as well as phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα in TNF‐α‐stimulated RA FLSs.	12944	13113
27860244	We then observed EPZ015666 decreased p65 nuclear accumulation (Fig.	13114	13181
27860244	5B).	13182	13186
27860244	Furthermore, we observed that transfection with PRMT5 siRNA suppressed the TNF‐α‐induced pIKK and phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig.	13187	13314
27860244	5C).	13315	13319
27860244	These data suggested that inhibition of PRMT5 suppressed NF‐κB activation through IKK signalling.	13320	13417
27860244	Because AKT was an important factor in regulating inflammation and migration of RA FLSs, we further investigated the relationship between PRMT5 and AKT.	13418	13570
27860244	It was observed that EPZ015666 treatment inhibited phosphorylation of AKT in TNF‐α‐treated RA FLSs (Fig.	13571	13675
27860244	6A).	13676	13680
27860244	We also observed the similar results from RA FLSs transfected with PRMT5 siRNA (Fig.	13681	13765
27860244	6B).	13766	13770
27860244	These data suggested that AKT might be involved in PRMT5‐mediated inflammation and migration of RA FLSs.	13771	13875
27860244	Our results demonstrated that RA FLSs constitutively express PRMT5, which was up‐regulated by stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines.	13876	14013
27860244	Moreover, inhibition of PRMT5 suppressed the production of IL‐6 and IL‐8 and prevented cell proliferation, migration and invasion by attenuating the activation of NF‐κB and AKT in RA FLSs.	14014	14202
27860244	Taken together, the data suggested a crucial role of PRMT5 in regulating inflammation and the maintenance of an activated FLSs phenotype in patients with RA.	14203	14360
27860244	Inhibition of PRMT5 might be a hopeful target for the therapy of RA.	14361	14429
27860244	Pro‐inflammatory cytokines initiated synovial inflammation in RA.	14430	14495
27860244	However, the mechanisms that modulated the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in RA remained to be identified.	14496	14612
27860244	Here, we demonstrated that PRMT5 inhibition decreased TNF‐α‐induced expression of IL‐6 and IL‐8 in RA FLSs.	14613	14720
27860244	Recent studies suggested that PRMT5‐mediated post‐translational modifications might be associated with inflammatory.	14721	14837
27860244	PRMT5 methylated a key transcriptional factor HOXA9 of endothelial cell inflammatory responses, which was critical in up‐regulation of endothelial–leucocyte adhesion molecules 22, 23.	14838	15021
27860244	PRMT5‐medicated arginine methyltransferase was indicated as an important step for CXCL10 transcription in TNF‐α‐activated human endothelial cells inflammation.	15022	15181
27860244	Our data indicated one of the mechanisms of PRMT5 in the maintenance of the activated phenotype of RA FLSs via regulation the inflammatory response.	15182	15330
27860244	The invasive behaviours of RA FLSs to the cartilage and bone were essential steps in the aggravation of RA 6, 24, 25.	15331	15448
27860244	PRMT5 was the major enzyme responsible for arginine dimethylation, which was associated with tumour cell growth in different types of cancer 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.	15449	15609
27860244	In this study, we found that inhibition of PRMT5 strongly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion.	15610	15719
27860244	Consistent with our findings, Zhang et al. and Guo et al. 26, 27 reported that treatment with a PRMT5 inhibitor decreased migratory activity in several tumour cell lines.	15720	15890
27860244	As abnormal migration and invasion of RA FLSs were critical in destruction of joints, our results provided new evidence on the association between PRMT5 and the aggressive nature of RA FLSs.	15891	16081
27860244	We observed that PRMT5 inhibition suppressed TNF‐α‐induced phosphorylation of IKKβ and IκBα, as well as translocation of nuclear NF‐κB.	16082	16217
27860244	These data indicated that PRMT5 regulated the NF‐κB pathway by interfering in early cytoplasmic IKK signalling.	16218	16329
27860244	Similar findings were also indicated in other studies.	16330	16384
27860244	According to Wei et al. 28 , PRMT5 methylated Arg‐30 (R30) residues of the p65 subunit, and consequently regulated NF‐κB‐dependent gene expression, such as IL‐1α and TNF receptor‐associated factor 1.	16385	16584
27860244	Additionally, it has also been reported that R35 as well as R30 at p65, which was methylated by PRMT5, participated in transcription of TNF‐α‐induced pro‐inflammatory genes in endothelial cells 22.	16585	16782
27860244	Simulated by TNF‐α, phosphoinositide AKT was crucial in regulating cell proliferation and inflammation in RA 29.	16783	16895
27860244	We found that inhibition of PRMT5 leaded to decreased expression of p‐AKT, without affecting total AKT.	16896	16999
27860244	Our results were also supported by studies from tumour cells.	17000	17061
27860244	Wei et al. 30 demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K/AKT activity could block PRMT5‐induced cell proliferation in lung cancer cell lines, including A549 and H1299.	17062	17223
27860244	Our finding identified a new pathway linking PRMT5 to AKT activation.	17224	17293
27860244	In conclusion, we showed that PRMT5 played an important role in inflammatory response, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of RA FLSs through NF‐κB and AKT pathway.	17294	17465
27860244	Thus, inhibition of PRMT5 might be a potential therapeutic agent to attenuate pathological progression in rheumatoid arthritis.	17466	17593
27860244	The authors confirm that there are no conflict of interests.	17594	17654
27491646	Glioma is aggressive and common primary tumour in central nervous system (CNS) 1.	0	81
27491646	Their main characteristics are rapid proliferation and extensive migration.	82	157
27491646	Surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are effective therapies for gliomas.	158	230
27491646	Despite these treatments, the median survival time of glioblastoma patients is still about 15 months 2, 3.	231	337
27491646	The effectiveness of glioma therapy was influenced by many factors including rapid tumour growth and highly infiltrative nature of glioma cells 4, 5, 6.	338	490
27491646	Therefore, suppressing proliferation and inhibiting glioma cells migration would be a promising therapeutic strategy.	491	608
27491646	Mangosteen, Garcinia mangostana L., a common Southeast Asia tropical fruit, has been consumed as food and medicine for centuries 7.	609	740
27491646	Xanthones are characterised by one or more hydroxy and prenyl groups in their tricyclic ring system.	741	841
27491646	Cumulative evidence indicates that xanthones regulate diverse biologic processes such as antioxidation 8, anti‐tumour 9, anti‐inflammation 10, anti‐allergy 11, anti‐bacteria, anti‐fungi and anti‐virus 12.	842	1046
27491646	Recently, there has been reported that tumours could be suppressed by several kinds of xanthones isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen including gartanin 13, 14, α‐mangostin 15, 16 and γ‐mangostin 17, 18, and were recognised as potential anti‐cancer drugs.	1047	1306
27491646	α‐Mangostin and γ‐mangostin have been extensively studied in a variety of neoplasm.	1307	1390
27491646	By now, there was no report on the effects of gartanin on glioma development yet.	1391	1472
27491646	In this research, we found that gartanin, at lower micromole, potently inhibited the migration and viability abilities in T98G cells.	1473	1606
27491646	Further studies showed that the anti‐tumour effects of gartanin might involve cell cycle arrest in G1, increased protein expression level of p27Kip1, suppressed protein expression level of cyclin D1 and inhibited secretion and activity of MMP‐2/‐9.	1607	1855
27491646	Moreover, the anti‐viability effect of gartanin was also associated with autophagy.	1856	1939
27491646	Further studies indicated that PI3K/Akt/mTOR was associated with gartanin‐induced autophagy and mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling pathways were involved in the suppressed expression level and activity of MMP‐2/‐9.	1940	2171
27491646	In summary, results indicate that gartanin might be a promising anti‐tumour drug against gliomas.	2172	2269

27491646	Apoptotic cells were characterised by morphological alternation as condensed nuclei and cell shrinkage.	4831	4934
27491646	The cell cycle phase distribution was determined via flow cytometry analysis of DNA content of cells with a cell cycle assay kit (Nanjing, China) according to the instructions.	4935	5111
27491646	In brief, T98G was planted in six‐well plates and treated with gartanin at various concentrations for the indicated time.	5112	5233
27491646	After treatment, cells were trypsinised and fixed with 65% ethanol for 12 hrs.	5234	5312
27491646	Cells were then incubated with DNA‐binding dye propidium iodide (PI, 50 μg/ml) and RNase (1.0 mg/ml) for another 1 hr in the incubator.	5313	5448
27491646	Finally, a flow cytometry (Beckman, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to analyse the red fluorescence, and a peak fluorescence gate was used to discriminate aggregates.	5449	5613
27491646	T98G cells were planted in six‐well plates and cultured in incubator.	5614	5683
27491646	When the cells reached confluence, would healing assay was performed.	5684	5753
27491646	In brief, a 200‐μl pipette tip was used to manually scrape the cell monolayer.	5754	5832
27491646	The floating cells were washed away with PBS.	5833	5878
27491646	Cells were then maintained in DMEM.	5879	5914
27491646	Cell migration was observed at three indicated time points (0, 12 and 24 hrs) in three different microscopic fields for each concentration of gartanin.	5915	6066
27491646	Images were acquired with a phase‐contrast microscope (IX71, Chongqing, China) and were processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.	6067	6191
27491646	The wound width at time 0 minus the wound width at different time points is the distance migrated by the cells.	6192	6303
27491646	The values were expressed as a migration percentage, and setting the 0 hr group as 0%.	6304	6390
27491646	XCELLigence real‐time cell analysis (RTCA) DP system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used to perform cell migration experiments.	6391	6518
27491646	Real‐time cell analysis was allowed by the xCELLigence system on the RTCA DP Instrument equipped with a CIM‐Plate 16.	6519	6636
27491646	In brief, T98G cells were trypsinised and resuspended in DMEM.	6637	6699
27491646	Each upper chamber was planted with 3 × 104 cells to allow cells attachment, the CIM‐Plate was maintained in incubator for another 30 min.	6700	6838

27491646	In brief, cells were planted in six‐well plates and treated with gartanin at various concentrations for 24 hrs.	7102	7213
27491646	Ten microlitre supernatant of each well was collected and was mixed with 10 μl sample buffer.	7214	7307
27491646	An equal volume of sample (20 μl) was then loaded in each lane of 8% SDS‐PAGE containing gelatin as a substrate.	7308	7420
27491646	Using pre‐cooled electrophoresis running buffer, electrophoresis was carried out at 20 mA for 60 min.	7421	7522
27491646	After washing with 2% Triton X‐100, gels were dipped into the developing buffer containing 0.02% NaN3, 50 mM Tris and 10 mM CaCl2 for 42 hrs at 37°C.	7523	7672

27491646	Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), version 1.46r, was used to perform quantitative analysis.	7945	8045
27491646	Plasmid, GFP‐LC3, was kindly provided by Professor Rongbiao Pi (Sun Yat‐Sen University).	8046	8134
27491646	T98G cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were planted on a glass coverslip in the six‐well plates and cultured in incubator.	8135	8250
27491646	After reaching 60% confluence, Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) was used to perform transient transfection in accordance with the instructions.	8251	8441
27491646	After 8 hrs, the supernatant was removed and complete medium was added.	8442	8513
27491646	After the sample was incubated for 1 day, cells were treated with gartanin at various concentrations for another 7 hrs after which it was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for half an hour at 37°C.	8514	8717
27491646	Confocal laser microscopy (Zeiss LSM710, Jena, Germany) was used to analyse the cells.	8718	8804
27491646	After treatment, cells were collected, washed and then lysed in 100 μl lysis buffer (10 mM NaF, protease inhibitor cocktail, 20 mM Tris‐HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM Na3VO4 and 1% Triton X‐100, pH 7.5).	8805	9011
27491646	BCA assay kit (Thermofisher Pierce, Rockford, AL, USA) was used to determine the protein concentration.	9012	9115
27491646	An equal amount of protein (20 μg) was loaded into lanes.	9116	9173
27491646	After separated by electrophoresis, proteins were electrically transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).	9174	9300
27491646	After the membrane blockage, specific antibodies were used to immunodetect the target proteins.	9301	9396
27491646	After incubated with corresponding secondary antibody, target proteins were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique.	9397	9527
27491646	The experimental data were presented as mean ± S.D.	9528	9579
27491646	Differences among groups were analysed by one‐way analysis of variance (anova).	9580	9659
27491646	Following anova analyses, the Tukey's test was used.	9660	9712
27491646	Differences between two groups were analysed by unpaired Student's t‐test.	9713	9787
27491646	Experiments described in this study were repeated at least three times.	9788	9859
27491646	P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.	9860	9916
27491646	In our preliminary experiments, we tested the anti‐viability effects of seven xanthones isolated from the shells of Garcinia mangostana L. (Fig.	9917	10061
27491646	1A) and found that the potency of gartanin was by far the greatest in T98G cells (Fig.	10062	10148
27491646	1B).	10149	10153
27491646	Thus, all subsequent experiments were focused on gartanin.	10154	10212
27491646	As shown in Fig.	10213	10229
27491646	1C, three malignant glioma cell lines including T98G, U87 and U251 were all sensitive to the anti‐viability effect of gartanin, and T98G was the most sensitive one.	10230	10394
27491646	So, we did the subsequent experiments in T98G cells to uncover the characters of gartanin's anti‐cancer activity as well as the underlying mechanisms.	10395	10545
27491646	Active mitochondria within cells are required in the process of conversing MTT to a blue formazan.	10546	10644
27491646	Thus, cellular activity could be measured by MTT scores.	10645	10701
27491646	Figure 2A and B indicated that gartanin suppressed the cell viability of T98G cells in a dose‐ and time‐dependent manner.	10702	10823
27491646	A 46.5% inhibition rate (P < 0.001, n = 3) was observed in cells treated with gartanin (10 μM) for 24 hrs.	10824	10930
27491646	The IC50 of gartanin on the growth of T98G was 10.8 μM.	10931	10986
27491646	However, the IC50 on that of normal mouse neuron HT22 cells was 54.2 μM (Fig.	10987	11064
27491646	2E).	11065	11069
27491646	Either cell death or reduced viability could result in the reduction of MTT score.	11070	11152
27491646	To determine whether gartanin caused necrosis or apoptosis, LDH assay and DAPI staining were used.	11153	11251
27491646	No significant difference was observed in the number of apoptotic bodies stained with DAPI between gartanin‐treated group and control group (Fig.	11252	11397
27491646	2D).	11398	11402
27491646	No obvious difference was observed in LDH release between gartanin‐treated group and control group (Fig.	11403	11507
27491646	2C).	11508	11512
27491646	Therefore, reduction in MTT score was not resulted from cytotoxicity.	11513	11582
27491646	Thus, significantly reduced MTT score in gartanin‐treated group most likely resulted from decreased viability.	11583	11693
27491646	Consistently, colony formation assay showed that, compared with control group, cells treated with gartanin (10 μM) formed significantly smaller and fewer colonies (Fig.	11694	11862
27491646	2F and G; ***P < 0.001).	11863	11887
27491646	To preliminarily reveal the mechanism of viability suppression in gartanin‐treated group, flow cytometry was used to determine cell cycle distribution in T98G cells.	11888	12053
27491646	Results showed that gartanin led to G1 phase accumulation in a dose‐dependent manner to reach 47.87% and 71.89% of gartanin at 3 and 10 μM, respectively, while 45.22% was observed in control group.	12054	12251
27491646	Concomitantly, gartanin decreased the cells in S fraction from 36.57% of control group to 10.17% of gartanin (10 μM) group (P < 0.001).	12252	12387
27491646	Moreover, the change in the G2/M phase did not reach statistical significance (Fig.	12388	12471
27491646	3A and B).	12472	12482
27491646	These results indicate that gartanin caused cell viability suppression in T98G cells possibly because of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.	12483	12612
27491646	To explore the molecular basis of the cell cycle arrest in gartanin‐treated group, Western blot was used to investigate the expression of some cell cycle regulatory proteins.	12613	12787
27491646	As the checkpoint of G1/S phase, the expression of cyclin D1 was investigated.	12788	12866
27491646	Figure 3C and D showed that the protein expression level of cyclin D1 was significantly reduced in gartanin‐treated group in a time‐ and concentration‐dependent manner.	12867	13035
27491646	Additionally, as an important negative regulatory factor of cell cycle, the expression level of cyclin‐dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p27Kip1, was investigated.	13036	13199
27491646	Figure 3E and F indicated that the protein expression of p27Kip1 was significantly increased in gartanin‐treated group in a time‐ and concentration‐dependent manner.	13200	13365
27491646	Data indicated that inactivation of cyclin D1 accompanied by activation of p27Kip1 attributed to arrest cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, further resulted in viability suppression in gartanin‐treated group.	13366	13581
27491646	Malignant gliomas are not only characterised by infinite proliferation ability but also by highly migration ability.	13582	13698
27491646	Wound healing assay was performed to determine the possible effects of gartanin on migration.	13699	13792
27491646	Figure 4A showed that the scratched area was completely re‐colonised after 24 hrs in the control group.	13793	13896
27491646	However, this process was significantly impaired in a dose‐dependent manner in gartanin‐treated group.	13897	13999
27491646	As a matter of fact, cells treated with 10 μM gartanin rarely invaded the scratched area.	14000	14089
27491646	Moreover, there was statistically significant difference in the migration distance between treated group and the control group 12 hrs after scratch (Fig.	14090	14243
27491646	4A).	14244	14248
27491646	Quantitative analysis of wound closure clearly showed that 10 μM gartanin group closed 10.1% and 15.2% of the wound after 12 and 24 hrs respectively.	14249	14398
27491646	Conversely, the control group closed 63.2% and 96.3% of the wound after 12 and 24 hrs respectively (Fig.	14399	14503
27491646	4B).	14504	14508
27491646	Results indicated that migration of T98G malignant glioma cells could be significantly suppressed by gartanin.	14509	14619
27491646	To eliminate interference factors including invasion and proliferation, RTCA assay was performed.	14620	14717
27491646	The migration of T98G cells from the upper chambers to the lower chamber was monitored by the electrodes.	14718	14823
27491646	Data indicated that T98G cells treated with 10 μM gartanin migrated significantly slower when compared with the controls (Fig.	14824	14950
27491646	4C).	14951	14955
27491646	To explore the molecular basis of anti‐migration in gartanin‐treated group, the activities of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 were determined by gelatin zymography assay.	14956	15110
27491646	Figure 4D indicated that the activities of MMP‐9 and MMP‐2 were significantly suppressed by gartanin.	15111	15212
27491646	As shown in Figure 4E, quantitative analysis suggested that MMP‐2 activity reduced by 27.5% and 71.5% and MMP‐9 activity reduced by 22.5% and 75.0% when cells were treated with 3 μM or 10 μM gartanin respectively.	15213	15426
27491646	To gain insight into the signalling pathway involving the modulation of MMP‐9 and MMP‐2, we assessed the effects of gartanin on MAPK signalling pathway.	15427	15579
27491646	Specifically, the activation of several different downstream MAPK including p‐ERK1/2 (thr202/tyr204), p‐JNK (thr183/tyr188) and p‐p38 (thr180/tyr182) were assessed.	15580	15744
27491646	Figure 5 showed that gartanin (10 μM) time dependently suppressed the expression level of p‐p38 and p‐ERK.	15745	15851
27491646	And the expression level of total ERK did not change.	15852	15905
27491646	Moreover, no changes in the phosphorylated forms of JNK were observed.	15906	15976
27491646	To determine whether autophagy was induced in glioma cells treated with gartanin, the protein expression levels of p62, LC3‐II and Beclin 1, which are important regulatory factors of autophagy, were detected by Western blot.	15977	16201
27491646	Figure 6A and B showed that gartanin significantly increased the expression levels of Beclin 1 and LC3‐II, while significantly suppressed the expression level of p62 in a time‐dependent manner.	16202	16395
27491646	Moreover, punctate structure, representing autophagosomes, could visualise the formation of LC3‐II.	16396	16495
27491646	Thus, after transiently transfected with GFP‐LC3, cells were treated with gartanin at various concentrations for 8 hrs.	16496	16615
27491646	Analysis was performed by confocal microscopy (Fig.	16616	16667
27491646	6C).	16668	16672
27491646	Figure 6D showed that, compared with the control group (2.7%) and gartanin (3 μM) group (3.2%), the number of GFP‐LC3‐positive puncta per cell in gartanin (10 μM)‐treated group (16.5%) was significantly higher.	16673	16883
27491646	To gain insight into the signalling pathway involving the regulation of autophagy in T98G malignant glioma cells, we assessed the effects of gartanin on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway which was involved in inducing autophagy.	16884	17111
27491646	Specifically, we detected three key proteins, p‐mTOR (ser2448), p‐PI3K (tyr458) and p‐Akt (ser473).	17112	17211
27491646	As shown in Figure 7, gartanin (10 μM) time dependently suppressed the expression levels of p‐PI3K, p‐Akt, p‐mTOR and LC3‐II, while no changes were found in the content of total Akt.	17212	17394
27491646	We tested the cell viability with or without autophagy inhibitors, chloroquine (CQ) or 3‐MA, to assess the effects of autophagy on the anti‐viability of gartanin.	17395	17557
27491646	In brief, after pre‐treated with CQ (8 μM) or 3‐MA (2 mM), cells were treated with 10 μM gartanin.	17558	17656
27491646	Western blot was used to investigate the expression level of LC3‐I/II, and MTT assay was used to investigate the cell viability.	17657	17785
27491646	Figure 8B and C showed that expression level of LC3‐II was decreased by 3‐MA, while increased by CQ.	17786	17886
27491646	Figure 8A showed that the cell viability of T98G was increased from 54% to 75.8% and 77%, respectively, by pre‐treatment with 3‐MA or CQ.	17887	18024
27491646	Further study showed that cells in G0/G1 phase decreased from 66.65% of 10 μM gartanin group to 48.34% of 3‐MA+10 μM gartanin group (P < 0.001), and cells in S phase increased from 10.19% of 10 μM gartanin group to 32.58% of 3‐MA+10 μM gartanin group (P < 0.001), although the change in the G2/M phase did not reach statistical significance (Fig.	18025	18371
27491646	9A and B).	18372	18382
27491646	Regulatory proteins of G1 phase including cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 were investigated.	18383	18465
27491646	Figure 9C and D showed that the decrease in cyclin D1 and increase in p27Kip1 were abolished by pre‐treatment with 3‐MA.	18466	18586
27491646	However, the anti‐migration effect of gartanin could not be abrogated by autophagic inhibitor, 3‐MA.	18587	18687
27491646	Figure 9E and F showed that there was no significant restore of cell migration by pre‐treatment with 3‐MA.	18688	18794
27491646	We tested the cell viability with or without GSK‐3β inhibitor, LiCl, to assess the effects of GSK‐3β signalling pathway on the anti‐viability of gartanin.	18795	18949
27491646	In brief, after pre‐treated with LiCl (0.5 mM), cells were treated with 10 μM gartanin.	18950	19037
27491646	Western blot was used to investigate the expression level of GSK‐3β, and MTT assay was used to investigate the cell viability.	19038	19164
27491646	Figure 10A and B showed that gartanin suppressed the expression levels of p‐GSK‐3β in a time‐dependent manner.	19165	19275
27491646	Figure 10C showed that there was no significant restore of cell viability by pre‐treatment with LiCl.	19276	19377
27491646	Malignant gliomas are characterised by local migration and aggressive proliferation 19.	19378	19465
27491646	Cell migration takes an important role in tumour invasiveness, metastasis and spreading.	19466	19554
27491646	The infinite proliferative activity and infiltration nature of tumour cells are important factors in preventing the intact tumour resection, and thus resulting in tumour recurrence and therapeutic failure 20.	19555	19763
27491646	In this study, results showed that gartanin could potently suppress migration and viability of T98G glioma cells (Fig.	19764	19882
27491646	1).	11884	11887
27491646	It was worth to note that gartanin, at such concentrations, did not cause significant cytotoxicity in mouse normal neurons HT22 cells (Fig.	19887	20026
27491646	2E), indicating that gartanin might be a tumour‐specific agent.	20027	20090
27491646	Besides, gartanin also has mighty neuroprotective effect against glutamate‐induced cell death in HT22 cells (data not shown and will be reported in another paper of our laboratory).	20091	20272
27491646	A fundamental reason for aberrant proliferation of tumour cells is dysregulation of cell cycle progression 21.	20273	20383
27491646	In process of cell cycle, the first critical restriction point is the G1/S phase checkpoint.	20384	20476
27491646	Cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclins, CDKs and cyclin CDK inhibitors, play a key role in the G1/S transition 22.	20477	20595
27491646	In particular, the cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 are essential for the regulation of cells to enter S phase.	20596	20696
27491646	Previous studies showed that xanthones could induce G1 phase arrest in prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and hepatoma 23, 24, 25, 26.	20697	20840
27491646	Consistently, this study showed that gartanin‐induced T98G cell G1 phase arrest accompanied by S phase proportion decreased (Fig.	20841	20970
27491646	3A and B).	12472	12482
27491646	We also found that gartanin increased the expression level of p27Kip1, while decreased the expression level of cyclin D1 (Fig.	20982	21108
27491646	3C–F).	21109	21115
27491646	Thus, anti‐viability effect of gartanin could be preliminary explained by cell cycle arrest because of the down‐regulation of positive cell cycle regulator and up‐regulation of negative cell cycle regulator.	21116	21323
27491646	In addition, there has been reported that gambogenic acid, a polyprenylated xanthone, induced degradation of cyclin D1 via triggering dephosphorylation of GSK‐3β which is required for cyclin D1 turnover 23, 27.	21324	21534
27491646	We have also found that gartanin suppressed the expression levels of p‐GSK‐3β.	21535	21613
27491646	However, inactivation of GSK‐3β by LiCl cannot abrogate the anti‐viability effect of gartanin (Fig.	21614	21713
27491646	10).	21714	21718
27491646	Therefore, the anti‐viability effect of gartanin might be irrelevant to GSK‐3β signalling pathway.	21719	21817
27491646	Besides GSK‐3β signalling pathway, proliferation of cancer is closely related to autophagy 28, 29.	21818	21916
27491646	Autophagy, degrading cellular macromolecules or organelles, is an evolutionarily highly conserved catabolic pathway 30.	21917	22036
27491646	The capacity of autophagy to maintain cellular metabolism improves the survival of cells.	22037	22126
27491646	Paradoxically, autophagy has also been implicated in cell death called autophagic or type II programmed cell death 30.	22127	22245
27491646	Previous studies have showed that xanthones, including α‐mangostin, gambogenic acid and gartanin, could induce protective autophagy or autophagic cell death in chronic myeloid leukaemia cells 23, human urinary bladder cancer cells 14, lung cancer cells 31, hepatocellular carcinoma cells 13 and glioblastoma cells 29.	22246	22563
27491646	In this research, we also found that gartanin, a polyprenylated xanthone, obviously induced autophagy that was determined by the conversion of LC3‐I to LC3‐II, the degradation of p62, the increase in Beclin 1 and GFP‐LC3 punctate fluorescence (Fig.	22564	22812
27491646	6).	22813	22816
27491646	Moreover, anti‐viability effect of gartanin was significantly abolished by CQ or 3‐MA, two autophagy inhibitors (Fig.	22817	22934
27491646	8).	22935	22938
27491646	Further study showed that accumulation in G1 phase of gartanin group was significantly abrogated by pre‐treatment with 3‐MA (Fig.	22939	23068
27491646	9).	23069	23072
27491646	Concomitantly, the decrease in cyclin D1 and increase in p27Kip1 were abolished by pre‐treatment with 3‐MA (Fig.	23073	23185
27491646	9).	23069	23072
27491646	Accordingly, to some degree, the anti‐viability effect of gartanin on T98G cells involves cell cycle arrest which was regulated by autophagy.	23190	23331
27491646	It is well known that PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway has been frequently implicated in regulating autophagy 32.	23332	23445
27491646	Gartanin, here, inhibited key points of PI3K pathway, such as p‐PI3K, p‐Akt and p‐mTOR, in a time‐dependent manner (Fig.	23446	23566
27491646	7).	23567	23570
27491646	Data suggest gartanin is a potentially effective anti‐viability agent against glioma, and this anti‐viability effect involves autophagy which is induced by inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.	23571	23763
27491646	Local migration is another malignant phenotype of glioma.	23764	23821
27491646	Although distant metastasis is pretty rare, the characteristic of the glioma cells that migrating into adjacent brain tissue makes intact resection impossible 4, 5, 6.	23822	23989
27491646	Hence, interruption of the migration process is an effective approach for the treatment of glioma.	23990	24088
27491646	Previous studies showed that α‐mangostin suppressed metastasis in melanoma cells 16, PC‐3 human prostate carcinoma cells 33, MCF‐7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells 34 and pancreatic cancer cells 35.	24089	24288
27491646	Consistently, our research found that gartanin displayed obvious inhibition of motility in a concentration‐dependent manner via wound healing assay and RTCA (Fig.	24289	24451
27491646	4).	24452	24455
27491646	The first step of tumour cells migration is the breakdown of the basement membrane by the activated type IV collagen‐degrading enzymes including MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 36.	24456	24620
27491646	It has been reported that α‐mangostin suppressed invasion by inhibiting MMP‐2/‐9 33.	24621	24705
27491646	We also found that gartanin suppressed the proteolytic activities of MMP‐2/‐9 in T98G cells via gelatin zymographic assay.	24706	24828
27491646	To the best of our knowledge, MAPK pathway is one of the most important signalling pathways regulating the synthesis of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 37, 38.	24829	24972
27491646	It is reported that activated ERK1/2 or p38 could increase the production of MMPs 39.	24973	25058
27491646	On the contrary, inhibition of ERK signalling pathway might result in decreased expression of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 in human breast adenocarcinoma cells 34.	25059	25209
27491646	To explore the mechanism, we investigated the expression level of p‐ERK, p‐JNK and p‐p38 in T98G cells.	25210	25313
27491646	Gartanin (10 μM) significantly decreased the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 (Fig.	25314	25395
27491646	5).	9008	9011
27491646	As for p‐ERK, its expression level was increased at the time‐point of 3 hrs (Fig.	25400	25481
27491646	5A).	25482	25486
27491646	Besides anti‐tumour activity, it is also reported that gartanin possessed neuroprotective activity against stress injury 40.	25487	25611
27491646	In this study, cells were in stress state in the early stage.	25612	25673
27491646	Gartanin might exert transitorily protective effect against injury through the activation of ERK.	25674	25771
27491646	However, more studies are needed to reveal the exact mechanism(s).	25772	25838
27491646	What's more, autophagy had nothing to do with anti‐migration effect of gartanin (Fig.	25839	25924
27491646	9).	23069	23072
27491646	Thus, anti‐migration effect of gartanin could be preliminary explained by down‐regulation of MMP‐2/‐9 as a result of the suppressed MAPK signalling pathway (Fig.	25929	26090
27491646	5).	9008	9011
27491646	In summary, gartanin, at low micromole, effectively inhibits viability and migration ability of malignant glioma cells mainly by cell cycle arrest and suppression of MMPs.	26095	26266
27491646	Gartanin, the natural xanthone isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen fruit, might be a promising drug for the treatment of gliomas, alone or combined with other conventional chemotherapy drugs.	26267	26463
27491646	However, further studies are needed to reveal the exact mechanism(s) and confirm these effects in vivo.	26464	26567
27491646	The authors declare no conflicts of interest.	26568	26613
28660748	Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer‐related death in Japan that is associated with changes in lifestyle toward a Western diet.1 Approximately 20% of patients with a diagnosis of CRC already have metastasis.2 Liver metastasis is a common complication of CRC that has an impact on outcomes.	0	299
28660748	The mechanisms of early metastasis formation remain unclear.	300	360
28660748	Resident and tumor‐infiltrating cells form tumor microenvironments that have an important role in cancer initiation and progression.3 These cells regulate the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and pro‐angiogenic factors.4, 5 Transforming growth factor‐β1 is one of the major cytokines that induces phenotypic changes such as EMT of tumor cells, thereby facilitating their extravasation and dissemination to distant sites during metastasis.6 Transforming growth factor‐β1 is also known to be a promoter of tumor progression and profibrotic agent associated with the ability of EMT activator.6 The RAS plays an important role in the cardiovascular system and regulation of blood pressure.7 Angiotensin II is converted to mediator Ang 1‐8 by ACE.8 The activation of Ang II has been shown to stimulate the expression of VEGF, SDF‐1, and TGF‐β1.9, 10 Angiotensin II is known to be mediated by seven transmembrane receptors, and two major subtypes have been identified, AT1 and AT2.11 AT1 consists of two isoforms, AT1a and AT1b.11 Previous studies showed that the genetic depletion of AT1a inhibits tumor cell growth.12 We have also reported that the AT1 receptor antagonist TCV‐116 or the genetic depletion of AT1a suppresses tumor growth and lung metastasis formation.9 Previous studies have reported that the RAS inhibits growth of CRC liver metastasis in the regenerating liver.13, 14, 15 The expressions of AT1 receptor in KCs and macrophages are increased in metastatic liver.16 Blockade of AT1 receptor inhibits liver metastasis.16 However, the precise mechanism of the contributions of AT1a receptor signaling to liver metastasis remains to be clarified.	361	2035
28660748	A recent study showed that uptake of tumor cell‐derived exosomes by KCs induces TGF‐β1 secretion and formation of a premetastatic niche.17 These findings led us to hypothesize that the development of liver metastasis is facilitated by TGF‐β1 secreted from KCs through AT1a signaling.	2036	2319
28660748	The present study was thus designed to investigate the role of AT1a signaling in liver metastasis and to explore the underlying mechanisms of metastasis regulated by AT1a signaling.	2320	2501
28660748	Male C57BL/6 mice, 6–8 weeks old and weighing 20–25 g, were obtained from the CLEA Japan Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center (Fuji, Japan).	2502	2639
28660748	AT1a knockout mice (AT1aKO) with a C57BL/6 hybrid background were generated by our research group.	2640	2738
28660748	The mice were kept continuously on a 12:12‐h light:dark cycle.	2739	2801
28660748	All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for animal experiments of Kitasato University School of Medicine (Kanagawa, Japan).	2802	2952
28660748	Mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) throughout the experiments.	2953	3056
28660748	The adequacy of anesthesia was monitored on the basis of disappearance of the pedal withdrawal reflex.	3057	3159
28660748	The hair was shaved from the left flank, and the skin was rubbed with ethanol pads.	3160	3243
28660748	A 0.5‐cm incision was made in the left flank adjacent to the spleen, as described previously.18 CMT‐93 (CCL‐223; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), a murine colorectal cancer cell line, was maintained in DMEM (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) and RPMI‐1640 medium (Sigma), containing 10% FBS.	3244	3515
28660748	These cancer cells (2.0 × 106) in 200 μL PBS were slowly injected into the spleen of WT and AT1aKO using a 27‐G needle.	3516	3635
28660748	Five minutes after the injection, the spleen was removed, and the wound was closed with surgical clips.	3636	3739
28660748	Two weeks after injection of CMT‐93 cells, the mice were killed with an i.p. overdose of pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg).	3740	3862
28660748	Liver metastases were identified macroscopically.	3863	3912
28660748	The rate of hepatic metastases was expressed by dividing the number of mice with hepatic metastases by the total number of mice.	3913	4041
28660748	The total numbers in WT and AT1a KO were 20, respectively.	4042	4100
28660748	The livers were resected and weighed.	4101	4138
28660748	Sections (4‐μm thick) were prepared from paraffin‐embedded tissue and stained with H&E.	4139	4226
28660748	Images of H&E‐stained sections were captured under a fluorescence microscope (Biozero BZ‐9000 Series; Keyence, Osaka, Japan).	4227	4352
28660748	The area of liver metastasis was measured using ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD, USA).	4353	4437
28660748	Transcripts encoding AT1a‐R, AT1b‐R, AT2‐R, F4/80, TGF‐β1, SDF‐1 (CXCL12), VEGF‐A, CD31, MCP‐1 (CCL2), Col1a1, and GAPDH were quantified by real‐time PCR analysis.	4438	4601
28660748	Total RNA was extracted from liver tissues with TRIzol reagent (Gibco‐BRL; Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) and single‐stranded cDNA was generated from 1 μg total RNA by RT with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, New York, NY, USA).	4602	4827
28660748	Quantitative PCR was carried out with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan).	4828	4915
28660748	The real‐time PCR primers were designed using Primer 3 software (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/) based on data from GenBank.	4916	5041
28660748	The DNA sequences of mouse primers used for real‐time PCR are described in Table 1.	5042	5125
28660748	Data were normalized to the level of GAPDH in each sample.	5126	5184
28660748	Liver tissue was immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde.	5185	5261
28660748	After fixation, the tissue was dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and then embedded in paraffin.	5262	5361
28660748	Each section (4 μm) of the paraffin‐embedded tissue was mounted on a glass slide and either stained with H&E or processed for immunohistochemistry.	5362	5509
28660748	For the latter, sections were activated using Histo VT One (Nacalai Tesque, Yokohama, Japan) and then incubated overnight at 4°C with one of the following primary antibodies: (a) anti‐mouse F4/80 antibody (1:200, rat monoclonal, sc52664; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); (b) anti‐mouse TGF‐β1 antibody (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, ab92486; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); (c) anti‐mouse GFP antibody (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, ab290; Abcam); (d) anti‐mouse Ang II type 1A receptor antibody (1:100, rabbit polyclonal, bs‐2132R; Bioss, Boston, MA, USA); (e) anti‐mouse desmin antibody (1:100, goat polyclonal, ab80503; Abcam); (f) anti‐mouse type I collagen antibody (1:100, rabbit polyclonal, ab21286; Abcam); or (g) anti‐mouse CD31 antibody (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, ab28364; Abcam).	5510	6294
28660748	For primary antibodies (a–f), after washing in PBS, the sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488‐conjugated donkey anti‐rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), Alexa Fluor 594‐conjugated donkey anti‐rat IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), and Alexa Fluor 594‐conjugated donkey anti‐goat IgG (Molecular Probes).	6295	6633
28660748	For primary antibodies (f, g), after immersion in a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 30 min, the sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with N‐Histofine Simple Stain Mouse MAX PO (Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) and were immersed in 0.02% 3,3′‐diaminobenzine and 0.3% nickel ammonium sulfate in 50 mM Tris‐HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.005% H2O2 for 3 min.	6634	7023
28660748	Images were captured with a light microscope and a fluorescence microscope (Biozero BZ‐9000 Series; Keyence).	7024	7133
28660748	For primary antibodies (a–e), the numbers of positive cells in metastases in the whole fields (×200 magnification) were counted.	7134	7262
28660748	For primary antibody (f), the positive area in the whole fields (×200 magnification) was calculated with the use of ImageJ image analysis software.	7263	7410
28660748	The KUP5 KC line19 was seeded on 12‐well chamber glass slides (354 118; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well with the growth medium.	7411	7568
28660748	Three different concentrations of Ang II (0.001, 0.1, and 10 μM) were added to serum‐free media for 6 and 12 h. For the BM transplantation experiments, transgenic mice expressing GFP against a C57BL/6 background (a gift from Dr. M. Okabe, Genome Information Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) were used to confirm BM chimerism.	7569	7910
28660748	AT1aKO and GFP+ mice were crossed to obtain GFP+ AT1aKO.	7911	7967
28660748	Bone marrow transplantation experiments were carried out as described previously.20 In brief, donor BM was obtained by flushing the cavities of AT1aKO and WT/GFP transgenic mice with PBS.	7968	8155
28660748	The flushed BM cells were dispersed and resuspended in PBS at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/100 μL.	8156	8254
28660748	Both WT and AT1aKO were lethally irradiated with 10 Gy using an MBR‐1505 R X‐ray irradiator (Hitachi Medico, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a filter (copper, 0.5 mm; aluminum, 2 mm).	8255	8434
28660748	The cumulative radiation dose was monitored.	8435	8479
28660748	The BM mononuclear cells of GFP mice (2.0 × 106 cells/200 μL) were transplanted into irradiated WT and AT1aKO through the tail vein.	8480	8612
28660748	After 8 weeks, blood was collected and analyzed by FACS.	8613	8669
28660748	Mice in which more than 90% of peripheral leukocytes were GFP‐positive were used in the experiments.	8670	8770
28660748	Protein levels of type I collagen in the liver at day 0 and day 14 after injecting cancer cells were measured using a specific ELISA kit (Mouse Type I collagen detection kit, 6012; Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA).	8771	8980
28660748	To deplete KCs, mice were injected i.v. with 200 μL clodronate liposomes (F70101C‐N; FormuMax Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA) or control liposomes (F70101‐N) 2 days before cancer cell injection into the spleen.	8981	9191
28660748	Data are expressed as means ± SD.	9192	9225
28660748	All statistical analyses were undertaken using GraphPad Prism software, version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).	9226	9350
28660748	Student's t‐test or the Mann–Whitney U‐test were used for comparisons between two experimental groups with or without normal distribution, respectively.	9351	9503
28660748	Comparisons between multiple groups were carried out using one‐way anova.	9504	9577
28660748	The results of survival experiments were analyzed using log–rank tests and are presented as Kaplan–Meier survival curves.	9578	9699
28660748	P‐values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.	9700	9768
28660748	We determined the expression of AT receptors in the metastatic livers from WT (C57BL/6) mice.	9769	9862
28660748	Compared with PBS injection, the expression of AT1a in the metastatic liver was enhanced after injection of CMT‐93 cells, whereas there were no significant differences in the expression of AT1b (P = 0.057) or AT2 (P = 0.114; Fig.	9863	10092
28660748	1a).	10093	10097
28660748	These results suggested that AT1a signaling is related to liver metastasis formation.	10098	10183
28660748	To examine the effect of endogenous AT1a signaling on liver metastasis formation, we compared the liver weight and the rate of metastasis between AT1aKO and WT (Fig.	10184	10349
28660748	1b,c).	10350	10356
28660748	Compared with WT, the liver weight (WT 1.32 ± 0.04 g vs AT1aKO 1.03 ± 0.01 g; P < 0.05; Fig.	10357	10449
28660748	1b) and rate of metastasis (WT 87.5 ± 8.5% vs AT1aKO 17.1 ± 5.7%; P < 0.05; Fig.	10450	10530
28660748	1c) were significantly suppressed in AT1aKO.	10531	10575
28660748	The colon cancer cell line CMT‐93 substantially formed liver metastases in WT mice, whereas liver metastasis formation was less in AT1aKO mice (Fig.	10576	10724
28660748	1d,e).	10725	10731
28660748	We also confirmed that AT1aKO mice injected with another colon cancer cell line, Colon 38, significantly suppressed liver metastasis formation (Fig.	10732	10880
28660748	S1).	10881	10885
28660748	The metastatic areas in the liver in macro (WT 2.64 ± 0.33 cm2 vs AT1aKO 0.07 ± 0.07 cm2; Fig.	10886	10980
28660748	1f) and in micro (WT 1.60 ± 0.56 mm2 vs AT1aKO 0.08 ± 0.03 mm2; Fig.	10981	11049
28660748	1g) were significantly suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT.	11050	11111
28660748	Furthermore, 60 days after the injection of CMT‐93 cells, the survival rate of WT was 30%, while that of AT1aKO was 90% (Fig.	11112	11237
28660748	1h).	11238	11242
28660748	These results suggested that AT1a signaling facilitates not only liver metastasis formation but also serves as a prognostic factor for liver metastasis.	11243	11395
28660748	AT1a has been suggested to be expressed in KCs16 and HSCs.21 To further examine the cellular source of AT1a in liver metastatic areas, dual immunofluorescence was carried out 14 days after CMT‐93 injection.	11396	11602
28660748	Immunofluorescence double staining of liver sections of WT with antibodies against AT1a and F4/80 or desmin, a marker for HSCs,22 indicated that AT1a was expressed mainly in KCs (F4/80‐positive cells; Fig.	11603	11808
28660748	S2a), and partly in HSCs (desmin‐positive cells; Fig.	11809	11862
28660748	S2b).	11863	11868
28660748	These results suggest that AT1a is derived mainly from KCs, and partly from HSCs, during the progression of CRC liver metastasis.	11869	11998
28660748	Tumor metastasis formation is related to angiogenesis.23 Therefore, we investigated the expressions of CD31, VEGF‐A, SDF‐1, and TGF‐β1 in the liver 14 days after CMT‐93 injection.	11999	12178
28660748	The expression of CD31 mRNA was significantly suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT (Fig.	12179	12268
28660748	2a).	12269	12273
28660748	In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 showed that more CD31‐positive cells were located in metastatic areas in WT than in AT1aKO (Fig.	12274	12420
28660748	2b).	11864	11868
28660748	Furthermore, we examined the expression of angiogenesis‐stimulating factors, including VEGF‐A, SDF‐1, and TGF‐β1.	12426	12539
28660748	The expression of TGF‐β1 in the liver was significantly lower in AT1aKO than in WT, but there were no significant differences in VEGF‐A or SDF‐1 expression between the two groups (Fig.	12540	12724
28660748	2c–e).	12725	12731
28660748	It is commonly accepted that macrophages are related to liver metastasis formation.24 Macrophages secrete angiogenesis‐stimulating factors to regulate metastasis formation.	12732	12904
28660748	We therefore examined the expression of macrophage markers by means of real‐time PCR analysis.	12905	12999
28660748	The mRNA levels of F4/80 in livers from AT1aKO were significantly suppressed compared with the levels in livers from WT (Fig.	13000	13125
28660748	2f).	13126	13130
28660748	The mRNA levels of MCP‐1 in AT1aKO were also reduced (Fig.	13131	13189
28660748	2g).	13190	13194
28660748	These results suggested that AT1a signaling is involved in the recruitment of macrophages, which has an important role in tumor growth.	13195	13330
28660748	Kupffer cells are the resident macrophages of the liver and contribute to the metastatic process.25, 26 To elucidate the role of hepatic macrophages in liver metastasis, we determined the numbers of hepatic macrophages by immunofluorescence analysis.	13331	13581
28660748	As shown in Figure 3(a), F4/80+ cells markedly accumulated into the metastatic tumors in WT compared with AT1aKO.	13582	13695
28660748	Infiltrated F4/80+ cells in metastatic areas were significantly increased in WT (5019 ± 699 cells/mm2) compared with AT1aKO (1870 ± 656 cells/mm2; Fig.	13696	13847
28660748	3b).	13848	13852
28660748	A previous study showed that TGF‐β1 released from KCs induces tumor cell adhesion.17 The number of TGF‐β1+ cells in WT (3655 ± 439 cells/mm2) was larger than in AT1aKO (1291 ± 414 cells/mm2; Fig.	13853	14048
28660748	3c).	14049	14053
28660748	To investigate whether F4/80+ KCs in metastatic tumors express TGF‐β1, we carried out double immunofluorescent analysis against TGF‐β1 and F4/80 (Fig.	14054	14204
28660748	3a).	14205	14209
28660748	The expression of TGF‐β1 was colocalized with F4/80+ cells.	14210	14269
28660748	Accumulation of F4/80+TGF‐β1+ cells in the metastatic areas in WT (2962 ± 363 cells/mm2) was enhanced compared with AT1aKO (1064 ± 333 cells/mm2; Fig.	14270	14420
28660748	3d).	14421	14425
28660748	To further focus on the expression of TGF‐β1 from KCs, we estimated the expression of TGF‐β1 in mouse clonal KCs (KUP5) under Ang II stimulation.	14426	14571
28660748	KUP5 expressed AT1 receptors, AT1a and AT1b (Fig.	14572	14621
28660748	3e).	14622	14626
28660748	The expression of TGF‐β1 was enhanced 6 h after stimulation with Ang II compared with the control (Fig.	14627	14730
28660748	3f).	14731	14735
28660748	There was no significant difference in the expression of TGF‐β1 at 12 h (Fig.	14736	14813
28660748	3f).	14731	14735
28660748	To determine whether BM‐derived macrophages affect liver metastasis formation, we transplanted GFP‐expressing BM cells to irradiated mice: BM cells from GFP+ WT or GFP+ AT1aKO were transplanted→WT or AT1aKO.	14819	15026
28660748	Eight weeks after BM transplantation, CMT‐93 cells were intrasplenically implanted in chimeric mice (Fig.	15027	15132
28660748	4a).	15133	15137
28660748	In AT1aKO‐BM→WT, tumor area (1.97 ± 0.11 cm2) was significantly suppressed compared with that in WT‐BM→WT (2.94 ± 0.16 cm2; Fig.	15138	15266
28660748	4b).	15267	15271
28660748	Moreover, tumor area in WT‐BM→AT1aKO (0.72 ± 0.15 cm2) showed a significant increase compared with that in AT1aKO‐BM→AT1aKO (0.17 ± 0.12 cm2; Fig.	15272	15418
28660748	4b).	15267	15271
28660748	These results suggested that AT1a signaling in BM cells is involved in liver metastasis.	15424	15512
28660748	Interestingly, the tumor area in WT‐BM→AT1aKO did not increase, but further decreased compared with that in AT1aKO‐BM→WT.	15513	15634
28660748	These results suggested that resident liver cells expressing AT1a rather than BM‐derived cells expressing AT1a would induce metastatic formation.	15635	15780
28660748	To further examine the contribution of BM‐derived macrophages or host‐derived macrophages to the formation of liver metastasis, immunofluorescence was carried out (Fig.	15781	15949
28660748	4c).	15950	15954
28660748	The numbers of accumulated GFP+ cells in AT1aKO‐BM→WT (5917 ± 461 cells/mm2), WT‐BM→AT1aKO (6018 ± 622 cells/mm2) and AT1aKO‐BM→AT1aKO (5891 ± 825 cells/mm2) had a tendency to be suppressed compared with those in WT‐BM→WT (8269 ± 422 cells/mm2; Fig.	15955	16204
28660748	5a).	16205	16209
28660748	However, the difference did not reach statistical significance.	16210	16273
28660748	This result suggested that AT1a signaling in BM cells did not make a significant contribution to the accumulation of BM‐derived cells (GFP+ cells) into metastatic areas.	16274	16443
28660748	The numbers of accumulated F4/80+ cells in WT‐BM→AT1aKO (3902 ± 451 cells/mm2) were suppressed compared with WT‐BM→WT (6172 ± 635 cells/mm2; Fig.	16444	16589
28660748	5b).	16590	16594
28660748	However, there were no significant differences in accumulated F4/80+ cells between WT‐BM→WT and AT1aKO‐BM→WT.	16595	16704
28660748	Similarly, the numbers of accumulated F4/80+ cells in AT1aKO‐BM→AT1aKO (2622 ± 409 cells/mm2) were suppressed compared with AT1aKO‐BM→WT (4754 ± 242 cells/mm2; Fig.	16705	16869
28660748	5b).	16590	16594
28660748	However, the numbers of F4/80+ cells did not differ between AT1aKO‐BM→WT and AT1aKO‐BM→AT1aKO‐BM.	16875	16972
28660748	These results showed that hepatic resident cells expressing AT1a signaling, but not BM‐derived cells, contributed to accumulation of F4/80+ cells into liver metastatic lesions.	16973	17149
28660748	In order to examine whether F4/80+ cells derive from BM or not, we counted the numbers of GFP+F4/80+ cells (Fig.	17150	17262
28660748	5c) and GFP−F4/80+ cells in metastatic areas (Fig.	17263	17313
28660748	5d).	17314	17318
28660748	There were no significant differences in the numbers of GFP+F4/80+ cells among four groups (Fig.	17319	17415
28660748	5c).	17416	17420
28660748	By contrast, the changes in numbers of GFP−F4/80+ cells in metastatic areas from each group were basically similar to those of F4/80+ cells in each group (Fig.	17421	17580
28660748	5d).	17314	17318
28660748	The numbers of GFP+F4/80+ cells in WT‐BM→WT were approximately 23% of the total numbers of F4/80+ cells in WT‐BM→WT, whereas the numbers of GFP−F4/80+ cells were approximately 77% of the total numbers of F4/80+ cells (Fig.	17586	17808
28660748	5e).	17809	17813
28660748	In addition, in another three groups, the percentages of GFP+F4/80+ cells were approximately 20%–30%, whereas those of GFP−F4/80+ cells were approximately 70%–80% (Fig.	17814	17982
28660748	5e).	17809	17813
28660748	These results indicated that accumulated F4/80+ cells in metastatic areas were mainly derived from resident hepatic macrophages (KCs) and partly from BM, and that resident KCs were mainly involved in tumor metastasis.	17988	18205
28660748	These findings also suggested that AT1a signaling in resident KCs would contribute to liver metastasis formation.	18206	18319
28660748	As indicated in Figure 3(a), we examined whether accumulated F4/80+ cells expressed TGF‐β1 in the BM transplantation model (Fig.	18320	18448
28660748	6a).	18449	18453
28660748	F4/80+ cells were also positive for TGF‐β1 (Fig.	18454	18502
28660748	6a).	18449	18453
28660748	The numbers of accumulated TGF‐β1+ cells in the metastatic livers from chimeric mice correlated with the numbers of accumulated F4/80+ cells from respective chimeric mice (Fig.	18508	18684
28660748	6a,b).	18685	18691
28660748	The total population of TGF‐β1+F4/80+ cells in WT‐BM→AT1aKO (2056 ± 171 cells/mm2) was significantly reduced compared with that in WT‐BM→WT (3268 ± 396 cells/mm2; Fig.	18692	18859
28660748	6c).	18860	18864
28660748	In addition, the total population of TGF‐β1+F4/80+ cells in AT1aKO‐BM→AT1aKO (1735 ± 277 cells/mm2) had a tendency to be suppressed compared with that in AT1aKO‐BM→WT (2233 ± 231 cells/mm2; Fig.	18865	19059
28660748	6c).	18860	18864
28660748	These results suggested that AT1a signaling accumulated host‐derived TGF‐β1+F4/80+KCs in metastatic areas.	19065	19171
28660748	Because AT1a was expressed in HSCs (Fig.	19172	19212
28660748	S2b), and type I collagen deposition produced by HSCs27 is associated with an increased risk of liver metastasis,28 we examined the cellular source of collagen deposition in metastatic areas.	19213	19404
28660748	Double immunofluorescence revealed that the expression of type I collagen was colocalized with desmin+ cells (Fig.	19405	19519
28660748	S3a), but not F4/80+ cells (Fig.	19520	19552
28660748	S3b).	19553	19558
28660748	Next, we determined the expression of type I collagen in metastatic areas 14 days after injection of CMT‐93 cells in WT and AT1aKO.	19559	19690
28660748	Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of type I collagen in metastatic areas was diminished in AT1aKO (Fig.	19691	19816
28660748	7a).	19817	19821
28660748	Quantitative analysis revealed that the total type I collagen‐positive area in the liver from AT1aKO (0.05 ± 0.01 mm2/mm2) was suppressed compared with WT (0.19 ± 0.03 mm2/mm2; Fig.	19822	20003
28660748	7b).	20004	20008
28660748	The mRNA expression of Col1a1 in AT1aKO was significantly reduced compared with that in WT (Fig.	20009	20105
28660748	7c).	20106	20110
28660748	Moreover, the protein levels of type I collagen in the livers in AT1aKO (0.42 ± 0.02 μg/mL) was suppressed compared with those in WT (0.76 ± 0.13 μg/mL; Fig.	20111	20268
28660748	7d).	20269	20273
28660748	These results suggested that HSCs produced type I collagen through AT1a signaling in liver metastatic areas.	20274	20382
28660748	Bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that the area occupied by type I collagen‐positive cells was significantly increased in WT‐BM→WT (0.15 ± 0.02 mm2/mm2) compared with WT‐BM→AT1aKO (0.08 ± 0.01 mm2/mm2).	20383	20598
28660748	Similarly, those cells had a tendency to an increase in AT1aKO‐BM→WT (0.09 ± 0.01 mm2/mm2) compared with AT1aKO‐BM→AT1aKO (0.04 ± 0.01 mm2/mm2; Fig.	20599	20747
28660748	7e,f).	20748	20754
28660748	These results suggested that the expression of type I collagen depended on AT1a signaling in host liver cells.	20755	20865
28660748	To further elucidate the role of KCs in liver metastasis formation, KCs from WT mice were deleted by injection of clodronate liposomes 2 days before injection of cancer cells.	20866	21041
28660748	The metastasis area in WT with clodronate liposomes (1.15 ± 0.45 cm2) was reduced compared with that in WT with control liposomes (3.30 ± 0.19 cm2; Fig.	21042	21194
28660748	8a).	21195	21199
28660748	The mRNA expression levels of F4/80, TGF‐β1, Col1a1, and CD31 were significantly suppressed in WT with clodronate liposomes compared with WT with control liposomes (Fig.	21200	21369
28660748	8b–e).	21370	21376
28660748	The numbers of TGF‐β1+ cells, F4/80+ cells, and TGF‐β1+F4/80+ cells were suppressed in clodronate liposome‐treated WT (1267 ± 472, 1959 ± 596, and 970 ± 378 cells/mm2, respectively) compared with controls (5205 ± 401, 6399 ± 520, and 4192 ± 402 cells/mm2, respectively; Fig.	21377	21651
28660748	8f–i).	21652	21658
28660748	The area occupied by type I collagen‐positive cells was suppressed in clodronate liposome‐treated mice (0.11 ± 0.02 mm2/mm2) compared with control liposome‐treated mice (0.33 ± 0.04 mm2/mm2; Fig.	21659	21854
28660748	8j,k).	21855	21861
28660748	These results suggested that the accumulation of KCs expressing TGF‐β1 induces liver metastasis formation associated with production of type I collagen.	21862	22014
28660748	The focus of this study was to elucidate the role of AT1a signaling in the metastatic progression of CRC in the liver.	22015	22133
28660748	The genetic depletion of AT1a significantly suppressed liver metastasis.	22134	22206
28660748	Enhanced mRNA expression of F4/80 and TGF‐β1 in the liver metastatic area was associated with the accumulation of F4/80+ cells expressing TGF‐β1.	22207	22352
28660748	Bone marrow transplantation experiments showed the presence of mainly host‐derived F4/80+ cells (KCs), but BM‐derived F4/80+ cells, to a lesser degree, participated in liver metastasis formation.	22353	22548
28660748	These results suggested that AT1a signaling promotes liver metastasis formation by accumulated resident hepatic macrophages in association with TGF‐β1.	22549	22700
28660748	Angiotensin II is one of the major components of the RAS that is essential for blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance.6 Angiotensin II binds two receptors, AT1 and AT2.	22701	22880
28660748	AT1 has two subtypes, receptor AT1a and AT1b.11 Angiotensin II, one of the factors of the RAS, promotes tumor growth with expression of VEGF‐A, angiopoietin 2, fibroblast growth factor, and platelet‐derived growth factor.3, 4, 29 The expression of AT1 is especially enhanced in cancer.30, 31, 32 In fact, it is reported that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers inhibit the risk of cancer and cancer‐related death.33 We have shown that AT1 signaling induces tumor growth and metastasis formation in a lung metastasis model.9 Neo et al.34 reported that treatment with ACE inhibitors suppressed angiogenesis in a mouse model of CRC liver metastasis.	22881	23543
28660748	These findings led us to focus on the role of AT1a signaling in liver metastasis formation.	23544	23635
28660748	To examine whether endogenous AT1a signaling has an effect on liver metastasis formation or not, we used AT1aKO.	23636	23748
28660748	The present study showed suppression of liver metastasis formation in AT1aKO after injection of CMT‐93 cells.	23749	23858
28660748	We found that AT1a is expressed mainly in KCs during the progression of CRC liver metastasis, which is consistent with the findings by others.16 Liver metastasis formation is enhanced by angiogenesis‐stimulating factors, including TGF‐β1, VEGF‐A, and SDF‐1.4, 5 Transforming growth factor‐β1 plays important roles in embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and wound healing.35, 36 Furthermore, it is well known to be an immune and inflammation regulator.	23859	24348
28660748	Upregulation of TGF‐β1 induces EMT, a key step in processing metastasis formation, and this creates a microenvironment conducive to infiltration of the target organ by cancer cells.37 The present study showed that the expression of TGF‐β1 in the metastatic liver was suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT.	24349	24654
28660748	This finding suggested that the expression of TGF‐β1 in the metastatic liver was dependent on AT1a signaling.	24655	24764
28660748	Taken together, AT1a signaling promotes liver metastasis with enhancement of TGF‐β1.	24765	24849
28660748	The TGF‐β1 signaling pathway is a key player in tumor development.	24850	24916
28660748	Angiotensin II activates TGF‐β1 signaling.38 In the current study, we showed that F4/80+ KCs coexpressed TGF‐β1 in metastatic areas and the expression of TGF‐β1 depended on AT1a signaling.	24917	25105
28660748	We also revealed that Ang II enhanced TGF‐β1 expression in cultured KCs.	25106	25178
28660748	Although these findings suggest that Ang II/AT1a activates the TGF‐β1 signaling pathway, we further need to elucidate the relative importance of AT1a for activation of TGF‐β1 signaling in a liver metastasis model.	25179	25392
28660748	Macrophages are characterized by high functional plasticity for forming tumor microenvironments that are associated with angiogenesis or facilitation of immune response.39 Resident liver macrophages, KCs, play critical roles in development of microenvironments in primary cancer and liver metastasis formation.40 Our present study showed that the expression of macrophage‐related markers, including F4/80 and MCP‐1, was enhanced in areas of metastasis.	25393	25845
28660748	These results support the hypothesis that macrophages are related to metastasis formation.	25846	25936
28660748	Pancreatic cancer exosomes initiate premetastatic niche formation by KCs through TGF‐β1 secretion.17 Previous studies have shown that KCs express the RAS components ACE and AT1R.	25937	26115
28660748	Wen et al.16 reported that the RAS regulates KCs in CRC liver metastasis formation.	26116	26199
28660748	In the present study, we showed that KUP5 cells, murine KCs, enhanced the expression of TGF‐β1 under Ang II stimulation.	26200	26320
28660748	In this experiment, immunofluorescence against F4/80 was used to detect accumulated macrophages in the metastatic livers.	26321	26442
28660748	Our results indicated that resident KCs had an important role in liver metastasis formation.	26443	26535
28660748	We previously reported that AT1a signaling is important for the recruitment of BM cells to metastatic areas.9 The present study showed that recruitment of GFP+ cells infiltrated in liver metastasis was suppressed in AT1aKO‐BM→WT compared with WT‐BM→WT.	26536	26788
28660748	Regardless of whether WT‐BM or AT1aKO‐BM was transplanted, the number of GFP+F4/80+ KCs was suppressed in AT1aKO.	26789	26902
28660748	Interestingly, the same phenomenon was seen in the numbers of TGF‐β1+F4/80+ KCs in WT‐BM→WT and AT1aKO‐BM→WT.	26903	27012
28660748	Even after transplantation of WT‐BM, the total population of GFP+F4/80+ KCs was not elevated.	27013	27106
28660748	Moreover, the number of accumulated TGF‐β1+F4/80+ KCs in the metastasis area was much higher than that of GFP+F4/80+ KCs in WT‐BM→WT.	27107	27240
28660748	These results indicated that tissue resident TGF‐β1+F4/80+ KCs play a role in metastasis formation through AT1a signaling, and that the number of TGF‐β1+F4/80+ KCs correlated with liver metastasis formation.	27241	27448
28660748	Regarding the role of KCs in the formation of liver metastasis, conflicting results have been reported.	27449	27552
28660748	Wen et al.41 showed that KC depletion with gadolinium chloride before tumor induction was associated with an increased tumor burden in metastatic liver, suggesting that KCs show an antitumor effect.	27553	27751
28660748	Kruse et al.42 reported that KC depletion with clodronate liposomes before tumor induction led to a significant reduction of liver metastasis, which was consistent with our results.	27752	27933
28660748	These suggest that KCs promote the formation of metastases in the liver.	27934	28006
28660748	Despite divergent roles of KCs in liver metastasis, KC infiltration appears not to be the result of liver metastasis but the cause of initiation of liver metastasis.	28007	28172
28660748	As the precise correlation between KCs and liver metastasis still remains unclear, further experiments are needed.	28173	28287
28660748	Tumor progression and fibrosis are pivotal aspects of malignant tumors.	28288	28359
28660748	Several factors, including TGF‐β1, VEGF‐A, SDF‐1, and Ang II, are regarded as candidate factors involved in cross‐talk between tumor cells and stromal cells.	28360	28517
28660748	As mentioned above, Ang II induces fibrosis in many organs.	28518	28577
28660748	We previously reported that host‐derived AT1a‐positive cells, fibroblasts, induce tumor growth.12 The present study suggested that TGF‐β1 derived from resident KCs induced liver metastasis formation.	28578	28777
28660748	We also showed that attenuated expression of host‐derived TGF‐β1 in AT1aKO was associated with suppressed metastasis formation.	28778	28905
28660748	In the early stage of metastasis, tumor cell invasion into the extra‐sinusoidal space seems to recapitulate this tissue repair process: KCs trigger HSCs and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell activation.	28906	29108
28660748	This was observed in experimental models and is also evidenced by the increased production of collagen in hepatic metastases in clinical specimens.40 Okamoto et al.43 showed that the Ang II/AT‐1 axis induced tumor progression and fibrosis in intrahepatic cholangiosarcoma through an interaction with HSC.	29109	29413
28660748	The present study indicated that the expression of type I collagen, a fibrosis marker, was also suppressed in AT1aKO.	29414	29531
28660748	We showed that resident F4/80+ KCs expressed TGF‐β1 in metastatic tumor areas, in which type I collagen was significantly expressed.	29532	29664
28660748	Transforming growth factor‐β1 mediates fibrogenesis, including collagen deposition, by induction of activated HSCs.	29665	29780
28660748	Bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that AT1a signaling in host cells accumulated TGF‐β1+F4/80+ KCs as well as type 1 collagen‐productive cells.	29781	29936
28660748	Further studies are needed to disclose the interaction between accumulated host‐derived TGF‐β1+F4/80+ KCs and fibrosis formation.	29937	30066
28660748	In conclusion, AT1a signaling in resident F4/80+ KCs promotes liver metastasis formation by enhancing TGF‐β1 expression.	30067	30187
28660748	Highly selective AT1a antagonists may become a useful treatment for CRC.	30188	30260
28660748	The authors have no conflict of interest.	30261	30302
