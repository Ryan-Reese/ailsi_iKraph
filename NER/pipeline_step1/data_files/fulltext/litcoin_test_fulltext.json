However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning.\n\n\nResults\nPb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb-exposed children. Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit. In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure. These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children. However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals.\n\n", "fulltext": "Chelating agents have been used to treat lead-exposed children since the 1950s, but the metric for gauging therapeutic efficacy has changed over time. When these drugs were first implemented for clinical use, it was common for poor, inner-city children to be brought to emergency rooms with signs of Pb-induced encephalopathy. The chelating agents used at that time, CaNa2EDTA (calcium disodium versenate) and BAL (dimer-caprol), are credited with dramatically reducing the mortality rate in such children, estimated to be 66% before the advent of chelating agents (Foreman 1961) relative to 1\u20132% thereafter (Chisholm 1968). Fortunately, blood Pb levels of U.S. children have declined dramatically over the past 20 years [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2005], and Pb-induced encephalopathy is rare. However, as evidence mounts that even slightly elevated Pb levels are associated with impaired cognitive functioning in children, there appears to be growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at very low exposure levels. The CDC (2005) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (2005) recommend chelation for blood Pb levels > 45 \u03bcg/dL, but surveillance data from 10 states indicate chelation therapy occurring at blood Pb levels well below this recommended level (CDC, unpublished data). There are surprisingly little data upon which to gauge the benefits and possible risks of chelation therapy in children with subclinical Pb poisoning. With respect to succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid), the most widely administered chelating agent, only one clinical trial conducted to date has included cognitive measures. This study did not detect a benefit of chelation, relative to placebo, in children with blood Pb levels between 20 and 44 \u03bcg/dL. However, several studies using animal models reported that succimer normalized various behaviors altered by Pb exposure, including forced-swim immobility, activity level, and habituation rate (Gong and Evans 1997). Using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure, the present study was designed to a) determine whether treatment with a succimer regimen shown to produce significant reductions in blood and brain Pb levels also lessens the lasting cognitive and affective changes that are produced by a short period of early developmental Pb exposure; and b) determine whether succimer produces lasting cognitive and/or affective impairment when administered in the absence of Pb exposure. Findings from the latter group are needed to gauge the safety of prolonged regimens when treating Pb-exposed children, as well as the safety of the drug for treating autistic children, as currently advocated on numerous websites by physicians, autism parent groups, and organizations such as the American College for Advancement in Medicine. In this article, we describe a subset of the administered tests\u2014namely, a series of visual attention tests designed to tap several functions reported to be affected in Pb-exposed children, including sustained and selective attention, inhibitory control, learning/associative ability, and regulation of arousal or emotion. Two of these tasks, the sustained attention and selective attention tasks, are similar to ones commonly used to assess attention in human subjects, such as the Continuous Performance Test and Leonard\u2019s 5-choice Serial Reaction Task (reviewed by Robbins 2002). The study used a 3 \u00d7 2 factorial design, with three levels of Pb exposure and two levels of chelation (succimer or vehicle), described below. The sample size for the behavioral testing was 120 animals, 20 per group. These 120 animals were the female offspring of 60 litters, one succimer-treated and one vehicle-treated animal per litter. All procedures were approved by the Cornell Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the housing facilities were accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Nulliparous Long-Evans rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were mated in the laboratory. They were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering. Twenty-four hours after birth, each litter was culled to 10 pups and assigned to one of three Pb-exposure conditions [no Pb, moderate Pb (Mod-Pb), or high Pb (High-Pb)]. The dams in the no-Pb group received drinking water (deionized distilled) adulterated with 300 ppm sodium acetate from postnatal day (PND)1 to PND30. Both Pb-exposed groups received water adulterated with 300 ppm Pb acetate from PND1 to PND17. On PND17, around the age when pups begin consuming water directly from the drinking water bottle, the water Pb concentration was lowered to 20 ppm for the Mod-Pb group for the remainder of the Pb exposure period (until PND30) in order to maintain the moderate level of Pb intake experienced prior to PND17 when milk provided the sole source of Pb. The High-Pb group was maintained on the 300-ppm Pb acetate drinking water until PND30. At PND30, the pups were weaned and Pb exposure was terminated. The period of Pb exposure, PND1\u201330, corresponds roughly, in terms of neural development, to the period spanning the sixth month of pregnancy until late childhood/early adolescence in humans. Additional information on the Pb exposure regimens is provided in the Supplemental Material available online (http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf). On PND30, the pups in each Pb treatment group were divided into succimer (Chemet; McNeil Consumer Products Company, Fort Washington, PA) and vehicle (apple juice) subgroups. This assignment was made at the level of each litter to provide littermate controls for the vehicle\u2013succimer comparisons. Succimer or apple juice (vehicle) was administered twice daily via oral gavage from PND31 to PND52. The daily succimer dose was 50 mg/kg body weight/day during the first week of chelation, followed by 25 mg/kg/day for the second and third weeks, similar to the regimen used clinically. On PND52 (end of chelation therapy) one animal from each litter was euthanized for analysis of blood and whole brain Pb levels by inductively coupled plasma-high resolution mass spectrometry, as previously described. Behavioral testing was conducted in 12 automated Plexiglas chambers, each operated by a personal computer. Briefly, each chamber consisted of a waiting area, and a small testing alcove recessed into one wall. The alcove was separated from the waiting area by a metal guillotine-type door. Each of the three walls of the alcove contained a funnel-shaped response port. A light-emitting diode (LED) was mounted above each port; the illumination of one of these LEDs served as the discriminative cue in all of the tasks described here. For the selective attention task, compressed, scented air (which served as the olfactory distractors) was projected into the response ports via polyethylene tubes. Behavioral testing began on PND62. All animals were weighed and tested 6 days/week. For all tasks, a daily testing session consisted of 200 trials or 2 hr, whichever came first. All behavioral testing was conducted by individuals blind to the treatment condition of the subjects. Throughout behavioral testing, animals were maintained on a restricted food intake regimen (see Supplemental Material available online at http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf) with ad libitum access to water. Testing on the four tasks described in this report was initiated, on average, at 9, 10, 13, and 15 weeks of age, respectively. Each trial began with the opening of the alcove door. Immediately after the animal broke the infrared beam at the alcove entrance, one of the three LEDs was illuminated. The LED remained illuminated until the animal made a 1-sec nose-poke into one of the three ports or 60 sec elapsed, whichever came first. A 1-sec nose-poke into the port under the illuminated LED constituted the correct response and was rewarded with delivery of a 45 mg food pellet into the alcove. Each animal was tested on this task until it reached a performance criterion of at least 80% correct in a single session.. This task was a variation of the visual discrimination task with two modifications: a) a delay of varying duration (0, 3, 6, or 9 sec) was imposed between trial onset (entry into the alcove) and presentation of the cue (the illuminated LED); and b) the duration of cue illumination was shortened to 700 msec. Animals were tested on this task for 20 sessions. The sustained attention task was identical to the previous task, except that the duration of the cue illumination varied between 200, 400, and 700 msec. Animals were tested for 10 sessions on this task. The animals were then tested for 10 sessions on a selective attention task, similar to the preceding task but with modifications of the stimulus parameters and the addition of unpredictable olfactory distractors on one-third or the trials in each daily test session. This task was preceded by three sessions on a baseline task, which had stimulus parameters identical to those in the selective attention task, but without olfactory distractors. In both tasks, the stimulus delay varied between 2 and 3 sec, and the stimulus duration varied between 300 and 700 msec. We analyzed the various performance measures using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), which correctly handled the repeated measures on each animal (Wolfinger and O\u2019Connell 1993). Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05; p-values between 0.05 and 0.10 were considered to be trends and are discussed if they aid in clarifying the nature of the Pb and succimer effects. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for Windows 2000. Additional information on the various dependent measures and statistical analyses is provided in the Supplemental Material available online (http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf). Because of space constraints, the results of behavioral testing presented here include only those instances where effects of Pb and/or succimer were seen. Analysis of average percent errors for the first six sessions on the visual discrimination task revealed a significant main effect of treatment group [F(2, 78.1) = 8.54; p = 0.0004] and a significant interaction of treatment and session number [F(10, 151) = 3.29; p = 0.0007]. The controls (no lead exposure and no succimer treatment) performed significantly better than the High-Pb (p = 0.017) and High-Pb\u2013succimer (p < 0.0001) groups. Chelation offered no benefit; the performance of the High-Pb and High-Pb\u2013succimer groups did not differ significantly. The High-Pb and control groups did not differ significantly by the sixth session, indicating that their inferior performance earlier in testing reflected impaired learning ability. Analysis of percent premature responses (responses made before cue onset) revealed a borderline main effect of treatment [F(2, 57.2) = 2.81; p = 0.068]; and significant interactions involving treatment and delay [F(4, 1925) = 3.64; p = 0.006], and treatment, session block, and trial block [F(12, 1926) = 2.13; p = 0.013]. Rats in the High-Pb group committed a significantly higher percentage of premature responses than controls for trials with the 3 and 6 sec pre-cue delays (averaged across the 20 sessions on the task) (Figure 1A), and for session blocks 3 and 4 (averaged across pre-cue delay) (Figure 1B). Similar trends were seen for trials with a 9-sec pre-cue delay (Figure 1A) and for session block 2 (Figure 1B). The extent to which succimer treatment improved performance varied across conditions. Under some conditions (e.g., session blocks 2 and 3), the succimer treatment offered some benefit, as the performance of the High-Pb\u2013succimer group was intermediate to the control and High-Pb groups, not differing from either one (Figure 1B). In other conditions [e.g., pre-cue delays 3 and 6 (Figure 1A); session block 4 (Figure 1B)], no benefit was seen; that is, rats in the High-Pb\u2013succimer group committed a significantly higher percentage of premature responses than the controls and did not differ from the High-Pb group. Alcove latency (AL) is the time elapsed between the raising of the alcove door at trial onset and entry of the animal into the testing alcove. Because the data were highly skewed, with a high proportion of identical values (the minimum latency), the dependent measures used for each animal were the percentages of ALs that fell into each of four bins of latency values: < 0.1, 0.1\u20130.5, 0.6\u20131.0, and > 1 sec. A significant treatment \u00d7 session block interaction was found in the analysis of very short ALS [F(6, 52.2) = 3.24; p = 0.009]. As seen in Figure 2A, the percentage of very short ALs (< 0.1 sec) was significantly lower for the High-Pb rats than for controls specifically during the first block of sessions (p = 0.001), suggesting some hesitation to enter the testing alcove during this early portion of the task when all groups were performing very poorly. Succimer treatment was beneficial in that the High-Pb\u2013succimer rats did not exhibit this hesitancy in the first block of sessions: they did not differ from controls (p = 0.38) and differed significantly from the High-Pb group (p = 0.01). We defined response latency as the time between cue onset and a response. The data were log-transformed before analysis. Analysis of the High-Pb, High-Pb\u2013succimer, and control groups revealed significant interactions of treatment and delay [F(6, 2700) = 2.70; p = 0.013], and treatment, delay, and session block [F(18, 2700) = 1.85; p = 0.016]. The increased response latency seen early in the task for all animals (when error rate was very high) was more pronounced for the High-Pb rats than for the control and High-Pb\u2013succimer groups. This Pb effect was normalized by succimer treatment: the High-Pb\u2013succimer group was significantly faster than the High-Pb group during these early sessions and did not differ from controls (i.e., the same pattern seen for AL, described above). Analysis of premature response rate for the High-Pb, High-Pb\u2013succimer, and control groups revealed significant effects of treatment [F(2, 58.9) = 3.56; p = 0.035] and treatment \u00d7 delay [F(4, 114) = 2.81; p = 0.029]. The High-Pb group committed a higher percentage of premature responses than the controls for trials with a 3-sec (p = 0.001) or 6-sec (p = 0.05) pre-cue delay (Figure 1C). Succimer treatment did not improve this deficiency in inhibitory control; the High-Pb\u2013succimer group was significantly different from controls for the 3-sec (p = 0.001) and 6-sec (p = 0.02) delays and was not different from the High-Pb group for either. An omission error was tallied when a rat entered the testing alcove but failed to respond within 15 sec of trial onset, indicative of missing the cue. The analysis of percent omission errors for the High-Pb, High-Pb\u2013succimer, and control groups revealed the following significant treatment-related effects: treatment \u00d7 trial block [F(4, 107) = 2.91; p = 0.025], treatment \u00d7 trial block \u00d7 cue duration [F(12, 872) = 1.75; p = 0.05], and treatment \u00d7 trial block \u00d7 previous trial outcome (Prev) [F(4, 892) = 6.63; p < 0.0001]. For all groups, we found an increase in percent omission errors across each session, an effect that was most pronounced for trials that followed an error. As shown in Figure 2B, for trials following an error, the rate of increase in omission errors across each session was greater for the High-Pb rats than for controls. This impairment was abolished by succimer treatment: The High-Pb\u2013succimer group was significantly different from the High-Pb-group and did not differ from controls. The significant interaction of treatment, trial block, and cue duration [F(12, 872) = 1.75; p = 0.05] reflected that a) the High-Pb rats committed a borderline greater percent omission errors than controls in the first block of trials in each session (p = 0.06), and b) during this first block of trials in each session (trials 1\u201366), the High-Pb group benefited less than controls by the lengthening of the cue from 200 to 700 msec (p = 0.009), such that group differences were greatest on trials with the longest cue duration (p = 0.01, for 700 msec cue; Figure 1D). Succimer treatment provided some benefit, as the High-Pb\u2013succimer group did not differ significantly from controls in this regard; however, they also did not differ significantly from the High-Pb group. Additional details of the omission error analyses are provided in the Supplemental Material available online (http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf). Analysis of average percent errors for the first six sessions on the task revealed a significant main effect of treatment group (F(2, 78.1) = 4.88; p = 0.01) and a significant interaction of treatment and session [F(10, 159) = 1.93; p = 0.04]. The Mod-Pb group learned significantly more slowly than controls (main effect contrast, p = 0.004). Chelation offered a significant benefit in that the Mod-Pb\u2013succimer group learned significantly faster than the Mod-Pb group (main effect contrast, p = 0.03) and did not differ from controls for any session. The three groups performed similarly by the sixth session, indicating that the observed group differences in performance reflected variations in learning ability (Figure 3A). The analysis of percent premature responses revealed a significant interaction of treatment and session block [F(6, 58.9) = 2.89; p = 0.016]. As depicted in Figure 3B, the Mod-Pb group mastered the new rule (i.e., that the light cue was presented after a delay on some trials) more slowly than controls (p = 0.05), and succimer treatment offered a significant benefit (Mod-Pb vs. Mod-Pb\u2013succimer, session block 1, p = 0.006). The Mod-Pb\u2013succimer and control groups did not differ for any session. The performance of the three groups did not differ during the final 10 sessions on the task (blocks 3 and 4), indicating that the observed performance differences reflected differing learning ability. Analysis of average percent errors for the first six sessions on the task revealed that the succimer-only group (treated with succimer in the absence of lead exposure) learned significantly more slowly than the controls [Figure 4A; treatment (F(1, 57) = 4.21; p = 0.04); treatment \u00d7 session (F(5, 99.4) = 2.20; p = 0.06)]. The percentage of inaccurate responses (responses made after cue onset, but to an incorrect port) was significantly higher for the succimer-only group than for controls during session blocks 2, 3, and 4 [Figure 4B; treatment, (F(1, 141) = 4.42; p = 0.042); treatment \u00d7 session block (F(3, 1729) = 2.64; p = 0.048)]. The groups did not differ significantly for this type of error during session block 1 (sessions 1\u20135), an early point in the learning process when most responses were made before cue onset (premature responses). The analysis of omission errors for the control and succimer-only groups revealed significant interactions of treatment and cue duration [F(2, 587) = 4.47; p = 0.012] and of treatment, cue duration, and trial block [F(8, 587) = 1.99; p = 0.045]. As shown in Figure 4C, the succimer-only group benefited less than controls by the lengthening of the cue from 200 to 700 msec (p = 0.004). This pattern was seen only during the beginning and end of each daily session (contrasts for slopes across cue duration, p = 0.002 and 0.037 for first and third trial blocks, respectively). The succimer-only group benefited less than controls from the lengthening of the cue, resulting in increasing group differences in percent inaccurate responses as the cue duration increased [F(2, 1292) = 15.95; p < 0.0001]. Because the timing of the distractor relative to cue onset (1 or 2 sec) did not alter the treatment-related effects, we used a two-level variable for distraction condition for the analyses: distractor or no distractor. The analysis of percent inaccurate responses for the succimer-only and control groups revealed a main effect of treatment group [F(1, 38.1) = 6.18; p = 0.017], an interaction of treatment and cue duration [F(1, 216) = 11.25; p = 0.0009], and a trend toward a three-way interaction of treatment, distraction condition, and the outcome of the previous trial [F(1, 387) = 3.06, p = 0.08]. The succimer-only group benefited less by the lengthening of the cue than did controls (Figure 5C). In addition, although the succimer-only group committed a higher percentage of inaccurate responses overall (p = 0.017), group differences were greatest for trials that both included a distractor and that followed an error (Figure 5A,B). However, there was also a tendency for the groups to differ on non-distraction trials (p = 0.10; Figure 5A). To assess whether the trend toward poorer performance of the succimer-only group on the nondistraction trials reflected generalized disruption caused by the unpredictable presentation of the olfactory distractors, an analysis was conducted to directly compare performance on the nondistraction trials with that of the preceding baseline task. All trials in this latter task were identical to the nondistraction trials of the selective attention task (i.e., pre-cue delays, cue durations, etc.). For the succimer-only group, the percentage of inaccurate responses was significantly higher for the non-distraction trials of the selective attention task than during the baseline task (p = 0.0001), whereas for controls, the rates were similar for these two conditions (p = 0.16; Figure 5D). This analysis supports the inference that for the succimer-only group, the unpredictable presentation of the olfactory distractors produced a generalized disruption in performance that extended beyond the distraction trials. Motivation was assessed by analyzing the average rate of response trials [number of response trials per session divided by session length (minutes)]. No significant group differences were detected (all p > 0.2), providing evidence that motivational differences did not account for the observed differences in performance (for further discussion, see Supplemental Material available online at http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf). Analysis of mean blood Pb levels on PND52 revealed dose-dependent effects on both blood and brain Pb levels and a beneficial effect of succimer chelation for both Pb exposure conditions for both tissues (Table 1). The High-Pb and High-Pb\u2013succimer groups weighed \u22486% less than the control group (p < 0.05), measured on PND52 after cessation of succimer treatment. None of the other groups differed from controls. The slightly smaller size of the High-Pb rats likely reflects a decrease in growth hormone during the Pb exposure period. Low-level Pb exposure in children has also been associated with small but statistically significant reductions in height, in the absence of any other signs of overt toxicity. A short period of early Pb exposure produced impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in children with low to moderate elevations in blood Pb levels. As in children, these impairments were lasting; that is, they were apparent long past the period of Pb exposure, indicative of lasting neurologic dysfunction as a result of the early exposure. The pervasiveness of the impairment was related to the intensity of Pb exposure; for the Mod-Pb group, dysfunction was limited to learning ability, whereas the High-Pb group exhibited impairments in learning, inhibitory control, arousal regulation, and attention. Importantly, succimer treatment significantly alleviated some Pb-induced neurobehavioral deficits, although the magnitude of the benefit varied as a function of both the level of the Pb exposure and the specific area of dysfunction. In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting cognitive and affective dysfunction, similar in magnitude and pervasiveness to that produced by the High-Pb exposure regimen. The basis for each of these conclusions is provided below and summarized in Table 2. Both the High-Pb and Mod-Pb groups learned the basic rules of the visual discrimination task and attention task 1 more slowly than the controls, indicating lasting impairment in associative ability as a result of a short period of early Pb exposure, as previously reported. Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed animals improved learning rate, although the degree of benefit was greater for the Mod-Pb group than for the High-Pb group. Succimer treatment significantly improved the learning rate of the rats in the Mod-Pb group for both the initial visual discrimination task and attention task 1; in both tasks, the Mod-Pb\u2013succimer group learned significantly faster than the Mod-Pb group and did not differ significantly from the controls. For the High-Pb exposure regimen, succimer treatment did not improve learning rate in the visual discrimination task, but a small benefit was seen in attention task 1. It is likely that more prolonged succimer treatment would have produced an even greater cognitive benefit for these more heavily exposed animals. This suggestion is based on the facts that a) reductions in brain Pb levels lag significantly behind reductions in blood Pb following chelation or cessation of Pb exposure; b) blood and brain Pb levels were still quite elevated in the High-Pb group at the end of chelation (approximately equal to the nonchelated Mod-Pb rats); and c) in a previous study from our laboratory, a second 3-week succimer regimen offered significant benefit over one regimen in terms of both blood and brain Pb reductions. Therefore, these results likely underestimate the potential benefit of succimer treatment for the more heavily Pb-exposed animals. For the four tasks presented here, the rate of all types of errors was significantly greater on trials that followed an error than on trials following a correct response. Similarly, the latency to enter the testing alcove at trial onset was significantly longer on trials following an error than on trials that followed a correct response, a pattern also seen for the latency to make a response after cue onset. The disruption produced by committing an error was significantly greater for the High-Pb animals than for controls for several dependent measures: In the sustained attention task, the percentage of omission errors was significantly higher for the High-Pb group than for controls during mid- to late-session trials following an error\u2014but not following a correct response\u2014a pattern that indicates the combined influences of the disruptive effects of committing an error and the changing motivational and attentional state of the animals across each session. Similarly, in attention task 1, the High-Pb rats took significantly longer to enter the testing alcove and to make a response than controls, but only early in the task when error rate was very high and the rats had not yet learned the task rules. Finally, the drop in performance on trials following an error was also more pronounced for the High-Pb rats than for controls in a conditional olfactory discrimination task with periodic reward omission, an additional task administered subsequently to these rats. The interpretation of the heightened sensitivity to errors of the High-Pb rats is informed by previous studies that examined performance changes as a function of an error on the previous trial, all involving human subjects. In some of these studies, the error rate on post-error trials was exceptionally low, indicating the operation of an executive error-correction system localized to the anterior cingulate cortex. However, the finding consistently seen in our rodent studies\u2014increased error rate on trials following an error (reviewed by Strupp and Beaudin 2006)\u2014has also been reported in some human studies and likely reflects an emotional response to the error. This interpretation is supported by the finding that an electrophysiologic marker of error detection, termed error-related negativity, varies as a function of individual differences in negative affect and emotionality. Importantly, this heightened disruption following an error was very responsive to succimer treatment: In all cases, the High-Pb\u2013succimer group was indistinguishable from controls. These results provide encouragement that Pb-induced dysfunction in the area of arousal or emotion regulation can be significantly alleviated by succimer treatment. This type of dysfunction may be an important contributor of the behavioral problems and increased delinquency rates seen in Pb-exposed children and adolescents, based on evidence that individuals vulnerable to faulty regulation of negative emotion are at risk for violence and aggression. The sustained attention task revealed two types of attentional dysfunction in the High-Pb group. First, the early-session increase in omission errors (relative to mid-session), seen for all groups across all sessions on this task, was more pronounced for the High-Pb group than for the controls, with group differences being largest for trials with the longest cue duration (700 msec). This pattern of results may indicate that lapses in attention were more common for the High-Pb rats than for controls during this early part of the session. More frequent attentional lapses in the High-Pb group would have the consequence of flattening the slope across cue duration and making group differences largest on trials for which performance of the controls was best (i.e., those with the longest cues). One interpretation of this pattern is that early Pb exposure may impair the ability to rapidly engage in a new task when transitioning between activities, manifested here as an increased tendency to miss the cue (an attentional deficit). A second type of attentional dysfunction observed in the High-Pb rats was evident later in each testing session. The incidence of omission errors increased for all groups across each daily testing session, the classic pattern seen when sustained attention is taxed (Parasuraman and Warm 1998). However, as discussed above, the High-Pb rats committed a significantly higher percentage of omission errors than controls during mid- to late-session trials, specifically on trials that followed an error. This pattern of effects, coupled with the similar pattern seen in the omission of reward task administered subsequently to these same animals, indicates that as attention and motivation waned across the session, the disruptive effect of an error on attention and persistence increased, and that this disruption was more pronounced for the Pb-exposed rats than for controls. The effectiveness of succimer chelation varied for these different types of attentional deficits. As discussed above, the heightened attentional disruption seen in the High-Pb rats following an error was completely normalized by succimer treatment, as the chelated High-Pb rats differed significantly from the High-Pb group and did not differ from controls. In contrast, succimer treatment only partially alleviated the attentional lapses seen early in each test session; the High-Pb\u2013succimer group was intermediate to the other two, not differing from either. In the sustained attention task, the percentage of premature responses was significantly higher for the High-Pb rats than for controls, indicating deficient inhibitory control. Converging evidence for this area of dysfunction was provided by the higher percentage of premature responses committed by the High-Pb rats in the final block of trials of attention task 1, a point at which the basic rules of the task had already been learned. Succimer treatment was ineffective in alleviating this area of dysfunction: In both instances, the percentage of premature responses for the High-Pb\u2013succimer rats was significantly greater than that of the control rats, and not different from the High-Pb group. The efficacy of the succimer treatment varied as a function of both the level of Pb exposure and the specific functional domain tested. Interestingly, the pattern seen for succimer efficacy parallels the apparent sensitivity of specific functional domains to the Pb exposure. Learning was impaired by both Pb exposure regimens, whereas impaired regulation of arousal or emotion was seen only in the High-Pb group, suggesting that disruption in learning occurs at lower exposures than dysregulation of arousal or emotion. The efficacy of succimer across these domains corresponded to the degree to which chelation reduced brain Pb levels in the two Pb exposure groups. For the Mod-Pb group, succimer treatment almost completely removed Pb from the brain and effectively alleviated the learning dysfunction. In contrast, brain Pb levels were still moderately elevated in the High-Pb group following chelation; these chelated High-Pb rats exhibited the same pattern of dysfunction as the unchelated Mod-Pb group, which also had moderately elevated brain Pb levels on PND52. Both groups also exhibited impaired learning but not affective dysfunction. This constellation of findings suggests that succimer treatment of the High-Pb rats reduced tissue (i.e., brain) Pb levels below that which produces lasting impairment in emotion regulation, but not enough to alleviate the learning dysfunction. The mechanistic basis for this pattern of effects is unknown, but likely reflects complex interactions between the timing of the Pb exposure and succimer treatment relative to the ontogenetic stage of specific neural systems, the extent to which succimer treatment reduced Pb levels in specific neural systems, and the inherent sensitivity of those developmental processes and/or associated functional domains to Pb exposure. The present study also revealed the unexpected finding that a single 3-week course of succimer treatment during early development produced lasting dysfunction in cognition and arousal regulation in rats not previously exposed to Pb. Note that these four behavioral tests were administered across a 7-month period following cessation of succimer treatment, suggesting lasting brain changes. These results corroborate preliminary results from a similar study in nonhuman primates (Laughlin 2001). The succimer-only group learned the initial visual discrimination task more slowly than the controls. They also committed a higher rate of inaccurate responses than controls in attention task 1, indicative of attentional dysfunction. In both the sustained attention task and the selective attention task, their performance benefited less by the lengthening of the visual cue than did the controls, indicative of lapses in attention, as discussed above. Additionally, in the selective attention task, the succimer-only group committed a higher rate of inaccurate responses than controls, an effect that was most pronounced for trials on which a distractor was presented and that followed an error, indicating impairments in both selective attention and arousal regulation. Finally, a comparison of performance on trials without distractors (during the selective attention task) to performance on the baseline task revealed that the succimer-only rats experienced a generalized disruption of performance in the selective attention task that extended beyond the trials on which a distractor was presented. This finding, too, implicates impaired arousal regulation in the succimer-only group. These various impairments were similar in magnitude to those produced by the High-Pb exposure. The mechanism(s) responsible for these adverse succimer effects is not known. One possibility is that succimer, a metal-chelating agent, altered essential metal homeostasis and increased metal diuresis, as has been suggested by a number of clinical and nonhuman primate studies. Both Pb-exposed groups exhibited low blood Pb levels (\u224825\u201335 \u03bcg/dL) during the first 3 weeks of the 4-week exposure period. During the fourth and final week of exposure, both groups experienced an increase in tissue Pb levels because of the direct ingestion of Pb-adulterated water. Although the blood Pb levels produced during this final week of exposure were higher than commonly reported for children (see Supplemental materials available online at http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2006/9263/suppl.pdf), direct comparison of blood Pb levels across species should be cautioned. The available evidence indicates that the blood Pb levels required to produce overt toxicity (i.e., malaise, coma, convulsions, death) or lasting neurobehavioral effects (i.e., effects that last beyond the period of exposure) are higher in both rats and nonhuman primates than in humans. Consistent with these earlier studies, none of the animals in the present study exhibited any signs of overt toxicity throughout the study and could not be distinguished from controls throughout the 8 months of daily handling. The Mod-Pb group exhibited very circumscribed and subtle behavioral/cognitive effects, and the High-Pb group exhibited subtle, although more widespread, neurobehavioral effects. As such, the regimens used in the present study may be viewed as modeling subclinical or asymptomatic Pb exposure. Similarly, although the succimer regimen used in the present study closely modeled the duration and dose (weight-normalized) of the regimens used clinically in children, it is possible that it was more \u201caggressive\u201d than the clinical regimen, when allometrically scaled across species. The present study provides clear evidence that administration of succimer, using a regimen sufficient to reduce brain Pb levels, can lessen Pb-induced impairments in learning ability, attention, and regulation of arousal and/or emotion. These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits caused by Pb exposure. The primary area of dysfunction seen in the Mod-Pb rats, impaired learning ability, was significantly alleviated by succimer treatment. For the High-Pb group, treatment with succimer provided a robust benefit on measures indicative of impaired regulation of arousal or affect\u2014one of the most pervasive areas of impairment seen in this group, and a major cause of their impaired performance overall. However, for the High-Pb group, succimer produced only a slight improvement in learning ability and did not lessen the deficient inhibitory control. The High-Pb rats treated with succimer performed similarly to non-chelated Mod-Pb rats\u2014consistent with their comparable brain Pb levels\u2014suggesting that a more prolonged treatment may have further improved performance in the High-Pb exposed animals. These findings are consistent with previous animal studies but contrast with the results of the Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children (TLC) study, the one clinical trial in Pb-exposed children that included cognitive outcomes. There are several possible reasons for this disparity in outcomes. First, the succimer treatment protocol used in the TLC trial may not have achieved a sufficient reduction in brain Pb levels to improve cognitive functioning. This suggestion is based on the evidence that a) succimer-induced reductions in blood Pb overestimate reductions in brain lead and b) the succimer treatment protocol used in the TLC study achieved relatively modest group differences in blood Pb levels (relative to placebo), averaging only 4.5 \u03bcg/dL over the 6 months following treatment. In comparison, in the present study both blood and brain Pb levels were substantially reduced by succimer, relative to the vehicle treatment (Table 1). Second, the disparate outcomes of the TLC trial and the present study may also reflect differences in the nature of the cognitive tasks that were used. In particular, the tasks used here (relative to those in the TLC trial) may have provided more specific indices of the two functional domains most improved by succimer in the present study: associative learning ability and regulation of arousal and/or emotion (indexed by reactivity to errors). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that it is possible for chelation therapy to alleviate certain types of Pb-induced behavioral/cognitive dysfunction in rats. This is an important demonstration because Pb-induced behavioral dysfunction is generally considered to be irreversible. The present findings thus suggest that if a succimer treatment protocol that produced a substantial removal of Pb from the brain could be identified for humans, a functional benefit might be derived. In addition, the finding that succimer produced lasting adverse effects when administered to non-Pb\u2013exposed rats highlights the potential risks of administering succimer or other metal chelating agents to children who do not have elevated tissue Pb levels. It is of significant concern that this type of therapy is being widely advocated as safe and effective for treating autism.

Twenty-one had Alpers syndrome, the commonest severe POLG1 autosomal recessive phenotype, comprising hepatoencephalopathy and often mtDNA depletion. The cellular mtDNA content reflected the genotype more closely than did clinical features. Patients with tissue depletion of mtDNA all had at least one allele with either a missense mutation in a catalytic domain or a nonsense mutation. Four out of 12 patients exhibited a progressive, mosaic pattern of mtDNA depletion in cultured fibroblasts. All these patients had mutations in a catalytic domain in both POLG1 alleles, in either the polymerase or exonuclease domain or both. The tissue mtDNA content of patients who had two linker mutations was normal, and their phenotypes the mildest. Epilepsy and/or movement disorder were major features in all 21. Previous studies have implicated replication stalling as a mechanism for mtDNA depletion. The mosaic cellular depletion that we have demonstrated in cell cultures may be a manifestation of severe replication stalling. One patient with a severe cellular and clinical phenotype was a compound heterozygote with POLG1 mutations in the polymerase and exonuclease domain intrans. This suggests that POLG1 requires both polymerase and 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity in the same molecule. This is consistent with current functional models for eukaryotic DNA polymerases, which alternate between polymerizing and editing modes, as determined by competition between these two active sites for the 3\u2032 end of the DNA.\n", "fulltext": "First described in 1991, mtDNA depletion is the central feature of a group of disorders, collectively termed mtDNA depletion syndromes (MDS) (1,2). The characteristic mtDNA finding in these disorders is a quantitative reduction in the mtDNA content of affected tissues, but there may also be low levels of heteroplasmy for point mutations (3). Defects in mtDNA maintenance have been hard to study as the mtDNA defects are only evident in primary fibroblast cultures (4) from a minority of patients and are rarely described in other primary lines (5). Unlike mtDNA mutations, the pattern of inheritance of MDS is autosomal recessive. Furthermore, mtDNA content and OXPHOS activity was restored in cybrids generated from the fusion of mtDNA-free (\u03c1\u00b0) cells with enucleated fibroblasts from MDS patients (6), implying an underlying nuclear defect.Previous investigators have classified MDS into two main groups, consisting of a hepatocerebral form and a myopathic form (7,8). In both groups several tissues may be affected (9). Genes involved in the hepatocerebral form include POLG1 (10), deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) (11), the human ortholog of the mouse kidney disease gene MPV17 (12), the mitochondrial helicase/primase, TWINKLE (13) and the alpha subunit of Succinyl-CoA Synthase (SUCLG1) (14). MDS without hepatic involvement is associated with myopathy and/or encephalopathy. Mutations have been identified in genes encoding the mitochondrial thymidine kinase (TK2) (11), the beta subunit of ADP-Forming Succinyl-CoA Synthase (SUCLA2) (15), the P53 dependent subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2B) (16) and thymidine phosphorylase (or TP, associated with MyoNeuroGastroIntestinal Encephalomyopathy or MNGIE) (17). Myopathic MDS may present as the so-called \u2018benign\u2019 later-onset mtDNA depletion (18).By far the commonest gene defects identified in autosomal recessive mtDNA depletion are POLG1 mutations. POLG1 is the gene encoding the 195 kDa catalytic (alpha) subunit of the mitochondrial (gamma) DNA polymerase, located on chromosome 15q25. Three polymerase domains (exons 17\u201322) are separated from 3 exonuclease domains (exons 2\u20138) by a linker region (residues 418\u2013755) that interacts with the beta subunit. Mutations in POLG1 are associated with a range of different phenotypes (19). These include both dominant and recessive chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia, mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (20) and recessive, severe, early onset Alpers syndrome (10). While some authors distinguish between Alpers syndrome, characterized by refractory seizures, deafness, cortical blindness, episodic psychomotor regression, and Alpers\u2013Huttenlocher syndrome in which liver disease is also a major feature (21), such a subdivision requires detailed data. Alpers syndrome is marked by a progressive deterioration, most patients dying in infancy but a few surviving into their teens (22). POLG1 genotype:phenotype correlations in both Alpers and mtDNA depletion have been disappointing (19). We sought to develop these using accurate quantitation of tissue mtDNA content and cellular depletion phenotype.We investigated 24 children in whom we had identified POLG gene mutation(s). These patients were referred with childhood onset of symptoms that were suggestive of POLG1 mutations, such as Alpers syndrome, or because we had previously identified mtDNA depletion or multiple DNA deletions. Features of the 24 patients with POLG1 mutations are summarized in Table\u00a01. Age ranged from 0 to 17 years and 9/10 patients with mtDNA depletion in liver or muscle were male.Sequence analysis of the POLG1 gene revealed two mutant alleles in all of the patients with Alpers disease consistent with recessive inheritance. Three individuals had a largely neurological presentation that clearly fell outside the accepted criteria for Alpers disease, but the remainder all had encephalopathy. Seventeen out of the remaining 23 (74%) had a variable degree of liver dysfunction, from mild to liver failure requiring transplant. Of the 20 out of 21 individuals with probable Alpers syndrome where clinical information was available, all had epilepsy, which was intractable (epilepsia partialis continua) in four. One teenage patient died only 2 years after presentation, ending with 5 months of continuous seizure activity. Epilepsy was treated with sodium valproate in four out of the 11 where we had information about anticonvulsant therapy, and in one case this was followed by deterioration and death within 3 months. Movement disorders (choreoathetosis, ataxia and ataxic nystagmus) and epilepsia partialias continua were common features. None of the patients had survived to their 19th birthday, the median age at death being 1 year (7 months to 18 years).The mtDNA content of liver was low in all cases where it was available, but was variable in muscle (22\u2013117%). All of the patients with mtDNA depletion in liver and/or muscle had at least one missense or nonsense mutation in a catalytic domain, either at least one mutation in the polymerase domain or two mutations in the exonuclease domain.Fibroblast cultures were available for 10/24 of the patients for visualizing mtDNA using PicoGreen fluorescence microscopy. PicoGreen can quantitatively stain mtDNA (23), which in vivo is arranged into punctate DNA/protein structures termed nucleoids, which consist of several mtDNA genomes complexed to nucleoid proteins like POLG. In normal control cells, PicoGreen stains numerous nucleoids that are of comparable fluorescence intensity in different cells and between different individuals. However, some of the patient fibroblast cultures, such as that from patient A (Fig.\u00a01) showed mosaic depletion, in that many cells showed greatly reduced nucleoid staining, suggesting mtDNA depletion, which was most noticeable at later cell passages (approximately 2\u20133 months continuous culture). This was evident in cultured cells derived from four individuals (patients A\u2013D Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a01). In all cases nuclear staining was unaffected, although cytoplasmic background fluorescence was often increased. These patients with mosaic depletion within their cultured fibroblasts all had severe clinical phenotypes, all being dead by the age of 16 months. Of these, patient A had much the highest proportion of depleted cells, and this was probably a later passage than cultures B\u2013D. The mosaic distribution of mtDNA depletion was also apparent at low cell passage number (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1), where occasional mtDNA-free (rho zero) cells were present (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1), interspersed with cells with apparently normal or near normal mtDNA levels. Cultures A\u2013C were grown until at least passage 20, and the proportion of depleted cells increased with successive passage (compare Fig.\u00a01 with Supplementary Material, Fig. S1), so that by 45 days the majority of cells were depleted (Fig.\u00a02A). This was reflected by a reduced minimum fibroblast mtDNA content by Q-PCR (Table\u00a01) in cells from patients A\u2013D (average 23%), but at baseline patient D had infrequent depleted cells and much higher mtDNA content (97%, relative to control fibroblast cultures 39\u2013193%). There was no consistent change in mtDNA content in any of the fibroblast cultures from controls (Fig.\u00a02), from patients with other types of mitochondrial disease or from POLG1 patients who were not mosaic for depleted cells (patients G\u2013J). However, in two cell cultures (E and F), occasional depleted cells were apparent (24,25), particularly as the cultures became senescent, but this was not a consistent, progressive feature. Thus the mosaic cellular distribution of mtDNA in fibroblast cultures A\u2013D was characteristic, differing from all other fibroblasts examined and marking them out as a distinctive subgroup.The mtDNA content of liver was marginally lower in the mosaic patients A\u2013D (average 5%, range 4\u20137%) than the other patients (average 19%, range 5\u201332%), but this was not significant (P = 0.09). Muscle mtDNA content was also somewhat reduced (average 27%, range 22\u201332%) but this was not significantly less than the rest of the patients. Muscle mtDNA was normal in the patients with only linker mutations (26), mtDNA content being significantly higher in these than the other patients (average 93 and 34% respectively, P = 0.001) with earlier onset Alpers disease (average age 16 and 1 year, respectively, P < 0.001).The reduction in mtDNA content was assessed by quantitative analysis of digital images, which showed that while the number of nucleoids detectable by PicoGreen significantly declined with time (Fig.\u00a02B, P < 0.001 and <0.01 for early and late time points for patients B and C, respectively), the distribution of their intensities barely changing (Fig.\u00a02C). That is, nucleoid numbers were reduced (Fig.\u00a02B) but no less intense (Fig.\u00a02C) in depleted cells in the mosaic patients.We further studied the mosaic mtDNA depletion in cultured cells from patients A\u2013C, using a battery of in situ approaches.Immuno-fluorescence with antibodies against anti-DNA, which detect mtDNA nucleoids as small cytoplasmic dots confirmed the presence of numerous cells within cultures A\u2013C with mosaic and severe mtDNA depletion, which were not observed in any of the controls (Fig.\u00a03A, top panels). Mitotracker co-labelling indicated many of these depleted cells also exhibited reduced Mitotracker labelling. As Mitotracker specifically labels mitochondria according to their membrane potential, a reduced Mitotracker labelling indicates these mtDNA depleted cells also manifested reduced membrane potential. Similar results were observed with anti-bodies to mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a nucleoid protein reduced by loss of mtDNA, which showed that numerous cells within cultures A\u2013C exhibited reduced TFAM expression (Fig.\u00a03Af\u2013h), unlike the homogenous labelling of controls (Fig.\u00a03Ae and Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A). Mitotracker co-labelling showed many of the TFAM reduced cells also contained reduced Mitotracker labelling. Interestingly, some mitochondria within anti-DNA/TFAM depleted cells retained Mitotracker labelling, and these invariably co-localized with residual anti-DNA/TFAM expression (arrowed, Fig.\u00a03Ad and Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). Bromodeoxyurudine (BrdU) labelling of newly synthesized DNA within cultures A\u2013C (Fig.\u00a03Aj\u2013l) showed markedly reduced mtDNA replication compared with controls (Fig.\u00a03Ai), with fewer nucleoids incorporating BrdU and a weaker nucleoid labelling. Nuclear BrdU labelling was unaffected. Again, cells with profoundly reduced BrdU also often showed markedly reduced Mitotracker signals (data not shown). A number of patient cells showed a near absence of mtDNA replication (see asterisks in Fig.\u00a03Ak and l).We next examined the cellular expression of the mtDNA encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI, Fig.\u00a03B). COXI immunolabelling showed mosaic COXI expression in cultures A\u2013C, with numerous cells exhibiting reduced COXI, unlike the homogenous expression of controls (Fig.\u00a03Ba\u2013d). Global COXI expression was reduced in cultures A and B (data not shown). COXI reduced cells again often showed substantially reduced Mitotracker labelling, although individual polarized mitochondria often co-localized with residual COXI expression (arrowed, Supplementary Material, Fig. S3B). A reduced cytochrome c oxidase (COX) relative to nuclear encoded succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity was detected in many cells within cultures A\u2013C (Fig.\u00a03Be\u2013l).Finally, to confirm that TFAM, anti-DNA, COXI, BrdU reduced cells within cultures A\u2013D correlated to the PicoGreen reduced cells, we co-labelled these cells with PicoGreen and tetramethyl-rhodamine-methyl ester (TMRM), a dye similar to Mitotracker in that it is absorbed into mitochondria according to mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig.\u00a03C). Many PicoGreen depleted cells were found to have depolarized mitochondria (Fig.\u00a03C, arrowed).We have found that mtDNA depletion of tissues and cultured fibroblasts from patients with POLG1 mutations is associated particularly with mutations in catalytic domains. We have identified mosaic mtDNA depletion of mtDNA in primary fibroblast cultures from some patients with Alpers disease. In patients A\u2013C, mtDNA was depleted in cells with reduced COX activity. These cells also had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting that the depletion and not the point mutations underlie the major part of the respiratory chain defect in fibroblasts from these POLG1 patients (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). In all cases, cellular mosaic depletion was associated with two mutations in catalytic regions of POLG1, either in the polymerase or exonuclease domain or in one of each. The mtDNA depletion manifested primarily as a reduced number of nucleoids in the depleted cells and reflected the severity of the clinical and tissue phenotypes. The cellular mtDNA content may be an indicator of the underlying molecular mechanism that links genotype to phenotype. These data from a human disease suggest that eukaryotic DNA polymerases require both polymerase and 3\u2032\u20135\u2032exonuclease activities within the same molecule.Previous studies of human POLG1 mutations have found little in the way of clear genotype\u2013phenotype correlations, and these may have been more apparent in the present study as it has been possible to link a range of clinical phenotypes with laboratory data that included both tissue mtDNA content and cellular phenotypes. Our clinical findings were similar to previous studies, confirming that epilepsy and movement disorders (27) are major features of POLG1 syndromes. Relatively complete information was available for the four patients who manifested mosaic mtDNA depletion, whereas the clinical data available on the other patients was largely retrospective, hence dependent on the local neurologist. We found that the cellular phenotype correlated better with the location of the mutation and the severity of the tissue depletion than with specific clinical features. Nevertheless, mosaic mtDNA depletion was evident in fibroblast cultures from only the most severely affected children, all of whom had died before the age of 16 months. Patient D had two mutations, R232G and T251I, in the exonuclease domain, the latter being in cis with the P587L linker mutation. The P587L mutation usually co-segregates with T251I, but has occurred with 251T in a patient with a relatively mild phenotype (28). While this suggests that P587L is mildly pathogenic, T251I may exacerbate its effect. Patient M was homozygous for the L304R exonuclease mutation and had a relatively mild phenotype, but neither liver nor fibroblasts were available for study. In contrast to the patients with two catalytic mutations, no patient who only had missense linker mutations was dead by 16 months or had mosaic cellular or tissue mtDNA depletion.Depletion of mtDNA was present in liver in all cases where it was available for measurement, but was much less consistent than in muscle. All patients with hepatic mtDNA depletion had at least one catalytic mutation, whereas patients with purely linker mutations had little in the way of liver features. These were usually missense mutations, but one patient had a nonsense mutation in the polymerase domain resulting in mono-allelic expression (21,24). We found cellular mtDNA depletion only in individuals with clear tissue depletion (Table\u00a02). The severity of the depletion was commensurate with the severity of the defect in replication that we have seen, and this is supported by the published literature (29). These genotype\u2013phenotype correlations may not have been seen in some previous studies because the diagnosis of mtDNA depletion syndrome is frequently imprecise. This is for both technical reasons (25) and because of the lack of established age-adjusted normal ranges, and may explain some of the inconsistencies in the published literature. However, age-related changes in mtDNA content are undoubtedly also a feature of mtDNA depletion (18,25,30,31). Furthermore, it is clear that the effect of specific mutations may be modulated by other missense mutations in cis (32,33).An important aspect of this study is the use of PicoGreen to visualize mtDNA packaged into nucleoids. While PicoGreen is less sensitive that antiDNA antibodies and does not detect nucleoids containing the lowest levels of mtDNA, it can be used more quantitatively than antiDNA antibodies, being sensitive to the nucleoid DNA content (23). With this method, it could be shown that both the number of nucleoids and the average mtDNA content in individual cells declined with time in fibroblast cultures from the patients with the mosaic cellular depletion phenotype (Fig.\u00a02). During this decline, the distribution of nucleoid intensities remained similar within the range where the PicoGreen signal is quantitative (23). This might indicate that the balance between nucleoid fusion and division depends more on the mtDNA content of the nucleoid than the number of nucleoids in the cell. It may also explain our observation that occasional mitochondria within TFAM depleted cells retained Mitotracker labelling (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Occasional nucleoids of relatively normal mtDNA content in cells that are profoundly depleted of mtDNA may underlie the co-localization of Mitotracker and residual TFAM signal.Like many replicases, POLG1 has a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 nuclease activity that is used to excise incorrectly paired bases. Mutations in this domain have been seen in both childhood and adult onset POLG1 disease. In the mutator mouse model, POLG1 with deficient exonuclease activity impairs both polymerase fidelity and shortens lifespan (34,\u201336). By analogy with other DNA polymerases, the enzyme probably alternates between polymerizing and editing modes, as determined by competition between the two active sites for the 3\u2032 primer end of the DNA (37). Once the correct base has been incorporated, the enzyme moves forward 1 bp further, ready for the next precursor nucleotide to enter. Patient B, who is a compound heterozygote with one mutation in the polymerase and one in the exonuclease domain, has a severe cellular and clinical phenotype, comparable with patients A, C and D, who either have two polymerase (patients A and C) or two exonuclease mutations (patient D). The apparent lack of complementation between the POLG1 mutations in patient B supports the molecular model, by suggesting that normal mtDNA replication requires both polymerase and exonuclease activity within the same alpha subunit.Previous studies of patients with POLG1 mutations have found limited correlation between phenotype and genotype (38\u201340). Horvath et al. (38) reported that patients with Alpers disease generally had at least one catalytic mutation, most commonly in the polymerase domain, and that patients whose mutations both lay in the linker domain presented later. Bindoff and coworkers (27) studied 26 individuals with two common linker mutations, A467T and W748S. The A467T mutation influences the interaction of POLG1 with POLG2 and the W748S mutation reduces both processivity and DNA binding. These authors found major differences in survival depending on genotype, with compound heterozygotes having a significantly shorter survival time than patients homozygous either for the A467T or W748S mutations. As the active form of POLG is known to be a compound heterotrimer containing one alpha and two beta subunits, this suggests a quaternary interaction between catalytic subunits in different heterotrimers. While our data set is much too small to draw parallel inferences, we saw nothing to suggest quaternary interactions between polymerase domains. Patient C, who was homozygous for the R1096C mutation, had a comparable cellular and clinical phenotype to patient A, who was a compound heterozygote for this mutation and T914P.Six of the other POLG1 mutations we identified have not been reported previously. These comprise one nonsense mutation (R374X), one 10 amino acid deletion (W347_L356del), three simple missense mutations (H277L, R417T, H569Q) and one allele with two missense mutations (P587L;P589L). While P589L is novel, it is in cis with P587L which has been reported as a recessive mutation. H277L, R417T and H569Q are all within nine amino acids of previously reported recessive mutations and alter residues that are highly conserved across mammalian species. In addition, R417T may lead to aberrant splicing as the last nucleotide of exon 6 is mutated (1250G>C).Wanrooij et al. (41) used two dimensional DNA analysis to show that cells, over-expressing POLG1 or TWINKLE containing catalytic defects, have both cellular depletion of mtDNA and replisome stalling. In some of their cell lines, the mtDNA depletion was apparent as reduced numbers of nucleoids. We have previously shown that intra-mitochondrial nucleotide imbalance occurs in cells from patients with mutations in TK2, dGK, TWINKLE and, potentially, TP (24). Nucleotide imbalance is another potential cause of replisome pausing and depletion, and cells that are deficient in dGK may also have mosaic mtDNA depletion (25,42). Replisome pausing may thus underlie mtDNA depletion due to either POLG1 mutations (41) or to nucleotide imbalances (43). The mosaic cellular depletion that we have demonstrated may thus be a manifestation of severe replication stalling. As in the model proposed by Wanrooij et al., we found that each of the fibroblast cultures from patients A\u2013D (that had the most severe cellular depletion) had at least two POLG1 mutations lying in catalytic domains. The depletion in the patient cells was less pronounced than in the in vitro study, however, the progressive depletion observed with successive passages of patient cells may partly recapitulate the depletion observed on induction of the mutant POLG1 in the experimental study.The clinical findings in this group of patients are similar to those found in previous studies of POLG1 mutations in Alpers disease. The prominence of epilepsy has been highlighted before, as well as the variability in pointers to mitochondrial disease. Movement disorders appear to be very much more common than in maternally inherited mtDNA disease, especially if this feature is broadened to include epilepsia partialis continua. Thus, epilepsia partialis continua and movement disorders may provide an important pointer to POLG1 mutations. In one case, fatal deterioration followed valproate therapy and others have reported a clear improvement on stopping therapy with this anticonvulsant. However, several other patients, with a generally milder phenotype, have been treated with this drug for short periods without apparent problem. The relationship between the hepatic encephalopathy associated with valproate therapy and pre-existing POLG mutations (carrier frequency <1 in 150) is worthy of further study.Among a group of patients with POLG1 mutations, we have identified and characterized mosaic cellular depletion of mitochondrial DNA in four patients, each with two mutations affecting catalytic domains. These mutations appear to have severe consequences, both for the clinical phenotype and the mtDNA content of affected tissues. Patients with demonstrable tissue mtDNA depletion always had at least one catalytic domain or nonsense mutation. Our findings add general support to the current model of the role of POLG1 in the replisome.Patients were referred to our diagnostic service with a variety of clinical presentations. In two cases (we received fibroblasts, the patients having been diagnosed at other centres [patient D (37) and J (21,24)]. Alpers was diagnosed on the basis of the referring clinician's information, some of which was collected retrospectively (Table\u00a01). Case histories for patients A\u2013C are in the Supplementary Material.All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd or Biomol International. Antibodies to TFAM were raised in our own lab, anti-DNA was from ProGen Biotechnick GmbH. Anti-BrdU antibody was from Roche.

Tumor development in response to Ras activation varies between different tissues and the molecular basis for these variations are poorly understood. The murine lens and cornea have a common embryonic origin and arise from adjacent regions of the surface ectoderm. Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway induces the corneal epithelial cells to proliferate and the lens epithelial cells to exit the cell cycle. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the differential responses of these two related tissues have not been defined. We have generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active version of human H-Ras in their lenses and corneas.\n\n\nResults\nRas transgenic lenses and corneal epithelial cells showed increased proliferation with concomitant increases in cyclin D1 and D2 expression. This initial increase in proliferation is sustained in the cornea but not in the lens epithelial cells. Coincidentally, cdk inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 were upregulated in the Ras transgenic lenses but not in the corneas. Phospho-Erk1 and Erk2 levels were elevated in the lens but not in the cornea and Spry 1 and Spry 2, negative regulators of Ras-Raf-Erk signaling, were upregulated more in the corneal than in the lens epithelial cells. Both lens and corneal differentiation programs were sensitive to Ras activation. Ras transgenic embryos showed a distinctive alteration in the architecture of the lens pit. Ras activation, though sufficient for upregulation of Prox1, a transcription factor critical for cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation, is not sufficient for induction of terminal fiber differentiation. Expression of Keratin 12, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, was reduced in the Ras transgenic corneas.\n\n\nConclusions\nCollectively, these results suggest that Ras activation a) induces distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea resulting in distinct cellular responses and b) is sufficient for initiation but not completion of lens fiber differentiation.\n\n", "fulltext": "Ras proteins have been shown to regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis and senescence. Ras proteins are small GTP-binding proteins that switch between inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound and active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound conformations. Active GTP-bound Ras recruits Raf to the cell membrane. Raf then phosphorylates mitogen-activated and extracellular-signal regulated kinase kinases (MEKs) which in turn, phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks). Erks activate cytoplasmic substrates and translocate to the nucleus to stimulate expression of immediate early genes such as c-jun and E26 transcription factors (ETS). The Ras-Raf-Erk signaling pathway has been shown to be sufficient for transformation of murine cell lines. Activating somatic missense mutations in Ras genes (predominantly in codons 12, 13 and 61) have been found in a number of human cancers. Specific associations have been found between the three major Ras oncogenes, H-, K- and N-Ras, and specific types of malignancies. For instance, K-Ras mutations are frequent in pancreatic and colon carcinomas, H-Ras mutations in bladder cancers and N-Ras mutations in melanomas and small intestine malignancies. In addition, germline mutations in Ras underlie several developmental disorders including cardio-facio cutaneous syndrome (K-Ras), Costello (H-Ras) and Noonan syndromes (K-Ras) that are characterized by sporadic tumors and skeletal, cardiac and visual abnormalities. The reasons for the association of specific Ras genes with specific tumors or developmental disorders are not well understood. Analysis of H-, K- and N-Ras null mice suggests that Ras proteins perform both unique and overlapping roles during development. H-Ras and N-Ras single and double null mice are viable, fertile and develop normally. Of the two K-Ras isoforms, 4A and 4B, 4B but not 4A is essential for embryogenesis. K-Ras 4B null embryos die in utero due to anemia, liver and cardiac defects. Replacement of K-Ras coding sequences with H-Ras results in viable mice suggesting that H-Ras protein can perform the functions of K-Ras in K-Ras-expressing tissues presumably by activating the same set of downstream targets. Alterations in ocular development in K-Ras null mice have not been reported. Lens differentiation is initiated when the neuroectoderm-derived optic vesicle induces the overlying surface ectoderm to upregulate the expression of transcription factors such as Pax6 and Sox2, leading to lens placode formation [reviewed in]. The lens placode then invaginates to form a distinctively shaped, symmetrical lens pit. BMP receptor mediated signaling has recently been shown to be critical for this placodal invagination. The lens cells subsequently detach from the overlying ectoderm to form the lens vesicle. Lens detachment requires the transcription factors FoxE3 and Pitx3. During vesicle closure, the posterior cells of the lens vesicle initiate fiber cell differentiation, forming the primary fiber cells. Fiber cells exit from the cell cycle, undergo dramatic elongation, and express \u03b2- and \u03b3-crystallins. The anterior cells of the lens remain cuboidal and retain expression of Pax6 and E-Cadherin. The anterior-posterior polarity of the lens is maintained throughout life by coordination of lens epithelial proliferation, cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation. Upregulation of the transcription factor Prox1 at the transition zone near the equator has been shown to be essential for cell cycle exit. The CDK inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 are upregulated at the transition zone and are necessary for proper cell cycle exit at the outset of fiber cell differentiation. An inductive signal from the neural retina is critical for initiation of lens fiber differentiation. Though the identity of this inductive signal is not known, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that this signal is an FGF or FGF-like molecule. Expression of a secreted dominant negative version of the FGFR3 or targeted deletion of FGFR1, 2 and 3 in the lens results in the delay or loss of fiber cell differentiation. These results suggest that FGF receptor mediated signaling is necessary for initiation of lens fiber differentiation. After lens vesicle detachment, surface epithelial cells adjacent to the lens vesicle differentiate to form the corneal epithelium. In mice, corneal epithelial differentiation is marked by Keratin 12 (K12) expression. The corneal stroma and endothelium are formed by intraocular migration of neural crest and mesodermally-derived periocular mesenchymal cells. Previous studies showed that activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway in the lens epithelial cells in transgenic mice leads to cell cycle exit and premature fiber differentiation. In contrast, FGF signaling induces the corneal epithelial cells to first proliferate and later differentiate into lacrimal or Harderian glands. The molecular mechanisms that regulate proliferative and differentiation responses of the cornea and lens respectively have not been defined. Activation of Ras, a downstream effector of FGF signaling, in the lenses of transgenic mice is sufficient to induce lens epithelial hyperplasia. In addition, H-, K- and N-Ras genes are expressed ubiquitously within the eye. However, in previous studies, downstream targets of Ras activation in the lens were not analyzed. In addition, the promoter used to drive Ras expression in the eye was lens-specific thereby precluding analysis of the effects of Ras activation in the cornea. In order to test whether activation of Ras in the cornea can phenocopy the effects of FGF signaling, we generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active version of H-Ras (G12V) driven by a modified Pax6 promoter This promoter is active in the lens, corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. Our results suggest that, despite the common embryonic origin of the lens and the cornea, these two tissues possess distinct sets of downstream targets that regulate the cellular responses to Ras activation. The human H-Ras (G12V) genomic clone, encoding a constitutively active version of H-Ras (from Dr. Michael Lieberman, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston), was digested with SpeI and inserted between the Pax6 promoter/enhancer and the SV40 intron and polyadenylation sequences. The injection fragment was generated by SpeI and StuI digestion and was microinjected into individual pronuclei of 1-cell stage FVB/N mouse embryos. Injected embryos were transferred into pseudopregnant ICR strain female mice. Animals were handled following the guidelines provided in US Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The embryos were allowed to develop to term and potential Pax6-Ras transgenic mice were identified by isolating genomic DNA from tail biopsies and screening by PCR, using primers specific for the SV40 sequences. Embryos were obtained by mating FVB/N females to heterozygous Ras transgenic males. Pregnant females were sacrificed at appropriate time points and transgenic offspring were identified by PCR. Heads of transgenic mice were removed, fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5-7 \u03bcm) and used for histological analyses, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. To analyze patterns of gene expression, [35S] UTP-labeled riboprobes were generated. The SV40 antisense riboprobe was synthesized using EcoRI-digested SV40 DNA and T3 RNA polymerase (Promega). The FoxE3 antisense probe was synthesized using HindIII-digested mouse FoxE3 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase. The Pitx3 antisense probe was synthesized using XhoI-digested mouse Pitx3 cDNA and SP6 RNA polymerase. The Prox1 antisense probe was synthesized using SmaI-digested mouse Prox1 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase. The p57Kip2 antisense probe was synthesized using BamHI-digested mouse p57Kip2 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase. The Erm, Pea3, Spry1 and Spry4 antisense probes were synthesized using EcoRI-digested Erm, Pea3, Spry1 and Spry4 cDNAs and T7 RNA polymerase. The Spry2 antisense probe was synthesized using SacI-digested mouse Spry2 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase. The cyclin D1 antisense probe was synthesized using XhoI-digested mouse cyclin D1 cDNA and T3 RNA polymerase. The cyclin D2 antisense probe was synthesized using SphI-digested mouse cyclin D2 cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase. The cyclin B1 antisense probe was synthesized using HincII-digested mouse cyclin B1 cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase. The p21Cip1 antisense probe was synthesized using ApaI-digested mouse p21Cip1 cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase. The Hes1 antisense probe was synthesized using HindIII-digested mouse Hes1 cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase. In situ hybridizations were performed using the same hybridization and washing conditions as described previously. The hybridized slides were soaked in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion, dried and exposed for 4-10 days at 4\u00b0C. Following development and fixation, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Bright and dark-field images were captured separately using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. Silver grains in the dark field images were pseudo-colored red using ADOBE Photoshop CS and overlaid on corresponding bright field images. Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed as follows. Slides containing ocular sections were first deparaffinized and rehydrated. Antigens were retrieved by microwave treatment in 10 mM Sodium Citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Following antigen retrieval, the tissue sections were blocked with 10% normal horse serum for 30 minutes, at room temperature. The slides were then incubated with anti-Pax6 (catalog number PRB-278P, 1:250; Covance, Berkeley, CA), anti-E-Cadherin (catalog number 610181, 1:1000; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), anti-Keratin 14 (Krt14) (catalog number PRB-155P, 1:2000; Covance), anti-Prox1 (catalog number ab5475, 1:1000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-\u03b1 A crystallin (catalog number ab5595, 1:10,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-\u03b2 crystallin (catalog number sc-22745, 1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Keratin 12 (Krt12) (catalog number KAL-KR074, 1:200; Cosmo Bio Company, Tokyo, Japan), anti-phospho Erk1/2 (catalog number 4370, 1:50; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-p57Kip2 (catalog number ab4058, 1:250; Abcam), anti-14-3-3\u03c3 (catalog number sc-7683, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Ki67 (catalog number M7249, 1:200, Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA) or anti-Trp63 (4A4) (catalog number sc-8431, 1:100; Santa Cruz) antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. Following brief washes in PBS, the slides were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated-secondary antibodies; anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number BA-1000, 1:200; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) for Pax6, Prox1, \u03b1 A-crystallin, \u03b2-crystallin, phospho-Erk1/2, p57Kip2, Krt12 or Krt14, anti-mouse IgG (catalog number BA-2000, 1:200; Vector Labs) for E-Cadherin or Trp63, anti-goat IgG (catalog number BA-5000, 1:200; Vector Labs) for 14-3-3\u03c3 and anti-rat IgG (catalog number BA-4000, 1:200, Vector Labs) for Ki67 for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Antigen-antibody complexes were then detected using streptavidin-linked Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 1:1000 dilution. Sections were mounted using ProLong Antifade media containing DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. DNA replication was examined by BrdU incorporation as described previously. Cell proliferation was analyzed by counting the number of BrdU positive nuclei. Quantification of cell proliferation (BrdU labeling index) was performed by determining the fraction of BrdU labeled nuclei over the total number of nuclei present on a given section. Cells in the interior of the Pax6-Ras transgenic lenses that expressed markers such as FoxE3 and Prox1 were counted as lens cells. A minimum of 3 different embryos were analyzed per genotype/time point. The number of sections used for quantification is indicated in the graphs (Fig. 4I). Analysis was performed by two-tailed Student's t-test at P \u2264 0.05. In order to test whether activation of Ras, a downstream effector of FGF signaling, can mimic the effects of FGF stimulation on the lens and cornea in the murine eye, we generated transgenic mice with targeted expression of a constitutively active (and oncogenic) version of human H-Ras under the control of the Pax6 promoter (Fig. 1). This promoter is active from embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) in the lens, corneal and conjunctival epithelial precursors. The Pax6-Ras transgene was constructed by inserting the human H-Ras gene (G12V) between the Pax6 enhancer/promoter and SV40 intron and polyadenylation site. The transgene was microinjected and two founders were generated. Stable transgenic lines (OVE2043, OVE2044) were established from these founders. Transgenic line OVE2043 did not show any ocular abnormalities. OVE2044 mice showed microphthalmia and were born with open eyelids. Transgene expression in the two Pax6-Ras transgenic lines was examined by in situ hybridizations (Fig. 2). No transgene expression was seen in the OVE2043 line (data not shown). In the OVE2044 line, at E11.5 and E13.5, transgene expression could be seen in the lens, corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells (Fig. 2B, D). Low levels of Ras transgene expression were seen in a subset of neuroblasts in the retina at E13.5 (Fig. 2D) with stronger expression at E16.5 (Fig. 2F). As transgene expression was seen only in the OVE2044 transgenic line, further studies were performed on this line and the results are presented here. In this manuscript we study the initial changes in lens and corneal differentiation. Later changes in retinal organization are not evaluated in this report. In order to assess the alterations in ocular development and morphology, sections of Pax6-Ras transgenic mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 3). Nontransgenic littermates were used as controls. At E10.5, the lens placode had invaginated to form the lens pit (Fig. 3A, A'). In the Ras transgenic embryos, morphological changes at the anterior margin of the lens pit were visible (Fig. 3B, B'). The boundary between the surface and lens pit epithelial cells was well defined in the nontransgenic embryos (Fig. 3A, A'). In contrast, in the transgenic embryos, extra cells extending into the interior of the lens pit were seen (Fig. 3B, B', arrow). At E11.5, Ras transgenic lenses and corneas displayed epithelial hyperplasia (Fig. 3D, D'). In addition, the extra cells seen in the lens pit were internalized within the lumen of the developing lens. (Fig. 3D, D', arrow). By E13.5, Ras transgenic lenses had become embedded in the cornea (Fig. 3F, F'). At E16.5, the eyelids had failed to close in the Ras transgenic embryos (Fig. 3H). In addition, lenses remained attached to the cornea and the lens epithelial cells showed an elongated morphology (Fig. 3H', bracket) in contrast to the cuboidal morphology in the lens epithelial cells of nontransgenic embryos (Fig. 3G', bracket). The corneal stroma was disorganized and a distinctive corneal endothelium was not seen (Fig. 3H'). At E18.5, vacuoles were present inside the defective lens (Fig. 3J, arrows) and the central cornea showed epithelial and stromal defects (Fig. 3J, J'). In order to assess apoptosis in Ras transgenic lens and corneal epithelial cells, we examined cleavage of caspase-3, a critical mediator of apoptosis, by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3K, L). Activated caspase 3 was detected in the transgenic epithelial cells within the lens that were not in contact with the basement membrane (Fig. 3L, arrows). Positive staining was not seen in the lens epithelial cells that expressed the Ras transgene but retained contact with the basement membrane. Similarly, activated caspase 3 staining, for the most part, was not seen in the Ras transgenic corneas (Fig. 3L). In order to assess cell proliferation in the Ras transgenic embryos, BrdU incorporation assays and Ki67 immunohistochemistry were performed (Fig. 4). The BrdU incorporation assay allows the identification of cells in S phase of the cell cycle. Ki67 is expressed by cycling cells in G1, S, G2 and M phase but not G0 cells. Ras transgenic lenticular and corneal epithelial cells show a significant increase in BrdU labeling at E11.5 (Fig. 4B, I). The cells in the interior part of the lens vesicle that were not in contact with the basement membrane also incorporated BrdU (Fig. 4B, arrow). At E13.5, a significant increase in the BrdU labeling index of corneal, but not lens, epithelial cells was seen (Fig. 4D, I). Both BrdU (Fig. 4A-D) and Ki67 (Fig. 4E-H) assays showed consistent results. Thus, Ras transgenic lenticular and corneal epithelial cells show a significant increase in proliferation initially but later, this increase is sustained in the corneal but not in the lens epithelial cells. Alterations in conjunctival epithelial proliferation will be described elsewhere (DB, ES, RW, VG). Alterations in the lens differentiation program were assessed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5). Pax6, FoxE3, Prox1 and Pitx3 are transcription factors that are critical for lens specification (Pax6), lens vesicle detachment (FoxE3, Pitx3) and cell cycle exit of lens epithelial cells (Prox1). In nontransgenic lenses, Pax6, E-Cadherin and FoxE3 are expressed in the epithelial cells (Fig. 5A, C, E), \u03b2-crystallin in differentiated fiber cells (Fig. 5O, Q) and Prox1 and \u03b1-crystallin in both epithelial and fiber cells (Fig. 5G, I, M). Expression of Pax6 (Fig. 5B), FoxE3 (Fig. 5F) and Pitx3 (Fig. 5L) in the transgenic lens epithelial cells was similar to nontransgenic lenses (Fig. 5A, E, K). E-Cadherin expression in the transgenic lens epithelial cells was comparable, although perhaps not identical, to nontransgenic lenses (Fig. 5D, T). Prox1 expression is normally upregulated near the equator of the lens where the fiber differentiation is initiated (Fig. 5G, I, white arrows). In contrast, Prox1 was upregulated in the Ras transgenic lens epithelial cells (Fig. 5H, J, arrowheads) but expression in the fiber cells was similar to wild type controls (Fig. 5H, J). Expression of \u03b1-crystallin in the transgenic lens epithelial cells (Fig. 5N) and \u03b2-crystallins in the transgenic lens fiber cells were similar to nontransgenic controls (Fig. 5O-R). The extra cells in the interior part of the Ras transgenic lenses that were not in contact with the basement membrane expressed lens epithelial markers including FoxE3 (Fig. 5F), Pitx3 (Fig. 5L) and \u03b1-crystallin (Fig. 5N). In addition, in a subset of these cells, expression of Prox1 (Fig. 5H, J) and \u03b2-crystallin (Fig. 5P, R, arrows) could be detected. Double labeling with \u03b2-crystallin and E-Cadherin antibodies suggested co-localization of these two proteins in some of the abnormal epithelial cells (Fig. 5S, T). These results show that some markers of lens fiber differentiation are induced in the anterior cells of the transgenic lenses. Erk activation in the Ras transgenic lenses and corneas was assessed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-phospho Erk1/2 antibody (Fig. 6). Erk1 and 2 are phosphorylated in response to Ras activation. Phospho-Erk1/2 immunoreactivity could be detected in the lens fiber cells of E11.5 and E13.5 nontransgenic embryos (Fig. 6A, C). Elevated levels of phospho-Erk1/2 were detected in the Ras transgenic lens but not in the corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 6B, D). In addition, a modest reduction of phospho-Erk1/2 levels was seen in the Ras transgenic lens fiber cells at E13.5 (Fig. 6D, lf). These results show that the lens and the corneal epithelial cells show differential Erk1/2 phosphorylation in response to Ras activation. In order to test whether Ras activation can induce expression of ETS transcription factors (Erm and Pea3) or negative feedback regulators of Ras-Raf-Erk signaling (Spry1, 2 and 4), in the lens and corneas, in situ hybridizations were performed on E13.5 ocular sections of Ras transgenic embryos (Fig. 7). Erm, Pea3, Spry1 and 2 were upregulated in the Ras transgenic corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells (Fig. 7B, D, F, H) in contrast to nontransgenic corneas (Fig. 7A, C, E, G). Significant upregulation of Erm, but not Pea3, Spry1 or 2, expression was seen in the Ras transgenic lens epithelial cells (Fig. 7B, D, F, H). Spry 4 was not induced in the transgenic lens or cornea (Fig. 7J). Expression of Erm, Spry1 and 2 in the Ras transgenic lens fiber cells was similar to nontransgenic controls (Fig. 7B, F, H). In summary, different sets of downstream targets were activated in the Ras transgenic lens and corneal epithelial cells. Expression of genes that regulate the cell cycle was analyzed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 8). D-type cyclins are often activated in response to growth factor and/or Ras stimulation and can promote entry into S phase. p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 have been shown to regulate cell cycle exit during fiber cell induction. Upregulation of cyclins D1 and D2 was seen in the Ras lens and corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 8B, D). Cyclin B1 was upregulated in the transgenic corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 8F) but expression in the lenses was similar to nontransgenic controls (Fig. 8E). No alterations in cyclin E expression were seen in Ras transgenic lenses and corneas (data not shown). p21Cip1 expression was upregulated in both the lens and corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 8H). Expression of p57Kip2 is normally upregulated near the equator where the lens epithelial cells exit the cell cycle and initiate fiber differentiation (Fig. 8I, K, white arrows). p57Kip2 mRNA and p57Kip2 protein levels were upregulated in Ras transgenic lens epithelial cells (Fig. 8J, L, arrowheads). Similarly, p27Kip1 mRNA levels were elevated in the transgenic lens but not corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 8M, N). In summary, D-type cyclins were elevated in both the lens and corneal epithelial cells but B-type cyclins were elevated only in the corneal epithelial cells. CDK inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 were preferentially upregulated in the lens but not in the corneal epithelial cells. In contrast, p21Cip1 was upregulated in both epithelial cell types. Alterations in corneal differentiation in the Ras transgenic corneas were assessed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 9). Hes1, a transcription factor and a downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway, is modestly expressed in the corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 9A) and has been shown to be critical for maintenance of the corneal progenitor/stem cells. Keratin 12 (Krt12) expression is restricted to the corneal epithelial cells within the eye (Fig. 9C) and has been shown to be essential for corneal differentiation. Krt14, 14-3-3\u03c3 and Trp63 are expressed in the corneal, conjunctival and skin epithelia (Fig. 9E, G, I). At E13.5, Hes1 expression was expanded in the Ras transgenic corneas but was unaltered in the Ras transgenic lenses (Fig. 9A, B). At E16.5, Krt12 expression was significantly reduced in the Ras transgenic corneas (Fig. 9D) but Krt14, 14-3-3\u03c3 and Trp63 were still expressed (Fig. 9F, H, J). Reduction in Krt12 expression indicates that terminal differentiation of corneal epithelial cells is inhibited by expression of activated Ras. The Pax6-Ras transgenic mice were generated in order to test whether Ras activation in the corneal and lens epithelial cells can phenocopy the effects of FGF stimulation. Similar studies performed on embryonic retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells in transgenic mice suggest that Ras activation can mimic the effects of FGF stimulation and is sufficient to induce the RPE cells to initiate a neuronal program of differentiation. Lens-specific expression of FGF10 in transgenic mice stimulates corneal epithelial cells to first proliferate and later differentiate into lacrimal and Harderian glands. Our results suggest that Ras activation is sufficient to induce proliferation but not glandular differentiation of corneal epithelial cells. Ras transgenic lenticular and corneal epithelial cells show increased proliferation with concomitant increases in cyclin D1 and D2 expression. The cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 was upregulated in both the lens and corneal epithelia. The initial increase in lens epithelial proliferation was not sustained perhaps due to the upregulation of p27kip1 and p57kip2. Phospho-Erk1 and Erk2 levels are elevated in the lens but not in the cornea. Consistent with this result, expression of Sprys1 and 2, downstream targets of FGF signaling and negative feedback regulators of Ras-Raf-Erk pathway, was higher in the Ras transgenic corneal than in the lens epithelial cells. Pea3, an ETS transcription factor, was elevated in the corneal but not in the lens epithelial cells. In contrast, transcription of Erm, another ETS transcription factor, was elevated in both the lens and corneal epithelial cells. Both lens and corneal differentiation programs were sensitive to Ras activation. Ras transgenic lenses showed defects in morphogenesis at the lens pit stage. Transgenic lens epithelial cells showed upregulation of Prox1, a transcription factor critical for cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation. Keratin 12, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, was significantly reduced in the Ras transgenic corneas. Collectively, these results show that a) lens and corneal epithelial growth and differentiation are sensitive to alterations in Ras activity and b) Ras activation can induce distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea. In our transgenic model, the H-Ras protein is constitutively active and not subject to feedback regulation. It is therefore, possible (and perhaps likely) that Ras activity is significantly higher than normal. Upregulation of p21Cip1 (a gene that is not upregulated during normal development) in the Ras transgenic lenses and corneas would be consistent with this possibility. Nonetheless, our results show that constitutive Ras signaling is not sufficient to induce glandular differentiation in the cornea. As early molecular markers of lacrimal or Harderian gland differentiation are not currently known, initiation of glandular differentiation in the Ras corneal epithelial cells could not be analyzed. Our results imply that other signaling pathways downstream of FGF receptor stimulation are necessary for ocular gland differentiation. Ras activation, however, is sufficient to induce an increase in corneal epithelial proliferation. Similarly, lens epithelial cells also respond to Ras activation by hyperproliferaton. Ras activation in the lens and corneal epithelial cells induces transcriptional upregulation of cyclins D1 and D2. As cyclin E was not induced in these tissues, it is likely that Ras-induced entry into S phase (assayed by BrdU incorporation) is due to the upregulation of cyclins D1 and D2. Cdk inhibitors, p27Kip1 and p57Kip2, are normally upregulated in the transition zone of the lens where the fiber differentiation program is initiated. Both p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 cooperatively regulate cell cycle exit at the onset of fiber cell differentiation. Ras activation in the lenticular, but not the corneal, epithelial cells upregulated both p27Kip1 and p57Kip2. In addition, the initial increase in proliferation seen at E11.5 in the lens epithelial cells was not sustained at E13.5 in contrast to corneal epithelial cells of the same age. These results taken together suggest that the deceleration in lens epithelial proliferation at E13.5 could be due to induction of Cdk inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 in the lens. The reasons for specific upregulation of these genes in the lens but not in the cornea are not clear. However, expression of the transcription factor, Prox1, offers us a clue. The transcription factor Prox1 has been shown to be necessary for transcriptional upregulation of p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 in the lens as expression of these two genes is not seen in Prox1 null lenses. In lymphatic vascular endothelial cells Prox1 expression is sufficient to activate p57Kip2 expression and to promote cell cycle exit. These studies considered together would suggest that transcriptional upregulation of p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 in Ras transgenic lenses could be due to Ras-induced upregulation of Prox1. It is not clear why Ras-induced upregulation of Prox1 is specific to the lens but not the cornea. Ras transgenic lenses also showed increased apoptosis. Apoptosis, however, was not seen in all the lens cells that expressed the Ras transgene suggesting that apoptosis was not a non-specific consequence of Ras transgene expression. Apoptosis in the lens was seen only in the abnormal cells in the interior of the lens. These results are interesting as oncogenic Ras has been shown to block suspension induced apoptosis or anoikis in vitro. Ras is able to protect cells from anoikis through the activation of Akt via PI3 kinase. Whether the PI3 kinase-Akt pathway is inactive in the Ras transgenic lenses remain to be verified. In the Ras transgenic mice, early events during lens differentiation including lens placode formation and lens invagination were not affected. However, Ras transgenic lenses failed to form a normal lens pit resulting in architectural changes at the lens pit stage. We considered the possibility that the altered lens pit architecture is caused by loss of FoxE3 or Pitx3 expression as FoxE3 and Pitx3 mutants show persistence of a lens stalk. However, expression of both Foxe3 and Pitx3 were unaltered in Ras transgenic lenses. We also analyzed the expression of E-Cadherin, a cell adhesion protein that plays a role in lens invagination. E-Cadherin was still expressed in the Ras transgenic lenses. It seems likely that the alterations in the architecture of the lens pit are a consequence of altered proliferation of cells in or around the lens placode in response to Ras stimulation. If this is true, it suggests that cell proliferation and invagination have to be precisely coordinated during lens invagination. Previous studies have shown that activation of the FGF signaling pathway in the lens epithelial cells in vivo is sufficient for induction of fiber differentiation. In vitro experiments using rat lens epithelial explants have shown that FGFs at low concentration, can induce proliferation and at high concentration, can induce cell cycle exit and differentiation. Our results suggest that Ras activation in the lens epithelial cells induces a modest increase in cell proliferation, at least transiently. Concurrently, there is upregulation of expression of some of the early markers of lens differentiation such as Prox1, p27Kip1 and p57Kip2. However, \u03b2-crystallin, a marker of terminal differentiation of lens fibers, was detected in only a small fraction of the Ras transgenic lens epithelial cells. Some of these cells also expressed lens epithelial markers including Pax6 and E-Cadherin, suggesting an abnormal or ambiguous state of differentiation. These results suggest that Ras activation is sufficient to initiate only limited aspects of the lens fiber differentiation program. These results are consistent with previous reports that show Erk signaling, while necessary for FGF-induced lens fiber elongation, is not sufficient for \u03b2-crystallin expression. Both corneal and lens epithelial cells originate from the surface ectoderm. Interestingly, our results suggest that, in spite of their common embryonic origin, the lens and the cornea activate distinctive sets of downstream targets in response to Ras activation. Phospho-Erk levels were elevated in the Ras transgenic lens but not in the cornea. In addition, negative feedback regulators of Raf-Erk signaling such as Spry1 and Spry2 are elevated more in the cornea than in the lens epithelial cells. These observations provide correlative evidence that Spry1 and 2 may be inhibiting Raf-Erk signaling in the corneal epithelial cells. Alternatively, it is possible that signaling effectors downstream of Ras that are critical for Erk phosphorylation are expressed in the lens more than in the cornea. This model would predict that Ras-induced expression of downstream targets in the cornea is independent of Erk activation and that Ras signals through other effectors. Transcription factors that show tissue-specific expression such as Trp63 in the cornea or Prox1 in the lens may also dictate the response of these tissues to Ras signaling. Nonetheless, the differential activation of downstream targets in these two related tissues is a novel discovery that warrants further analysis. Our results suggest that corneal differentiation is sensitive to changes in Ras activity. Interestingly, in contrast to the lens, Ras stimulation inhibits corneal epithelial differentiation. Expression of Krt12, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, is significantly reduced. Expansion of the expression domain of Hes1, a gene critical for maintenance of pleuripotency, is consistent with the block in differentiation. Expression of other proteins such as 14-3-3\u03c3, Krt14 and Trp63 that are normally expressed in, but not restricted to, the corneal epithelium was maintained. Therefore, it is likely that the inhibition of Krt12 expression in the Ras transgenic corneas is a specific effect of Ras stimulation. Collectively, our results suggest that Ras activation induces distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea resulting in distinct cellular responses. These results support the model that responses to Ras signaling are tissue specific and dictated by the autonomous programming of the responding tissues. These results also suggest the possibility that the associations seen between mutations in specific Ras genes and specific types of malignancies could be explained at least in part, by cell-specific activation of different signaling effectors and downstream targets."}, "20806042": {"pmid": "20806042", "pmcid": "PMC2927419", "title": "A novel mutation in GJA8 causing congenital cataract\u2013microcornea syndrome in a Chinese pedigree", "abstract": "\n\nPurpose\nTo identify the underlying genetic defect in a four-generation family of Chinese origin with autosomal dominant congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC).\n\n\nMethods\nAll individuals in the study underwent a full clinical examination and the details of history were collected .

The opaque lens, which frequently leads to eyesight reduction and even complete loss of sight, can be congenital or acquired. Although congenital cataract is much less common than age-related cataract, it is still responsible for approximately 10% of childhood blindness worldwide. Inheritance accounts for at least 50% of all congenital cataracts, compared with other factors. From a genetic standpoint, congenital cataract is primarily an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive and X-linked patterns have also been reported. Inherited cataract commonly presents in an isolated fashion, a component of other ocular disorders, or a part of systemic syndromes. Cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC, OMIM 116150) is characterized by the association of congenital cataract and microcornea without any other systemic abnormality. Microcornea is defined as a horizontal corneal diameter of less than 10.00\u00a0mm, and appears as a distinct phenotype affecting 12%\u201318% of congenital cataract cases. To date, more than seven genes have been reported in association with congenital cataract and microcornea. These genes have been identified as coding for three crystallins (\u03b1A-crystallin [CRYAA], \u03b2B1-crystallin [CRYBB1], and \u03b3D-crystallin [CRYGD]), one gap junctional protein (gap junction protein, alpha 8 [GJA8]), and two transcription factors (Maf-like protein gene [MAF] and paired box gene 6 [PAX6]). Several other loci have also been linked to CCMC, but the mutant genes have not yet been identified. In the present study, a human inherited autosomal dominant CCMC was analyzed in a four-generation Chinese pedigree. A missense mutation in GJA8 was detected, which was responsible for the disease in this family. A four-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome was recruited from Heilongjiang province in the Northeast of China. Three affected patients, four non-carrier relatives, and 100 healthy normal controls were involved in this study. All participants underwent ophthalmologic examinations, including visual acuity tests, slit-lamp, corneal diameter and axial length measurements, and fundus examination of the dilated pupil. Informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from all individuals. Ethical approval for this study was received from the Heilongjiang Institutional Review Board. Five milliliter peripheral blood from seven members (three affected and four non-carrier relatives) of the family and controls was collected and preserved at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C in EDTA. Genomic DNA was extracted by QIAamp DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen Science, Germantown, MD). All exons of candidate genes related to CCMC were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using the primers listed in Table 1. The PCR reaction mixture (50\u00a0\u00b5l) contained 2\u00a0\u00b5l 10\u00d7 PCR Buffer, 10 pmol primer pairs, 200\u00a0\u00b5mol/l dNTP mix, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, and 80 ng genomic DNA. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: pre-degeneration at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of denaturation, annealing and extension, followed by a final extension at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 7 min, and a last hold at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The PCR products were subsequently purified using a TIANgel Midi Purification Kit (Tiangen Biltech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China), and then sequenced with an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing results were analyzed using Chromas 2.22 software (Technelysium Pty. Ltd., QLD, Australia) with reference sequences in the NCBI Gene Bank. The PolyPhen program was used in the bioinformatics study to predict the possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of human proteins. The prediction was based on the caculation of position-specific independent counts (PSIC) score deduced from multiple sequence alignments of observation. PSIC scores of \u22640.5 represented that the polymorphism was benign to protein function; scores of 0.5\u20132.0 were possibly damaging; scores of 2.0 were propably damaging. The secondary structures and hydrophobic properties of mutant and wild-type amino acid sequences were analyzed by Jpred 3 software and Misc Protein Analysis software, respectively. There were five affected individuals in this Chinese family, and three of them (II:6, III:3, and III:5) participated in this study (Figure 1). At the time of this study, all patients had undergone cataract extraction surgeries. Therefore, the clinical findings (summarized in Table 2) were obtained from the medical records. The proband (III:3), a 24-year-old man, was diagnosed with bilateral CCMC at five years of age. The horizontal diameters of his corneas were less than 10\u00a0mm. The axial length of his eyes was 25.2\u00a0mm oculus dexter (OD) and 24.8\u00a0mm oculus sinister (OS), respectively. His mother and sister also showed similar clinical symptoms. Apart from congenital cataract and microcornea, no other eye abnormalities such as microphthalmia, iris coloboma or nystagmus were detected in any of these patients. In all affected individuals, bidirectional sequencing of the coding regions of the candidate genes revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, C\u2192T, at nucleotide 592 in exon 2 of GJA8 (Figure 2A). This mutation resulted in the replacement of a highly conserved arginine by tryptophan (Figure 2C). This change co-segregated with the affected members of the family, but was not detected in either non-carrier relatives or 100 normal controls (Figure 2B). No other mutations were found except for the non-pathogenic SNPs. After input the amino acid sequences of the wild-type GJA8 protein and the mutant, the PSIC score from Polyphen analysis was 3.149, which meant that the variant (p.R198W) was predicted as being \u201cprobably damaging\u201d with high confidence. In comparison with the wild-type GJA8 protein, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was dramatically increased (Figure 3). The secondary structure prediction suggested that the mutation R198W led to a turn replaced by a helix. (Figure 4). We identified a novel missense mutation, p.R198W, in gap junction alpha-8 protein (GJA8) for a four-generation Chinese pedigree with autosomal dominant congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC). According to Polyphen analysis, the R198W was predicted to probably damage the structure and function of the protein, which emphasized the functional importance of this site. The replacement of a hydrophilic arginine by a hydrophobic tryptophan at position 198 might increase the hydrophobicity of the protein, which was propitious to the formation of the helix. The secondary structure prediction showed that the mutation led to a turn replaced by a helix, which was in accordance with the hydrophobicity prediction. This suggested that the mutation may cause to the conformation change of the mutant protein. Mutations in GJA8 have been considered as cataractogenesis in humans. To date, 16 mutations in this gene have been identified to contribute to assorted phenotypic cataracts, five of which were associated with CCMC phenotype (Table 3). In addition to the novel R198W mutation, another mutation (p.R198Q) of the same codon has been reported in an Indian family with CCMC. However, the affected amino acid was different. In our family, the c.592C>T change resulted in a R198W mutation, while the c.593G>A change led to a R198Q mutation in the Indian family. Our finding further expands the mutation spectrum of GJA8 in associated with congenital cataract and microcornea. GJA8 (NM_005267) is located on chromosome 1q21.1 and encodes a 50\u00a0kDa protein (connexin 50; Cx50). Cx50, consisting of 433 amino acids, is a member of the connexin family of proteins that are important to the formation of gap junction channels. These channels are responsible for direct intercellular transfer of ions and molecules up to 1,000 Da between adjacent cells. Since the eye lens is an avascular structure, it relies heavily on an intercellular communication system constructed of gap junctions for preservation of tissue homeostasis and transparency. Like other connexins, Cx50 contains four transmembrane domains (M1, M2, M3, and M4) linked by two extracellular loops (E1 and E2), as well as an intracellular loop (CL), and intracytoplasmic NH2- and COOH-termini. The extracellular loop of the connexin protein is a highly conserved and functionally important domain in gap junction channels by multiple-sequence analysis among different species (Figure 2C). The p.R198W substitution observed in the present study is located within the E2 loop of Cx50 and it results in the replacement of a highly conserved basic arginine by a neutral tryptophan at position 198. The extracellular loops have been proven to be important for the docking of the two hemichannels to form a gap junction unit. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the second extracellular domain is a determinant of compatibility between connexins. Therefore, the mutant protein (p.R198W) may disrupt the intercellular communication mediated by gap junction channels and subseqently affect the transparency of the lens. Cataractogenesis has been detected by targeted gene disruption in mice. In contrast to the connexin 46 knockout mice exhibiting nuclear cataracts, the target disruption of connexin 50 mice developed microphthalmia with small lenses and nuclear cataracts. While connexin 46 was expressed in place of connexin 50, the len was clear, but the size was subnormal. It was concluded that GJA8 played an important role in lens and eye growth, as well as in the lens fiber cell differentiation and maturation. In summary, the study provides the first report of a heterozygous c.592 C\u2192T mutation of GJA8 in a Chinese pedigree with congenital cataract-microcornea syndrome (CCMC). This broadens the mutation spectrum of GJA8. The results of this study may help to further clarify the pathogenesis of congenital cataract and microcornea."}, "21799811": {"pmid": "21799811", "pmcid": "PMC3140509", "title": "Strong Association of 677 C>T Substitution in the MTHFR Gene with Male Infertility - A Study on an Indian Population and a Meta-Analysis", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme of folate and methionine metabolism, making it crucial for DNA synthesis and methylation.

The SNP was typed by direct DNA sequencing. Chi square test was done for statistical analysis. Published studies were searched using appropriate keywords.

Allele and genotype meta-analysis also supported its strong correlation with male infertility, thus establishing it as a risk factor.\n\n", "fulltext": "Folic acid metabolism is important for stability and integrity of the genome due to its role in maintaining a balance between deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) for error free DNA synthesis, DNA methylation pattern and repair. Therefore, deficiency in folate intake or polymorphism(s) in the enzymes of folate pathway may result in aberrant DNA synthesis and methylation. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme of folate and methionine metabolism, making it crucial for DNA synthesis and methylation. MTHFR reduces methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate which then donates methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine. Methionine is ultimately converted to S-adenosyl methionine which acts as a \u2018methyl\u2019 donor for DNA methylation. Also, methylenetetrahydrofolate participates in DNA synthesis by converting uracil to thymine. MTHFR activity is higher in adult testis than other organs in mouse, indicating its critical role in spermatogenesis,\u2013. Recent research has identified epigenetic regulation of several genes playing important role in spermatogenesis and fertility. Therefore, aberrations in the MTHFR gene could compromise the process of spermatogenesis and predispose the carriers to infertility\u2013. Four SNPs (203G>A, 677C>T, 1286A>C and 1793G>A) in the MTHFR gene have been described to affect activity of this enzyme,. Of these, 677C>T resulting in the replacement of alanine with valine (A222V, rs1801133), has been studied most often\u2013,\u2013. This substitution results in reduced MTHFR specific activity and increased thermolability. Homozygous 677TT variant has \u223c30% of residual activity and heterozygous 677CT variant has \u223c70% of residual activity when compared to 677CC variant,,,\u2013. This substitution also results in enhanced level of homocysteine and low plasma folate level,\u2013. The frequency of 677C>T polymorphism varies with geographical location and the association status with infertility may vary due to ethnic differences\u2013, [ 9]\u2013. It has been suggested that low level of folate associated with MTHFR polymorphism could be the cause of infertility due to alteration in the synthesis of DNA and RNA molecules,. Increase in sperm concentration upon folic acid and zinc sulfate supplementation further suggests the importance of this pathway in spermatogenesis. This is also supported by induction of hypo-methylation by 5-aza deoxy cytidine, which inhibits the differentiation of spermatogonia into spermatocytes in murine model. Most of the studies till date have analyzed this polymorphism in small sample size, giving way to over-estimation of association. We have, therefore, analyzed 677C>T polymorphism in a large sample size (N\u200a=\u200a837) to elucidate the correlation between this polymorphic variant and male infertility in Indian population. We also performed a meta-analysis on all eligible published case-control studies, including our data, which established MTHFR 677C>T substitution to be a strong risk factor for male infertility. Genotyping by direct sequencing on the DNA samples of all infertile and fertile controls individuals was undertaken. Genotype data for control population fitted well in the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium equation [p (Exact test) \u200a=\u200a0.246620]. Distribution of mutant allele and genotypes was significantly different between infertile individuals and controls (Figure 1). Mutant allele (T) was more frequent in infertile men (16.5%) in comparison to fertile controls (11.1%) (Table 1) and the difference was statistically significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.0025) with an odds ratio of 1.58 (CI, 1.17\u20132.13) (Table 1). The frequency of \u2018T\u2019 allele in each infertile sub-group was significantly higher in comparison to fertile controls (11.1%) and was almost double (19.3%) in oligoasthenoteratozoospermic (OAT) group, making the difference statistically significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.01). Comparison of allele frequency between cases and controls suggested strong association of mutant allele with infertility and with OAT (Table 1). Similarly, the frequency of homozygous mutant genotype (TT) in infertile individuals was almost three times (5.4%) to that of controls (1.9%), and the difference was statistically significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.009 at 99% level of confidence). The frequency of heterozygous genotype was also higher in infertile group (22.2%) in comparison to control samples (18.4%); however, the difference was not statistically significant (Table 1). In sub-group analysis, homozygous mutant genotype showed strong association with asthenozoospermia (p\u200a=\u200a0.02) and uncategorized infertile (p\u200a=\u200a0.003) groups. Overall, the presence of all mutant genotypes (CT+TT) was higher in infertile individuals in comparison to controls, and the difference was statistically significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.0187) (Table 1). Twenty nine studies were retrieved by our literature search strategy. Out of these, only 15 had analyzed 677C>T substitution in correlation with male infertility. Two studies were excluded from the analysis as one did not provide detailed information required for meta-analysis and the other was not directly relating the genotypes with infertility. Hence, only 13 studies qualifying our strict selection criteria were included in the analysis. Along with the present study from India, this meta-analysis included data on 3094 cases and 2877 controls. Allele and genotypes data for all these studies were tabulated (Table 2). A true heterogeneity existed between studies for allele (Pheterogeneity\u200a=\u200a0.00, Q\u200a=\u200a39.66, df(Q) \u200a=\u200a13, I2\u200a=\u200a67.221, var\u200a=\u200a0.001, \u03c42\u200a=\u200a0.050, SE\u200a=\u200a0.031,\u03c4\u200a=\u200a0.224) and genotype (Pheterogeneity\u200a=\u200a0.00, Q\u200a=\u200a44.44, df(Q) \u200a=\u200a13, I2\u200a=\u200a70.75, var\u200a=\u200a0.004, \u03c42\u200a=\u200a0.109, SE\u200a=\u200a0.064, \u03c4\u200a=\u200a0.330) comparisons. The \u2018I2\u2019 value of more than 50% for between studies comparison in both allele and genotype analysis shows high level of true heterogeneity. In allele meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis performed by exclusion of the studies involving small sample size\u2013, decreased heterogeneity (Pheterogeneity\u200a=\u200a0.016, I2\u200a=\u200a54.07, Q\u200a=\u200a21.77, df(Q)\u200a=\u200a10, var\u200a=\u200a0.000, \u03c42\u200a=\u200a0.025, SE\u200a=\u200a0.021, \u03c4\u200a=\u200a0.158) to a small extent but exclusion of studies with very high p values,,\u2013 decreased heterogeneity to a large extent (Pheterogeneity\u200a=\u200a0.136, I2\u200a=\u200a33.98, Q\u200a=\u200a13.63, df(Q) \u200a=\u200a9, var\u200a=\u200a0.000, \u03c42\u200a=\u200a0.012, SE\u200a=\u200a0.016, \u03c4\u200a=\u200a0.108). Here, \u03c42 defines between studies variance and is used to asses heterogeneity; however, this is not commonly used for this purpose as it depends on the particular effect metric used in the analysis. Var denotes variance and SE denotes standard error for heterogeneity test. Similarly, in genotype analysis exclusion of the studies with small sample size\u2013 decreased heterogeneity to a small extent (Pheterogeneity\u200a=\u200a0.001, I2\u200a=\u200a68.07, Q\u200a=\u200a31.32, df(Q)\u200a=\u200a10, var\u200a=\u200a0.003, \u03c42\u200a=\u200a0.082, SE\u200a=\u200a0.056, \u03c4\u200a=\u200a0.287). As a result of this exclusion, there was no significant difference in the results of fixed effect (OR\u200a=\u200a1.361, p\u200a=\u200a0.000) and random effect (OR\u200a=\u200a1.363, p\u200a=\u200a0.004) models. After exclusion of studies with high p values,,,\u2013, heterogeneity decreased to a lesser extent (Pheterogeneity\u200a=\u200a0.002, I2\u200a=\u200a67.13, Q\u200a=\u200a24.343, df(Q)\u200a=\u200a8, var\u200a=\u200a0.005, \u03c42\u200a=\u200a0.091, SE\u200a=\u200a0.071, \u03c4\u200a=\u200a0.301) and the results in random effect model (OR\u200a=\u200a1.571, p\u200a=\u200a0.000) were almost identical to that of fixed effect model (OR\u200a=\u200a1.528, p\u200a=\u200a0.000). Sensitivity analysis thus showed that differences in the outcome between the two models (fixed and random effect) could be attributed to a few studies with very small sample size or very high p values. Under the conditions of heterogeneity, random-effects model is more appropriate. However, since there was no change in the inference adopting either model, we present results of both the models. There is no difference in the overall inference except in genotype sub-group analysis for oligozoospermic cases, where we use fixed effect model for drawing inference since random effect model gives more weight to studies with smaller sample size. Mutant allele showed significant association with infertility in both fixed effect (p\u200a=\u200a0.000, OR\u200a=\u200a1.304, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.202-1.414) and random effect (p\u200a=\u200a0.000, OR\u200a=\u200a1.310, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.129-1.520) models (Figure 2a). In cumulative analysis using fixed and random effect models, the association of mutant \u2018T\u2019 allele with infertility turned statistically significant with the addition of study of Park et al (2005) and A et al (2007), respectively, and stayed significant thereafter (Figure 2b and c). Sub-group analyses were done for azoospermia, oligozoospermia and OAT groups. Few of the previous studies did not categorize infertile subjects into sub-groups; therefore, such studies had to be excluded from sub-group analysis. Significant association of mutant allele with azoospermia was observed using both fixed (p\u200a=\u200a0.000, OR\u200a=\u200a1.522, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.32-1.175) and random (p\u200a=\u200a0.000, OR\u200a=\u200a1.531, 95%CI\u200a=\u200a1.25-1.87) effect models (Figure 3a). Similarly, mutant allele showed positive correlation with oligozoospermia adopting both fixed (p\u200a=\u200a0.000, OR\u200a=\u200a1.426, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.178-1.726) and random (p\u200a=\u200a0.025, OR\u200a=\u200a1.498, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.052-2.134) effect models (Figure 3b). However, mutant allele did not show association with OAT using either model (p\u200a=\u200a0.056) (Figure 3c). Similar to allele meta-analysis, pooled odds ratio for mutant genotypes (CT+TT) showed statistically significant association with infertility adopting both fixed (p\u200a=\u200a0.000, OR\u200a=\u200a1.310, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.173-1.462) and random (p\u200a=\u200a0.018, OR\u200a=\u200a1.290, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.044-1.595) effect models (Figure 4a). The fixed effect model cumulative analysis showed that addition of the study of Paracchini et al (2006) turned the overall association significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.023) (Figure 4b). With introduction of another two studies, p value became highly significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.00, significant at 99% level of confidence) and stayed significant thereafter (Figure 4b). However, with random effect model, the overall association turned significant only after inclusion of the study of Gava et al, 2011 (p\u200a=\u200a0.041) and further introduction of our study supported the inference (p\u200a=\u200a0.018) (Figure 4c). Sub-group analysis showed significant association of mutant genotypes with azoospermia using both fixed and random effect models (p\u200a=\u200a0.000, OR\u200a=\u200a1.648, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.360-1.996) (Figure 5a). Mutant genotypes also associated with oligozoospermia using fixed (p\u200a=\u200a0.000) but not random (p\u200a=\u200a0.054) effect models (Figure 5b). However, mutant genotypes did not associate with OAT in any case (fixed model, p\u200a=\u200a0.455, random model, p\u200a=\u200a0.557) (Figure 5c). We generated funnel plots using standard error and precision values for allele (Figure 6a\u2013h) and genotypes (Figure 7a\u2013h) using both fixed and random effect models. Apart from observed sets of studies, the plots were also drawn after imputation. Symmetrical distribution of studies in the funnel plots suggests absence of publication bias. This is also supported by other tests described below. In allele analysis, classic fail-safe \u2018N\u2019 value of 130 (p\u200a=\u200a0.000, Z\u200a=\u200a6.28) suggests that 130 null studies would have to be included to nullify the effect or convert the combined \u2018p\u2019 to a non-significant (>0.050) value. Orwin's fail-safe \u2018N\u2019 to bring observed odds ratio of 1.30 to 1.1 is 25, indicating that at least 25 null studies would be required to bring the effect size to null. Begg and Mazumdar Rank correlation test also showed no evidence of publication bias. Egger's intercept (B0) was 0.422 with t value of 0.253 (one tailed p value\u200a=\u200a0.40, two tailed p value\u200a=\u200a0.81), further suggesting no publication bias. No change in overall summary estimate (odds ratio) after \u2018trim and fill\u2019 procedure suggests absence of publication bias (Figure 6 b,d,f,h). Similarly, in genotype analysis, no evidence of publication bias was seen. Classic fail safe \u2018N\u2019 was 60 (p\u200a=\u200a0.00001, z\u200a=\u200a4.51), indicating that additional 60 null studies would be required to bring the p value in non-significant range. In the same way, Orwin's fail safe \u2018N\u2019 to bring observed odds ratio of 1.31 to 1.1 was 26, indicating that additional 26 null studies would be required to bring effect size to null. Similar to the allele analysis, Begg and Mazumdar Rank correlation test showed no evidence of publication bias. Egger's intercept (B0) was -0.49 with t value of 0.25 (one tailed p\u200a=\u200a0.40, two tailed p\u200a=\u200a0.80), suggesting no publication bias. No changes in the pooled odds ratio after \u2018trim and fill\u2019 procedure (Figure 7 b,d,f,h), confirmed absence of publication bias. Symmetry of the funnel plots and all statistical tests described above showed no trace of publication bias. Therefore, we are confident that there is no over-estimate of the infertility risk associated with this SNP. Mutant allele and genotypes at 677C>T were strongly associated with male infertility in our population. This was also supported by meta-analysis on previously published studies including our results. The findings of our study become particularly interesting since two previous studies on Indian populations had reported contrasting observations to each other,. Singh et al (2005) showed significant association of mutant genotypes with infertility while Dhillon et al (2007) showed no statistically significant difference of 677C>T variants between infertile and fertile males. Dhillon et al, tried to explain the variation in results on the basis that their study included majority of OAT patients in comparison to the majority of azoospermic cases in the study by Singh et al. In the present study, we included both azoospermic and OAT individuals, and had contrasting observations. Our analysis has shown significant association of mutant allele and genotypes with infertility and with OAT in sub-group analysis. Presence of mutant genotypes did not associate with azoospermia in our samples. To the best of our knowledge, the three Indian populations studied so far are not ethnically different. The differences in the results could therefore be attributed to other factors such as variations in recruitment of subjects. 677C>T substitution has been studied in different populations for its possible association with male infertility\u2013, [ 9]\u2013. Bezold et al (2001) showed for the first time association of homozygous mutant genotype with male infertility. Several studies later on showed significant association of homozygous mutant genotype with infertility in different populations\u2013, [ 11]\u2013, [ 15]\u2013. Two studies conducted on Korean population, showed significant increase of homozygous mutant genotype in infertile males than fertile controls. Park et al showed that OAT and non obstructive azoospermic patients in unexplained infertile group had higher frequency of homozygous mutant genotype in comparison to explained infertile males. Similarly, a study on Turkish population also inferred homozygous mutant genotype to be a risk factor for infertility characterized by oligozoospermia and non-obstructive azoospermia. Other studies provided evidence for association of this polymorphism with male infertility in the Chinese and Brazilian populations. In contrast to the above, a study on Dutch population revealed that mutant genotype was not a risk factor for male infertility. Two studies on Italian populations reported contrasting observations,, one showing no significant association of heterozygous or homozygous mutant genotypes with male sub-fertility and the second reporting increased risk of infertility in individuals with homozygous mutant genotype in comparison to heterozygous and wild type genotypes. Similarly, in a French population, no statistically significant correlation of mutant genotype with male sub-fertility was observed. We found true heterogeneity between studies in both allele and genotype meta-analysis, which is also evident from slight variations in the results of fixed and random effect models. The presence of heterogeneity would force us to use random effect model for further analysis. However, after doing sensitivity analysis we chose to use fixed effect model on the basis that there were few small studies affecting the results of meta-analysis. Since there was no significant difference in the results using either model, we present results of both; however, the inference is based on fixed effect model. Meta-analysis showed significant association of mutant allele and mutant genotypes (CT+TT) with infertility. Introduction of the studies of Park et al, 2005 and Paracchini et al, 2006 in the allele and genotype cumulative analysis, respectively, provided enough data to conclude that the mutant allele and genotypes are risk factors for infertility. Addition of more studies later on strengthened the conclusion and now this substitution has been established as a risk factor. The strength of our conclusion is also indicated by a very narrow confidence interval for odds ratio. Subgroup analysis has shown significant association of mutant allele and genotypes (CT+TT) with infertility characterized by azoospermia and oligozoospermia but not OAT. Analysis according to geographical distribution of populations could not be undertaken due to relatively lesser number of studies. An earlier meta-analysis on this SNP included eight studies and reported a highly significant association between mutant genotypes and infertility (p\u200a=\u200a0.002; OR- 1.23; 95% CI- 1.08-1.41). A recent meta-analysis on this polymorphism included 10 studies and concluded no overall association between this polymorphism and male infertility. Several observations in the latter study, such as association of this mutation with azoospermia and no association with OAT, are similar to us. However, overall inference in Wu et al., differs from ours as well as from Tuttlemann et al.. Cumulative analysis in our study clearly states less likelihood of finding no overall association as reported by Wu et al. However, inclusion in our meta-analysis of few recent studies and data from our case-control study could be responsible for differences in the overall inference. It is apparent from our analysis that 677C>T substitution associates strongly with infertility in Indian population and meta-analysis establishes it as a risk factor for male infertility. High fail safe \u2018N\u2019 and symmetrical distribution of studies in funnel plots ascertains absence of publication bias, further strengthening our conclusion. The penetration of this SNP could be affected by dietary folate intake and geographical factors such that overall phenotype is an outcome of interaction between these factors. Low dietary intake of folic acid could cause several health problems including but not limited to neural tube defects in developing embryos, homocysteine accumulation, and impaired DNA synthesis and repair. Low folate level in the Indian and African populations in comparison to the Western and European populations, makes them more susceptible to infertility and other health problems listed above. Inadequate folic acid intake and prevalence of vegetarian diet in India, in coupling with more than 10% overall frequency of this polymorphism, could justify folic acid supplementation for both men and women. Though exact mechanism by which 677C>T substitution affects fertility is not yet clear, some possible mechanisms have been put forward. Induction of hypo-methylation by 5-aza deoxy cytidine inhibited the differentiation of spermatogonia into spermatocytes in murine model, which could explain the association between this SNP and infertility. Since several genes participating in spermatogenesis are regulated by DNA methylation, individuals with 677T allele are associated with decreased global genomic methylation. Further, low levels of folate may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, resulting in oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is well known to cause damage to sperm plasma membrane, and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Hyperhomocysteinemia leads to precocious atherosclerosis which results in lower blood flow in testicular arteries, resulting in alteration in spermatogenesis. All the above taken into account partially explains the association between this polymorphism and male infertility. In nutshell, it appears, we have now enough data to conclude that 677 C>T is a risk factor for infertility in general and azoospermia in particular. The study was approved by the Institutional Human Ethics Committee of the Ajanta Hospitals and IVF Centre, Lucknow. Before enrolment in the study, each subject's informed written consent was obtained in response to a fully written and verbal explanation of the nature of study. In the case-control study, a total of 837 individuals from north India including 522 infertile and 315 fertile controls of Indo-Aryan ethnicity were recruited. The patients and controls were recruited at the Ajanta Hospitals and IVF Centre Pvt. Ltd. 765, ABC complex, Alambagh, Lucknow. The inclusion criteria of the cases included infertility persisting longer than one year and absence of any obvious fertility problem in the partner. Clinical observations on the female partners including menstruation and ovulation ruled out any problem on female side. Patients having infection of accessory glands, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, and those on drugs known to influence fertility were excluded. The patients were further categorized in sub-groups as per WHO 1999 criteria. Normozoospermic infertile men (N\u200a=\u200a141) had normal semen profile (defined as in the control group except fertility) and infertility of unknown etiology. Asthenozoospermic infertile men (N\u200a=\u200a135) had a sperm count >20\u00d7106/mL, motility <50%, and >\u200a=\u200a30% normal morphology; OAT (N\u200a=\u200a65) had a sperm count <20\u00d7106/mL, motility <50% and <30% normal morphology; non-obstructive azoospermic infertile men (N\u200a=\u200a68) with no sperm in the ejaculate and 113 infertile patients who were not categorized due to lack of one or the other semen parameter. The controls were recruited following the criteria of normal semen profile (WHO 1999) with confirmed paternity. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of patient and control samples using phenol-chloroform-isoamyl method. The point mutation (677C>T) in the MTHFR gene was typed using direct DNA sequencing technique. Briefly, primers around the polymorphic site were designed with the help of GENETOOL software. PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 10 \u00b5l each in thin walled tubes consisting of 1.0 \u00b5l of PCR buffer (10X), 1.0 \u00b5l of MgCl2 (25 mM), 1.0 \u00b5l of dNTPs (10 mM), 2.0 pM of each of the forward (5\u2032 CATCCCTATTGGCAGGTTACCC 3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032 GGGAAGAACTCAGCGAACTCAG 3\u2032) primers, 1.0 unit of Taq DNA polymerase enzyme (Applied Biosystems) and 40 ng of genomic DNA. PCR cycling was carried out in ABI Veriti thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA). PCR amplification conditions included denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 minutes followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 30 seconds, annealing at 63\u00b0C for 30 seconds and polymerization at 72\u00b0C for 40 sec, and a final stage of polymerization at 72\u00b0C for 7 minutes. The amplified products were directly sequenced using BigDye\u2122 chain termination chemistry on ABI 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Multiple alignment and sequence analysis was done using Auto Assembler Software (Applied Biosystems, USA). Genotype data for control population was analyzed for fitness in the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. For this purpose, data was analyzed using calculator available at http://ihg.gsf.de/cgi-bin/hw/hwa1.pl. Chi square analysis was used to compare the allele and genotype data between cases and controls. In addition to the comparison of all the patients with the controls, each sub-group of infertile individuals was compared with controls. Data was analyzed using the Vassar Stats Online Calculator (http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html). P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 677C>T has been explored in several studies in different ethnic groups, making it important to conduct meta-analysis. We had used Comprehensive Meta-analysis Version 2 software for this purpose. A systematic search was done on published literature using the keywords \u2018MTHFR and male infertility\u2019, \u2018folate metabolism and male infertility\u2019, \u2018MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and male infertility\u2019 through \u2018Pubmed\u2019 \u2018Ovid\u2019 and \u2018Google Scholar\u2019 up to march 2011. Detailed information for each study on 677C>T polymorphism in male infertility such as the purpose and design of the study, presentation of the data, genotyping method used, inclusion and exclusion criteria of the cases and controls was collected. Detailed information, wherever not available, was collected by contacting authors. The following inclusion criteria were set for the meta-analysis: (i) each trial is an independent case-control study; (ii) the purpose of all the studies and statistical methods is similar; (iii) it supplied enough information to calculate the odds ratio; (iv) SNP typing was done at high resolution level and (v) inclusion of the patients was done according to the standard diagnosis parameter. The exclusion criteria included: i) study not providing enough information (incomplete raw data) and ii) not well-described. Genotype data for MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism related to male infertility was gathered. Information regarding the first author, year of publication, ethnicity of study population, number of cases and controls and allele and genotype frequency was collected. Chi-square analysis was performed and the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated using Vassar Stats online statistical calculators (http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html) for all the possible genotypes. Association analysis was undertaken to compare the frequency of mutant allele and mutant genotypes between cases and controls. For meta-analysis, major consideration is the type of \u2018effect size\u2019 chosen for statistical analysis. In the present study, computed effect size in the form of \u2018odds ratio\u2019 and \u2018confidence interval\u2019 was chosen. A Chi square based \u2018Q\u2019 test defined by Cochran was used to assess the heterogeneity (between study variability) in the meta-analysis. A significance level of P<0.10 instead of traditional P<0.05 was used because of its low power and to avoid type II errors for statistical test of heterogeneity. Since the \u2018Q\u2019 statistics is only useful for testing the existence of heterogeneity qualitatively but not quantitatively, another index \u2018I2\u2019, calculated as the percentage of the total variability in a set of effect sizes due to true heterogeneity, was used to quantify the degree of heterogeneity. A tentative classification of \u2018I2\u2019 values proposed by Higgins and Thompson has been used to interpret the magnitude; viz. 25%, 50% and 75% which corresponds to low, medium and high heterogeneity, respectively. In the absence of significant heterogeneity determined by the results of Q test, the Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model (Peto method) was used for the combination of data, while in the presence of significant heterogeneity, the Dersimonian Laird random effect model (DL method) was used for combining the data-. Sensitivity analysis was also done to validate the assumptions and decisions made, and for the robustness of the method used in the analysis. A comparison of results based on fixed and random effects models before and after exclusion of outlier studies or studies involving small sample size was used as a method for sensitivity analysis. High resolution plots (forest plots) were generated to estimate the pooled odds ratio corresponding to 95% confidence interval and the p value. Both fixed effect and random effect models were used to analyze the data. Cumulative meta-analysis was also done to observe the effect of subsequent addition of each study. Subgroup analysis according to infertility phenotype (azoospermia, oligozoospermia and OAT) was also carried out to estimate the specific odds ratio for a particular sub-group. Publication bias was investigated by using the funnel plots; viz. funnel plot of standard error by log odds ratio and funnel plot of precision by log odds ratio. Different statistical tests such as Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation, Egger's regression intercept, Duvall and Tweedie's trim and fill procedure and Fail-safe \u2018N\u2019 were adopted to assess and quantify the publication bias and its impact on the analysis. The classic fail-Safe N and the Orwin fail-safe \u2018N\u2019 assess if the entire observed effect is an artifact of bias. Rank correlation and regression procedures are used for testing the presence of bias. Duvall and Tweedie's trim and fill procedure tests how the effect size will shift, if the apparent bias were to be removed."}, "21810259": {"pmid": "21810259", "pmcid": "PMC3162509", "title": "HIV-1 Tat activates indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in murine organotypic hippocampal slice cultures in a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent manner", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nWe have established that activation of the tryptophan degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) mediates the switch from cytokine-induced sickness behavior to depressive-like behavior. Because human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein causes depressive-like behavior in mice, we investigated its ability to activate IDO in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) derived from neonatal C57BL/6 mice.\n\n\nMethods\nDepressive-like behavior in C57BL/6J mice was assessed by the forced swim test. Expression of cytokines and IDO mRNA in OHSCs was measured by real-time RT-PCR and cytokine protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). p38 MAPK phosphorylation was analyzed by western blot.\n\n\nResults\nIntracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of Tat (40 ng) induced depressive-like behavior in the absence of sickness. Addition of Tat (40 ng/slice) to the medium of OHSCs induced IDO steady-state mRNA that peaked at 6 h. This effect was potentiated by pretreatment with IFN\u03b3. Tat also induced the synthesis and release of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 protein in the supernatant of the slices and increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the serotonin transporter (SERT). Tat had no effect on endogenous synthesis of IFN\u03b3. To explore the mechanisms of Tat-induced IDO expression, slices were pretreated with the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB 202190 for 30 min before Tat treatment. SB 202190 significantly decreased IDO expression induced by Tat, and this effect was accompanied by a reduction of Tat-induced expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, iNOS and SERT.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese data establish that Tat induces IDO expression via an IFN\u03b3-independent mechanism that depends upon activation of p38 MAPK. Targeting IDO itself or the p38 MAPK signaling pathway could provide a novel therapy for comorbid depressive disorders in HIV-1-infected patients.\n\n", "fulltext": "The risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients is significantly greater than that in the general population. Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) appears to suppress viral replication, there is a high level of microglial activation in the central nervous system (CNS) of the post HAART-treated patients, indicating that eliminating virus may not stop the process of HIV-induced ongoing inflammation in the brain. It has long been known that virus infected monocytes are able to invade the brain and induce a local inflammatory chain reaction that involves the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines by infected and non-infected macrophages and microglia. In addition, infected cells can shed viral proteins such as gp120 and Tat which can activate glial cells by themselves and therefore contribute to the propagation of inflammation. Although the production of inflammatory mediators by glial cells exposed to HIV-1 proteins has been mainly studied in the context of AIDS-related dementia, there is still limited evidence that HIV-1 proteins administered into the brain can induce depressive-like behavior in preclinical models with laboratory rodents. Rats injected with gp120 into the lateral ventricle of the brain present with signs of sickness associated with increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. Some of these behavioral alterations, such as the decreased preference for a saccharin solution, mimic the anhedonia observed in depressed patients. Intracerebral administration of HIV-1 Tat to mice induces depressive-like behavior in mice as measured by increased immobility in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, together with increased expression of brain proinflammatory cytokines. We have already established that development of inflammation-associated depression is dependent on activation of the tryptophan degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) by proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1. IDO degrades tryptophan (Trp) into kynurenine (KYN) which can be further metabolized into neurotoxic metabolites such as 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid (QUIN). In addition to developing depressive-like behaviors, Tat-treated mice also display increased IDO expression in their brains. The occurrence of neuropsychiatric disorders in HIV-1 seropositive patients presenting with symptoms of neuro-AIDS is associated with activation of IDO in peripheral macrophages, as evidenced by decreased levels of circulating Trp and increased plasma levels of both KYN and the macrophage activation marker neopterin. Confirmation that IDO activation also takes place in the brain of HIV-infected patients has been obtained since IDO enzymatic activity is increased in the brain of HIV-infected patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). IDO expression is up-regulated in monocytic cells in brain tissue of both patients with HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE) and monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (SIVE). Furthermore increases in brain QUIN are associated with progression of HIV infection. Brain expression of IDO during HIV infection certainly contributes to immunotolerance since administration of the IDO competitive inhibitor 1-methyl tryptophan enhances elimination of virus-infected macrophages in mice with HIVE. There is evidence that HIV-1 Tat can induce IDO expression in various cell types. This is particularly the case in macrophages but also in astrocytes exposed to HIV-1 clade B Tat. We have demonstrated that organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) offer a reliable model for investigating neuroimmune interactions and for studying the mechanisms of IDO activation. Here we have used this model to assess whether Tat alone or in conjunction with IFN\u03b3 can induce IDO expression. We chose IFN\u03b3 since this cytokine is traditionally regarded as the primary inducer of IDO. IFN\u03b3 is elevated in the brains of patients with HIVE and has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of HAD. IFN\u03b3 synergizes with Tat to enhance chemokine expression, which in turn can amplify the inflammatory responses within the CNS of patients with AIDS-related neurological disorders. However, IFN\u03b3-independent activation pathway has also been reported in response to LPS in primary microglia and murine slices. Additionally, the IFN\u03b3-independent up-regulation of IDO expression was recently demonstrated in HIV-infected human macrophages. It is unknown whether this property of IDO induction extends to OHSCs exposed to HIV proteins such as Tat. Furthermore, the precise mechanisms responsible for IFN\u03b3-independent induction of IDO following exposure to Tat are not clearly understood. Activation of IDO is not the sole mechanism that could be responsible for inflammation-associated depression. By reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) with high affinity in presynaptic neurons, the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SERT) contributes to the regulation of 5-HT neurotransmission. Several cytokines, including IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, are able to increase expression of SERT. Additionally, a recent study reported that HIV-1 clade B and C Tat differentially induce SERT expression in dendritic cells. For this reason, we included SERT in the possible targets of HIV-1 Tat in the in vitro model of OHSCs. HIV-1 Tat mediates its biological functions by activating a variety of signaling pathways and transcription factors. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is activated by Tat in a variety of cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, astrocytes and the THP-1 cell line. Since p38 MAPK is required for IDO expression in THP-1 cells, we investigated whether this signaling pathway also mediates Tat-induced expression of IDO in OHSCs. In the present study, we show that Tat induces the expression of IDO and synergizes with exogenous IFN\u03b3 to increase IDO induction in OHSCs and the effect of Tat is mediated by p38 MAPK activation. Recombinant Tat 1-72 was provided by Professor Avindra Nath through a contract with the University of Kentucky. Stock solutions of Tat 1-72 were prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (1ug/ul) and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Recombinant murine IFN\u03b3 (cat# 315-05) was from PeproTech, Inc. Heat-inactivated horse serum (cat# SH30074.03), Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, cat# SH30030.03) and minimal essential media (MEM) (cat# SH30024.02) were all from Hyclone. Gey's balanced salt solution (GBSS, cat# G9779) was from Sigma, D-glucose (cat# 15023-021) was from GibcoBRL and the kits for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were obtained from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, DE). TRIzol reagent was purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Reagents for RT-PCR were all from Applied Biosystems as follows: high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (cat# 4374967); RT-PCR primers for IDO (cat# Mm00492586_m1), TNF\u03b1 (cat# Mm00443258_m1), IL-6 (cat# Mm00446190_m1), the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (cat# Mm00440485_m1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; cat# Mm999999_g1). Antibodies specific for p38 (cat# 9212) and phosphorylated p38 (p- p38, cat# 9211) were purchased from Cell Signaling Biotechnology (Danvers, MA), whereas the secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked rabbit anti-mouse antibody (NA934V) was obtained from GE Healthcare Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190 (cat# 559397) was from EMD Chemicals, Inc. (USA). Protein was measured with a standard Bradford assay kit (cat# 500-0113, 0114, 0115) and Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, cat# 162-0177) membranes were from Bio-RAD (Hercules, CA). ECL Western blotting detection reagents (cat# RPN2106V1, RPN2106V2) were obtained from GE Healthcare Little Chalfont (Bucks, UK). All animal care and use procedures were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiments conducted in vivo were performed on 12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice obtained from a colony raised in our laboratory. Mice were individually housed in standard shoebox cages, with wood shavings as litter, in a temperature- (23\u00b0C) and humidity- (45-55%) controlled environment with a 12/12 h modified dark-light cycle (lights on 10:00 P.M.-10:00 A.M.). Food and water were available ad libitum. Mice were surgically implanted with a single guide cannula (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) directed toward the lateral ventricle, As previously described. The guide cannulas were kept clean and covered using a screw on cannula dummy for mice (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA). Coordinates for placement of the guide cannula were 1.5 mm lateral, 0.6 mm posterior, and 1.3 mm dorsal with respect to bregma. These coordinates placed the guide cannula 1 mm dorsal to the lateral ventricle. Mice were allowed to recover 2 weeks before treatment and initiation of behavioral tests. After recovery, mice were slowly injected over 1 min i.c.v. with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Tat (40 ng) in a volume of 1 \u03bcl. This dose of Tat was selected on its ability to reliably induce IDO expression in human astrocytes. The forced swim test was conducted at 24 h post i.c.v. injection of Tat for a five-min period and the mice were video recorded for future analysis. Immobility was defined as passive floating behavior or any movement necessary for the mouse to keep its head above water, as described previously. Murine hippocampal slice cultures were prepared using the static interface culture method. Briefly, 6- to 8-day-old C57BL/6J mice were decapitated. The brains and meninges were removed, followed by separation of the hippocampus from both hemispheres. Hippocampi were dissected and transverse slices (350 \u03bcm in thickness) were prepared using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Campden Instruments Ltd, UK). Slices were placed for 1 h at 4\u00b0C into GBSS supplemented with 2 mg/ml D-glucose and were then transferred onto porous (0.4 \u03bcm) transparent membrane inserts (30-mm in diameter; Millipore) with five slices on each insert. Inserts were then placed into six-well culture plates. Each well contained 1.2 ml of nutrient medium composed of 25% heat-inactivated horse serum, 25% HBSS and 50% MEM supplemented with 25 mM D-glucose. Neither antibiotics nor anti-mycotics were used. Plates were maintained in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% atmospheric air) at 37\u00b0C. Medium was changed every 2-3 days. The MEM medium was changed so that it contained only 5% horse serum and 25 mM D-glucose on the day that Tat or control medium was added. At various times following addition of Tat, supernatants were collected and stored at -80\u00b0C for measurement of cytokines. Slices were washed 3 times with cold PBS and stored at -80\u00b0C for isolation of total cellular RNA and for western blotting. Slice viability was evaluated using both propidium iodide (PI) staining and the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium by CytoTox96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity kit. Total cellular RNA from the hippocampus and cultured slices was extracted in TRIzol reagent, as previously described. Total mRNA (1-2 \u03bcg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit from Ambion. Samples were analyzed in duplicate. Data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle method, as described elsewhere (Applied Biosystems user bulletin no.2). TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 were measured in OHSCs supernatants with validated specific ELISA assays. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of each sample were added in duplicate to ELISA plates pre-coated with an anti-TNF\u03b1 or IL-6 capture antibody. Recombinant murine TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 standards ranged from 0 to 1,000 pg/ml. The lower assay limit of detection was 16 pg/ml. Absorbance was measured on an OPTImax ELISA plate reader. TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 concentrations are expressed as picograms per milliliter. Western blotting experiments were conducted as previously described, with minor modifications. Briefly, slices were lysed in cold lysis buffer. Equal amounts of protein (40 \u03bcg) were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred from the gel to PVDF membranes using a Bio-Rad Laboratories Mini Protein 3 system. After treating PVDF membranes with blocking buffer (TBS/0.1% Tween20 (TBST) containing 2% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, they were incubated overnight at 4 C with blocking buffer containing primary antibodies specific for phosphorylated p38 or p38, (1:1000 dilution). Membranes were washed extensively with TBST and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer. Finally, membranes were washed extensively with TBST and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Western Blot Detection Reagent. Blots were covered with transparency film and then inserted into a Fujifilm LAS-4000 System Configured for multifunctional analysis (Fujifilm, Life Science, Stamford, USA). Densitometric analysis of autoradiograms was performed using publically available IMAGE-J software from the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Densitometric summaries were expressed as ratios of phosphorylated p38 to total p38. Data were analyzed using a one-way (treatment) or two-way (pretreatment \u00d7 treatment) ANOVA, followed by a post hoc pairwise multiple comparison using Fischer's LSD test if the interaction was significant. All data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM. Differences were considered significant if the probability reached a level of 0.05 or less. Mice were treated with i.c.v. PBS or Tat (40ng). At 24 h post Tat, sickness and depressive-like behavior were assessed by body weight loss and FST, respectively. Consistent with our previous findings, the 24 h changes in body weight did not differ according to treatment (Figure 1A, p >0.05). Tat-treated mice displayed increased immobility in the FST at 24 h post-treatment compared to control mice (Figure 1B, p < 0.05). We recently found that central injection of HIV-1 Tat (40 ng) increased brain IDO and cytokine steady-state transcripts at 4 h. Here we determined whether the expression of IDO and cytokines response to Tat occurs in murine OHSCs as it does in the CNS in vivo. Based on the in vivo response to central injection of Tat, the time point of 6 h was selected for carrying out dose-response experiments to determine the effect of Tat on cytokine and IDO expression. Slices were exposed to 4, 40 and 400 ng/slice of Tat on day 10 in culture. As shown in Figure 2, Tat significantly increased TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and iNOS at the mRNA level (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum at 400 ng/slice. Tat-induced increases in TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA expression were paralleled by a concomitant increase in protein production (Figure 2, p < 0.05). Increased iNOS mRNA was not associated with any detectable increase in nitrite levels at the 6 h time point (data not shown). Induction of SERT mRNA reached a maximum at 4 ng/slice (Figure 2, p < 0.05). For kinetic studies, OHSCs were exposed to 40 ng/slice Tat for 2, 6 and 12 h on day 10 of culture. As shown in Figure 3, the greatest expression of both mRNA and protein for TNF\u03b1 occurred at 2 h (p < 0.05) and 6 h (p < 0.05), respectively. IL-6 mRNA peaked at 6 h (p < 0.05) and gradually decreased at 12 h. IL-6 concentration in the culture medium increased after 6 h (p < 0.05) and reached a maximum at 12 h (p < 0.05). iNOS and SERT mRNA increased at 6 h (p < 0.05) and peaked at 12 h (p < 0.05), but there was no concomitant increase in nitrite levels at any time point (data not shown). We also used real-time RT-PCR to determine whether Tat induces IDO steady-state transcripts in OHSCs as it does in vivo. To determine an optimal dose for Tat-induced expression of IDO, OHSCs were treated with 4, 40 and 400 ng/slice of Tat for 6 h. As shown in Figure 4A, IDO mRNA expression could be detected at 4 ng/slice Tat and peaked at 40 ng/slice Tat (p < 0.05). Kinetic studies were then carried out in which OHSCs were exposed to Tat (40 ng/slice) for 2, 6 and 12 h. As shown in Figure 4B, IDO mRNA could not be detected in OHSCs prior to addition of Tat (40 amplification cycles). However, IDO expression was significantly induced by Tat at 6 h (p < 0.05) with no further increase at 12 h. This effect was similar in intensity to that of exogenous IFN\u03b3 (10 ng/ml, Figure 4C, p < 0.05). Moreover, pretreatment of OHSCs with the same dose of IFN\u03b3 24 h before Tat markedly amplified IDO responses to Tat (Figure 4C, p < 0.01). However, the Tat-induced expression of IDO did not require endogenous synthesis of IFN\u03b3 because no IFN\u03b3 mRNA could be detected at 6 h in Tat-stimulated slices (40 amplification cycles, data not shown). In accordance with the results of others on the effects of Tat on p38 MAPK in various cell types, we confirmed that HIV-1 Tat can activate p38 MAPK in OHSCs. Slices were treated with Tat for 15, 30, 60 and 120 min respectively and the lysates were analyzed for phospho-p38 activity by Western blot analysis. We found that Tat induced significant phosphorylation of p38 MAPK as early as 15 min (Figure 5A, p < 0.05) with a maximum at 60 min (Figure 5A, p < 0.05). To determine whether p38 MAPK is involved in Tat-induced IDO expression, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190 was employed. We previously established that 30 \u03bcM SB 202190 significantly suppresses cytokine expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in response to LPS stimulation (data not shown). The dose of 30 uM was therefore selected for further experiments on Tat-induced IDO expression. Slices were pretreated with SB 202190 (30 \u03bcM) for 30 min before stimulation with Tat for another 6 h. SB 202190 abrogated the Tat-induced expression of IDO, IL-6, iNOS and SERT transcripts, although this effect was only partial for TNF\u03b1 mRNA (Figure 5B, p < 0.01). SB 202190 also fully blocked the Tat-induced release of cytokine proteins in the slice supernatants (Figure 5B, p < 0.01). Importantly, neither Tat nor SB 202190 affected viability of the cells, as determined by measuring both PI staining and release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway is necessary for the Tat-induced expression of both proinflammatory cytokines and IDO. Results of the present experiments establish that HIV-1 Tat induces depressive-like behavior in vivo and induces production of proinflammatory cytokine in vitro in murine OHSCs and increases expression of IDO and SERT. These changes are dependent on activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Our in vivo data show that Tat increases the duration of immobility in the forced swim test in mice without inducing any sickness, as measured by the lack of body weight loss. These data are in agreement with already published findings from our group on depressogenic activity of Tat. The mechanisms of the depressogenic activity of Tat were further investigated in vitro. Compared to primary cultures of brain cells, OHSCs have the advantage of preserving the cellular and connective organization as well as several fundamental in vivo-like characteristics such as glial-neuronal interactions. Although this preparation has previously been used for studying the detrimental effects of proinflammatory cytokines on long-term potentiation in the rat system, OHSCs have rarely been used for the investigation of neuroimmune interactions. Our previous experiments demonstrated that long term culture of OHSCs can be reliably used to study neuroimmune mechanisms of induction of IDO. We therefore employed OHSCs in the present experiments to study the mechanisms involved in the expression of IDO by Tat. Depression is an important comorbid condition of HIV infection. We previously demonstrated that IDO, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of KYN from the precursor of Trp, is both sufficient and necessary to mediate depressive-like behavior in response to either acute or chronic activation of the immune system in mice. Moreover, the increase in brain IDO activity is invariably preceded by enhanced expression of IDO mRNA, which can therefore be used as a surrogate marker of IDO activation. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of Tat on IDO mRNA in OHSCs. As shown in Figure 2, HIV-1 Tat protein significantly up-regulates IDO mRNA expression in OHSCs. These results are consistent with previous studies that describe Tat-mediated induction of the IDO expression in other types of cells. These in vitro data are also in accordance with our in vivo results showing that Tat induced depressive-like behavior is associated with increased expression of IDO in the brain. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence to indicate that activation of IDO in response to Tat stimulation in the brain could be a key event in the switch from sickness to depressive-like behavior. IFN\u03b3 is considered to be the prototypical inducer of IDO in a variety of cells as well as in clinical situations in which inflammation-associated depression occurs. Additionally, IFN\u03b3 is increased in the brain during HIV infection and synergizes with Tat to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of HAD. It is well documented that monocytes/macrophages/microglia can produce IFN\u03b3. However, IDO expression appears to be up-regulated in an IFN\u03b3-independent manner in HIV-infected human macrophages. IFN\u03b3 protein remained undetectable in HIV-infected human macrophage supernatants while IDO expression increased. Our data indicate that IDO induction by Tat does not necessarily require synthesis of IFN\u03b3 because no IFN\u03b3 transcripts could be detected at 6 h. These observations are in accordance with the results obtained by Boasso et al.. Boasso et al. reported that blockade of either type I or type II IFNs by antibodies was ineffective in preventing the induction of IDO in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to R5- or X4-trophic HIV. Therefore, our data extend the developing concept that IDO can be induced by Tat in an IFN\u03b3-independent mechanism. Addition of Tat to OHSCs induced the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are well known to stimulate HIV-1 replication and contribute to HIV pathogenesis. Increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain is observed in HIV-1 infected patients. Tat also can up-regulate cytokine expression, such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, in peripheral blood macrophages, CNS-derived cell lines and primary astrocytes, microglia and human monocytes. The large increase in proinflammatory cytokine expression could mediate IDO induction by Tat. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that IDO induction is associated to IL-1\u03b2. For instance, pretreatment in vivo with the anti-inflammatory tetracycline derivative minocycline attenuates LPS-induced expression of brain IL-1\u03b2, indicating that IL-1\u03b2 probably participates in LPS-induced expression of brain IDO. A synergistic activation of IDO by IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 has been reported in human monocytic THP-1 cells exposed to LPS. We observed that IL-1\u03b2 mRNA can be induced by Tat in OHSCs (data not shown). However, this induction does not lead to release of IL-1\u03b2 protein if exogenous ATP is not added to the culture. This is because ATP is necessary for processing and release of the mature IL-1\u03b2 protein. In the absence of IL-1\u03b2, the most likely mediators of IFN\u03b3-independent IDO induction in OHSCs are TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. IDO induction has been shown to be mediated mainly by TNF-\u03b1, but not by IL-6 in human monocytic THP-1 cell cultures exposed to immune stimulation. However, IL-6 can synergize with TNF-\u03b1 to increase IDO activity. The exact cytokine signaling pathways that are predominantly involved in the production of IDO in response to Tat in OHSCs remain to be elucidated. In addition to IDO induction by Tat, we observed a robust induction of SERT mRNA in response to Tat. This finding indicates that OHSCs can serve as a reliable in vitro model for investigating the possible contribution of serotonin re-uptake mechanisms in comorbid depressive disorders in HIV-infected patients. Whether this change at the mRNA level translates into functional changes in SERT remains to be established. This is an important perspective since differences in the expression and function of SERT are well known to affect many human and mouse quantitative traits, including anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. To elucidate the signaling pathways that mediate Tat-induced IDO expression, we examined whether Tat contributes to overexpression of IDO by activating p38 MAPK. This signaling pathway has been shown to be required for IDO expression in THP-1 cells following LPS stimulation. Moreover, HIV-1 Tat protein has been reported to activate p38 MAPK in a variety of cells, including monoctyes, macrophages, astrocytes and the human THP-1 cell line. We therefore tested the possibility that Tat-induced p38 promotes expression of IDO in OHSCs. SB 202190, a highly selective, potent and cell permeable inhibitor of p38 MAPK, was employed to inhibit p38 activation. It binds within the ATP pocket of the active kinase with a Kd of 38 nM, as measured in recombinant human p38, and selectively inhibits both the p38\u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms. We observed that SB 202190 significantly inhibited Tat-induction of IDO in OHSCs, which is consistent with the possibility that p38 may be involved in the development of Tat-induced depressive-like behavior. The demonstration of an inhibitory effect of SB 202190 on Tat-induced changes in OHSCs does not mean p38 MAPK signaling is directly responsible for these effects. Activation of p38 MAPK could act indirectly via NFkB activation or AP-1 activity at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The human IDO promoter region contains multiple AP-1 and NFkB sites. Therefore, the possibility that other transcription factors are involved in Tat-induced IDO expression cannot be dismissed. However, our data clearly demonstrate that Tat-induced IDO expression in OHSCs is mediated, at least in part, through a p38-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, results of the present studies demonstrate that p38 MAPK is potently involved in HIV-1 Tat-induced IDO expression. These studies provide further evidence for targeting the brain IDO and p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the treatment of depressive disorders associated with HIV infection."}, "22729903": {"pmid": "22729903", "pmcid": "PMC3404285", "title": "Contribution of STAT4 gene single-nucleotide polymorphism to systemic lupus erythematosus in the Polish population", "abstract": "\nThe STAT4 has been found to be a susceptible gene in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in various populations.

The course of SLE is unpredictable, with periods of remission and flare-ups. Moreover, this autoimmune disorder is vastly heterogeneous, with various clinical manifestations including malar and discoid rash, photosensitivity, arthritis, serositis, as well as renal, neurologic, hematologic, immunologic and mucocutaneous manifestations, and biosynthesis of a broad array of autoantibodies. The occurrence of SLE is nine times frequent in pre-menopausal women than in men. It is accepted that environmental factors together with genetic components are involved in the abnormal immune responses and pathogenesis of SLE [2\u20136]. Flare-ups of SLE can be triggered by various environmental components, such as exposure to ultraviolet light, drugs, chemicals, and viral infections. Candidate gene and genome wide association studies revealed numerous susceptibility genes of SLE, and the association of some of these genes have been confirmed among distinct populations. The immune cells from patients with SLE display many abnormalities, including reduced T cell cytotoxicity, abnormal function of CD4+ T cells, abnormal activation of B cells, and alterations in cytokine biosynthesis [7\u20139]. The STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) 4 gene is expressed in T and B cells, monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. STAT4 is a transcription factor and a member of the STAT family. Its expression may support the differentiation of immune cells to inflammatory subsets, production of inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies, prevention of apoptosis, and presentation of autoantigens, which may promote the development of autoimmune diseases. Several genome-wide association studies have identified STAT4 as an SLE susceptible gene in Caucasian and Asian populations [4, 5]. Recently, many studies have demonstrated the contribution of intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs7582694) and G\u00a0>\u00a0T (rs7574865) to the incidence of SLE and its clinical manifestations [11\u201319]. Both of these polymorphisms display complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Asian and Caucasian populations presented in HapMap CHB data (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). We studied the STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs7582694) polymorphism distribution in SLE patients in a sample from a Polish cohort. As SLE is a heterogeneous disorder, we also assessed the association of these polymorphisms with various clinical symptoms of SLE and the production of autoantibodies. Data for two hundred and fifty-three women fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology Classification criteria for SLE [20, 21] were collected in a random manner for the study at the Institute of Rheumatology in Warsaw, Poland (Table\u00a01). Controls included five hundred and twenty-one unrelated healthy volunteers and healthy women selected during medical examination at the Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw. Women with SLE and controls were of Polish and Caucasian origin and of a similar age. The mean age of SLE patients at diagnosis was 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0years, and of controls 33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0years. All participating subjects provided written consent. The study procedures were approved by the Local Ethical Committee of Pozna\u0144 University of Medical Sciences. DNA was isolated from peripheral leucocytes using a standard salting out procedure. Identification of the STAT4 C\u00a0>\u00a0G (rs7582694) polymorphic variant was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR\u2013RFLP). PCR was conducted employing primer pair 5\u2032 ATCCAACTCTTCTCAGCCCTT 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 TCATAATCAGGAGAGAGGAGT 3\u2032. The PCR-amplified fragments of STAT4 that were 338\u00a0bp in length were isolated and digested with the endonuclease HpyCH4III (ACN/GT) NewEngland BioLabs, (Ipswich, USA). The STAT4 C allele was cleaved into 258 and 80\u00a0bp fragments, whereas the STAT4 G allele remained uncut. DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 3\u00a0% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The STAT4 C\u00a0>\u00a0G polymorphism was confirmed by repeated PCR\u2013RFLP. The genotyping quality was examined by direct sequencing of approximately 10\u00a0% of the all samples. The distribution of genotypes in patients and controls was examined for deviation from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium using exact and log likelihood ratio \u03c72 tests (http://ihg.gsf.de/cgi-bin/hw/hwa1.pl). The polymorphism was tested for association with SLE incidence using the \u03c72 test for trend (p trend). The \u03c72 test was employed to examine differences in genotypic and allelic distribution between patients and controls, and a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Odds Ratio (OR) and 95\u00a0% Confidence Intervals (95\u00a0% CI) were calculated. Contribution of the STAT4 C\u00a0>\u00a0G polymorphism to clinical manifestations and the production of autoantibodies (Ab) was determined by \u03c72 test. The Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used and both p values, before (p) and after correction (p corr), were determined. Power analysis was performed using uncorrected \u03c72 test using Power and Sample Size Calculation program version 2.1.30. Distribution of STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C genotypes did not display significant deviation from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium between patients and healthy individuals. The prevalence of the STAT4 C/C genotype was 1.8-fold times higher in patients with SLE than in healthy individuals (Table\u00a02). The STAT4 C/G heterozygous frequency in patients was higher than in controls and amounted to 37 and 31\u00a0%, respectively (Table\u00a02). The OR for SLE patients with the C/C genotype as compared to the C/G and G/G genotypes was 1.967 (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.152\u20133.358, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0119) and OR for the C/C and C/G genotypes as compared to the G/G genotype was 1.583 (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.168\u20132.145, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0030) (Table\u00a02; Figure\u00a01S, online supplementary data). To evaluate the effect of the minor allele as a risk factor in SLE incidence, we also assessed the minor allele\u2019s distribution in patients and healthy individuals. The frequency of the STAT4 C allele was higher in patients with SLE compared to healthy individuals, with frequencies of 30 and 22\u00a0%, respectively (Table\u00a02). The OR for the STAT4 C allele frequency showed a 1.539-fold increased risk of SLE (95\u00a0% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.209\u20131.959, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) (Table\u00a02; Figure\u00a01S, online supplementary data). The p value of the \u03c72 test for the trend observed for the STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C polymorphism was also statistically significant (p trend\u00a0=\u00a00.0008). The statistical power of this study amounted to 84\u00a0% for the C/C or C/G genotypes and 69\u00a0% for the C/C genotype (Table\u00a02). We found an association between STAT4 C/C and C/G genotypes with renal OR\u00a0=\u00a02.259 (1.365\u20133.738, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0014), (p corr\u00a0=\u00a00.0238) and neurologic manifestations OR\u00a0=\u00a02.867 (1.467\u20135.604, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0016), (p corr\u00a0=\u00a00.0272) of the disease (Table\u00a01; Figure\u00a02S, online supplementary data). Moreover, we observed a significant association between the STAT4 C/C and C/G genotypes and the presence of anti-snRNP Ab OR\u00a0=\u00a03.237 (1.667\u20136.288, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003), (p corr\u00a0=\u00a00.0051). There was also significant association between the C/C and C/G genotypes and the anti-Scl-70 Ab OR\u00a0=\u00a02.665 (1.380\u20135.147, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0028), (p corr\u00a0=\u00a00.0476) (Table\u00a03; Figure\u00a03S, online supplementary data). STATs include DNA-interacting transcription factors that trigger the expression of the DNA\u2019s target genes by recognizing specific DNA regulatory sequences. The expression of STATs has been observed in a vast range of cell types, however the expression of STAT4 mainly takes place in immune cells and the testis. STAT4 is essential for signal transduction by interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-23 (IL-23), and type 1 interferon (IFN) in T cells and monocytes. IL-12 induces the STAT4-dependent NK cell activation and differentiation of naive CD4+ lymphocytes into Th1 effector cells and IFN\u03b3 production [23\u201325]. STAT4 also mediates the IL-23-dependent expansion of Th17 cells, contributing to autoimmune diseases. It has been demonstrated that STAT4-deficient mice display reduced manifestation of T cell-linked experimental autoimmune diseases including encephalomyelitis, arthritis, myocarditis, colitis, and autoimmune diabetes. Moreover, STAT4 deficiency results in a reduction of IFN\u03b3 biosynthesis in immune cells. Accordingly, an association between disease activity in SLE patients and activation of the type 1 IFN system has been observed. We observed that STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs7582694) intronic substitution may significantly increase the risk of SLE occurrence in a sample of the Polish population. Recent studies carried out by Luan et al. demonstrated a statistically significant contribution of STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs7582694) to SLE incidence in the Mainland Chinese female population. The association of the STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0T (rs7574865) polymorphism with SLE development was also previously observed in other Asian ethnic groups residing in Hong Kong, Northern Han of China, and Japan [14\u201319]. The contribution of the STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs7582694) or STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0T (rs7574865) polymorphisms to SLE incidence was also observed in large groups of patients of European origin, among them a Finnish family cohort as well as Spanish, Swedish and other populations [11\u201313, 29, 30]. The SNP rs7574865 has also been confirmed as a genetic risk factor in the incidence of SLE in Colombian, Mexican, and Argentinian cohorts [30, 31]. However, the rs7574865 polymorphism has not been found to be a risk factor for SLE in the Turkish population. In our study, patients with the STAT4 C/C or G/C genotypes exhibited a significantly increased risk of developing either renal or neurologic manifestations of SLE. An association between the STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0T (rs7574865) polymorphism and nepthritis has also been demonstrated in Americans of European descent. Moreover, the contribution of STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs7582694) or STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0T (rs7574865) SNPs to the production of double-stranded DNA autoantibodies has been found in Swedish and American Europeans [11, 12, 33]. The STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0T (rs7574865) SNP has also been associated with antiphospholipid syndrome in Italian cohorts, as has the production of anti-Sm antibodies in a Northern Han Chinese population. Additionally, other STAT4 SNPs were correlated with lupus nephritis, arthritis, and the production of anti-SSA/B autoantibodies in a Northern Han Chinese population. The different effects of the STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs7582694) or STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0T (rs7574865) SNPs on clinical manifestations in various ethnicities may result from different sizes of the studied groups, genetic heterogeneity or patient interaction with disparate environmental factors. STAT4 gene variants have also been found to be risk factors for other autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, asthma, systemic sclerosis, and Sjogren\u2019s syndrome [35\u201339]. The role of STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs7582694) or STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0T (rs7574865) SNPs in the expression of STAT4 have been studied [12, 30]. Abelson et al. (2009) used quantitative PCR to demonstrate significantly higher levels of STAT4 mRNA in mononuclear cells bearing the SLE risk TT genotypes as compared to cells having the GG or GT genotypes of the rs7574865 SNP. Moreover, Sigurdsson et al. indicated that gene variants having the rs8179673 SNP in almost perfect pair-wise LD with rs7582694 led to over-expression of STAT4 in pooled primary human osteoblasts. Our genetic studies are consistent with other studies that have demonstrated the STAT4 G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs7582694) intronic substitution as a significant risk factor of SLE incidence. Moreover, we found that this SNP can be associated with renal and neurological symptoms of SLE. Since this autoimmune disease is vastly heterogeneous, further studies of this polymorphism\u2019s effects on clinical manifestations of SLE in other populations would be valuable."}, "24535067": {"pmid": "24535067", "pmcid": "PMC3930766", "title": "Prevention of etomidate-induced myoclonus: Which is superior: Fentanyl, midazolam, or a combination?

Previous studies reported that at 0.3 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 induction doses, etomidate does not cause significant alterations in heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures, right atrial pressure, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, stroke volume, cardiac index, systemic blood flow, and shunt flow in pediatric patients undergoing congenital cardiac shunt surgery and in adults [1\u20137]. Induction of anesthesia with etomidate results in dose-dependent myoclonus in 50\u201380% of patients without premedication. In addition to increasing the risk of aspiration in patients with a full stomach, myoclonus may also increase intraocular pressures and cause problems in patients who will undergo open eye surgery. The incidence of myoclonus is reduced by one-half when pretreatment with 100 \u03bcg fentanyl 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia is made, but the incidence of apnea is increased. It was shown that midazolam pretreatment decreased myoclonus induced by etomidate, and increasing the dose of midazolam from 0.015 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 to 0.05 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 did not further decrease the incidence of myoclonus. There are no reported comparative studies that have investigated whether fentanyl or midazolam is a better option in the prevention of myoclonus due to etomidate. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacies of fentanyl, midazolam, or their half-dose combinations in preventing myocloni when they were administered prior to induction of anesthesia with etomidate. This retrospective comparative study was performed based on anesthesia records over a period of 6 months. Eighty adult patients with ASA I\u2013II physiologic score and who would undergo various operations under general anesthesia were included in the study. Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate, the patients were separated into 4 groups: no pretreatment (Group NP), fentanyl 1 \u03bcg/kg (Group F), midazolam 0.03 mg/kg (Group M), and midazolam 0.015 mg/kg + fentanyl 0.5 \u03bcg/kg (Group FM). The incidence of myoclonus in the no pretreatment group (Group NP) was estimated to be 80%, based on previous studies. Power analysis with \u03b1=0.05 and \u03b2=0.2 for determining the myoclonus frequency under 50% revealed that each group required a minimum of 17 patients. However, each group included 20 patients according to the admission date. The patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected: 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs (fentanyl, midazolam or combination of both), anesthesia is induced with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate (Etomidate-Lipuro, B. Braun Melsungen AG, D-34209 Melsungen, Germany), injected intravenously over a period of 20\u201330 seconds. Two minutes after the end of etomidate injection, muscle relaxation with 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium was achieved and endotracheal intubation was performed after another 2 minutes. Following etomidate injection, mask ventilation with 100% O2 was carried out until intubation. Anesthesia was maintained using 1.5\u20132.5% concentration of sevoflurane in a mixture of O2 and air that contained 50% O2. Patients who took sedative and analgesic drugs within the 24 hours before the operation were excluded from the study. Myoclonic movements were evaluated, which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection: 0=no myoclonus, 1=mild myoclonus (small movements in 1 body segment, such as finger or wrist), 2=moderate (slight movements in 2 or more muscle areas, such as face or shoulder), and 3=severe (intense movements in 2 or more muscle areas, sudden adduction of an extremity). The severity of pain due to etomidate injection was evaluated using a 4-grade scale: 0=no pain, 1=mild (pain reported only when asked), 2=moderate (pain reported without being asked or reported when asked and there were associated behavioral symptoms), and 3=severe (verbal response, grimacing, pulling the arm, tearing in the eyes). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) recordings were evaluated during the time between entrance into the operating room and 5 minutes after intubation. Decreases in peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2 <90%), arrhythmia, and other adverse effects were also evaluated. The data were registered and analyzed using the SPSS 16.0 for Windows software. Chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between the groups. The distribution of group means was evaluated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and after they were found to have normal distribution, 1-way analysis of variance was used to compare the hemodynamic parameters between the groups. Hemodynamic parameter changes in the groups relative to the baseline during each measurement period were evaluated using repeated measurements analysis of variance. Tukey HSD and Dunnett tests were used post hoc to determine the groups showing a statistically significant difference. Data are shown as mean \u00b1s.d. or the number of cases. Statistical significance level was accepted as p<0.05. There were no differences between the groups with respect to mean age, weight, height, ASA physiologic score, sex distribution, and injection pain (p>0.05, Table 1). Pretreatment with either fentanyl or fentanyl-midazolam combination decreased the frequency and severity of myoclonic movements arising after anesthesia induction with etomidate (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively (Table 2). During the study period, none of the patients had a decrease in peripheral oxygen saturation, arrhythmia, or any other adverse effects. Mean arterial pressure measurements after induction were significantly lower in groups F and FM compared to the no pretreatment group (p<0.001). Intragroup comparison showed that MAP had significant reductions to the basal values in Groups F and FM (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). All groups except group FM had significant increases in MAP 2 minutes after intubation (Table 3). Intergroup comparisons showed that mean heart rate values after induction were significantly lower in Groups F and FM compared to Group NP. Intragroup comparisons showed that Group NP had significant elevations which later returned to basal values 5 minutes after intubation (p<0.001). Group F never had significant elevations compared to basal values, whereas group M had significant elevations at all periods (p<0.01 and p<0.001). In group FM, only the HR measurements taken 2 minutes after intubation were significantly higher than basal values (p<0.01, Table 4). The results of this study show that the incidence of myoclonus was 85% in the no pretreatment group after etomidate injection; this finding was similar to the others reported in the literature [8,11\u201319]. The incidence of myoclonus due to etomidate depends on the dosage and speed of injection. In healthy volunteers, Doenicke et al. demonstrated that increased doses of etomidate were correlated with the frequency of myocloni, which was 83% with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate. None of the patients had myocloni in doses under 0.05 mg/kg. Do et al. investigated the effects of slow and rapid etomidate injection rates at 0.3 mg/kg doses on the frequency of myocloni, and observed that 84% of the patients developed myocloni when the drug was administered over a period of 10 seconds, whereas 28% of the patients developed myocloni when the injection was made slowly over a period of 2 minutes. Nyman et al. showed that myocloni developed in 85% of children given 0.3 mg\u00b7kg\u22121 intravenous etomidate over a period of 5\u201310 seconds. In our study, we found similar rates of myocloni when etomidate was given over a period of 20 seconds. Doenicke showed that after 0.3 mg/kg etomidate, myocloni occurred 80\u2013360 (mean 160) seconds after the injection, and lasted 40\u2013400 (mean 160) seconds. The duration of clinical observation in etomidate-induced myocloni range from 1 to 3 minutes according to various studies. In these studies the incidence of myocloni decreased as the observation period was shortened. Huter et al. applied cardioversion 1 minute after administration of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate, and found that the rate of myoclonus was 50%. Satilmis et al. investigated the efficacy of magnesium sulphate in the prevention of etomidate-induced myoclonus and gave vecuronium to their patients 1 minute after injection of 0.2 mg/kg etomidate. The frequency of myoclonus in patients who received premedication with isotonic saline was 55%. Patients who did not receive premedication and were treated with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate followed by vecuronium 2 and 3 minutes later had 77% and 84% myoclonus rates, respectively. In our study we gave the neuromuscular blocker 2 minutes after 0.3 mg/kg etomidate administration, and observed myoclonic movements during this time. The results in our control group were in concordance with other studies having the same observation period length. When the clinical observation period that aims to detect myoclonic movements is shortened, it may result in the suppression of a possibly delayed myoclonus by a neuromuscular blocker and thereby result in lower rates. We believe further studies are necessary to determine the optimal length of observation needed to determine the incidence of myoclonus after etomidate injection. A study that investigated EEG alterations in patients with etomidate-induced myoclonus stressed the correlation between myoclonus and the increase in delta waves in EEG recordings. In this study, myoclonus was observed to be synchronized with slow and continuous waves on EEG, and it was not a typical seizure. There were no changes except for delta waves in EEG recordings throughout the myoclonic episode. The possible cause of myoclonus during anesthesia induction using etomidate is thought to be subcortical disinhibition. The decreased incidence of myoclonus when using premedication with drugs such as benzodiazepines and fentanyl, which are known to inhibit subcortical neuronal activity, supports this hypothesis. Fentanyl is a \u03bc-opioid receptor antagonist that causes dose-dependent analgesia, respiratory depression, and sedation. The inhibitory effects of midazolam on the central nervous system act through GABAA receptors. The site of action where fentanyl and midazolam prevent the myoclonus occurring after etomidate injection is not clear. However, the prevention of myoclonus by fentanyl and midazolam is a result of inhibition in the central nervous system, although their actions are mediated by different receptors. In our study, fentanyl and midazolam combination was more effective in the prevention of myoclonus compared to use of either drug alone. We observed that the myoclonus rate decreased to 40% (8/20) in the group that received 1 \u03bcg/kg fentanyl before anesthesia induction with etomidate, and to 25% (6/20) in the group that received both 0.5 \u03bcg/kg fentanyl and 0.015 mg/kg midazolam. We also found that 0.03 mg/kg midazolam was inadequate for preventing myoclonus. Although the frequency of myocloni was lower in the group in which fentanyl and midazolam were used together compared to the use of either drug alone, we found that they had no additive or synergistic effect. It has been shown that midazolam and fentanyl display a synergy when used together. However, in the fentanyl+midazolam combination, the use of half the dosage of the drugs compared to when either of them was applied alone can explain why we saw no additive or synergistic effect. Stocham et al. reported that premedication with fentanyl decreased etomidate-induced myoclonus in a dose-dependent manner, but it increased the risk of apnea. They observed that none of the patients who received premedication with 500 \u03bcg fentanyl 5 minutes before anesthesia induction using etomidate had a myoclonus, but all developed apnea. Respiratory depression was less when 100 \u03bcg fentanyl was given, and the rate of myoclonus was 33%. Giese et al. reported that premedication with 100 \u03bcg fentanyl significantly decreased the rate of etomidate-induced myoclonus; however, it introduced the risk of respiratory depression. Similarly, the rate of myoclonus in our patients premedicated with 1 \u03bcg/kg fentanyl was 40%, but none of our patients sustained any episodes of apnea or desaturation. The mean fentanyl dose in our study was 72\u00b116 \u03bcg. Myoclonus rates in studies using 100 \u03bcg fentanyl and in our study were not different, and we believe that lower doses of fentanyl in our study prevented apneic episodes. Our results show that 0.03 mg/kg midazolam was not effective in preventing myocloni. The rate of myoclonus was 60% in patients who were treated with midazolam. Huter et al. reported that in patients undergoing elective cardioversion, 0.015 mg/kg midazolam pretreatment 90 seconds prior to anesthesia induction with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate provided significant reduction in the frequency of myocloni compared to the control group (10% vs. 50%). Huter et al. used a shorter observation period (1 minute) than our study, and most of their patients were under magnesium treatment, which account for the difference. Schwarzkopf et al. showed that 0.015 mg/kg midazolam significantly reduced the rate of myoclonus compared to the control group (20% vs. 90%). Premedication with oral midazolam and shorter observation period (1 minute) for myoclonus, in contrast to our study, may be the causes for lower incidence. Hwang et al. found that 0.05 mg/kg midazolam pretreatment given 60 seconds prior to induction with 0.3 mg/kg etomidate reduced the rate of myoclonus to 17%, which was 77% in the control group using placebo. The higher dose used in our study may be one of the causes. We therefore conclude that the efficacy of midazolam in prevention of etomidate-induced myoclonus may be correlated with dose, and studies that are better standardized in that aspect are needed. High osmotic pressure in the etomidate formulation is thought to cause injection pain. The injection pain is reported to be significantly less in lipid-emulsified etomidate compared to etomidate dissolved in propylene glycol. We found the injection pain rate of the lipid solution was 0\u201310%, which is similar in results in the literature. During evaluation of the hemodynamic effects of etomidate, the control group was also analyzed to exclude the influences of study drugs used in premedication. The results show that etomidate did not cause a significant difference in hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction. Although the increase in HR was statistically significant, the difference was less than 15% compared to basal values. These findings correlate with those of previous studies [1\u20137]. The absence of any recording of the onset time of myoclonus within the 2-minute observation period and of its duration was a limiting factor for our study. Studies that will enable investigation of the onset time and duration of myoclonus after etomidate injection may provide us with useful information on the optimal pretreatment time. We found that both the combination of 0.5 \u03bcg/kg fentanyl with 0.015 mg/kg midazolam and 1 \u03bcg/kg fentanyl alone were effective in the prevention of myocloni caused by anesthesia induction with etomidate and observed in high rates in patients without premedication. Premedication with 0.03 mg/kg midazolam alone was insufficient for the prevention of myoclonus."}, "24768818": {"pmid": "24768818", "pmcid": "PMC4058747", "title": "Structural Mechanisms Determining Inhibition of the Collagen Receptor DDR1 by Selective and Multi-Targeted Type II Kinase Inhibitors", "abstract": "\nThe discoidin domain receptors (DDRs), DDR1 and DDR2, form a unique subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by the binding of triple-helical collagen. Excessive signaling by DDR1 and DDR2 has been linked to the progression of various human diseases, including fibrosis, atherosclerosis and cancer. We report the inhibition of these unusual receptor tyrosine kinases by the multi-targeted cancer drugs imatinib and ponatinib, as well as the selective type II inhibitor DDR1-IN-1. Ponatinib is identified as the more potent molecule, which inhibits DDR1 and DDR2 with an IC50 of 9\u00a0nM. Co-crystal structures of human DDR1 reveal a DFG-out conformation (DFG, Asp-Phe-Gly) of the kinase domain that is stabilized by an unusual salt bridge between the activation loop and \u03b1D helix. Differences to Abelson kinase (ABL) are observed in the DDR1 P-loop, where a \u03b2-hairpin replaces the cage-like structure of ABL. P-loop residues in DDR1 that confer drug resistance in ABL are therefore accommodated outside the ATP pocket. Whereas imatinib and ponatinib bind potently to both the DDR and ABL kinases, the hydrophobic interactions of the ABL P-loop appear poorly satisfied by DDR1-IN-1 suggesting a structural basis for its DDR1 selectivity. Such inhibitors may have applications in clinical indications of DDR1 and DDR2 overexpression or mutation, including lung cancer.\n", "fulltext": "The discoidin domain receptors (DDRs), DDR1 and DDR2, are unique among the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in being activated by interaction with the extracellular matrix. Binding to triple-helical collagen is mediated by the receptor extracellular domains that include an N-terminal discoidin (DS) domain, a DS-like domain and a short juxtamembrane (JM) region [3\u20135]. A single transmembrane helix links to the cytoplasmic domain, where a larger JM region precedes the catalytic C-terminal kinase domain. Both DDRs form constitutive dimers making them unusual among RTKs, which typically dimerize only upon activation [6\u20138]. DDRs regulate extracellular matrix remodeling, as well as cell adhesion, proliferation and migration. DDR1 is expressed mainly in epithelial cells where it plays an important role in mammary gland development, whereas mesenchymal expression of DDR2 promotes bone growth, as suggested by dwarfism in DDR2 knockout mice. DDR kinases are linked to the progression of various human diseases, including fibrotic disorders, atherosclerosis and cancer. Significantly, they are identified as indicators of poor prognosis in ovarian, breast and lung cancer [14\u201316]. DDR1 overexpression is associated with increased cell survival and invasion in hepatocellular carcinomas, pituitary adenoma and prostate cancer [17\u201319], whereas DDR2 is mutated in squamous cell lung cancers and contributes to breast cancer metastasis. The promise of DDR kinases as a therapeutic target has been demonstrated by DDR1 knockdown that has been shown to reduce metastatic activity in lung cancer models, slow the development of atherosclerosis and impede the development of fibrotic disorders [23\u201325]. Imatinib (STI-571) is a first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted at breakpoint cluster region-Abelson kinase (ABL) for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). As a type II inhibitor, imatinib achieves significant selectivity by binding to an inactive DFG-out conformation (DFG, Asp-Phe-Gly) of the kinase domain. A chemical proteomics study recently identified DDR1 as a secondary target of imatinib, leading to the suggestion that DDR1 inhibition may also contribute to the effectiveness of the treatment, particularly as activation of DDR1 is known to block p53-mediated apoptosis. Further characterization of this interaction revealed imatinib to be a potent inhibitor of DDR1, as were the second-generation TKIs nilotinib and dasatinib. Moreover, dasatinib may have potential to treat squamous cell lung cancer in patients harboring oncogenic mutations in DDR2. Imatinib also rescues mouse models of fibrosis similarly to DDR1 deficiency, although a connection between these effects has yet to be proven. Ponatinib is a third-generation TKI developed for the treatment of CML patients with resistance to imatinib. It was selected primarily to circumvent the steric hindrance introduced by the ABL T315I \u201cgatekeeper\u201d mutation and has proven to be a more potent but considerably less selective inhibitor than imatinib. Finally, the inhibitor DDR1-IN-1 was designed to a similar pharmacophore model as these multi-targeted type II kinase inhibitors but has been recently reported as a highly selective pharmacological probe for DDR1-dependent signal transduction. Such inhibitors will be highly valuable to investigate further the complex roles of DDR1 in both normal and pathobiology. In addition, more selective compounds are likely to offer improved safety profiles for potential clinical indications outside oncology. While crystal structures of DDR1 and DDR2 have revealed the molecular basis for extracellular collagen interaction, a structural description of the kinase domain fold is lacking. Here, we present the crystal structures of the kinase domain of human DDR1 in complexes with the inhibitors imatinib and ponatinib, as well as structural comparisons to the selective inhibitor DDR1-IN-1. The structures reveal differences to ABL in both the shape and the sequence of the ATP pocket that can be exploited for the design of DDR1-specific inhibitors. The kinase domain of human DDR1 (residues 601\u2013913; Fig.\u00a01a) was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified using nickel affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Crystal structures (Fig.\u00a01b) were determined in separate complexes with the kinase inhibitors imatinib and ponatinib, respectively (Fig.\u00a01c). The ponatinib co-structure was solved by molecular replacement using tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) (PDB ID: 4AT5) as a search model and refined at 1.9\u00a0\u00c5 resolution (see Table\u00a01 for data collection and refinement statistics). The complete main chain was traceable, except for residues 721\u2013731, which were not visible in the electron density map. This site, corresponding to a small kinase insert domain (KID), was one of several sequence insertions identified relative to the comparable kinase domain structure of ABL (Fig.\u00a01d). The DDR1\u2013imatinib complex structure was solved subsequently using data collected from crystals improved by microseeding procedures (see Materials and Methods). The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 1.7\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. Disordered regions in the imatinib co-structure were identified in both the KID region and a portion of the activation segment spanning residues 799\u2013803. The two inhibitor complexes exhibited distinct crystal packing leading to small differences in their respective structures (Fig.\u00a02). DDR1 was monomeric in the imatinib complex, consistent with its size-exclusion profile, whereas the ponatinib complex formed a crystallographic dimer with an additional ponatinib molecule bound at the dimer interface (Fig.\u00a02). Overall, DDR1 displays the classical bilobal architecture of a tyrosine kinase (Fig.\u00a01b). An N-terminal extension folds across the top of the smaller N-terminal lobe, which comprises \u03b21\u2013\u03b25 strands and the \u03b1C helix. In the \u03b1-helical C-terminal lobe, the activation segment includes an additional \u03b2-hairpin motif formed by strands \u03b28 and \u03b29 (Fig.\u00a01b and d). As observed for ABL, both type II inhibitors induce an inactive conformation of DDR1 characterized by a \u201cDFG-Asp out, \u03b1C-Glu in\u201d configuration. In this conformation, the catalytically relevant salt bridge is observed between DDR1 residues Glu672 (\u03b1C) and Lys655 (\u03b23), but the remaining catalytic site is disrupted by an inverted conformation of the DFG motif in the activation loop (A-loop). Comparable inhibitor-bound structures of DDR1 and ABL show a global root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.6\u00a0\u00c5 over 248 C\u03b1 atoms (Fig.\u00a03a), with identical values for the respective imatinib and ponatinib complexes. DDR1 contains a notable insertion between the \u03b22 and \u03b23 strands, where amino acids 629\u2013650 form a structured loop of 22 residues that is double the length of the same region in the closely related kinases insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), MUSK (muscle, skeletal receptor tyrosine protein kinase) and TrkB. These residues fold across the top of the N-lobe forming hydrophobic interactions with the N-terminal extension and \u03b25 strand. The N-lobes also differ in the P-loop, which in DDR1 remains bound to \u03b23 as a \u03b2-hairpin in contrast to the cage-like structure of ABL that dissociates to envelope the bound imatinib (Fig.\u00a03a). Two additional sequence insertions are identified in the C-lobe. Firstly, DDR1 contains a small KID located between helices \u03b1D and \u03b1E, although 12 of these 23 residues are disordered (Fig.\u00a03a). Secondly, an insert of 7 residues follows the DDR1 \u03b1G helix leading to a difference of 6.8\u00a0\u00c5 in the positions of the DDR1 and ABL chains at this site (Fig.\u00a03a). Similar insertions are predicted in DDR2, although the KID region appears 9 residues shorter in this protein (Fig.\u00a01d). The two DDR family members share 68% sequence identity within their kinase domains, with the highest conservation as expected in the catalytic core and activation segments. In particular, the P-loop and ATP pocket residues of DDR1 and DDR2 are strictly conserved suggesting that their inhibitor binding preferences will be similar. Both kinases contain three potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in their A-loops corresponding to DDR1 Tyr792, Tyr796 and Tyr797. Their packing closely matches that of the conserved residues in the inactive structures of IGF1R, MUSK and TrkB (Fig.\u00a03b). In particular, DDR1 Tyr796 adopts a conserved position as a pseudosubstrate, as observed also for the single tyrosine in ABL (Fig.\u00a03b). Mass spectrometry confirmed that the DDR1 kinase domain was expressed and purified in a non-phosphorylated state. Perhaps the most important sequence changes in the DDR family occur in the P-loop, where ABL mutations conferring imatinib resistance (Gly250Glu and Tyr253Phe) match the native DDR sequence (DDR1 Glu618 and Phe621, respectively). In ABL, Tyr253 forms a hydrogen bond with Asn322 to stabilize the cage-like structure of the P-loop, while Gly250 likely contributes to the flexibility required for this fold (Fig.\u00a04). This P-loop conformation also affords additional van der Waals interactions with the inhibitor. As a result of its phenylalanine substitution, the same hydrogen bond cannot be formed in DDR1 and its P-loop retains the common \u03b2-hairpin conformation. Interestingly, the missing P-loop interactions are replaced by the A-loop, which inserts DDR1 Arg789 into the ATP pocket to hydrogen bond with the Asn322-equivalent residue Asp708 (Fig.\u00a04). This conformation is further stabilized by main-chain hydrogen bonding between the P-loop and A-loop (data not shown). Thus, the alternative structure of DDR1 removes Glu618 and Phe621 from the binding site into solvent while maintaining suitable ATP pocket interactions for inhibitor binding. As anticipated, the binding of both type II inhibitors is facilitated by an inverted conformation of the DFG motif that exposes an additional binding pocket below the \u03b1C for the inhibitor tail, while the head groups bind to the hinge. In total, imatinib forms six hydrogen bonds in the ATP pocket of DDR1 (Fig.\u00a05a). Two target the hinge region, including one between the pyridine head group and the backbone amide of Met704 and one between the aminopyrimidine and the gatekeeper residue Thr701. Two more are made by the linker: the amide binds to Glu672 in the \u03b1C, while the carbonyl contacts the backbone amide of Asp784 in the DFG motif. Finally, the methylpiperazine group occupies a hydrophobic pocket between the \u03b1C and HRD (His-Arg-Asp) motif and hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of Val763 and His764. The DFG motif further stabilizes the binding with a \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction between Phe785 and the aminopyrimidine group (Fig.\u00a05a). The strong binding of DDR1 to imatinib was revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), which indicated a dissociation constant (KD) of 1.9\u00a0nM (Fig.\u00a05b). To confirm the ability of imatinib to inhibit DDR1 kinase activity in cells, we measured its ability to block collagen-induced DDR1 autophosphorylation in U2OS cells. Again, imatinib demonstrated significant potency against DDR1 yielding an EC50 of 21\u00a0nM. By design, ponatinib binds at the same site with the loss of one hydrogen bond owing to the ethynyl linker, which removes any polar interaction with the gatekeeper residue Thr701 (Fig.\u00a06a). Hinge interactions are made instead by an imidazo[1,2b]pyridazine head group, which establishes the hydrogen bond with Met704. In addition to the remaining four hydrogen bonds, there are extensive hydrophobic interactions across the DDR1 pocket, although the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interaction with Phe785 is broken (Fig.\u00a06a). The added trifluoromethyl group occupies the pocket vacated by the inverted DFG motif and forms favorable hydrophobic contacts with Leu679, Ile684, Ile685, Leu757 and Ile782 (Fig.\u00a06a). ITC measurements suggested that the ponatinib interaction was slightly stronger than imatinib, with a calculated KD of 1.3\u00a0nM (Fig.\u00a06b). Similar potency was observed in U2OS cells, where ponatinib inhibited collagen-induced DDR1 autophosphorylation with an EC50 of 2.5\u00a0nM (Fig.\u00a06d). The tight binding of both inhibitors can be understood from the similar inhibitor binding modes of DDR1 and ABL, which share a conserved threonine gatekeeper in their hinge regions (Supplementary Fig. S1). Importantly for inhibitor design, the ATP pocket of DDR1 also shows a number of sequence changes. Several substitutions cluster around the inhibitor tail region, where DDR1 Ile675 (\u03b1C), Leu679 (\u03b1C), Ile684 (\u03b1C-\u03b24 loop) and Ile685 (\u03b1C-\u03b24 loop) replace ABL Val289, Ile293, Leu298 and Val299, respectively. Other changes include Tyr703 (ABL Phe317) in the hinge and Met699 (ABL Ile313, \u03b25), which packs above the methylphenyl linker. Recently we reported the discovery of a type II kinase inhibitor, DDR1-IN-1, with striking selectivity for DDR1 (Fig.\u00a07a; PDB ID: 4CKR). This inhibitor binds the DFG-out conformation of DDR1 in a similar fashion to imatinib. The carbonyl of its indolin-2-one head group forms a hydrogen bond with Met704 in the hinge, similar to the interactions of imatinib and ponatinib (Fig.\u00a07b). However, the ether bridge of DDR1-IN-1 eliminates the hydrogen bond to the gatekeeper residue Thr701. Similar binding interactions are also observed across the tail region of DDR1-IN-1 (Fig.\u00a07c), where the trifluoromethyl groups of both DDR1-IN-1 and ponatinib occupy the same hydrophobic pocket created by the flip of the DFG motif. To rationalize why DDR1-IN-1 is selective for DDR1 (IC50\u00a0=\u00a0105\u00a0nM) relative to ABL (IC50\u00a0=\u00a01.8\u00a0\u03bcM), we modeled the DDR1 co-crystal structure (PDB ID: 4CKR) onto the ABL\u2013imatinib complex (PDB ID: 2HYY). While the overall binding modes of the two inhibitors are predicted to be similar, one notable difference is that the ether bridge of DDR1-IN-1 adopts a different dihedral angle relative to the aniline NH of imatinib (Fig.\u00a07b). As a result, the indolin-2-one head group of DDR1-IN-1 is orientated away from the ABL P-loop disrupting critical hydrophobic interactions with ABL Tyr253 and the hydrogen bond to the gatekeeper threonine (Fig.\u00a07d). In addition, the hydrogen bond between Met318 in the ABL hinge and the lactam carbonyl of DDR-IN-1 is predicted to be approximately 3.0\u00a0\u00c5, which is longer than the 2.6\u00a0\u00c5 hydrogen bond observed in the DDR1 complex. These predictions require examination of an experimental ABL structure with DDR1-IN-1. Finally, to investigate the chemical features required in the linker and tail moieties of DDR1-IN-1, we prepared seven analogs and tested their ability alongside imatinib and ponatinib to inhibit DDR1 and DDR2 kinase activity (Table\u00a02 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Ponatinib potently inhibited both DDR kinases with an IC50 of 9\u00a0nM. Inhibition by imatinib was slightly weaker with DDR1 and DDR2 exhibiting IC50 values of 41 and 71\u00a0nM, respectively. DDR1-IN-1 also retained significant activity against DDR1 (IC50\u00a0=\u00a0105\u00a0nM) despite the loss of the hydrogen bond to Thr701 and a reduction in the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking interaction that is observed between Phe785 and imatinib. We found that potency against the DDR kinases was decreased slightly when the amide between the linker and tail moieties was replaced with urea (1). Replacement of the methylpiperazine with an ether-linked methylpiperidine (2) resulted in a compound that retained the potency of DDR1-IN-1. Switching to a 3,5-substitution pattern (3,4) resulted in a slight decrease in potency relative to the 3,4-substitution pattern of DDR1-IN-1. Deletion of the methylpiperazine was tolerated when a hydrophobic 3-position substituent was maintained (5). Removal of the trifluoromethyl group resulted in analogs (6,7) that were inactive suggesting that a hydrophobic interaction near the DFG motif is likely essential for DDR1-IN-1. The structures presented here were solved at high resolution and show in detail how DDR1 achieves high affinity for imatinib and ponatinib, respectively. Both type II inhibitors bind in their more potent extended conformations to the inactive DFG-out conformation of the kinase domain. Differences to ABL are observed primarily in the P-loop, where DDR1 adopts the active conformation common to the KIT\u2013imatinib complex (KIT, mast/stem cell growth factor receptor). As a result, residues in the DDR1 P-loop that confer drug resistance when introduced in ABL are solvent exposed and tolerated. DDR1 also assembles a cage-like structure around the inhibitor pocket by tethering the activation segment to the \u03b1D helix. This alternative loop arrangement stabilizes the DFG-out conformation of DDR1 and establishes a distinct packing from other structures. This conformation is exploited by the first DDR1-selective type II inhibitors that carry variant head and linker moieties that restrict interaction with the gatekeeper residue. Interestingly, the ether bridge of DDR1-IN-1 is also found in the MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) inhibitor LY2801653, which has entered clinical trials for advanced cancer and inhibits DDR1 with IC50 and EC50 values of less than 1\u00a0nM. Imatinib-mediated inhibition of breakpoint cluster region-ABL has shown remarkable safety and efficacy against CML. Perhaps more significantly, the recognition of imatinib activity against other kinases, notably KIT and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), has led to its effective use in other oncology indications and ongoing clinical trials in fibrosis. Collagen-induced activation of the RTKs DDR1 and DDR2 is similarly observed in fibrotic diseases and neoplastic tissue suggesting that DDR inhibition may be a beneficial off-target effect. Furthermore, ponatinib and dasatinib show potent activity against mutant DDR2 in models of squamous cell lung cancer and indeed dasatinib has entered clinical trials for this indication. DDR kinases share a conserved threonine gatekeeper residue with ABL and are therefore likely to remain susceptible to drug resistance mutations at this site. The aminopyrimidine head group of imatinib is hydrogen bonded to the gatekeeper Thr701 in DDR1 analogous to its interaction with the gatekeeper Thr315 in ABL. In CML, mutation of the gatekeeper Thr315 to Ile confers drug resistance, suggesting that an analogous mutation in DDR1 and DDR2 would also confer resistance to imatinib. Ponatinib overcomes drug resistance arising from the gatekeeper position but acquires reduced selectivity and increased off-target effects. Interesting in this respect is the ponatinib molecule that stabilizes the crystallographic dimer in the kinase\u2013inhibitor complex. While we have not investigated this effect in solution, it may be of relevance for the full-length DDR1 and DDR2 receptors, which form constitutive homodimers at the cell surface. It may therefore be of interest in the future to screen this allosteric site against a library of ponatinib derivatives to identify compounds that stabilize this inactive kinase conformation. In summary, we report the crystal structures of the human DDR1 kinase domain in complex with two clinically relevant kinase inhibitors and identify structural features that determine the binding of DDR-selective inhibitors. The high affinity of these interactions supports the potential use of these molecules to control excessive DDR signaling in diseases such as inflammation, fibrosis and lung cancer. Unless otherwise noted, reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. For crystallization, imatinib was purchased from LC Laboratories whereas ponatinib was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. DDR1-IN-1 was prepared as described previously. Synthesis of DDR1-IN-1 derivatives is described in Supplementary Material. The DNA sequence corresponding to the kinase domain of human DDR1 (UniProt Q08345; residues 601\u2013913) was cloned into the transfer vector pFB-LIC-Bse by ligation-independent cloning. The vector encodes an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and a tobacco etch virus protease A (TEV) cleavage site. Bacmid DNA was prepared from Escherichia coli strain DH10Bac and used to generate baculovirus in Sf9 insect cells. Baculovirus was used to infect Sf9 cells grown in suspension to a density of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells/mL in Insect-Xpress media (Lonza). Cells were incubated at 27\u00a0\u00b0C and harvested 72\u00a0h post-infection. Harvested cells were resuspended in binding buffer [50\u00a0mM Hepes (pH\u00a07.5), 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 5\u00a0mM imidazole] supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail set III (Calbiochem) at 1:1000 dilution and 1\u00a0mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Cells were disrupted by high-pressure homogenization. Polyethylenimine was added to a final concentration of 0.5% to precipitate DNA and the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 21,000\u00a0RPM for 1\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. DDR1 protein was purified using nickel-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) and eluted stepwise with imidazole. Following tag cleavage, we purified the protein further by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad Superdex S75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) buffered in 10\u00a0mM Hepes (pH\u00a07.5), 250\u00a0mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 1\u00a0mM TCEP. The eluted DDR1 protein was supplemented with 5\u00a0mM l-arginine, 5\u00a0mM l-glutamate and 2\u00a0mM dithiothreitol before concentrating for crystallization. The intact mass of the unphosphorylated protein was confirmed by electrospray ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Agilent Technologies). Inhibitors were added to the concentrated protein in 1.5-fold molar excess and the protein solution was centrifuged at 14,000\u00a0RPM prior to crystallization. The DDR1\u2013ponatinib complex was crystallized at 4\u00a0\u00b0C in 150\u00a0nL sitting drops mixing 100\u00a0nL protein solution at 11\u00a0mg/mL with 50\u00a0nL of a reservoir solution containing 0.1\u00a0M 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol (pH\u00a05.5) and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. On mounting crystals were cryo-protected with an additional 25% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data were collected at 100\u00a0K on Diamond Light Source beamline I04-1. Crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group P1211. Two protein molecules were present in the asymmetric unit. The DDR1\u2013imatinib complex was crystallized at 20\u00a0\u00b0C in 150\u00a0nL sitting drops mixing 50\u00a0nL protein solution at 8\u00a0mg/mL with 100\u00a0nL of a reservoir solution containing 0.1\u00a0M 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol (pH\u00a06.3) and 34% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. After 4\u00a0h, 20\u00a0nL of DDR1\u2013ponatinib seed crystals was added to initiate crystal growth. On mounting crystals were cryo-protected with an additional 25% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data were collected at 100\u00a0K on Diamond Light Source beamline I03. Crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121. Two protein molecules were present in the asymmetric unit. Data were indexed and integrated using XDS and scaled using AIMLESS in the CCP4 suite of programs. Phases were found using molecular replacement in Phaser. PHENIX.SCULPTOR was used to optimize PDB ID: 4AT5 (TrkB) for use as a search model. The structures were built using PHENIX.AUTOBUILD and then refined and modified using alternate rounds of REFMAC5 and Coot. TLS groups were determined using the TLSMD server. The refined structures were validated with MolProbity and the atomic coordinate files were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with Autodep. Structure figures were prepared with PyMOL. Experiments were performed at 15\u00a0\u00b0C using a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. Protein and ligands were buffered in 50\u00a0mM Hepes (pH\u00a07.5), 250\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM TCEP and 2% DMSO. We titrated 100\u00a0\u03bcM DDR1 into inhibitor solutions at 10\u00a0\u03bcM concentration. Data were analyzed using a single binding site model implemented in the Origin software package provided with the instrument. IC50 values were determined by Invitrogen using a LanthaScreen kinase activity assay. U2OS cells containing tetracycline-inducible human HA-FLAG-DDR1 expression were used for the EC50 test. DDR1 was induced by 2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL doxycycline for 48\u00a0h prior to DDR1 activation by rat tail collagen I. The cells were pre-treated by media containing each concentration of the compound for 1\u00a0h and treated by changing the media to the EC50 test media containing 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL collagen and each concentration of the compound for 2\u00a0h. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times and lysed with lysis buffer [20\u00a0mM Tris (pH\u00a07.5), 5\u00a0mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail]. The phosphorylation of DDR1 and total DDR1 expression were quantified by using the ImageJ program following Western blot using anti-human DDR1b (Y513) and anti-HA, respectively. \u03b2-Actin was blotted as loading control. The EC50 concentration was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software.

Although marked reductions of CB expression have been observed in the brains of mice and humans with Alzheimer disease (AD), it is unknown whether these changes contribute to AD-related dysfunction. To determine the pathogenic importance of CB depletions in AD models, we crossed 5 familial AD mutations (5XFAD; Tg) mice with CB knock-out (CBKO) mice and generated a novel line CBKO\u00b75XFAD (CBKOTg) mice. We first identified the change of signaling pathways and differentially expressed proteins globally by removing CB in Tg mice using mass spectrometry and antibody microarray. Immunohistochemistry showed that CBKOTg mice had significant neuronal loss in the subiculum area without changing the magnitude (number) of amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) plaques deposition and elicited significant apoptotic features and mitochondrial dysfunction compared with Tg mice. Moreover, CBKOTg mice reduced levels of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 and cAMP response element-binding protein at Ser-133 and synaptic molecules such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDA receptor 1), NMDA receptor 2A, PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the subiculum compared with Tg mice. Importantly, this is the first experimental evidence that removal of CB from amyloid precursor protein/presenilin transgenic mice aggravates AD pathogenesis, suggesting that CB has a critical role in AD pathogenesis.\n", "fulltext": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive decline of cognition and memory. The major hallmarks of AD include senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.1 The amyloid hypothesis suggests that amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) accumulation is neurotoxic to the cells in the brain regions that have critical roles in learning and memory, including the hippocampus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex and basal forebrain.2 In addition to the accumulation of A\u03b2 and tau, several neurodegenerative processes of AD in the early stage are accompanied by calcium dysregulation, neuronal death, and mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction.2, 3 Specifically, disrupted calcium homeostasis has been reported in the brains of AD patients and normal aged subjects.4, 5 Altered levels of calcium (Ca2+)-binding proteins could result in impaired Ca2+ homeostasis in pathological conditions and disrupted Ca2+ signaling, thereby leading to loss of synapses and then dysfunctions of the neural network.6 We hypothesized that altered expression of a specific Ca2+-binding protein may affect a variety of AD-like pathologies in 5 familial AD mutations (5XFAD) mouse (Tg) brains, in an animal model of AD. Ca2+-binding proteins maintain calcium homeostasis by buffering excessive intracellular levels of free calcium. Calbindin-D28k (CB) is one of the major calcium-binding proteins that buffer the Ca2+ level and transport Ca2+.7 CB is abundant throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and has been used extensively as a marker of neuronal sub-populations for anatomical and developmental studies. Moreover, CB has been shown to block multiple pro-apoptotic pathways. For example, overexpression of CB inhibited apoptotic activities induced by A\u03b2 and mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) in glial and neuronal cells8, 9 and bax or caspase-3-related apoptotic signaling was increased in uteri of CB knock-out (CBKO) mice.10 It has been reported that the deficits of learning in mice expressing the familial AD-mutant hAPP correlated strongly with decreased levels of CB in the dentate gyrus of the brain.11 Furthermore, homozygous CBKO mice displayed impairments in motor coordination and activity.12, 13 However, whether reduced CB levels in animal models of AD could influence AD pathologies has not been extensively investigated. To obtain better insights into the pathological significance of these alterations in vivo, we generated CB-deficient AD transgenic mice (CBKOTg) and profiled the changes in abundance of proteins and levels of phosphorylation of hundreds of signaling proteins using antibody microarray and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. From these protein and phosphorylation profiles, we found that the depletion of CB in Tg mice brain elicited significant alterations in cell death pathways, synaptic transmission, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and cytoskeleton organization. These results revealed that the removal of CB in Tg mice caused apoptotic features, alteration of mitochondrial dynamic proteins, impaired N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA)-dependent signaling and decreased synaptic proteins levels at 6 months of age. To summarize, we have first shown, in vivo, that the removal of CB in Tg mice may be responsible for aggravating the apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic alteration on the pathogenesis of AD. In order to examine the effect of CBKO on AD pathology, we first crossed homozygous CBKO mice with hemizygous Tg and validated production of Tg and homozygous CBKOTg by crossing F1 generation of heterozygous CBKOTg mice. To verify each individual, genomic DNA was then isolated and PCR was performed using primers that span targeted regions of APP, PS1 and CB genes (Figure 1a). Based on these results, Tg and CBKOTg mice were identified. In young mice, plaques first appeared and amyloid deposits spread to fill much of the subiculum.14 CB is widely distributed in the mammalian CNS, including human brains.7 To confirm the effects of CBKO in the subiculum, we isolated the subiculum (white dotted line) of Tg and CBKOTg mice by an optical microscope (Figure 1b). To determine the protein level of APP, PS1 and CB expression, the offspring of Tg and CBKOTg mice were analyzed and the subiculum homogenates were prepared for immunoblot analysis with anti-APP (6E10), anti-PS1NT and anti-CB antibodies (Figure 1c). We also confirmed the presence of CB and plaque formation in the subiculum of Tg mice, but the absence of CB and the presence of plaque formation in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1d). Taken together, these data showed that all transgenic mice have a number of plaques and mice lacking CB showed a complete depletion of CB in the subiculum with no apparent difference in phenotype. Several studies have shown that the density of CB-expressing cells correlates inversely with plaque burden in AD brains.15, 16 To assess whether CB depletion in Tg brains affects A\u03b2 generation, we performed western analysis, ELISA and immunohistochemistry in the subiculum of each individual. Western blot using anti-A\u03b2 antibody (6E10) showed that \u223c4\u2009kDa bands (monomer form of A\u03b2) were not significantly altered in CBKOTg mice by CB deletion compared with Tg mice (Figures 2a and b). Moreover, ELISA of insoluble subiculum fractions showed no difference in the amounts of A\u03b242 between Tg and CBKOTg mice (Figure 2c). Immunohistochemistry for senile plaque in the subiculum, in which the plaque burden was visualized in brain sections using anti-A\u03b2-specific antibody (4G8), showed that the subiculum lacking CB expression failed to increase total A\u03b2 plaque burden in Tg mice (Figures 2d and e). Consistent with these results, plaque burden did not change in cortical area in both Tg and CBKOTg mice (Supplementary Figure S1). These findings are consistent with the results of ELISA using insoluble fractions between Tg and CBKOTg, indicating that the effect of CB depletion on amyloid pathology was independent of both generation and deposition of A\u03b2. To examine proteins affected by CB deficiency, we used antibody microarrays to measure abundances of 244 proteins and then to compare their abundances between 6-month-old Tg and CBKOTg subiculum. Among 244 proteins, 31 were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the Tg and CBKOTg subiculum (Supplementary Materials and methods; Supplementary Table S1). Of the 31 DEPs, 13 increased in their abundances in the CBKOTg subiculum, whereas 18 decreased. In particular, p35, PKB/AKT and caspase-3, which are involved in the induction of apoptosis, increased in CBKOTg mice, compared with Tg mice, while anti-apoptosis-related NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa-light chain-enhancer of activated B cells) decreased (Table 1). Moreover, neurofilament 200 and dystrophin, which are involved in organization of cell projection and cytoskeleton, decreased, indicating alteration of cytoskeleton in CBKOTg. These results were also supported by western analysis (Supplementary Figure S2). To further globally investigate the proteome affected by CB deficiency, liquid-chromatography-MS (LC-MS)/MS analysis was performed for the subiculum tissues of Tg and CBKOTg mice. From the samples of Tg and CBKOTg, 3840 and 3970 proteins (a total 4546 proteins) were identified, respectively (Figure 3a). Among them, 3264 were shared. Among the total 4546 proteins, 269 were selected as DEPs (5.92%, Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Materials and methods). The enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology biological processes (GOBPs) shows that the DEPs are mainly involved in the regulation of apoptosis, synaptic transmission, negative regulation of MAPK activity and mitochondrial fragmentation (Figure 3b; Supplementary Table S3; Supplementary Materials and methods). In addition, cytoskeleton organization, synaptic plasticity, cell cycle and small GTPase-mediated signal transduction also are perturbed in CBKOTg mice compared with Tg mice. Although there has been little demonstration of neuronal loss in APP transgenic mouse models,17, 18 a recent study showed that 5XFAD mice exhibited extensive neuronal loss by increasing A\u03b242 accumulation in cortical layer 5 and the subiculum.14 Therefore, the role of CB in the neuronal loss was examined in CBKOTg mice using immunohistochemistry of brain sections among nontransgenic littermates, Tg and CBKOTg mice at 6-month-old age with anti-NeuN antibody, a neuronal marker protein. We observed that NeuN-positive cells in the subiculum were visibly reduced in Tg mice compared with littermates (Figure 4a), in agreement with the previous finding.14 NeuN-positive cells in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice were significantly far fewer and scarcer, compared with both littermate and Tg mice (Figure 4b). To confirm whether the neuronal loss in CBKOTg mice is worse than in Tg mice, we examined NeuN-positive cells at 1.5, 3 and 6-month-old age, respectively. Although NeuN-positive cells did not differ between Tg and CBKOTg mice at 1.5-month-old age, NeuN-positive cells of CBKOTg mice from 3 months were seen significantly less than that of CBKOTg mice from 1.5-month-old age (Figures 4c and d). Together, these findings suggest that CB expression could have an important role in preventing the A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity and also in maintaining neuronal survival. It was previously shown that mRNA and protein levels of CB were decreased in brains of AD patients and AD mice, respectively.11, 19 CB overexpression has been reported to block apoptotic cell death in lymphocytes, glial cells and the uteri.9, 10, 20 However, there is no direct evidence that CB has a role in neuronal apoptosis in AD. To address this question, CBKOTg is one of the best models to show the role of CB in neuronal apoptosis in the brains of Tg mice. The proteomic analyses above revealed that CB deficiency in CBKOTg mice increased significantly the expression of the proteins involved in induction of apoptosis (Figure 3b; Table 1). We investigated whether the expression of apoptosis-related genes is affected by CB depletion in Tg. Interestingly, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression levels were reduced in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice compared with Tg mice (Figures 5a and b). There was no significant change in Bax level. The release of cytochrome c (CytC) is tightly controlled by proteins of the Bcl-2 family in the apoptosis pathway.21 Thus, the release of CytC was then measured by ELISA. We detected a significant increase of CytC in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice (Figure 5c). In addition, significantly higher levels of activated caspase 9 and 3 proteins were detected in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice (Figures 5d and e). To examine quantitatively whether apoptosis occurs in subiculum cells of both Tg and CBKOTg mice, apoptotic cells were assessed by FACS analysis after FITC-annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Both early (annexin V-positive, PI-negative) and late (annexin/PI-double positive) apoptotic cells were increased in CBKOTg mice than Tg mice, suggesting that CB may have a critical role in cells vulnerable to apoptosis in Tg mice (Figure 5f). These results indicate that apoptotic features increased in response to CB depletion in Tg mice. Several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to AD pathogenesis in the brains of transgenic animal models and patients,22, 23 during apoptosis, mitochondria are key organelles that sense and amplify damage24 and are vital for Ca2+ buffering and signal transduction, as well as stress-induced cell death.25 Also, our proteomic analysis revealed that CB deficiency changed the expression of the proteins involved in mitochondrial fragmentation (Figure 3b). Thus, the structure of mitochondria in the brains of AD mouse models was revealed by EM in previous studies.26 An EM study to examine the morphological changes of mitochondria in the subiculum of both Tg and CBKOTg mice showed severe cristae disruption like a hole as one of the apoptotic features in CBKOTg mice (Figure 6a). The percentage of elongated and round mitochondria was identified and calculated in each mouse group, and CBKOTg mice showed significantly lower percentage of elongated mitochondria, compared with Tg mice (Figure 6b). Moreover, the length of cristae in CBKOTg mice appeared to be significantly shorter than that in Tg mice (Figure 6c), suggesting that CB may have a role in mitochondrial morphology in CBKOTg mice. Alzheimer's pathology is accompanied by an expression change of the proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics.27, 28 Expression of mitochondrial proteins (dynamin-1-like protein (Drp1), mitochondrial fission 1 protein (Fis1), mitofusin-1 (Mfn1) and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1)) was detected by western blot analysis (Figure 6d). Drp-1 protein expression was significantly higher in CBKOTg mice than Tg mice. The level of Fis1 also tended to increase in the CBKOTg mice although this difference was statistically marginal (Figure 6e). The level of Mfn1 did not differ between Tg and CBKOTg mice. Opa-1 was less in CBKOTg mice than in Tg mice (Figure 6f). These results suggest that CB depletion from Tg mice contributes to the alteration of mitochondrial structure by damaging the mitochondrial cristae and disturbing mitochondrial dynamic remodeling. Our proteomic analysis revealed that CB deficiency changed the expression of the proteins involved in regulation of Ca2+ transport and calcium-mediated signaling (Figure 3b). Regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration is crucial for synaptic plasticity and long-term memory function.29 A\u03b21\u201342 accumulation in brain regions may exacerbate age-related declines in Ca2+ regulation that can lead to neuronal dysfunction and subsequent neurodegeneration.30 The induction of LTP in hippocampal slices requires the activation of NMDA receptors and mice with reduced CB expression show declines in memory and hippocampal LTP.31, 32 To determine whether the effects of changes in NMDA activity on learning and memory may be mediated by CB depletion, we measured the levels of NMDA receptors, synaptic molecules, in the subiculum of both Tg and CBKOTg mice. The levels of NMDA receptor 1 (NR1) and NMDA receptor 2A (NR2A) decreased in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice (Figures 7a and b). We also examined whether reductions of NR1 and NR2A, secondary to CB depletion from Tg mice, would affect NMDA receptor-mediated signaling pathways. In particular, the activation/phosphorylation of ERK is regarded as a key biochemical event in cognition. Our proteomic analysis also showed that CB deficiency changed the expression of the proteins involved in regulation of MAPK pathway (Figure 3b). The ERK activation leads to activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor linked to the formation of long-term memory.33 Especially, NMDA receptors enhance learning and memory through the activation of CREB by phosphorylation at serine 133.34 The levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and CREB at serine 133 significantly decreased in CBKOTg mice, compared with Tg mice (Figures 7a and c), whereas the levels of total ERK1/2 and CREB showed no change. We found that the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated CREB decreased in neurons of CBKOTg subiculum, compared with those in Tg mice (Figure 7d). Merged images of anti-NeuN and anti-pCREB stainings showed decreased yellow fluorescence in CBKOTg mice, and these images were quantified based on the fluorescence intensity (Figure 7e), suggesting that CREB inactivation is enhanced by CB depletion. To investigate whether CB depletion has any additive effects on the levels of synaptic proteins, we measured the levels of PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the subiculum of both CBKOTg and Tg mice. PSD-95 levels were reduced by 15% in CBKOTg mice and synaptophysin levels also decreased in the subiculum of CBKOTg by 24%, compared with Tg mice (Figures 7f and g). These data provide evidence that CB depletion has an important role in regulating of synaptic transmission and plasticity in Tg mice. The pathological features of AD have been reported to include A\u03b2 deposition, disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis, cell death and reduction of synaptic proteins. In this study, we have demonstrated that CB depletion contributes to A\u03b2-induced apoptosis and neurodegenerative changes in the brains of AD animal model. These results are consistent with earlier report that CB protein levels were markedly reduced in human AD brains and rodent AD model brains.11 To test the hypothesis that the removal of CB from 5XFAD mice may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, we generated CBKO AD transgenic mice (CBKOTg) as an in vivo experimental model with depleted CB expression (Figure 1). Pasti et al.35 demonstrated that inhibition of CB expression lead to prolonged increase of intraneuronal Ca2+ after NMDA or potassium stimulation of hippocampal slices.35 Greene et al.36 showed that CB-expressing cells in the brain of AD patients were unaffected by and resistant to degeneration.36 As a consequence of CB deficiency in the brains of Tg mice, we first demonstrated significant alterations in cell death pathways, synaptic transmission and MAPK signaling pathways from our initial antibody array analysis (Table 1). By MS, functional enrichment analysis also showed that the DEPs between both Tg and CBKOTg mice were significantly involved in apoptosis induction, synaptic transmission, MAPK activity and mitochondrial dysfunction (Figure 3). Based on these analyses, we have provided compelling evidence that CB depletion could alter pathological features of AD, independent of A\u03b2 generation, evidenced from both biochemical experiments and immunohistochemistry. Although there was no difference in A\u03b2 accumulation between Tg and CBKOTg mice, severe neuronal loss was found in the subiculum of CBKOTg mice, compared with that of Tg mice. Greater atrophy in the subiculum is associated with increased risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD.37 We also found that anti-apoptotic proteins, such as bcl-2 and bcl-xL, significantly decreased and the release of CytC with activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 increased in the brains of CBKOTg mice. In addition, FACS analysis showed that both early (annexin V-positive, PI-negative) and late (annexin/PI-double positive) apoptotic cells increased in CBKOTg mice, compared with Tg mice (Figure 5). These findings are consistent to earlier reports that CB protects against apoptotic cell death brought on by A\u03b2 in both neuronal and glial cells, and that bax and caspase-3 proteins are upregulated by CBKO in the murine uterus.8, 9, 10 Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that CB expression may contribute to neuronal survival in Tg mice. During apoptosis, remodeling of the mitochondrial cristae is accompanied by fragmentation of the mitochondria network.21, 38 The EM images showed that mitochondria of CBKOTg mice represent fragmentation and cristae disruption compared with Tg mice. Currently, it is believed that the overall shape of mitochondria is controlled by the balance between fusion and fission events that are mediated by specific proteins.39 Defects in mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins are associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.40 Interestingly, protein levels of both Drp1 and OPA1, one of the fission and fusion proteins, were significantly altered in CBKOTg mice compared with Tg mice (Figures 3 and 6), suggesting that the altered mitochondrial dynamics affects mitochondrial morphology as well as their functions, which lead to neuronal apoptosis in CBKOTg mice. The integrity of mitochondrial cristae during apoptosis is maintained not only by Opa1, but also by the genetic inhibition of Drp1.41 Thus, the altered Drp1 and Opa1 protein levels of CBKOTg mice support cristae disruption. Although the inhibition of CB expression impaired water maze learning in antisense for CB transgenic mice,32 whether CB depletion affects the mechanism associated with memory function has not been determined. The NMDA receptors consisting of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits are well-known key molecules for regulating memory function and synaptic plasticity.42 Protein levels of NR1 and NR2A are reduced in the brains of CBKOTg mice, compared with Tg mice. ERK1 and ERK2 are highly expressed in the adult mammalian CNS, and their activation relies on Ca2+ influx via the NMDA receptor, which is regarded as a key biochemical event in cognition through activation of CREB.33, 43, 44 Activation of both ERK1/2 and CREB was decreased by the removal of CB in the brains of Tg mice (Figures 7a and c). We also confirmed that immunohistochemical staining of brain sections for phosphorylated CREB revealed a decrease in subiculum neurons of CBKOTg mice, compared with those in Tg mice (Figures 7d and e). These results raise the possibility that CB depletion contributes to neuronal deficits and cognitive dysfunction in Tg mouse models, and persistent mitochondrial fission could lead to synaptic damage, bioenergetic failure and subsequent neurodegeneration.45, 46 Another interesting finding in this study is the influence of CB on synaptic protein levels. Loss of synaptic function is a key characteristic of AD progression, because it is directly linked with cognitive impairment.47 A growing body of evidence that CB is an important regulator of synapses has been reported. First, CB is expressed in distinct cell types throughout the CNS, buffers intracellular Ca2+ and modifies synaptic functions in neurons.7 Second, overexpression of CB has been shown to increase neuronal differentiation and neurite growth.48 Finally, recent evidence suggests that CB binds directly to caspase-3 and inhibits its activity in osteoblasts, and caspase-3 then triggers early synaptic dysfunction in a Tg2576 AD mouse model.49, 50 We have found decreased protein levels of PSD95 and synaptophysin, the presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins (Figures 7f and g). Therefore, the alterations in both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins imply that CB depletion may be important in the regulation of synapse formation. In summary, we have revealed for the first time that CB has a critical role in vivo in the apoptotic features, including mitochondria alteration as well as loss of synaptic proteins, in a AD mouse model. Our findings suggest that the CB depletion may be an important contributor to the pathogenesis of AD by exacerbating neuronal loss, apoptotic cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic loss. Female transgenic mice with 5XFAD were purchased from Jackson Lab (Bar harbor, ME, USA). These mice co-express and co-inherit FAD mutant forms of human APP (Swedish mutation: K670N, M671L; Florida mutation: I716V and London mutation: V717I) and PS1 (M146L; L286V) transgenes under transcriptional control of the neuron-specific mouse Thy1 promoter.14, 51 Heterozygous Tg transgenic mice (B6/SJL hybrid background) were cross-bred with CB homozygous knockout (CBKO) mice.12 The resultant F1 heterozygous CB+/\u2212 Tg mice were further intercrossed, yielding animals with four different genotypes (wild-type, Tg, CBKO\u00b7WT and CBKOTg) in the F2 progeny. All experiments were done with these mice at 6 months of age. Subiculum tissues were rapidly excised from the brains of the killed mice by using optical microscopy for protein isolation. Some subiculum tissues were fixed in cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy (EM). Animal treatment and maintenance were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication No.85-23, 1985 edition) and the Animal Care and Use Guidelines of Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of mice used. CBKO mice were provided by Professor Sukho Lee (Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea). Genomic DNA was obtained from the ears by digestion buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 20\u2009mM NaCl, pH 8.0, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 20\u2009mg/ml Proteinase K) at 55\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h, followed by phenol and isopropanol. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with a separate set of primers designed for each allele to distinguish the CB WT from CB mutant alleles. The oligonucleotide primers designed for the CB WT allele were as follows: upstream, 5\u2032-TCCCTCACCTAGAGATAGAAGCAGCGCAG-3\u2032 downstream, 5\u2032-AGACAGCAGAATCGAGGAGTCTGCTGCTC-3\u2032. The oligonucleotide primers designed for the CB mutant allele were as follows: upstream, 5\u2032-TCCCTCACCTAGAGATAGAAGCAGCGCAG-3\u2032 downstream, 5\u2032-GCTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACTGCCTTGG-3\u2032. The size of the WT PCR product was 254\u2009bp and the mutant PCR product was 192\u2009bp. For immunohistochemistry, WT, Tg, CBKO\u00b7WT and CBKOTg (n=4 each) mice were killed at 6 months of age. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of Zoletil 50 (Virbac, Carros, France) and Rompun (Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea) solution (3\u2009:\u20091 ratio, 1\u2009ml/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with a freshly prepared solution of 4% PFA in PBS. After the mice were decapitated, brains were dissected from the skull. Serial 30-\u03bcm thick coronal tissue sections were cut using a freezing microtome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany). Free-floating sections were incubated with the following the primary antibodies; biotin-labeled 4G8 (1\u2009:\u2009700; Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA), rabbit anti-CB (1\u2009:\u20093000; Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland), mouse anti-neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) antibody (1\u2009:\u20092000; Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) and rabbit anti-phospho-CREB Ser 133 antibody (1\u2009:\u2009800; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After washes in PBS, the sections were incubated with the following secondary antibodies; Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin (1\u2009:\u20091000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Invitrogen and donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 antibody (1\u2009:\u20091000; Invitrogen) for 2\u2009h. All sections were counterstained with DAPI (4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) before mounting and analyzed on a confocal laser scanning microscopy (FluoView FV 10i; OLYMPUS, Center Valley, PA, USA). Subiculum extracts of 6-month-old Tg and CBKOTg mice (n=3 each) were subjected to Panorama Antibody Microarray Cell Signaling (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) analysis consisting of 224 different antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Cy3 and Cy5 dye (Amersham, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) were attached to proteins extracted from Tg and CBKOTg mice. Next, equal amounts of labeled proteins from Tg and CBKOTg subiculum were mixed together and hybridized to antibody microarrays. After washing, the microarrays were scanned at wavelengths of 532\u2009nm (Cy3) and 635\u2009nm (Cy5) to detect signals using a GenePix4008B Scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and data were analyzed by GenePix software (Molecular Devices). Lowess normalization was performed for four signals of each protein.52 Normalized signals for four replicates of one protein between CBKOTg and Tg mice were compared to identify DEPs using an integrative statistical testing method53 in which adjusted P-values for each protein were calculated using both Student's t-tests and median fold-change test and then combined to compute overall P-values using Stouffer's method.54 Proteins with overall P-values <0.1, P-values of t-test <0.05 and P-values of median fold test <0.05 were selected as DEPs by the depletion of CB. Hippocampal subiculum tissue lysates were prepared by sonication followed by solubilization in lysis buffer consisting of 50\u2009mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 50\u2009mM sodium fluoride, 1\u2009mM sodium orthovanadate and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentrations were measured using a Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Solubilized proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), fractionated by SDS-PAGE (4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel, Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein gel regions were cut and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion following the general protocol.55 Briefly, protein gels were excised, destained and washed. Proteins were reduced with 20\u2009mM dithiothreitol and alkylated with 55\u2009mM iodoacetamide. After dehydration with acetonitrile, the proteins were digested with 13\u2009ng/\u03bcl sequencing grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 50\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 5% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The eluates were dried under vacuum and stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C until used. Peptides isolated from the in-gel digestion were resuspended in 50\u2009\u03bcl of solvent A (2% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) and 2\u2009\u03bcl of sample was injected into nano-HPLC system (Easy nLC; Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) and LTQ-Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sample was loaded onto an in-house packed 75\u2009\u03bcm (inner diameter) \u00d7 10\u2009cm C18 column and separated with a linear gradient of 2\u201338% solvent B (98% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) for 90\u2009min at a flow rate of 300\u2009nl/min. Standard mass spectrometric condition of the spray voltage was set to 1.9\u2009kV and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 325\u2009\u00b0C. The LTQ was operated in data-dependent mode with one survey MS scan at the mass range 400\u20131400\u2009m/z and followed by five MS/MS scans. Precursor ions were dynamically excluded for a period of 30\u2009s. LC-MS/MS raw data were searched by SEQUEST algorithm against forward\u2013reverse ipi.MOUSE.v3.87 using the following parameters: 1.5\u2009Da precursor mass tolerance; 1.0\u2009Da product ion mass tolerance; semitryptic digestion; up to two missed cleavages; variable modifications: oxidation of methionine (+15.99); fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.02). The SEQUEST search results were evaluated by computing the probability for each identified peptide using TPP v.4.5b.56 Peptides with false discovery rate <0.005 were regarded as reliably identified peptides and matched to proteins using the ProteinProphet software.57 Proteins with the protein probability \u22650.9 were regarded as reliably identified proteins and quantified using a spectral count-based method proposed by Fu et al.58 For each protein, the spectral counts between CBKOTg and Tg mice were compared to compute a spectral index (SPI), a measure of fold-change of the spectral counts, as described in Fu et al.58 To assess the statistical significance of a SPI value for each protein, an empirical distribution of SPI was estimated by performing 1000 random permutation experiments. For a SPI value for each protein, P-value was computed by a two- tailed test using the empirical distribution. Proteins with (1) SPI P-value <0.05 and (2) the number of identified unique peptides \u22652 in one of Tg and CBKOTg mice were identified as DEPs. To identify cellular processes represented by the DEPs, the enrichment analysis of GOBPs was performed using MetaCoreTM (ver 6.7; Thomson Reuters, New York, NY, USA), which provides P-value as the significance of each GOBP being enriched by the DEPs.59 The GOBPs with P-value <0.01 were selected as the ones significantly represented by the DEPs. Human A\u03b242 levels were quantified with a commercially available ELISA kit using an anti-A\u03b242 C-terminal-specific antibody according to the manufacturer's protocol (Immuno Biochemical Laboratories Co., Gunma, Japan). Extracts of brain subicular tissues were lysed by sonication with PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich). The homogenates supplemented with 70% formic acid were sonicated for 35\u2009s and ultra-centrifuged at 100\u2009000 \u00d7 g for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The formic acid extracts were neutralized with 1\u2009M Tris phosphate buffer (pH 11) and then diluted with the ELISA sample buffer (1\u2009:\u200920). ELISA plates were developed using a color reaction, and the absorbance was read at 450\u2009nm using a plate reader (POWER-XS; BIO-TEK, Winooski, VT, USA). Several subiculum pieces from Tg and CBKOTg were randomly excised, diced (1\u2009mm3), then fixed in a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u2009M phosphate or cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) and embedded with epoxy resin at 4\u2009\u00b0C for overnight. The epoxy resin-mixed samples were loaded into capsules and polymerized at 38\u2009\u00b0C for 12\u2009h and 60\u2009\u00b0C for 48\u2009h. Thin sections were sliced on an ultramicrotome (RMC MT-XL) and collected on a copper grid. Appropriate areas for thin sectioning were cut at 65\u2009nm and stained with saturated 4% uranyl acetate and 4% lead citrate. The ultrastructure of mitochondria of the brain was then examined by a TEM (TEM-1400, Tokyo, Japan). Mitochondria were measured and the averages were determined (n=10 for each group). Mouse brains were lysed in RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-Cl, pH8.0, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-Doc, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). After sonication at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009s, protein concentrations were determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce/Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Homogenized protein samples were separated on 4\u201312% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Membranes were incubated with antibodies against the indicated proteins. Immunoreactivity was determined by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The images were captured using a bioimaging analyzer (LAS-3000; Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with a Multi-Gauge program (Fuji). Antibodies for western blot analysis were purchased; anti-A\u03b2 antibody (6E10; monoclonal antibody, Signet Laboratories, Dedham, MA, USA), anti-PS antibody, anti-CB antibody, anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody, anti-Drp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-Fis1 antibody, anti-Mfn1 antibody, anti-OPA1 antibody, anti-Bcl-2 antibody, anti-Bax antibody, anti-Bcl-xL antibody, anti-NMDAR1 antibody, anti-NR2A antibody, anti-GluR1 antibody, anti-GluR2 antibody, anti-phospho-ERK antibody, anti-ERK antibody, anti-phospho-CREB Ser133 antibody, anti-CREB Ser133 antibody, anti-synaptophysin antibody and anti-PSD-95 antibody were used for immunoblotting. Brain tissues were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10\u2009mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1\u2009mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 1\u2009mM EGTA) including protease inhibitor cocktail (100\u2009mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2\u2009mg/ml leupeptin and 2\u2009mg/ml aprotinin, all from Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation on ice for 30\u2009min, swelled cells were disrupted with 25 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle in a Dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 500\u2009g for 15\u2009min. Supernatants were centrifuged at 17\u2009000 \u00d7 g for 30\u2009min and upper layers (cytosolic extracts) were isolated. Cytosolic CytC prepared from tissues was subjected to ELISA according to the manufacturer's instruction (Cytochrome c Kit, Invitrogen). Annexin V/PI staining (BD, San Diego, CA, USA) was performed using flow cytometry according to the manufacturer's guidelines. To examine the stage of apoptotic cells, the measurements were carried out. Briefly, subicular cells were trypsinized and collected and stained in solution with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate or PI for 15\u2009min at 25\u2009\u00b0C in the dark, and were then washed with ice-cold PBS. Flow cytometry analysis was immediately performed using a FACS Calibur (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). Four sections (100\u2009\u03bcm apart) from Tg and CBKOTg mice were used for this analysis. Immunofluorescence images of the cerebral frontal cortex and hippocampus were taken using a fluorescence microscope (FluoView FV 10i; OLYMPUS). To analyze the amyloid plaque burden, NeuN, and pCREB, the number of immunofluorescence-positive pixels in the subiculum area from the acquired images was analyzed using the Image J processing software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). All data are expressed as mean\u00b1S.E.M. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prizm4 (San Diego, CA, USA). The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with post-hoc test or unpaired t-tested regarded as appropriate (*P<0.05 and ***P<0.001)."}, "25983002": {"pmid": "25983002", "pmcid": "PMC4605959", "title": "Inhibition of LDHA suppresses tumor progression in prostate cancer", "abstract": "\nA key hallmark of cancer cells is their altered metabolism, known as Warburg effect. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) executes the final step of aerobic glycolysis and has been reported to be involved in the tumor progression. However, the function of LDHA in prostate cancer has not been studied. In current study, we observed overexpression of LDHA in the clinical prostate cancer samples compared with benign prostate hyperplasia tissues as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and real-time qPCR. Attenuated expression of LDHA by siRNA or inhibition of LDHA activities by FX11 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis of PC-3 and DU145 cells. Mechanistically, decreased Warburg effect as demonstrated by reduced glucose consumption and lactate secretion and reduced expression of MMP-9, PLAU, and cathepsin B were found after LDHA knockdown or FX11 treatment in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Taken together, our study revealed the oncogenic role of LDHA in prostate cancer and suggested that LDHA might be a potential therapeutic target.\n", "fulltext": "Although great advances in medical management and screening, prostate cancer (PC) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in men. About 15\u00a0% of prostates contain islands of cancer at the age of 50 and nearly 100\u00a0% by 80. Nowadays, the chief treatment for PC is androgen deprivation therapy; however, patients on this regime eventually relapse into hormone-refractory prostate cancer. An enhanced tumor microenvironment that favors tumor progression is formed during the critical switch of PC to androgen independence and distant metastasis. Therefore, it is urgent to identify key signaling events driving the tumor microenvironment to find novel therapeutic targets for PC. Cancer cells take up glucose and transform it to lactate even under aerobic conditions, known as the Warburg effect. Sufficient amounts of nucleotides, proteins, and lipids derived from this type of glucose metabolism are required for cancer cell rapid growth and division. Critical to this highly glycolytic phenotype is lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which catalyses the last step of anaerobic glycolysis. Abnormally expression of LDHA has been observed in many human cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. Inhibition of LDHA reduced cell malignant transformation and remarkably delayed tumor formation, indicating that the underlying role of LDHA in tumor initiation or maintenance. Several mechanisms by which LDHA suppression induces inhibition of tumor progression are revealed. In lymphoma, reduction of LDHA induces oxidative stress and alters cellular energy metabolism, which ultimately contributes to cell death. In breast cancer, LDHA knockdown suppresses tumorigenicity through induction of oxidative stress mediated mitochondrial pathway apoptosis. In PC, overexpressed lactate dehydrogenase 5 isoenzyme has been reported and confers prostate cancer with resistance of to radiotherapy. However, little is known the expression pattern of LDHA and its underlying roles in PC. In the present study, we firstly detected the expression of LDHA in PC and BPH tissues. Next, cellular functions of LDHA were analyzed in PC-3 and DU145 cells when LDHA expression was suppressed or LDHA activity was inhibited. Moreover, LDHA-dependent mechanisms involved in the progression of PC were also analyzed. FX11 (Merck Millipore, Germany) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and further diluted to preferable concentrations in culture medium before use. Human prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1, DU145, PC-3, and LNCaP were all purchased from Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All cells were cultured in DMEM specific medium supplemented with 10\u00a0% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified incubator under 5\u00a0% CO2 condition. Twenty freshly frozen PC tissues and 12 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues were recruited from Department of Urology, Guangdong General Hospital, China. All tissue samples were obtained with informed consent and approved by the ethics committee of Guangzhou Municipality. A tissue microarray containing 64 cases of PC tissues and 11 cases of BPH tissues were purchased from Xi-an Alenabio Inc. (China). After deparaffinizing, rehydrating, antigen retrieval, and neutralization of endogenous peroxidase, tissue sections were blocked with blocking serum, followed by incubation with primary antibody (LDHA, Proteintech) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for three times, the sections were incubated with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The reaction products were visualized with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and counterstained by hematoxylin. Scoring was conducted on a scale of 0\u20133: 0\u201310\u00a0% scored 0; 10\u201335\u00a0% scored 1; 36\u201370\u00a0% scored 2; and more than 70\u00a0% scored 3. Scored at 0 and 1 was defined as low expression group, while 2 and 3 was defined as high expression group. The scoring by the pathologists was done in a blinded manner. PC-3 cells were transfected specific siRNAs targeting LDHA as well as a negative control (GenePharma, Shanghai, China). Transfection was accomplished by seeding 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells into a six-well plate, and after 24\u00a0h, the medium was aspirated and incubated with transfection complex according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The interference efficiency was detected by Western blotting, and cell populations with lowest LDHA expression were used for subsequent experiments. Total RNA was isolated from cells or frozen tissue samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using the PrimeScript RT-PCR system (Takara, Japan). Then 1\u00a0\u03bcg cDNA was quantified by real-time PCR with SYBR Green Master Mix (Takara, Japan). Specific primer sequences used were as follows: MMP9: forward 5\u2032-GGGACGCAGACATCGTCATC-3\u2032, reverse 5\u2032-TCGTCATCGTCGAAATGGGC-3\u2032; PLAU: forward 5\u2032- GCTTGTCCAAGAGTGCATGGT -3\u2032, reverse 5\u2032-CAGGGCTGGTTCTCGATGG-3\u2032; cathepsin B: forward 5\u2032-AGAGTTATGTTTACCGAGGACCT-3\u2032, reverse 5\u2032-GATGCAGATCCGGTCAGAGA-3\u2032. The expression level of gene analyzed in this study was standardized using the expression level of \u03b2-actin to obtain a relative level of gene expression. Whole cell extracts were prepared using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor (Beyotime, China). Protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and target proteins were probed by Western blotting with antibodies (LDHA and \u03b2-actin, Proteintech). Then, the membranes were consecutively incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Abmart, China). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL Plus kit (Millipore Corporation, Billerica). Migration and invasion assay was performed with 8.0-\u03bcm pore inserts (Millipore, USA) in 24-well plate. For migration assay, 20,000 cells were seeded into the upper compartment of the transwell inserts. The invasion assay was performed with matrigel-coated filters (BD Bioscience, USA). Cells were allowed to incubate for 24 and 48\u00a0h, respectively. Migrated and invaded were fixed and stained by 0.1\u00a0% (w/v) crystal violet. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Cell viability was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo, Japan) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Briefly, 3000 cells were resuspended and seeded into a 96-well plate supplemented in the presence of 10\u00a0% FBS and cultured overnight. The next day, the LDHA knockdown cells or FX11-treated cells was incubated with CCK8 for 1\u00a0h and the absorbance was measured at 450\u00a0nm using a multifunctional microplate reader (Tecan). This experiment was done in quadruplicate cells. Cells under apoptotic condition were analyzed by Annexin V/PI staining. Briefly, cells with small interfering (RNA) siRNA or FX11 treatment were seeded in six-well plates at 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells per well in the absence of FBS for 48\u00a0h. Then, cells were harvested and labeled with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (BD Pharmingen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The apoptotic cells were measured by flow cytometry. The caspase-3/7 activity assay was performed at 48\u00a0h after serum deprivation according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Promega) Cells were cultured in fresh phenol red-free media and the culture media were collected in the first 24\u00a0h after siRNA or FX11 treatment. The glucose and glutamine concentration in the culture media are 5 and 2\u00a0mM, respectively. The lactate and glucose levels were measured by using lactate assay kits (Biovision) or glucose assay kits (Life Technologies), respectively. Data were presented as the means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses and graphical representations were performed with SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5 (San Diego, CA) software. Cell viability assay was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. And, the Student\u2019s t test was used for comparison between groups in other data. Values of P\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. To identify the expression pattern of LDHA in PC, a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 64 cases of PC specimens and 11 cases of BPH samples was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. Higher LDHA expression was observed in 75\u00a0% (48/64) of PC cases, while 18.2\u00a0% (2/11) in BPH cases, the difference was significant (Fig.\u00a01a, b). In addition, 20 cases of PC tissues and 12 cases of BPH tissues were collected to detect messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of LDHA using real-time quantitative PCR. We observed that LDHA mRNA expression was significantly elevated in PC tissues in relative to BPH samples (Fig.\u00a01c). And, data from Oncomine database further confirmed this phenomenon. As shown in Fig.\u00a01d, e, although without significant alternations in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, overexpressed LDHA was more commonly observed in prostate cancer. Furthermore, the expression level of LDHA in four PC cell lines was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.\u00a01f). To further analyze the possible functions of LDHA in PC, we selected the cell line with higher LDHA expression, PC-3 and DU145 cells, for further investigation. The level of endogenous LDHA expression in PC-3 and DU145 cells after targeted siRNA treatment was examined by Western blotting (Fig.\u00a02a). Given that LDHA expression was significantly decreased by siRNA-3 oligos treatment, we chose the siRNA-3 oligos for the next investigation. The CCK8 analysis showed that LDHA knockdown cells exhibited significantly reduced cell viability compared with the negative control cells (Fig.\u00a02b). The apoptosis assay showed that cell apoptosis ratio was significantly increased after LDHA was knocked down (Fig.\u00a02c). And, consistent with this, the caspase-3/7 activity was increased by LDHA siRNA treatment (Fig.\u00a02d). Next, to detect whether LDHA has an implication for cancer progression, cell migration and invasion assays were performed. Migration assay showed that migrated cells in siRNA-treated group was dramatically decreased in relative to the negative control group (Fig.\u00a02e). In the invasion assay, the invaded cells were also decreased significantly after LDHA knockdown (Fig.\u00a02f). Collectively, these data above demonstrated that LDHA favors tumor growth and metastasis in PC. A small-molecule inhibitor, FX11 [3-dihydroxy-6-methyl-7-(phenylmethyl)-4-propylnaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid]), is a competitive inhibitor of LDHA. As tumor progression was inhibited by siRNA-mediated LDHA reduction, here, we evaluated the effect of FX11 in PC-3 cells. As shown in Fig.\u00a03a, LDHA expression was not affected by FX11 treatment, indicating that FX11 mainly affect the activities of LDHA. Consistent with the results in siRNA-mediated reduction of LDHA, attenuation of LDHA activities by FX11 also resulted in decreased cell viability (Fig.\u00a03b), increased cell apoptosis (Fig.\u00a03c), increased caspase-3/7 activity (Fig.\u00a03d), inhibition of cell migration (Fig.\u00a03e), and invasion (Fig.\u00a03f). Taken together, these results indicate that decreased LDHA enzyme activity is also involved in the antitumor effect of FX11. Since LDHA executes the final step of aerobic glycolysis, we postulated that LDHA-mediated functions in PC may associate with glucose metabolism. Expectedly, the lactate level in the culture media was pronounced decreased after siRNA-mediated LDHA knockdown (Fig.\u00a04a) or FX11 treatment (Fig.\u00a04b). Besides, PC-3 cells also showed decreased glucose consumption after whether siRNA-mediated LDHA knockdown (Fig.\u00a04c) or FX11 treatment (Fig.\u00a04d). This data indicate that enhanced glycolysis may account for the tumor-suppressive effect of LDHA in PC. A critical consequence of altered lactate production and secretion is the acidification of tumor microenvironment, which favors the activation of a series of proteases, including MMP-9, urokinase type plasminogen activator (PLAU), and cathepsin B. And, this activation ultimately induces extracellular matrix degradation and facilitates tumor cells to metastasis. In our study, expression level of MMP-9, PLAU, and cathepsin B was evaluated after siRNA or FX11 treatment. Indeed, MMP-9, PLAU, and cathepsin B expression were remarkably decreased after LDHA knockdown (Fig.\u00a05a) or FX11 treatment (Fig.\u00a05b). In conclusion, these results support that enhanced acidified microenvironment mediated by LDHA promotes tumor cell metastasis, while increased utilization of glucose facilitates tumor cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a05c). In the present study, we observed overexpressed LDHA in PC tissues compared with BPH tissues. By using two PC cell lines, PC-3 and DU145, we asked whether the elevated LDHA was essential for tumor progression and whether LDHA altered tumor microenvironment that favors tumor growth or metastasis. To this end, we utilized siRNA to suppress the expression of LDHA and FX11 to inhibit LDHA enzyme activity. Our findings demonstrated that enhanced glycolysis and acidified microenvironment induced by LDHA had a drastic implication on tumor physiology. Given that the accelerated glucose metabolism distinguishes cancer cells from their normal counterparts, it is reasonable to speculate that certain glycolytic enzymes are suitable to target for cancer therapy. Many studies in tumors aimed at LDHA confirm this point view [6, 13, 14]. Consistent with previous reports, our results showed that knockdown of LDHA or limiting the LDHA activity of PC cells is sufficient to inhibit cell growth and metastasis [6, 9]. It is important to emphasize here that although tumor biology was altered by FX11 treatment, the LDHA enzyme activity was not measured in our study. Whether alternations induced by FX11 were due to decreased LDHA enzyme activity requires further confirmation. It was known that although Warburg effect produces reduced ATP compared with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), it provides a constant supply of metabolites that are essential for rapid macromolecule biosynthesis and necessary for cell growth and division [15, 16]. Our results showed that inhibition of LDHA significantly compromised cell viability of PC-3 and DU145 cells and accompanied by a decrease in glucose consumption and lactate production. These results, as a proof of principle, suggest a driver role of LDHA in glycolytic activity in PC. A critical consequence of Warburg effect is increased lactate production by tumor cells. In cancer cells, lactate was exported by monocarboxylate transporters resulting in the acidification of microenvironment, whereas this alternations leads to cell death in normal cells. In our study, LDHA deficiency led to a reduction in lactate production accompanied by decreased cellular migration and invasion. Consistent with this theory, our results confirmed that the expression of proteases involved in extracellular matrix degradation including MMP9, PLAU, and cathepsin B was reduced by inhibition of LDHA. However, mechanism of this type of alternation in proteases expression induced by LDHA inhibition remains further demonstration. In conclusion, our results from both clinical specimens and in vitro cell experiments demonstrated that LDHA expression is upregulated in PC, and it induces a favorable tumor microenvironment for tumor progression. We proposed that inhibition of LDHA may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling metastasis as well as tumor growth in prostate cancer."}, "26110643": {"pmid": "26110643", "pmcid": "PMC4482254", "title": "Protein-Trap Insertional Mutagenesis Uncovers New Genes Involved in Zebrafish Skin Development, Including a Neuregulin 2a-Based ErbB Signaling Pathway Required during Median Fin Fold Morphogenesis", "abstract": "\nSkin disorders are widespread, but available treatments are limited. A more comprehensive understanding of skin development mechanisms will drive identification of new treatment targets and modalities. Here we report the Zebrafish Integument Project (ZIP), an expression-driven platform for identifying new skin genes and phenotypes in the vertebrate model Danio rerio (zebrafish). In vivo selection for skin-specific expression of gene-break transposon (GBT) mutant lines identified eleven new, revertible GBT alleles of genes involved in skin development. Eight genes\u2014fras1, grip1, hmcn1, msxc, col4a4, ahnak, capn12, and nrg2a\u2014had been described in an integumentary context to varying degrees, while arhgef25b, fkbp10b, and megf6a emerged as novel skin genes. Embryos homozygous for a GBT insertion within neuregulin 2a (nrg2a) revealed a novel requirement for a Neuregulin 2a (Nrg2a) \u2013 ErbB2/3 \u2013 AKT signaling pathway governing the apicobasal organization of a subset of epidermal cells during median fin fold (MFF) morphogenesis. In nrg2a mutant larvae, the basal keratinocytes within the apical MFF, known as ridge cells, displayed reduced pAKT levels as well as reduced apical domains and exaggerated basolateral domains. Those defects compromised proper ridge cell elongation into a flattened epithelial morphology, resulting in thickened MFF edges. Pharmacological inhibition verified that Nrg2a signals through the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase network. Moreover, knockdown of the epithelial polarity regulator and tumor suppressor lgl2 ameliorated the nrg2a mutant phenotype. Identifying Lgl2 as an antagonist of Nrg2a \u2013 ErbB signaling revealed a significantly earlier role for Lgl2 during epidermal morphogenesis than has been described to date. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that successive, coordinated ridge cell shape changes drive apical MFF development, making MFF ridge cells a valuable model for investigating how the coordinated regulation of cell polarity and cell shape changes serves as a crucial mechanism of epithelial morphogenesis.\n", "fulltext": "Skin conditions generate between 12% to 43% of medical visits [1, 2]. In the United States, skin disorders are estimated to affect one third of the population at any time, with an estimated total annual cost of nearly US$100 billion. Patients with skin disease frequently suffer physical discomfort and pain, and often experience diminished quality of life and psychological distress [4\u20136]. Medically, skin conditions are challenging to treat: skin is an exposed, physically vulnerable external barrier whose continuous turnover can impede long-lasting healing. Because there is a limited variety of clinical treatment methods, many of which are non-specific immune modulators such as steroids, new therapeutic targets for skin conditions could have important health and economic benefits. Strategies for identifying novel integument genes and expanding our understanding of incompletely characterized integument loci offer avenues for subsequent interventional approaches. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent vertebrate model for understanding development and disease. Zebrafish not only share significant genomic similarity with humans [9, 10], they also generate numerous transparent, externally fertilized embryos ideal for in vivo imaging and for phenotype-based gene discovery (\u201cforward genetics\u201d) [11, 12]. In addition to traditional chemical mutagenesis [13, 14], forward genetic screening uses insertional mutagenesis methods, including retroviruses [15, 16] and the more recently developed gene-breaking transposon (GBT) technology (Fig 1A). GBT mutagenesis generates mRFP-tagged, Cre recombinase-revertible insertional alleles with \u2265 97% knockdown of endogenous transcript levels. Zebrafish GBT insertional mutagenesis has already identified and characterized new genes, expression patterns, and phenotypes in the heart [18, 19], vasculature, and muscle. GBT insertional mutagenesis has also been used to dissect genetic links between brain and behavior. However, it had not previously been applied to studying skin biology. Zebrafish larval skin and mammalian fetal skin share many features integral to both epidermal biology and disease. In both cases, the developing epidermis is a bilayered epithelium. The outer enveloping layer (EVL) of zebrafish embryos and larvae corresponds to mammalian embryonic periderm [23, 24], while the inner layer consists of basal keratinocytes that will eventually generate the multi-layered mature epidermis [25\u201327]. In both mammals and zebrafish, the transcription factor DeltaNp63 (\u0394Np63) is crucial for epidermal specification and promotes basal keratinocyte proliferation and stemness [28\u201334]. Fin fold development is an important event in larval epidermal development. Zebrafish larvae have an unpaired median fin fold (MFF) and a pair of pectoral fin folds (PFFs). The MFF is an ancient structure whose origins predate the evolution of paired pectoral fins [35, 36]. MFF development begins at 18 hours post-fertilization (hpf) when midline basal keratinocytes undergo profound cell shape changes that drive median epidermal ridge (MER) formation along the ventral and dorsal caudal midlines. Midline basal keratinocytes adopt a wedge-shaped cross-sectional profile by reducing their basal surfaces and expanding their apical surfaces. Those shape changes, in conjunction with loss of contact with the underlying mesoderm, push up the midline basal keratinocytes (ridge cells) to create the MER [37, 38]. Additional keratinocytes are then recruited to the proximal base of the MER. There they initiate MFF formation by elevating the MER perpendicularly to the larval mediolateral body axis. As the MFF extends further from the larval body, a sub-epidermal (dermal) space forms between the resulting apposed epidermal sheets. During MFF extension, the ridge cells of the initial MER remain at the tip of the MFF. As we show here, ridge cells\u2019 basal surfaces have re-expanded by 30 hpf during a second phase of cell shape changes. The single cells at the tip of the apical MFF (cleft cells) maintain an overall wedge shape while the growing basal surface invaginates, forming an intracellular cleft as a distal extension of the dermal space. In contrast, progressive apical and basal surface growth leads the two to three ridge cells on either side of the cleft cell to elongate, adopting a flattened, epithelial morphology with a rectangular cross-sectional profile. Little is known about the genetic control of the processes that direct MER formation [38, 39], but studies indicate that MER cells play crucial roles during MFF development and maintenance. As MFF development proceeds, MFF basal keratinocytes, including MER cells, secrete extracellular components into the dermal space. Those components then assemble into specialized extracellular structures, including cross-fibers [37, 40] and collagenous actinotrichia [41, 42], which provide the MFF with structural support against mechanical stresses. While basal keratinocytes along the entire proximo-distal length of the MFF secrete actinotrichia components, MER cleft and ridge cells are the predominant producers of basement membrane (BM) components such as Laminin [43, 44] (see below) and BM-dermal anchorage proteins such as Fras1 [44, 45] (see below). By 48 hpf, fin mesenchymal cells (FMCs), a type of dermal fibroblast, have finished invading the MFF to further support and organize the dermal space and its ECM [40, 46]. Genetic evidence increasingly demonstrates that zebrafish MFF development models multiple processes affected in human skin diseases. Two prominent examples are fraser syndrome 1 (fras1) and fraser-related extracellular matrix 2a (frem2a), encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) components mutated in human Fraser Syndrome patients. During human and mouse development, correct BM-dermal junction formation requires FRAS1 and FREM2, especially in limb buds and craniofacial regions. FRAS1 and FREM2 mutations cause transient, locally restricted fetal skin blistering and later lead to characteristic malformations such as cryptopthalmos and syndactyly [47\u201349]. Likewise, mutations in the corresponding zebrafish homologs fras1 and frem2a lead to transient skin blistering in developing larval fins. Additional examples are the zebrafish mutants in the BM component laminin \u03b15 (lama5) and its transmembrane receptor integrin \u03b13 (itga3), as well as in the intracellular integrin modulator kindlin-1 (fermt1). All of these mutants are characterized by impaired MFF epidermal integrity, and they model the corresponding epidermal defects characteristic of human epidermolysis bullosa (lama5, itga3) and Kindler Syndrome (fermt1). Our study used GBT technology to identify eleven zebrafish integument loci expressed in either larval epidermis or FMCs. Three of those loci (fras1, hmcn1, grip1) are novel revertible alleles of known disease-related genes that will provide new, Cre-regulatable molecular tools for skin biology studies. We also identified neuregulin 2a (nrg2a) as a novel essential regulator of apical MFF development and MFF ridge cell polarity. nrg2a is a zebrafish homolog of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) superfamily member NEUREGULIN 2 (NRG2). Although an earlier morpholino (MO) knockdown study indicates that nrg2a participates in dorsal root ganglion development, nrg2a has not been investigated in conjunction with skin or MFF development. We show here that zebrafish nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt insertional mutants display specific defects in MFF ridge cell organization, leading to aberrant apical MFF morphology reminiscent of ErbB2 (erbb2 -/-) mutants. ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) mediate signaling by EGF superfamily ligands, such as the Neuregulins (NRGs), through several different signal transduction pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK, and/or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT. Our pharmacological inhibition, erbb expression, and activated ERK (pERK) and AKT (pAKT) immunofluorescence studies were consistent with this novel Nrg2a-dependent MFF pathway operating through ErbB2/3 and the PI3K \u2013AKT signal transduction cascade. Furthermore, the nrg2a phenotype led us to discover an early role for the epithelial cell polarity regulator and tumor suppressor lethal giant larvae 2 (lgl2) in MFF development. Previous mutant studies established that lgl2 promotes epidermal integrity by attenuating ErbB signaling during late larval development (96\u2013120 hpf), but did not find an earlier developmental role for lgl2 despite having documented its expression from 24 hpf onwards [52, 54]. We show here that MO-directed knockdown of lgl2 in nrg2a-deficient larvae rescues the MFF defects caused by loss of functional Nrg2a two days before lgl2\u2019s tumor suppressor role. Therefore, we have identified a previously undocumented negative impact of lgl2 on ErbB signaling that regulates epithelial polarity and keratinocyte biology during epidermal morphogenesis in the apical fin fold. Locating expression within a tissue of interest is a key step toward identifying new genes involved in tissue-specific biology. Using the online GBT database and image catalog zfishbook.org (http://www.zfishbook.org) as an initial selection tool, we screened 350 GBT insertional alleles for mRFP expression within the skin of the MFF (Fig 1B\u20131E; Fig 2B, 2D, 2F, 2H, 2J, 2L, and 2N) and/or covering the larval body (Fig 2A, 2C, 2E, 2G, 2I and 2K) [37, 38, 56]. That expression prioritization screen identified eleven gene-break alleles (GBT lines) with mRFP localization in the integument (Fig 1B\u20131E; Fig 2). We refer to these as the initial Zebrafish Integument Project (ZIP) GBT lines. The ZIP lines\u2019 RFP localization patterns fell into three broad categories. The first was expression in MFF edges (Fig 1B\u20131E); the second was expression throughout some or all of the epidermis (Fig 2A\u20132N); and the third was expression in FMCs (Fig 2I\u20132N; Fig 3). Because we identified these eleven ZIP lines among the initial cohort of GBT insertional alleles, the GBT-disrupted genes in several ZIP lines had been identified during our initial GBT mutagenesis study. We completed sequence-based identification of ZIP genes not identified in the previous study (Table 1). Four ZIP lines displayed restricted mRFP localization in epidermal cells along MFF edges at 24 hpf: GBT0078/glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (grip1 mn0078Gt; Fig 1C and 1C\u2019), GBT0156/fraser syndrome 1 (fras1 mn0156Gt; Fig 1D and 1D\u2019), GBT0263/hemicentin 1 (hmcn1 mn0263Gt; Fig 1E and 1E\u2019), and GBT0325/multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 6a (megf6a mn0325Gt; Fig 1B and 1B\u2019). As we had expected, the grip1 mn0078Gt, fras1 mn0156Gt, and hmcn1 mn0263Gt alleles\u2019 respective mRFP localization patterns, as well as their respective mRFP fusion transcript expression data from whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) [57, 58] (Fig 1F\u20131H), corresponded to previous in situ transcript expression data [17, 44, 45]. Thus our data affirmed that these gene-break alleles reliably recapitulated endogenous expression of the trapped loci. Seven lines displayed global epidermal localization throughout the entire integument: GBT0237/neuregulin 2a (nrg2a mn0237Gt; Fig 2A and 2B), GBT0275/collagen 4a4 (col4a4 mn0275Gt; Fig 2C and 2D), GBT0175/arhgef25b (arhgef25b mn0175Gt; Fig 2E and 2F), GBT0196/ahnak (ahnak mn0196Gt; Fig 2G and 2H), GBT0261/calpain 12 (capn12 mn0261Gt; Fig 2I and 2J), GBT0316/fk 506 binding protein 10b (fkbp10b mn0316Gt; Fig 2K and 2L), and GBT0245/muscle segment homeobox C (msxc mn0245Gt; Fig 2M and 2N). Several expression patterns emphasized external topology, especially where the larval epidermis covered the head and eye (Fig 2A, 2C, 2I, 2J and 2K), the yolk and yolk extension (Fig 2A, 2C, 2E, 2G, 2I, 2K and 2M), the pectoral fin folds (Fig 2A, 2E, 2G, 2I, 2K and 2M), and the median fin fold (Fig 2B, 2D, 2F, 2H and 2L). In contrast, mRFP expression was excluded from neuromasts embedded within the basal layer (nrg2a mn0237Gt, Fig 2B; col4a4 mn0275Gt, Fig 2D; capn12 mn0261Gt, Fig 2I and 2J; and fkbp10b mn0316Gt, Fig 2K). We observed irregularly shaped mRFP+ cells within the fin folds of lines msxc mn0245Gt (Fig 2M and 2N), capn12 mn0261Gt (Fig 2I and 2J), and fkbp10b mn0316Gt (Fig 2K and 2L), and the endogenous transcript patterns revealed via WISH analyses supported those observations (S1D\u2019 and S1F\u2019 Fig). Hypothesizing that those mRFP+ cells were FMCs, we crossed capn12 mn0261Gt and msxc mn0245Gt into ET37, a transgenic marker line expressing EGFP in FMCs (among other cell types, such as cleft cells) [40, 60]. Both Capn12mn0261Gt-mRFP and Msxcmn0245Gt-mRFP fusion proteins co-localized with ET37 EGFP expression in FMCs (Fig 3A, 3D, 3E and 3H). Capn12mn0261Gt-mRFP was expressed in FMCs throughout the fin fold (Fig 3C and 3D), but localized to the periphery of FMC cell bodies (Fig 3C and 3D), whereas ET37 EGFP appeared uniformly distributed (Fig 3F and 3H). In contrast, Msxcmn0245Gt-mRFP was predominately expressed in FMCs within the distal fin fold (Fig 3B\u20133D) and was uniformly distributed within individual cells (Fig 3B\u20133D). Those results confirmed msxc mn0245Gt mesenchymal expression and established capn12 mn0261Gt as a new FMC marker for future studies of that migratory cell population. Several alleles also displayed non-epidermal mRFP localization. Col4a4mn0275Gt-mRFP was expressed in the caudal vascular plexus (Fig 2D) and in some somitic myotomes (Fig 2C and 2D). fkbp10b mn0316Gt was expressed in the notochord (Fig 2K and 2L; S1D\u2019 Fig). And consistent with previous reports and with our own WISH analyses of the endogenous msxc transcript (S1F Fig), Msxcmn0245Gt-mRFP was expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), the sensory maculae of the inner ears, and the pectoral fin buds (Fig 2M and 2N). Of the eleven genes identified (Table 1; Fig 1B\u20131D\u2019; Fig 2), three have established roles in skin development and epidermal-dermal junction formation: fras1, grip1, and hmcn1 [44, 62]. As described above, FRAS1 is a large basement membrane (BM)-associated ECM protein connecting BM with underlying dermal connective tissue. The cytoplasmic protein GRIP1 is required for properly localizing FRAS1 to the basal side of epithelial cells. In human and mouse, recessive mutations in FRAS1 [47, 48] and GRIP1 [63\u201365] are characterized by malformations resulting from epidermal/epithelial blistering during fetal development. Zebrafish fras1 mutants are characterized by corresponding blistering in the developing fin folds, though zebrafish grip1 mutants have no overt morphological phenotype. Hmcn1/Fibulin 6 is a highly conserved member of the Fibulin ECM protein family, with epithelial cell-anchoring roles in C. elegans. Zebrafish genetic studies have shown Hmcn1 is essential for epithelial-dermal anchorage in developing fin folds. To varying degrees, five other ZIP alleles have reported zebrafish or mammalian integument expression: col4a4, ahnak, capn12, nrg2a, and msxc. Col4a4 encodes one of the six subunits of type IV collagen, a major BM structural component [8, 62, 67]. Originally isolated from bovine muzzle epidermis as Desmoyokin, AHNAK shuttles between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane in keratinocytes and other epithelial cells. Ahnakmn0196Gt\u2013mRFP shows similar membrane localization (Fig 2G and 2H). CALPAIN12, a member of the Calpain family of calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal cysteine proteases, is expressed in murine skin. Calpain activity has also been implicated in wound healing. Transcriptional profiling data indicate that NEUREGULIN 2 (NRG2) is expressed in the epidermal basal layer. msxc encodes the transcription factor MsxC and is expressed in zebrafish FMCs [39, 61]. Finally, ZIP lines arhgef25b, fkbp10b, and megf6a did not have documented integument expression. arhgef25b mn0175Gt, fkbp10b mn0316Gt, and megf6a mn0325Gt therefore represent novel skin genes\u2014and are novel revertible alleles suitable for future genetic studies. To determine which ZIP loci were required for early zebrafish skin or fin fold development, we bred each expressing insertion to homozygosity through a standard inbreeding scheme. For each line, we screened offspring of intercrossed heterozygous parents during the first five days of development (120 hpf) for abnormal skin or fin fold morphology present only in mRFP-positive (GBT-expressing) larvae and absent from their wild-type siblings (an \u201cmRFP-linked\u201d phenotype). Of the eleven lines screened, three displayed recessive, mRFP-linked phenotypes: fras1 mn0156Gt (Fig 4B), hmcn1 mn0263Gt (Fig 4C), and nrg2a mn0237Gt (Fig 5B). Comparisons to published phenotypes of ENU-derived alleles indicated that fras1 mn0156Gt and hmcn1 mn0263Gt represented novel alleles of known skin blistering mutants pinfin (pif) and nagel (nel) [44, 56], respectively (Table 1, Fig 4A\u20134C). GBT-tagged loci are revertible due to loxP sites within the RP2 vector (Fig 1A). Cre-mediated recombination permanently excises the mutagenic cassettes, restoring wild-type splicing to the endogenous locus. To verify that fras1 mn0156Gt/mn0156Gt and hmcn1 mn0263Gt/mn0263Gt insertional mutants were revertible, we tested whether Cre recombinase activity rescued the phenotypes (Fig 1A) [17, 19]. We injected Cre mRNA into 1-cell-stage offspring of fras1 +/mn0156Gt or hmcn1 +/mn0263Gt heterozygote intercrosses, respectively, and scored injected larvae for blistered fins at 48 hpf. The frequency of phenotypic larvae in both fras1 mn0156Gt/mn0156Gt (27%, n = 156, Fig 4D) and hmcn1 mn0263Gt/mn0263Gt (25%, n = 146, Fig 4E) uninjected controls were within expected Mendelian proportions. However, phenotypic frequencies were significantly reduced in their Cre-injected siblings (fras1 mn0156Gt/mn0156Gt: 5%, n = 140, Fig 4D; hmcn1 mn0263Gt/mn0263Gt: 8%, n = 223, Fig 4E). To confirm that our GBT alleles and ENU-induced point mutation alleles of the same locus were functionally equivalent, we conducted complementation testing between fras1 +/mn0156Gt and pif +/tm95b [44, 56] heterozygotes. fras1 +/mn0156Gt x pif +/tm95b offspring (fras1 +/mn0156Gt; pif +/tm95b trans-heterozygotes) showed typical fras1 fin blistering (Fig 4F) in a Mendelian proportion (28%, n = 445), indicating that the fras1 mn0156Gt and pif tm95b alleles failed to complement each other. Failure to complement demonstrated that fras1 mn0156Gt was a novel, mutagenic allele of the fras1 locus. Together, the Cre reversion and non-complementation results demonstrated that GBT alleles of known skin mutants phenocopied established ENU mutants. nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt homozygotes presented the third recessive phenotype, which was characterized by morphological defects along MFF edges. (Fig 5A and 5B). Whereas wild-type MFF edges are thin and flat (Fig 5A), nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutant MFF edges were thick and were often accompanied by one or more pointed protrusions along the posterior curvature (Fig 5B). In live embryos, phenotypic changes to MFF edge morphology were visible as early as 48 hpf (Fig 5B). Immunostaining for Collagen II (Col II), an MFF dermal space collagen, showed increased Col II accumulation and thick, bent actinotrichia within nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutant apical MFFs (Fig 5D), whereas actinotrichia in the corresponding distal regions of wild-type MFFs were much thinner or even absent (Fig 5C). In addition, nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants\u2019 pectoral fins were often bent or crumpled, or had altered edges similar to those of mutant MFFs (S3A and S3B Fig). Mutant larvae also failed to inflate their swim bladders (S3C and S3D Fig), and died between 8 and 12 days post fertilization (dpf) (S3E Fig). Unlike other published zebrafish skin mutants, however, nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants did not display epidermal phenotypes such as cellular aggregates, blistering, or fin fold degeneration during the first 120 hpf [43, 44, 50, 54, 56, 73\u201376] To confirm that the GBT insertion caused the MFF phenotype, we conducted Cre rescue experiments on offspring of nrg2a +/mn0237Gt intercrosses. Cre-mediated excision significantly reduced the frequency of phenotypic siblings in injected (7%, n = 322) versus uninjected (25%, n = 358) embryos (p < 0.002) (data not shown). Successful Cre-mediated phenotype rescue confirmed that homozygosity for the mn0237Gt allele caused the MFF phenotype. Because the previously reported zebrafish nrg2a sequence contained a putative non-coding first exon but did not contain an N-terminal signal sequence, we investigated whether additional nrg2a N-terminal exons were present. Through 5\u2019RACE and zebrafish genome database searches, we identified two alternative N-terminal exons, exons 1B and 1C. While the putative exon 1A contains only non-coding sequence and is used for the previously reported N-terminally truncated Nrg2a isoforms, the newly annotated exons 1B and 1C give rise to alterative N-termini of 145 (1B) or 37 (1C) amino acid residues, respectively (Fig 6A; S2 Fig). Exon 1B has homology to N-termini of NRG2 homologs in other species, whereas exon 1C shows no homology to any other species. SignalP4 software analysis (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) indicated that only the exon 1B-encoded isoform contains an N-terminal signal sequence. In addition, NucPred software analysis (http://www.sbc.su.se/~maccallr/nucpred/) predicted that the exon 1C-encoded isoform would be capable of nuclear localization (S2 Fig). The gene-breaking cassette that generates the mn0237Gt allele is located in the intron between exon 1C and exon 2 (Fig 6A). According to RT-PCR analyses, endogenous 1B and 1C transcripts were present in both wild-type (nrg2a +/+) and heterozygous (nrg2a +/mn0237Gt) siblings, but absent in homozygous mutant (nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt) siblings (Fig 6B and 6C). Conversely, 1B-mRFP and 1C-mRFP fusion transcripts were present in mutant and heterozygous siblings, but absent from wild-type siblings (Fig 6B and 6C). We note that we were unable to amplify the sequence corresponding to non-coding exon 1A. Together, these transcript data indicate that mn0237Gt is a null or near-null loss-of-function allele (see also Discussion). Both nrg2a-mRFP fusion transcripts (Fig 5G) and Nrg2amn0237Gt\u2013mRFP fusion protein (Fig 5E and 5H) were epidermally localized in 24 hpf nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygotes. WISH analyses using a probe for mRFP revealed that the fusion transcript was prominently expressed along the MFF edges (Fig 5E and 5F)\u2014that is, within the apical MFF\u2014and was weakly expressed throughout the entire epidermis (Fig 5G). WISH analyses of endogenous nrg2a transcripts in wild-type embryos showed the same pattern (24 hpf; Fig 5H and 5I), thus demonstrating that the mn0237Gt insertional allele recapitulates endogenous nrg2a expression. Co-labeled MFF transverse sections further revealed that the Nrg2amn0237Gt\u2013mRFP fusion protein was present in the basal layer of keratinocytes, together with the nuclearly localized basal keratinocyte marker \u0394Np63. In contrast, the EVL, characterized by expression of the krt4:EGFP transgene, lacked Nrg2amn0237Gt\u2013mRFP fusion protein (Fig 5J\u20135N). Higher magnification analyses confirmed that the punctate distribution of Nrg2amn0237Gt\u2013mRFP fusion protein (Fig 2B; Fig 5E) reflected nuclear localization of the fusion protein (Fig 6C\u20136F). In addition, Nrg2amn0237Gt\u2013mRFP fusion protein could be detected in the cytoplasm of basal keratinocytes (Fig 5J\u20135N; Fig 6C\u20136F). Both of those findings regarding Nrg2amn0237Gt\u2013mRFP subcellular localization were initially surprising because Nrg2a is a growth factor (but see Discussion). However, wild-type embryos injected with synthetic mRNA encoding the exon 1C version of the Nrg2a-mRFP fusion protein showed similar cytoplasmic localization. Exogenous exon 1C-mRFP fusion protein was present in both keratinocyte nuclei and cytoplasm (Fig 6K\u20136N), mimicking the distribution of the transgene-encoded fusion protein in nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygous embryos (Fig 6C\u20136F). Exogenous exon 1B-mRFP fusion protein also showed some cytoplasmic localization (Fig 6G\u20136J). These results were consistent with the presence of one or more putative nuclear localization sequences (NLS) in the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by nrg2a exon 1C (S2B Fig), and suggest that the complex subcellular localization of the Nrg2a-mRFP fusion protein is caused by differential distributions of the different N-terminal isoforms. To further characterize the MFF defect in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants, we compared transverse sections of median epidermal ridges (MER) from nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutant larvae with those of wild-type siblings. As described above, the MER consists of a central cleft cell, characterized by a cleft-like invagination of the dermal space, and ridge cells to either side of the cleft cell. To visualize the shapes of individual cleft and ridge cells, we crossed nrg2a mn0237Gt into a Tg(Ola.Actb:Hsa.hras-egfp) vu119 (hras-egfp) ubiquitously expressed membrane-bound EGFP background (Fig 7A\u20137C). Furthermore, to specifically label cleft cells, we crossed nrg2a mn0237Gt into an ET37 background, in which EGFP is specifically expressed in FMCs and cleft cells (Fig 7D and 7E). We also performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig 8; S4 Fig) to examine the cleft and ridge cells in finer detail. Because the gross morphological changes characterizing nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutant MFFs were visible by the second day of development (Fig 5B), we conducted our analyses between 30 and 52 hpf. During normal MFF morphogenesis, MER cells undergo characteristic consecutive cell shape changes, accompanied by changes in the organization of the developing dermal space between the two apposed epidermal sheets. During the initial steps of fin fold elevation along the body midline, MER ridge cells acquire wedge-like shapes by expanding their lateral and/or apical domains at the expense of the basal domain. But at 30 hpf, re-enlargement of ridge cell basal domains had partially reversed the earlier shape changes. Ridge cells acquired an intermediate shape, more cuboidal than wedge-like, while the dermal space was curved (Fig 7A). MER morphogenesis continued through 36 hpf (Fig 8A, 8E, and 8F; S4A Fig). By 52 hpf, the dermal space had straightened and ridge cells had elongated, acquiring a flattened shape with large, equally-sized apical and basal domains, but small lateral domains (Fig 7B and 7D; Fig 8C). Cleft cells in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants were only mildly affected. They expressed the ET37 marker (Fig 7E) and retained a typical cleft shape (Fig 7E; S4B Fig), though they often shared an atypically elongated lateral border with a neighboring ridge cell (S4B Fig). Ridge cells in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants, however, displayed far more dramatic alterations (Fig 7C and 7E; Fig 8B, 8D, 8G, and 8H; S4C and S4D Fig). Ridge cells\u2019 lateral domains, and especially their basal domains, were much enlarged, while their apical domains were smaller (Fig 8G and 8H; S4C and S4D Fig), so that they bulged into the dermal space, giving it a serpentine-like appearance (Fig 7C and 7E; Fig 8B, 8D\u20138G). The bulges consisted either of two ridge cells sharing an extended lateral border (Fig 8G and 8H), or of a single ridge cell with an extended basal domain (S4C and S4D Fig). In both cases, the extent of apical domains was reduced. These findings suggest that Nrg2a regulates ridge cells\u2019 apicobasal organization during apical MFF morphogenesis, thereby promoting or maintaining apical domain identity at the expense of basolateral identity. To determine whether Nrg2a might have a corresponding function in more proximal (non-MER) epidermal cells of the MFF, we compared 52 hpf and 96 hpf mutant and wild-type siblings via TEM. However, we did not observe consistent epidermal differences, malformations, or cell-cell junction defects in these regions of nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants compared to wild-type siblings (data not shown). Because Nrg2 is a ligand for ErbB family tyrosine kinase receptors [80\u201382], we hypothesized that the lack of Nrg2a-mediated ErbB signaling in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants caused the ridge cell phenotype. We tested whether pharmacological ErbB inhibition in wild-type embryos would phenocopy nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants. Because serpentined distal dermal spaces were observed as early as 36 hpf (Fig 8A), we incubated wild-type embryos in either a low dose (1\u03bcM) or high dose (20\u03bcM) of the small-molecule EGFR/pan-ErbB inhibitor PD168393 [52, 83] from 24 hpf through 52 hpf. We examined MFF morphology in live embryos at 52 hpf (Fig 9C\u20139G) and 96 hpf (Fig 9A), and via TEM at 52 hpf (Fig 7I and 7J). At 52 hpf and 96 hpf, PD168393-treated wild-type larvae displayed thickened MFF edges (Fig 9A, 9E, and 9G), similar to those observed in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants (Fig 5B). The response was dose-dependent (Fig 9A, 9E, and 9G). TEM analyses of randomly selected 20\u03bcM PD168393-treated embryos (n = 21) showed serpentine-like MFF distal dermal spaces (Fig 9J) indistinguishable from distal dermal spaces in nrg2a insertional mutants (compare with Fig 8D). These data indicate that inhibiting ErbB receptor signaling in wild-type embryos recapitulates the nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt phenotype. Because our data point to a functional connection between Nrg2a and ErbB signaling, we conducted a genetic interaction analysis to test whether partial loss of both Nrg2a and ErbB signaling had synergistic effects on MFF morphogenesis. Specifically, we tested whether nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygous larvae were more sensitive to moderate ErbB inhibition than were their wild-type siblings. In fact, significantly more nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygotes (64%, n = 152, p < 0.0001) phenocopied nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants at the low PD168393 dose (1 \u03bcM) than did sibling (23%, n = 116) or non-sibling (28%, n = 120) wild-type embryos (Fig 9B; compare also Fig 9E with Fig 9F). In contrast, nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygosity did not further enhance the phenotype caused by the high (20 \u03bcM) PD168393 dose (compare Fig 9G with Fig 9H). Together with our earlier inhibitor data, these studies indicate that the nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt MFF phenotype results from a loss of Nrg2a-mediated ErbB signaling. Vertebrates have four different Neuregulins (NRG1-4) and four different members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR/ErbB1/HER1, ErbB2/Neu/HER2, ErbB3/HER3, and ErbB4/HER4). The combinatorial possibilities of those ligands and receptors permit diversity and specificity in signaling. Just as EGF binds to and signals through ErbB1/ErbB1 homodimers or ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers, NRG1 and NRG2 preferentially signal via ErbB3/ErbB2 heterodimers, while NRG3 and NRG4 do so via ErbB4 [53, 80\u201382, 84]. Intracellular signal transduction of all ErbB receptors can occur through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, although p85-mediated activation of the PI3K \u2013AKT pathway has been described as the major signal transduction route for ErbB3 in particular [53, 85\u201388]. Consistent with the requirement for Nrg2a during zebrafish apical MFF morphogenesis, we observed strong epidermal expression of its potential co-receptor erbb3a during the 30 to 36 hpf developmental window (Fig 9L; 34 hpf). However, we failed to detect epidermal expression of the zebrafish EGF receptor gene egfra (erbb1a) during the same timeframe (Fig 9K; 34 hpf). Furthermore, and consistent with possible ErbB3 involvement, immunofluoresence analyses revealed phosphorylated (activated) AKT (pAKT) in MFF ridge cells at 34 hpf (Fig 9M and 9N). Strikingly, pAKT levels were strongly reduced in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants\u2019 MFF ridge cells, but not at other sites (Fig 9O and 9P). Unlike the dramatic changes in pAKT levels, activated ERK (pERK) levels in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants did not change relative to pERK levels in wild-type siblings (S5 Fig). Together, these data suggest that Nrg2a regulates MFF ridge cell apicobasal organization and morphogenesis via ErbB3-mediated PI3K \u2013AKT signaling. To date, ErbB activity in zebrafish epidermis has only been described in the context of the tumor suppressor lethal giant larvae 2 (lgl2), which blocks ErbB signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) to safeguard epidermal integrity during late larval stages (120 hpf). Yet even though lgl2 is epidermally expressed by 24 hpf, it has no identified developmental role during that early time frame. However, previous characterizations of Lgl2 as an epithelial polarity regulator that promotes basal fate [54, 89, 90], along with the basolateral domain expansion observed in nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants\u2019 MFF ridge cells and the temporal overlap among lgl2, nrg2a (Fig 5H and 5I), and erbb3a expression patterns (Fig 9L), led us to speculate that Lgl2 might play an earlier role in epidermal development. We hypothesized that that earlier Lgl2 role involved opposing Nrg2 \u2013ErbB3 signaling during MFF morphogenesis. To test that hypothesis, we suppressed lgl2 in the nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt background. Morpholino (MO) knockdown of lgl2 significantly restored nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants\u2019 MFF morphology at 52 hpf (Fig 10A\u201310H) relative to both uninjected controls and tp53 MO-injected controls (Fig 10A). Indeed, lgl2 MO-injected and genotyped nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt embryos displayed external MFF morphology indistinguishable from that of wild-type siblings (compare Fig 10H with Fig 10D). Furthermore, MFF internal organization was also ameliorated in lgl2 MO-injected nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt embryos. Dermal actinotrichia organization, (Fig 10I and 10J; 48 hpf), ridge cells\u2019 apicobasal organization, and MFF dermal space bending (Fig 10K and 10L; 52 hpf) were all dramatically normalized, leading to embryos indistinguishable from wild-type (compare Fig 10J with Fig 5C, and Fig 10L with Fig 7D). These results indicated that loss of Lgl2 activity suppressed the nrg2a phenotype, revealing a new and significantly earlier role for lgl2 in fin fold development, distinct from its established tumor-suppressing and hemidesomosome (basal)-promoting functions in the later body epidermis [52, 54]. By selecting for skin- and MFF-localized mRFP, we identified four genes with little or no previously appreciated connection to skin biology: megf6a, nrg2a, arhgef25b, and fkbp10b (Fig 1B and 1B\u2019; Fig 2A, 2B, 2E, 2F, 2K and 2L). In addition, we isolated GBT alleles of several known skin-related genes (Table 1; Fig 1C\u20131E\u2019; Fig 2). In zebrafish embryos, apical MFF basal keratinocytes express fras1, grip1, and hmcn1 [44, 45], and MFF mesenchymal cells (FMCs) express msxc. ahnak and capn12 have not yet been investigated in zebrafish, but have been detected in mammalian stratified squamous epithelia [70, 91]. col4a4 encodes one (A4) of the six possible constituents (A1-A6) of collagen IV, which forms large networks integral to BMs. Zebrafish col4a4 expression has thus far only been analyzed via RT-PCR of whole-body RNA extracts, without corresponding spatial resolution. However, in humans, cutaneous collagen IV largely employs subunits other than COL4A4, and COL4A4 loss-of-function mutations, such as Alport Sydrome, largely affect epithelia other than the skin. Thus, zebrafish col4a4 mn0275Gt cutaneous expression offers a new tool for investigating evolutionary changes in tissue-specific expression of these important BM components and the impact of those changes on the biology of specific organs. With fras1, grip1, and hmcn1, we identified GBT alleles of loci with documented functions in zebrafish MFF development and connections to human skin disease. In humans and mice, recessive loss-of-function mutations in FRAS1 and GRIP1 cause the rare, clinically overlapping congenital disorders Fraser Syndrome and Ablepharon Macrostomia Syndrome [47, 48, 64, 65]. Both are characterized by malformations resulting from epidermal or epithelial blistering during fetal development due to compromised anchorage of epidermal and other epithelial basement membranes to underlying connective tissues such as the dermis. hmcn1 has recently been proposed as an additional Fraser Syndrome gene, though that hypothesis awaits confirmation. fras1 mn0156Gt/mn0156Gt and hmcn1 mn0263Gt/mn0263Gt homozygotes fully phenocopied the respective ENU-induced mutants (Fig 4A\u20134C). Consistent with previous MO knockdown results, grip1 mn0078Gt/mn0078Gt homozygotes lacked an overt skin phenotype, likely due to partial functional redundancy with zebrafish grip2. In contrast with the ENU-induced alleles, however, the fras1 mn0156Gt and hmcn1 mn0263Gt GBT alleles are revertible in a Cre-dependent manner (Fig 4D and 4E). That reversion capability offers important experimental advantages. For instance, coupling transgenic methods for temporally and/or spatially restricted Cre expression with GBT reversion would allow investigators to parse more finely the spatiotemporal requirements for Fras1 and Hmcn1 in MFF development. Similarly, tissue-specific Cre expression could be used to rescue the lethal craniofacial defects of fras1 mutants, thereby permitting investigations into possible later defects in fras1 mutants, including possible later consequences of the (non-lethal) epidermal blistering. In mammals, transient epidermal blistering in Fras1 mutant embryos is thought to abrogate crucial epithelial\u2014mesenchymal interactions, leading to characteristic later defects such as syndactyly (fused digits) or cryptophthalmos (fused eye lids) [47\u201349]. Thus far, it has not been possible to investigate possible later consequences of embryonic epidermal blistering in the zebrafish model due to the lethal craniofacial defects. But as outlined above, such studies could now be carried out with the new revertible GBT allele. The 11 ZIP lines described here (Table 1; Fig 1B\u20131E\u2019; Fig 2) comprise 3% of the original 350 GBT lines. Continued expression cataloging and gene identification will build a comprehensive, in vivo spatiotemporal anatomical expression atlas for integument development and diseases, revealing relationships among anatomy, gene expression, and protein localization. That unique resource would be a valuable supplement to standard anatomical atlases [94, 95] as well as a comparative resource for mammalian skin biology studies. Of the 11 identified loci, 3 gave a morphologically visible larval skin phenotype when their respective gene-breaking alleles were bred to homozygosity (fras1, hmcn1, nrg2a). The question of whether any of the other identified loci are required during later stages of skin biology requires further investigation since our analyses only extended through 120 hpf. Because the fras1 and hmcn1 mutant phenotypes had already been characterized, we focused on the nrg2a mutants, which displayed specific defects during MFF morphogenesis. As with the other Neuregulin family members, zebrafish nrg2a exists in multiple isoforms due to differential promoter usage and alternative splicing. Previously reported isoforms would have lacked the N-terminal sequences described here because exon 1A is a non-coding exon. Such 1A isoforms would therefore lack the first 145 amino acid residues of the 1B isoform and the first 37 N-terminal amino acid residues of the 1C isoform that we describe here (S2 Fig). We successfully amplified 1B and 1C transcripts from 5\u2019 RACE and RT-PCR analyses, but were unable to successfully amplify the 1A isoform. Those results suggest that the 1B and 1C versions are the predominant nrg2a transcripts generated during the stages relevant to MFF development. It should also be noted that Honjo et al. used MOs targeting an internal splice site present in all isoforms, rather than the 1A-specific translational start region, leaving open the question of which isoform(s) are required for dorsal root ganglia development. Most important for our present work, however, is the fact that all three nrg2a alternative first exons, 1A-C, are located upstream of the GBT insertion site that generates the nrg2a mn0237Gt allele. Consequently, nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants have truncated nrg2a transcripts which lack the sequences encoded by exon 2 onwards due to the GBT cassette\u2019s transcription termination sequence (Fig 1A). Accordingly, the 1B and 1C transcripts give rise to Nrg2a-mRFP fusion proteins in which the N-terminal 138 or 29 amino acids encoded by exons 1B or 1C, respectively, are directly fused to mRFP. 1A transcripts are not translated at all because the endogenous translational start codon is localized in exon 2. Therefore, nrg2a mn0237Gt is most likely a null or near-null loss of function allele. It is also noteworthy that out of all three N-terminal isoforms, only the longer and phylogenetically conserved 1B isoforms contain an N-terminal signal sequence involved in co-translational protein translocation to the endoplasmatic reticulum and subsequent secretion. However, all endogenous isoforms share an internal transmembrane domain which can target the proteins to the cell membrane from where their biologically active ectodomains can be released via proteolytic processing. Nrg2amn0237Gt-mRFP fusion proteins lack that internal transmembrane domain because they only contain exon 1-encoded Nrg2 sequences. The absence of that domain in Nrg2amn0237Gt-mRFP fusion proteins may contribute to the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of the 1C fusion protein, which also lacks an N-terminal signal sequence, but instead contains at least one nuclear localization sequence (S2 Fig). This suggests that the unexpected distribution of the fusion proteins might be a special feature of the targeted locus and a consequence of the lack of crucial internal domains in the encoded proteins, thus demonstrating an expected limitation (loss of protein trafficking signals due to truncation) of GBT technology to recapitulate the subcellular distribution of the endogeneous protein counterparts. On the other hand, we cannot rule out that the RFP localization observed in nrg2a mn0237Gt embryos does reflect the actual subcellular distribution of the endogenous Nrg2 proteins. Indeed, nuclear localization has also been reported for several other RTK ligands, such as different Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and the Neuregulin relative EGF, as well as their receptors [99\u2013103]. Studies with isoform-specific Nrg2a antibodies or full-length Nrg2-RFP fusion constructs will be needed to give more definitive answers. In mice, loss of Nrg2 leads to growth retardation and reduced reproductive capacity. We were unable to address whether the loss of Nrg2a in zebrafish has similar consequences because nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants die during larval stages, well before the onset of significant somatic growth and sex differentiation. The reason for this larval death is currently unknown. However, the defects during MFF morphogenesis described here are most likely not the primary cause, because other mutants can survive in the complete absense of median fins (M.H., unpublished observations). Altered MFF morphology similar to that of nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt mutants has only been reported for one other mutant to date\u2014erbb2 -/-, which harbors a loss-of-function mutation in EGF/NRG co-receptor ErbB2. However, the MFF morphological defects of erbb2 -/- mutants have not yet been analyzed in additional detail. The initial steps of MFF formation and elevation involve basal detachment of midline keratinocytes and their transition from a cuboidal to a wedged morphology, which is marked by shrinkage of their basal domains [37, 38]. The distal-most basal keratinocyte in the tip of the elevating fold becomes the cleft cell; the two to three basal keratinocytes adjacent to each cleft cell become ridge cells. As we have documented here, ridge cells then transition a second time, re-elongating their basal domains at the expense of their apical domains to reverse their wedged morphology and return to their initial rectangular/cuboidal morphology (Fig 6A). Finally, ridge cells then become progressively flatter by extending their basal and apical sides at the expense of their lateral domains (Fig 6F and 6H). This second phase of cell shape changes is affected in nrg2a mutants: nrg2a mutant ridge cells display disproportionately expanded basolateral domains and bulge basally, deforming the dermal space into serpentine shapes (Fig 6C, 6E, 6G and 6I; S3C\u2013S3F Fig). In addition, ectopic and enlarged actinotrichia in the distal-most regions of the MFF (Fig 5H) suggested increased basal activity such as secreting ECM components into the dermal space. Together, these findings suggest that coordinating apical and basal extension during ridge cells\u2019 second shape change requires active Nrg2a \u2013ErbB signaling which plays a \u201cpro-apical\u201d role during that transition by promoting maintenance of the apical domain and/or antagonizing basolateral epithelial domains to counterbalance the \u201cbasalization\u201d of ridge cells that occurs during their transition from a wedged back to a rectangular shape. These shape changes during the second phase of MFF morphogenesis mainly occur in the distal-most MFF cells (ridge and cleft cells), whereas more proximal MFF basal keratinocytes remain rectangular during their initial recruitment into the MFF. Accordingly, later MFF morphogenetic steps require less- pronounced shape changes by those proximal basal keratinocytes, which could explain why they are not affected in nrg2a mutants. Consistent with the spatially restricted defects in the mutant, distal MFFs in wild-type embryos show stronger endogenous nrg2a expression (Fig 5H and 5I). Ridge cells\u2019 higher pAKT levels (Fig 9M\u20139P) also suggest that the apical MFF receives stronger Nrg2a signaling than do proximal MFF cells. In contrast, expression of the likely Nrg2a receptor gene erbb3a is fairly homogeneous throughout all basal epidermal cells (Fig 9K). In conclusion, we have good evidence that the distal restriction of the defects in the mutants is due to spatially restricted signaling in wild type embryos. Nevertheless, it remains unclear why only the ridge cells, but not the cleft cells, are affected in nrg2a mutants. Identifying the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pro-apical and/or anti-basal effects of Nrg2a-ErbB signaling will require additional investigation. The expression of erbb3a, but not egfra/erbb1, at the appropriate locations (Fig 9), together with previously reported erbb2 epidermal expression in zebrafish embryos and the requirement of erbb2-/- for proper MFF morphogenesis, suggests that Nrg2a may signal via Erbb2/3 receptor heterodimers, which would be consistent with biochemical findings. In addition, reduced pAKT levels, but normal pERK levels in nrg2a mutant MFF keratinocytes (Fig 9; S5 Fig) points to Nrg2a \u2013ErbB signaling via the PI3K \u2013AKT signal transduction pathway, rather than the MAPK/ERK pathway, as has also found for Neuregulin signaling in other instances [53, 85, 87, 88]. Our finding that concurrent loss of Lgl2 activity significantly alleviated MFF defects in nrg2a mutants suggests that Nrg2a\u2019s pro-apical effects extend to antagonizing Lgl2 pro-basal activity. As a homolog of the Drosophila cell polarity gene lethal giant larvae (lgl), lgl2 is a cell polarity regulator required for maintaining the basolateral domain in epithelial cells [89, 90]. Likewise, the epidermal defects of zebrafish lgl2 mutants can also be interpreted in terms of loss of basolateral identity. Basal keratinocytes in lgl2 mutants not only lack hemidesomomes, basal domain junctions involved in attachment to underlying BM, but also display an even more pronounced loss of basal characteristics by undergoing EMT. Such events point to a tumor-suppressor role for Lgl2. Overactive ErbB signaling and its PI3K \u2013AKT signal transduction branch, on the other hand, have well-known oncogenic effects, promoting EMT and hyperproliferation [105\u2013107]. Thus, the roles of the Nrg2a \u2013ErbB3 \u2013AKT axis and Lgl2 during MFF morphogenesis identified in this study suggest that in addition to the established antagonistic relationship between ErbB signaling and Lgl2 during later phases of epidermal homeostasis and carcinogenesis, the Nrg2a \u2013ErbB3 \u2013AKT signaling axis and Lgl2 have as-yet unappreciated antagonistic, and more moderate anti- or pro-basal effects, respectively, on keratinocytes during earlier steps of epidermal morphogenesis. To our knowledge, our data also provide the first indication that AKT/pAKT is involved in regulating apicobasal organization and epithelial cell polarity during the development of any species. Strikingly however, despite their early and late antagonisms, Lgl2 and Nrg2a per se are uniquely required during different stages of epidermal morphogenesis and homeostasis. Lgl2 is required during late stages: epidermal defects in lgl2 mutants only become apparent between 108 and 120 hpf, and MFF formation is unaffected. In contrast, Nrg2a is only required early: mutants develop MFF defects between 30 and 36 hpf (Fig 6), and we did not detect any later-stage body epidermis defects corresponding to those of lgl2 mutants (data not shown). Yet concomitant loss of Lgl2 rescues the early MFF defects of nrg2 mutants (Fig 10), while concomitant loss of ErbB2 signaling rescues the late defects of lgl2 mutants. Genetically, these findings argue that Lgl2 is epistatic to Nrg2a \u2013ErbB signaling during early MFF morphogenesis: in double-deficient zebrafish embryos, the Lgl2 phenotype (no MFF defects) was dominant over the nrg2a phenotype. This suggests that Nrg2a \u2013ErbB acts at least partly by blocking Lgl2 activity, and that the MFF phenotype of Nrg2a-deficient embryos is at least partially caused by Lgl2 overactivity. That proposition fits with previous findings that EGF treatment suppresses LGL2 transcription in human cell culture systems, but confirming it will require analyzing Lgl2 protein levels in nrg2a mutant embryos. ErbB signaling, on the other hand, appears to be epistatic to Lgl2 during later epidermal homeostasis and carcinogenesis: in ErbB2/Lgl2-double deficient zebrafish larvae, the erbb2 phenotype (no EMT, no keratinocyte hyperproliferation) was dominant over the lgl2 phenotype. Those findings, together with increased levels of ErbB signaling mediator pERK in lgl2 mutants, had led to the conclusion that Lgl2 acts by blocking ErbB signaling, and that the MFF phenotype of Lgl2-deficient embryos is at least partially caused by ErbB overactivity. Together, our data and those of Reischauer et al. suggest the existence of a mutual negative feedback mechanism in which Lgl2 blocks ErbB signaling and vice versa. However, these opposing interactions occur at different developmental stages, and may involve different ErbB signaling molecules. Thus, early MFF ridge cell morphogenesis involves Nrg2a, most likely acting through ErbB2/3 and the PI3K \u2013AKT signal transduction pathway (Fig 9), whereas later carcinogenesis involves the ERK MAPK signal transduction pathway, most likely activated by EGF and ErbB1/2. Although studies of Neuregulins have primarily addressed their roles during neuronal or neural crest development [109, 110], expression of the NRG ligand family has also been described in epithelial contexts, most notably in mammary gland epithelium. Neuregulins and their ErbB receptors are expressed in murine embryonic mammary gland epithelium. Expression of Neuregulins 1, 2, 3, and 4 has also been reported in breast cancer cell lines and ductal carcinomas. There is also some evidence that NRG2 has an epidermal role. A transcriptional profiling study of differential gene expression during human epidermal differentiation found that NRG2 was expressed in basal keratinocytes, while suprabasal cells expressed the known NRG2 receptor ERBB3 and its likely co-receptor ERBB2. In light of these findings, our data regarding the role of Nrg2a during zebrafish MFF development may also provide new insights into regulation of epithelial polarity and morphogenesis during mammalian epithelial development and carcinogenesis. Overall, GBT technology provides a valuable leap forward in using the vertebrate zebrafish model to identify important molecular players and to gain new insights into the genetic control of skin biology and disease. Adult fish and embryo care was performed according to standard protocols approved by the on-site Institutional and Public Animal Care and Use Committees. Wild-type stocks were derived from the offspring of adult zebrafish obtained from Segrest Farms (Segrest Farms, Florida, USA). Non-GBT transgenic marker lines used were enhancer trap ET37 [46, 60], ubiquitously expressed membrane-bound EGFP Tg(Ola.Actb:Hsa.hras-egfp) vu119 [75, 114] and Tg(krt4:GFP) gz7. Live larvae were imaged for mRFP fluorescence on an Axio ImagerZ.1 ApoTome microscope (Zeiss) with AxioVision software (Zeiss). Z-stack images were flattened using the AxioVision Multi-Image Projection (MIP) tool. SCORE imaging techniques were used to hold live larvae and optimized for high-quality fluorescent imaging as follows: live larvae were transferred into 2.5\u20132.6% methylcellulose and drawn into borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments WPI #1B120-3). 80% glycerol was used as the imaging medium between capillary and cover slip. Brightfield images of live larvae were obtained either by mounting the specimen in 1.5% methylcellulose and imaging with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using the Zeiss AxionCam HRc camera and Axiovision software, or by SCORE imaging on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope using a Canon PowerShot A640 camera with Remote Capture Task and Canon Image Browser software. Cre-mediated excision of GBT mutagenic cassettes was performed as previously described. fras1 and hmcn1 reversion experiments were scored at 48 hpf; nrg2a reversion experiments were scored at 96 hpf. Results were graphed with PRISM software (Graphpad); p-value and significance were calculated with t-tests. Candidate loci for ZIP GBT insertions were identified from fusion transcripts using 5\u2019RACE on race-ready cDNA (RR-cDNA) as previously described or from genomic DNA (gDNA) using TAIL PCR [116, 117]. Candidate insertion loci were confirmed or rejected by genotyping 8 individual sibling larvae, 4 mRFP+ and 4 mRFP-, for a correctly oriented RP2 insertion within the candidate locus. Individual genotyping reactions were designed to identify the genomic-transposon junction (\u201cjunction product\u201d) within a specific locus of interest using one transposon-specific primer and one gene-specific (GS) primer. A candidate insertion locus was confirmed if all mRFP+ siblings were positive for the junction product within that locus of interest and all mRFP- siblings were negative for that same junction product. The transposon-specific primers were 5R-mRFP-P2 (5\u2019-CCTTGAAGCGCATGAACTCCTTGAT-3\u2019) (used with all forward (\u201cF\u201d) GS primers) and 3R-GM-P2 (5\u2019-TGGGATTACACATGGCATGGATGAAC-3\u2019) (used with all reverse (\u201cR\u201d) GS primers). GS primers were as follows: GNT-SEC0078-F3 (5\u2019-CAAGGCACAGCAAGGCTGGTGTA-3\u2019), GNT-SEC0078-R0 (5\u2019-CGGACAGATTTTCACTCATACATTGCCT-3\u2019), RT-SEC0156-F1 (5\u2019-CTGCTCAAAGGCTCTGATCTTGAACC-3\u2019), RT-SEC0156-R1 (5\u2019-ccacacagaccctacaggacgaatg-3\u2019), RT-SEC0175-F1 (5\u2019-GCTGTTCACCCTTCTGTTGGAAGGTT-3\u2019), RT-GBT0175-R1 (5\u2019-AGTGGAGACAGAGGCTGAAGGAGGAT-3\u2019), GNT-GBT0196-F1 (5\u2019-GACTGAAGTCTGAGGACCTTGC-3\u2019), GNT-nrg2a-F1 (5\u2019-gcagggaacagttaattgcttgacag-3\u2019), GNT-nrg2a-R4 (5\u2019- ggctgaatcttggcaacaatgcaac -3\u2019), GNT-GBT0245-F1 (5\u2019-CTTCTCAAATGGCTCCTTGCCTC-3\u2019), GNT-GBT0263-R1 (5\u2019-TCCAACACCCTCCAACACC-3\u2019), GNT-GBT0261-F1 (5\u2019-TATGGCTGTATATCATCACTGGTTGG-3\u2019), GNT-GBT0275-F2 (5\u2019-TTAGAAACGGCAGGAAACCGAG-3\u2019), GNT-GBT0316-F1 (5\u2019-TTGGTTACGTCCAGTGCGTC-3\u2019), GNT-SEC0325-F1 (5\u2019-CCAGTCCGCCGCTGAGGG-3\u2019), GNT-SEC0325-R1 (5\u2019-CGAATTGCTGTGAGATAGCGTTGAATAG-3\u2019). Transcripts from nrg2a alternate first exons, currently designated 1B and 1C, were manually identified and/or confirmed as follows. The presence of endogenous exon 1B transcript was confirmed using forward GS primer RT-nrg2a-F3 (5\u2019-ACACTTATCCATGCTGCTCATCGG-3\u2019) with reverse GS primer in nrg2a exon 4 RT-nrg2a-R3 (5\u2019-CGTTGCATCTTCTGGCATGGC-3\u2019) in 2 dpf wild-type cDNA. Exon 1C was identified via 5\u2019RACE on wild-type RR-cDNA as previously described. The presence of endogenous 1C transcript was confirmed using forward GS primer RT-nrg2a-F3.1 (5\u2019-AGGCGTAAGGACAGCCAAACTC-3\u2019) with RT-nrg2a-R3 in cDNA from nrg2a +/+ and nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygous (nrg2a +/-) siblings. The presence of nrg2a 1B-mRFP and 1C-mRFP fusion transcripts were confirmed using either GS primer RT-nrg2a-F3 or RT-nrg2a-F3.1, respectively, with mRFP reverse primer 5R-mRFP-P2 in cDNA from nrg2a +/mn0237Gt heterozygous (nrg2a +/-) and nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt (nrg2a -/-) homozygous mutant siblings. We were unable to confirm the presence of an endogenous transcript containing the predicted exon 1A. Embryos obtained from nrg2a +/- intercrosses were genotyped using three primers (GNT-nrg2a-F1, GNT-nrg2a-R4, and 5R-mRFP-P2) in a single reaction, yielding either an 800 bp fragment for homozygous wild-types or a 1091 bp fragment for homozygous mutants, and both fragments for heterozygous siblings. The isoform 1A sequence corresponds to predicted Nrg2a isoforms X7 \u2013X9 (GenBank accession numbers XM_005161329, XM_005161330, XM_005161331) in Zv10 and to the sequence reported by Honjo et al. (GenBank accession number NM_001099254). The isoform 1B sequence corresponds to those of predicted Nrg2a isoforms X1 \u2013X4 (GenBank accession numbers NM_001099254, XM_009295459, XM_00929546, XM_005161327) in Zv10, and the isoform 1C sequence to that of predicted Nrg2a isoform X5 (GenBank accession number XM_009295461) in Zv10. Larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and dehydrated/rehydrated through an ethanol/PBST series. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) was performed as previously described [57, 58, 118]. DIG-labeled probes were generated from cDNA clones as described in for fras1, hmcn1, and grip1, in for msxc, and in for mRFP. cDNA clones for ahrgef25b, fkbp10b, and erbb3a were obtained from SourceBioScience, the cDNA clone for egfra was a gift from M. Sonawane. Probes for endogenous nrg2a were obtained with DIG-labeled nrg2a antisense riboprobe generated with primers RT-nrg2a-F4 (5\u2019-TCCAGTGTTGGCAGACGAAGG-3\u2019) and RT-nrg2a-R2 (5\u2019-TTGGGCATGTATAACCGCAGGG-3\u2019). For nrg2a, the in situ protocol was slightly modified from. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked with either blocking buffer (2% lamb serum (vol/vol), 2 mg/ml BSA) or 2% Boehringer Blocking Reagent (11096176001, Roche) in maleic acid buffer containing 0.1% Tween20 (MABT) for 4 h at room temperature prior to immunoreaction with anti-DIG-AP Fab fragments antibody (11093274910, Roche, 1:500). Fixed, stained WISH larvae were rehydrated through an ethanol/PBST series into 80% glycerol or into benzylbenzoate/benzylalcohol (2:1). Single images were obtained on a SteREO Lumar.V12 stereomicroscope (Zeiss) using AxioVision software (Zeiss). Single focal plane images for creating multi-image extended depth of field projections from brightfield images (\u201cmanual Z-stack\u201d) were obtained using SCORE imaging techniques on an Axioplan2 microscope (Zeiss) with a PowerShot A640 camera (Canon) and ZoomBrowser EX software (Canon). Extended depth of field projections were generated in Image J (NIH) from multiple single focal plane images using StackReg and Extended Depth of Field plugins. To generate expression vectors pT3Ts-nrg2a-1B-mRFP and pT3Ts-nrg2a-1C-mRFP, the AUG-free mRFP coding sequence was amplified from pGBT-RP2 using primers CDS-GBT_mRFP-F1 (5\u2019- AGATCTCGCTAGCAATTATGGTTCAGCCGGAATTCACCC-3\u2019) and CDS-GBT_mRFP-R1 (5\u2019-aaactagtcttaggctccggtggag-3\u2019) and subcloned into a Strataclone vector backbone (Agilent). mRFP was then subcloned into the SpeI and BglII sites of pT3Ts-Cre to create pT3Ts-mRFP. The nrg2a-mRFP isoforms were amplified from cDNA obtained from nrg2a mn0237Gt/mn0237Gt (nrg2a -/-) homozygous mutant embryos using either forward primer rob-nrg2a-1A (5\u2019-ATACTAGTATGCTGCTCATCGGGGT-3\u2019) or rob-nrg2a-1B (5\u2019-ATACTAGTATGTCAGAGGGTAAGAAGAAGGAAC-3\u2019), respectively, with reverse primer rob-nrg2a-R1 (5\u2019-CCTCATCTTGATCTCGCCCTT-3\u2019) and subcloned into the pT3Ts-mRFP backbone. The pT3TS-EGFPCAAX expression vector was created as follows: EGFPCAAX was amplified from 384.pME-EGFPCAAX plasmid using primers CDS_EGFP_CAAX-F1 (5\u2019-GAAGGATCCATCATGGTGAGCAAGGG-3\u2019) and CDS-EGFP_CAAX-R1 (5\u2019-CAAACTAGTCAGGAGAGCACACACTT-3\u2019) and ligated into the SpeI and BglII site of pT3TS-Cre. To generate pT3TS_nlsTagBFP, a synthetic SV-40 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) was added to the N-terminus of Tag-BFP (pTagBFP-N, Evrogen, FP172), which was then cloned into the SpeI and BglII site of pT3TS-Cre. Expression vectors were linearized with SacI and RNA was made using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). 1 nL of 12.5 pg/nL caax-EGFP, 25 pg/nL nls-BFP, and 25 pg/nL of either nrg2a-1B-mRFP or nrg2a-1C-mRFP were co-injected into the yolks of one-cell stage wild-type embryos. 1 dpf injected embryos were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. Larvae for cryosections were fixed in either 4% PFA or EAF (40% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, 4% formaldehyde in PBS) for 3h at RT, washed several times with PBST, embedded in 15% sucrose/1% agarose in PBS, incubated in 30% sucrose/PBS overnight and mounted in tissue freezing medium (Leica). 10 or 20 \u03bcm sections of tails were obtained using a Leica CM1850 cryostat. Larval heads were used for genotyping. Immunostaining was performed essentially as previously described using the following primary antibodies: anti-collagen II (DSHB II-II6B3-c, 1:200), rabbit anti-RFP (Abcam; ab62341, 1:200), chicken anti-GFP (Invitrogen; A10262, 1:300), mouse anti-p63 BC4A4 (Zytomend, 1:200), and mouse anti-MAP Kinase, activated (Sigma, M9692, 1:50). For pAkt staining, cryosections of EAF-fixed embryos were washed with PBS-TritonX, followed by an antigen retrieval in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 9.0 for 5 min at 98\u00b0C, blocking in 5% sheep serum and antibody incubation with rabbit anti-pAkt (S473) (Cell signaling #4060, 1:50) (modified after). Secondary antibodies were anti-rabbitAlexa555, anti-mouseAlexa488, anti-mouseAlexa647, and anti-chickenAlexa488 (all Invitrogen, 1:200). Sections were mounted either directly in Mowiol containing DAPI or stained with a 1:1000 dilution of CellMask Deep Red Plasma membrane Stain (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 10 min and washed with PBS several times prior to mounting. Images were taken using a Zeiss Confocal (LSM710 META). A 10 mM stock of PD168393 (EMD Millipore Calbiochem #513033) was prepared with DMSO and diluted in embryo water to concentrations of 1 and 20 \u03bcM. 30 to 40 embryos were randomly selected for each treatment group and placed into Petri dishes (35\u20131007, BD Falcon). To examine the effect of inhibitor on the earliest stages of documented MFF phenotype through early pectoral fin fold development, PD168393 treatment and control groups were incubated from 24 hpf through 52 hpf. Larvae were gently transferred into fresh embryo water after incubation. Blinded treatment and control groups were and scored at 96 hpf with a Stemi 2000-C (Zeiss) dissecting microscope. Scoring was performed at 96 hpf to verify that inhibitor-induced morphological changes persisted beyond the end of the treatment window itself. Results were graphed with PRISM software (Graphpad); p-value and significance were calculated with Chi-square analysis. For TEM analysis samples, 20 \u03bcM-treated wild-type embryos were randomly selected immediately following incubation and removed into Trump\u2019s fixative, as were age-matched sibling controls. Embryos younger than 48 hpf were sorted by mRFP fluorescence. Larvae 48 hpf or older were sorted by MFF phenotype and fluorescence. Sorted or selected embryos were transferred into glass Petri dishes for all subsequent processing (Corning) and fixed in Trump\u2019s fixative (4% formaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2)) for a minimum of 24 hr. Following fixation, zebrafish were secondarily fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated through an ethanol series and embedded into Embed 812/Araldite resin. After a 24 hr polymerization at 60\u00b0C, ultrathin sections (0.1 \u03bcm) were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

Due to the lack of tissue samples from early-stages of PC, the stage-specific alteration of miRNAs during PC initiation and progression is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the global miRNA expression profile and their processing machinery during PC progression using the KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC) mouse model. At 25 weeks, the miRNA microarray analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-150, miR-494, miR-138, miR-148a, miR-216a, and miR-217 and upregulation of miR-146b, miR-205, miR-31, miR-192, and miR-21 in KC mice compared to controls. Further, expression of miRNA biosynthetic machinery including Dicer, Exportin-5, TRKRA, and TARBP2 were downregulated, while DGCR8 and Ago2 were upregulated in KC mice. In addition, from 10 to 50 weeks of age, stage-specific expression profiling of miRNA in KC mice revealed downregulation of miR-216, miR-217, miR-100, miR-345, miR-141, miR-483-3p, miR-26b, miR-150, miR-195, Let-7b and Let-96 and upregulation of miR-21, miR-205, miR-146b, miR-34c, miR-1273, miR-223 and miR-195 compared to control mice. Interestingly, the differential expression of miRNA in mice also corroborated with the miRNA expression in human PC cell lines and tissue samples; ectopic expression of Let-7b in CD18/HPAF and Capan1 cells resulted in downregulation of KRAS and MSST1 expression. Overall, the present study aids an understanding of miRNA expression patterns during PC pathogenesis and helps to facilitate the identification of promising and novel early diagnostic/prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.\n", "fulltext": "Cancer is a compendium of perturbed genome functions and is characterized by the deregulation of several genes and their regulatory molecules, including microRNAs (miRNAs) [1, 2]. In general, miRNAs are 19\u201324 nucleotides long, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate the expression of 30% of protein-coding genes at the posttranscriptional level [3, 4]. These miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as pre-miRNAs, which are processed by Drosha, to form hairpin-like intermediates called pre-miRNAs, which are approximately 70\u2013100 nucleotides long and have two nucleotide overhangs at their 3\u2032 ends [5\u20138]. Exportin-5 transports pre-miRNAs out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm for further processing by dicer [9, 10], which converts the pre-miRNA into a 19\u201324 nucleotide long, double-stranded, mature miRNA. The guide strand of mature miRNA gets incorporated into a complex to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes the specific target mRNA through complementary base pairing, and consequently, either degrades or inhibits translation of the target mRNA [6, 12]. Recent reports have shown that miRNAs can play an important role in diverse biological functions such as development, normal cell physiology and pathological conditions like abnormal cell proliferation [13\u201315] and cancer [16, 17] including pancreatic cancer (PC). Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the 10th leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States [18\u201321]. PC has a five-year survival rate of less than 6%. This high mortality rate among PC patients is due to the lack of early symptoms, diagnostic and prognostic markers, metastatic disease at the time of clinical diagnosis, poor response to therapy, and a high rate of recurrence. Thus, in order to identify suitable early diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets to combat this disease, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of PC. Several studies have shown the abnormal expression of miRNAs including miR-21, Let-7b, miR-100, miR-217, and miR-216 in PC and have proposed them as candidates for early diagnosis and potential molecular targets [23, 24]. However, due to unavailability of early stage PC biopsies from humans, the stage-specific deregulation of miRNA during PC progression is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression profile of miRNAs at various stages of PC progression using the KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre mouse model. This model is histopathologically recapitulates human PC and enables one to monitor the progression of PC from the onset of precursor lesions to cancer development. Hence, understanding the role of miRNA in PC pathogenesis using this model will subsequently help to develop early detection markers, as well as therapeutic and preventive strategies for PC. Further, this study examined the expression of various components of the miRNA biosynthetic machinery and some of their selected target genes for differentially expressed miRNAs. Findings were extrapolated to human PC tissues and cell lines by investigating the expression of differentially expressed miRNAs as observed in the KrasG12D mouse model. The overall objective of this study was to establish a global differential expression profile of miRNAs during the course of initiation and progression of PC. Moving forward, the identified miRNAs can be used to create novel biomarker(s) for validation studies and therapeutic targets to combat this lethal disease. Our previous study using the KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC/floxed KrasG12D) PC mouse model showed the presence of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions as early as 10 weeks of age; these lesions progressed to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and metastasized to the liver, lungs, and intestines by 50 weeks of age. We observed PanIN-I lesions at 10 weeks of age that progressed to PanIN I, II, III lesions at 25 weeks of age, replacing larger portions of the pancreatic parenchyma. At 40 weeks of age, the majority of the parenchyma was replaced by PanIN III and extensive desmoplasia, whereas at 50 weeks of age, animals replaced the pancreatic parenchyma with full-blown PDAC, and metastatic spread involving the colon, liver, and lungs in 60\u201370% of the animals. In order to identify the deregulated miRNAs during PC progression, we used affymetrix miRNA microarray to analyze the global miRNA expression in the pancreas of 25-week old KC animals (KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre) and its age-matched littermate control mice (LSL KrasG12D). We chose 25-week old mice as the base line because, at this time point, the mice had only developed PanIN I, II, and III lesions but not PDAC. Hence, this age represented the stage prior to the onset of PC. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using QC tool software. The miRNA microarray analysis for the KC animals compared to controls revealed that miR-150, miR-494, miR-138, miR-148a*, miR-216a, and miR-217 (p-value = 0.01) were significantly downregulated (Table 1), whereas, miR-146b, miR-205, miR-31, miR-192, and miR-21 (p-value = 0.01) were significantly upregulated (Table 2). A majority of the miRNAs were downregulated compared to the number of miRNAs that were upregulated in the KC animals (Supplementary table S1). The panel of differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by real-time PCR using TaqMan assays, and the results were consistent with the miRNA microarray data that showed up-regulation of miR-21, miR-221, miR-100 and miR-26a and down-regulation of miR-26b, miR-141, miR-96, miR483-3p, miR-216, and miR-217 in the KC compared to control mice (Figure 1A). The downregulation of the majority of miRNAs led us to investigate the expression status of the miRNA biosynthetic machinery during the progression of PC using the KC mouse model. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that expression of Dicer, Drosha, Exportin-5, TRKRA, and TARBP2 were downregulated, while expression of DGCR8 and Ago2 were upregulated in KC mice compared to control littermates (Figure 1B). The top differentially deregulated miRNAs were further analyzed at 10, 30, 40, and 50 weeks of PC progression. At 10 weeks of age, expression of miR-141 and Let-7b were upregulated, but their expression was not statistically significant. On the other hand, miR-146b, miR-34c, miR-223, miR-195 (p-value = 0.031) and miR-216 (p-value = 0.063) were downregulated in KC mice compared to control littermates. However, no significant difference was observed in the expression of pancreas-specific miR-217 (Figure 2A). At 30 weeks of age, the expression of miR-216 (p-value = 0.016), miR-217 (p-value = 0.0078), miR-150 (p-value =0.023), Let-7b (p-value = 0.031,) and miR-96 were significantly downregulated, whereas the expression of miR-146b (p-value = 0.0078), miR-205, (p-value - 0.0078), miR-21, miR-195 (p-value = 0.031), and miR-34c (p-value = 0.063) were significantly upregulated in KC animals compared to control animals (Figure 2B). At 40 weeks of age, the expression of miR-216, miR-217, miR-223, miR-141, miR-483-3p (p-value = 0.031), miR-195, Let-7b (p-value = 0.063) and miR-96 were significantly downregulated; on the other hand, the expression of miR-21, miR-205, miR-146b (p-value = 0.031), and miR-34c (p-value = 0.063) were upregulated in KC mice compared to the control animals (Figure 2C). Further, at 50 weeks of age, the expression of miR-216, miR-217, miR-345, miR-141, miR-483-3p, miR-26b, miR-96, Let-7b (p-value = 0.01), miR-100, miR-26a and miR-150 (p-value = 0.094) were further downregulated in KC animals compared to control mice (Figure 2D). The expressions of miR-216 and miR-217 were also progressively reduced in KC mice, but the expressions of miR-21, miR-205, miR-146b, miR-34c, and miR-223 progressively increased (Figure 1A, 2A\u20132D). At 50 weeks of age, variation in expression of miR-221 was not statistically significant between the KC and control animals (Figure 2D). The overall trends of miRNA expression during the mouse PC progression model are shown in Figures 2E and 2F. In order to confirm the expression of genes targeted by the differentially expressed miRNAs in PC, first we performed in silico analysis using an online bioinformatics program, mirecords/miRDB, which utilizes miRanda, Target scan, Pic Tar, etc., to predict several potential targets genes (Table 1 and Table 2). A few of these target genes, that are important in PC development, were analyzed by Real time PCR at 50 weeks of age. The expression of Kras (5-fold), Galectin-3 (5-fold), EGFR (3.5-fold), TGF\u03b21 (3.5-fold), cMyc (2.8-fold), Fut8 (2.5-fold), and Bcl2 (2-fold) were significantly upregulated, while the expression of PTEN was significantly downregulated in KC animals compared to controls (Figure 2G). In order to extrapolate the mouse miRNA microarray data to human PC, we next checked the expressions of a few differentially expressed miRNAs in eight human PC cell lines, as well as in the immortalized normal pancreatic ductal cell line (HPDE). Results showed the downregulation of miR-345, miR-96, and Let-7b in the majority of the PC cell lines compared to the HPDE cells (Figure 3A), indicating that these miRNAs were expressed in ductal cells rather than in tumor stroma. Also, the expression analysis of miRNA biosynthetic machinery in PC cell lines showed significant downregulation of Drosha, Dicer, and Exportin-5 compared to the HPDE cell line (Figure 3B). The differentially expressed miRNAs that were identified from mouse miRNA array data were further analyzed in eight samples of human PC tissues (Figure 3C) and their corresponding eight adjacent normal tissue (Figure 3D). The expression of miR-223, miR-483-3p (p-value = 0.01), 146b, 205 (p-value = 0.001), 221, 21 (p-value = 0.023), 195, 34c and miR-26a (p-value = 0.0078) were significantly upregulated, whereas the expression of miR-216, miR-141, miR-217, Let-7b (p-value = 0.001), and Let-150 (p-value = 0.01) were significantly downregulated in human PC tissues as compared to the cancer-adjacent normal tissues (Figure 3E). Additionally, the expression of proteins involved in miRNA biosynthesis, such as Drosha, Dicer, and Exportin-5, were analyzed and found to be significantly downregulated in human PC tissues as compared to the cancer-adjacent normal tissues (Figure 3F). The role of Let-7 family members and their target genes are well known in various cancer. Previous studies have shown that restoration of Let-7 results in downregulation of oncogenic Kras, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase. Similarly, HMGA2 is a direct target of Let-7 family members [29\u201331]. Our results in the KC mouse model also showed downregulation of Let-7b during PC progression. Further, our in silico analysis of Let-7b revealed several target genes like MUC4, NCOA3, KRAS, HMGA2, which are critical in PC pathogenesis. Herein, we overexpressed Let-7b and its scramble vectors in two PC cell lines, CD18/HPAF and Capan1, by infection with a lenti-viral supernatant (collected after 48 and 72 hours post transfection of 293FT cells) after mixing with 4 \u03bcg/ml of polybrene and analyzing its effect on downstream targets. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells were sorted by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) (Figure 4A); Let-7b overexpression was confirmed by TaqMan assays using real-time PCR (Figure 4B). We observed eight-fold and four-fold increase in the expression of Let-7b in Capan 1 and CD18/HPAF cells, respectively, compared to vector control cells (Figure 4B). Our results from western blot analysis revealed downregulation of MUC4, KRAS, MSST1, and Cyclin D1, and upregulation of caspase-9 in Let-7b overexpressing CD18/HPAF and Capan1 PC cells compared to vector transfected control cells (Figure 4C); \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. These findings suggest that downregulation of Let-7b plays an important role in PC progression. Due to unavailability of early stage samples from human PC patients, we utilized the well-characterized spontaneous mouse model (KC) of PC [32\u201336] to analyze the global miRNA expression profile. Notably, this model histopathologically recapitulates human PC. Using this PC model, we and others have observed PanIN lesions at as early as 10 weeks of age, as well as PDAC with metastasis (in 60\u201370% of KC animals) to distant organs by 50 weeks of age [26, 35]. Although high-grade PanINs (PanIN III) were rarely observed before 20 weeks of age, their frequency increased progressively with age (25\u201350 weeks); however, low- and high-grade PanINs were observed starting at 25 weeks of age. Therefore, the present study analyzed the global miRNA expression profile at 25 weeks of age, when the majority of acinar cells were replaced by high-grade PanINs and marked desmoplasia. Using miRNA microarray analysis, we identified several differentially expressed miRNAs in KC animals compared to control mice, with most of the miRNAs having tumor suppressive functions (Tables 1 and 2). The microRNA microarray revealed significant downregulation of miR-494 at 25 weeks of PC progression in the KC mouse model. A recent study has also shown significant downregulation of miR-494 in human PC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, correlating with PC metastasis and decrease free survival in patients. Furthermore, decreased expression of miR-494 is due to loss of SMAD4 in PC. Ectopic expression of miR-494 in PDAC cells resulted in downregulation of FOXM1, inhibition of \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation, decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and greater sensitivity to gemcitabine. The expression of pancreas-specific tumor suppressors miR-217 and miR-216 were unaltered at 10 weeks of age (presence of PanIN-Ia and Ib), but progressively decreased from 25 \u2013 50 weeks of age as PanIN lesions progressed to PDAC. (Figure 1A, 2A\u20132D). In addition to KC mice, we also observed a significant downregulation of miR-216 and miR-217 in human PC tissue (Figure 3E); these results are in agreement with earlier studies on human PC [38\u201343] that show downregulation of miR-217 in 76.2% (16/21) of PC tissue as well as cell lines. Similarly, the expression of miR-216 is significantly downregulated in PC. Our in silico analysis revealed that miR-216 and miR-217 potentially target many important genes that play critical roles during the pathogenesis of PC (Table 1); and the downregulation of miR-217 and miR-216 suggests their potential as tumor suppressors in PC by targeting downstream targets, particularly the Kras oncogene and Janus kinase 2. In addition to pancreas-specific miRNAs, we observed significant downregulation of miR-141 and Let-7b in human PDAC and in KC mice from 25\u201350 weeks of age compared to controls (Figure 1A, 2B\u20132D, 3E). Our human PDAC results were in agreement with earlier reports showing loss of Let-7b and miR-141 expression in PC samples compared to cancer-adjacent normal tissue [46, 47]. In vitro analysis of Let-7b overexpressed HPAF/CD18, and Capan1 PC cell lines showed significant downregulation of MUC4, Kras, MSST1, and Cyclin D1, and upregulation of cleaved caspase-9 (Figure 4C). Although the functional analysis of this Let-7b overexpression remains to be determined using our in vitro system, however previous studies have shown that overexpression of Let-7b in Capan1 cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation by downregulating Kras, Myc, and HMGA2, and activating mitogen-activated protein kinase [28\u201331, 46, 47]. In addition to affecting proliferation, the increased expression of cleaved caspase-9 in both HPAF/CD18 and Capan1 cells suggests it has a pro-apoptotic role that remains to be determined. Further, Kent et al. (2009) reported downregulation of miRNA-200 family members, including miRNA-141, in PC cell lines and observed a positive correlation between the expression of miR-200 family members and E-cadherin expression, as well as a negative correlation with the zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) [48, 49]. The transcription of miR-200 family members (miR-141 and miR-200c) is suppressed by ZEB1, which activates epithelial differentiation in PC, colorectal, and breast cancer cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) activators, such as transforming growth factor beta 2 and ZEB1, have 3\u2032 UTR binding sites for miR-200 family members. Therefore, existence of a feedback loop between ZEB1 and miR-141 serves to stabilize the EMT process and regulate the invasion of cancer cells. The present study also revealed significant downregulation of miR-150 during the progression of PC in both mice and humans (Figure 2A\u20132D, 3E). These results contradict a previous study on human PC, possibly attributable to species and/or PC stage variation. Similarly, the expression of miR-345 and miR-96 were significantly downregulated during the progression of PC in the mouse model (Figure 2D), which is consistent with previous reports [39, 40, 50]. However, a recent report in colorectal cancer patient tissues has shown significantly methylated mir-345 promoter region compared to the non-cancerous, adenoma, and normal colon tissues; further, ectopic over-expression of mir-345 in colorectal cancer cells significantly reduced cell proliferation by inhibiting the translation of anti-apoptotic BAG3 gene. These studies suggest a pro-apoptotic function of miR-345; its downregulation during PC progression may be associated with promoter methylation. The miR-26a miRNA inhibits the expression of c-myc, Cyclin D3 and E2, and cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK4 and CDK6. Also, it stimulates CDK-inhibitors p14(ARF) and p21(CIP1) expression in an EZH2-dependent manner, suggesting an anti-proliferative role. Accordingly, we observed significant downregulation of miR-26a in KC mice at 50 weeks of age, although it was upregulated at 25 weeks in KC mice and in human PC tissues compared to normal tissues (Figure 2B, 2D and 3E). Recently, significant downregulation of miR-26a was also reported in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and cell lines (53); its ectopic expression has been shown to downregulate EZH2 expression, thereby inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest to decrease cell proliferation and colony formation (53). A decreased expression of miR-483-3p was observed during the progression of mouse PC, whereas it is overexpressed in human PC (Figure 2A\u20132D and 3E). These results are in agreement with previous reports that show miR-483-3p upregulation in PC tissue compared to the cancer adjacent normal tissue [53, 54]. Furthermore, they showed that ectopic expression of miR-483-3p significantly inhibited the expression of DPC4/Smad4 protein in PC cell lines, leading to increased cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro [53, 54]. The miRNA microarray also revealed decreased expression of miR-148a and miR-451 in mouse PC, an observation consistent with other reports [40, 41, 55\u201358]. Similarly, another study showed that the expression of miR-148a/b and miR-375 were significantly downregulated in the PC developed from p48Cre;KrasG12D transgenic animals compared to the normal controls. Several studies have demonstrated the upregulation and importance of miR-21 in PC patients. Although the expression of miR-21 expression does not correlate with tumor size, differentiation, nodal status, or T stage, its overexpression was associated with poor patient outcomes and overall survival compared to patients without miR-21 or patients with faint/focal expression in node-negative disease [60, 61]. Overexpression of miR-21 is associated with both high Ki67 proliferation index and liver metastasis, whereas inhibition of miR-21 expression in MiaPaCa-2 PC cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation, increased cell death, and increased expression of the tumor suppressor gene like programmed cell death 4 (PCD4) gene. In addition, miR-21 has been shown to suppress the activity of the tumor suppressor gene tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), thereby promoting tumorigenesis. In line with these reports, our study also indicates the progressive increase in miR-21 and miR-205 from 10 to 50 weeks of age in KC mice compared to the control animals (Figure 1A and 2A\u20132D). Similarly, we also observed upregulation of miR-21 and miR-205 in human PC samples compared to cancer- adjacent normal tissue (Figure 3E). Several reports have also shown elevated expression of miR-21 and miR-205 in a panel of PC cell lines and tissues compared to the normal controls [40\u201342, 50, 55, 60, 65\u201368]. Rieu et al. also reported in the KC animals, progressive increases in miR-21 and miR-205 expression from PanIN lesions to full-blown PDAC, with strongest expression of miR-21 in precursor lesions with phenotypic changes in the ducts. Further, Rieu et al. have shown that expression of miR-21, miR-221, miR-222, and Let-7a increases with PanIN grade, with the strongest expression in the hyperplastic ducts with PanIN 2/3 lesions. Similarly, the expression of miR-10, miR-21, miR-100 and miR-155 was shown to increase in p48-Cre/KrasG12D mice when compared to control animals. We observed downregulation of miR-146b, miR-34c, and miR-223 at 10 weeks of age; however, their expression increased with the progression of PC in KC animals compared to control animals (Figure 2A\u20132D). We also observed upregulation of these miRNAs in the human PC samples (Figure 3E). Notably, the expression of miR-34c is activated by p53 following DNA damage and serves as an important regulator of c-Myc expression, acting downstream to the p38 MAPK/MK2 pathway. Deregulation of the miRNA biosynthetic machinery results in differential expression of miRNAs and downstream target genes. Abnormal expression of this machinery is associated with hematological malignancies, ovarian cancer, and neuroblastoma. In conjunction with these reports, our results also revealed significant downregulation of many miRNA biosynthetic pathway components, such as dicer, TARBP2, and exportin-5, both during the progression of PC in KC animals (Figure 1B) and in PC cell lines and tissues compared to normal tissues (Figure 3B and 3F). The predicted target genes for differentially expressed miRNAs (Table 1 and Table 2) such as Kras (5-fold), Galectin-3 (5-fold), EGFR (3.5-fold), TGF\u03b21 (3.5-fold), cMyc (2.8-fold), Fut8 (2.5-fold), and Bcl2 (2-fold) were upregulated. On the other hand, PTEN was observed to be downregulated in KC mice, which highlights the importance of deregulated miRNA expression in the pathology of PC (Figure 2G). Both miR-216 and miR-217 act as potential tumor suppressors for PC by targeting the Kras oncogene. In conclusion, the present study reveals the stage-specific (PanIN to PC) unique expression patterns for miRNAs, as well as miRNA biosynthetic machinery, during progression of PC. We have shown that in tumor samples compared to normal samples, the majority of miRNAs (miR-216, miR-217, miR-100, miR-345, miR-141, miR-483-3p, miR-26b, miR-150, Let-7b, Let-195 and miR-96) were downregulated, and few were upregulated (miR-146b, miR-205, miR-31, miR-192, miR-194 21, miR-379, miR-431, miR-541, and miR-199b). Future studies will focus on the analysis of stage-specific miRNA expression in the sera of mice collected during PC progression, as this is expected to provide the unique opportunity to develop early detection biomarkers for PC. Furthermore, restoring the expression of downregulated miRNAs in cancer cells may be performed to promote their de-differentiation and induce their reversion into a benign or normal cell. Overall, the current study offers the unique opportunity to develop early biomarkers for the diagnostic, prognostic and preventive management of PC. The B6.129-Krastm4Tyj (01XJ6) and B6. FVB-Tg (Ipf1-cre) 1Tuv (01XL5) mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium (MMHCC, Frederick, MD, USA). In order to decipher miRNAs in early PC lesions, we obtained the PC progression model by crossing LSL-KrasG12D animals with Pdx-1-Cre. The animals positive for both Kras and Pdx Cre (Floxed KrasG12D) and their contemporary littermates unfloxed Kras (LSL KrasG12D) from the F1 litter were sacrificed at 10, 25, 30, 40, and 50 weeks of age (eight animals for each group at each time point). The pancreas was resected, and half of the pancreas was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen (total RNA and miRNA isolation); the other half was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Serial tissue sections were cut (4 \u03bcM) and stained with hematoxalin and eosin. Throughout the study, the animals were subjected to a 12 hours of dark/light cycle with food and water ad libitum. Animal studies were performed in accordance with the United States Public Health Service \u201cGuidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\u201d under an approved protocol by the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Total RNA and miRNA were isolated from the pancreas of floxed KrasG12D mice positive for Kras;Pdx-1-Cre and unfloxed LSLKrasG12D mice, human PC cell lines, tissues and their cancer-adjacent normal tissues (eight tissues each) using mirVana\u2122 miRNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The RNA concentration was measured by Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), and the quality was analyzed using bioanalyzer (Agilent technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Samples with good integrity were used for miRNA array, real-time PCR, and TaqMan assays. GeneChip\u00ae miRNA Array (Cat. No: 901325) was used to study the global expression profile of miRNAs at 25-week of KrasG12D;Pdx-1-Cre mice and LSLKrasG12D mice. Two micrograms of total RNA from two floxed KrasG12D (KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre) and two unfloxed LSL-KrasG12D (LSL KrasG12D) animals were labeled with the FlashTag Biotin RNA Labeling Kit for Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae miRNA arrays (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA, USA) and hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae miRNA arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Hybridization, washing, and scanning of the slides were done according to Affymetrix's recommendations (Fluidics Protocol FS450_0003). Data was extracted from the images, quintile normalized, summarized (median polish) and log2-transformed with the miRNA QC tool software from Affymetrix. The TaqMan miRNA assay kits purchased from Applied Biosystems were used for expression and validation analysis of miRNAs during the progression of PC in both mice as well as human tumor samples. In order to analyze the expression patterns, first, reverse transcription reactions for each miRNA was performed using 1.5 \u03bcl of 10X reverse transcription buffer, 1.0 \u03bcl of MultiScribe\u2122reverse transcriptase (50 U/\u03bcl), 0.15 \u03bcl of 100 mM dNTPs (with dTTP), 0.19 \u03bcl of RNase inhibitor (20 U/\u03bcl) and 4.16 \u03bcl of nuclease-free water. Subsequently, 500 ng of miRNA and 3\u03bcl of 1X looped-primers were added (specific for each microRNA), mixed well and incubated for 30 min at 16\u00b0C followed by 30 min at 42\u00b0C and 5 minutes at 85\u00b0C. The resultant cDNA was diluted to a minimum of 1:15 with nuclease free water and 1.33 \u03bcl was used in real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed on Light cycler 480 II PCR System (PCR System, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). During the target amplification step, the AmpliTaq\u00ae Gold DNA polymerase amplifies target cDNA synthesized from the RNA samples using sequence-specific primers from the TaqMan Assay. Real-time PCR reactions based on TaqMan\u00ae reagent chemistry were performed in triplicate, and template controls were run for each assay under the same conditions. End-point PCR was performed in 20 \u03bcl reaction that contained 10 \u03bcl TaqMan 2X Universal PCR Master Mix No AmpErase UNG, 7.67 \u03bcl of nuclease free water, 1.33 \u03bcl diluted RT product (Minimum1:15) and 1 \u03bcl miRNA-specific PCR probe. The cycling conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds followed by 60\u00b0C for 60 seconds. The miRNA expression levels were normalized to the level of RNU6B for human samples and U6 snRNA for mouse samples to correct for differential cDNA content. Total RNA was isolated, and the cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription as previously described. Briefly, reverse transcription of RNA was performed by adding 10 \u03bcl of (2 \u03bcg) total RNA, 1 \u03bcl of Oligo (dT)12\u201318 (500 \u03bcg/ml), and 1 \u03bcl of 10 mM dNTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), incubating at 65\u00b0C for 5 minutes and immediately chilling on ice. Then, the master mix containing 4 \u03bcl of (5X) first strand RT buffer, 1 \u03bcl of 0.1 M DTT, and 1 \u03bcl of RNaseOUT (RNase Inhibitor) was incubated at 42\u00b0C for 2 min. Finally, 1 \u03bcl (50 units) of SuperScript II RT was added to each tube and incubated at 42\u00b0C for 50 minutes followed by 70\u00b0C for 15 minutes in order to destroy the superscript II RT. The real-time primers for all the genes (human and mouse) were designed using Primer 3 software (Supplementary table S2). Real-time PCR was performed on Light cycler 480 II PCR System, (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Real-time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate; non-template controls (NTCs) and a standard curve was run for each assay under similar conditions. Real-time PCR was performed in a 10 \u03bcl reaction containing 5 \u03bcl 2X SBYR green Master mix, 3.6 \u03bcl of nuclease free water, 1 \u03bcl diluted RT product (1:10), and 0.2 \u03bcl each of forward and reverse primer (5 pmol/\u03bcl). The cycling conditions used were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 1 minute. Gene expression levels were normalized to the level of \u03b2-actin expression and were reported relative to the expression level in RNA from corresponding normal controls. The 293FT cells were transfected with (2 \u03bcg) either with Let-7b over-expressing lentiviral pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP-Let-7b vector or with vector control and along with 10 \u03bcg of pPACKH1 Packaging Plasmid Mix (System Bioscience, CA, USA) using lipofectamine-2000 plus reagents (Invitrogen). The viral supernatant, collected after 48 and 72 hours post-transfection, was filtered and used to infect human PC cells (CD18/HPAF and Capan1) after mixing with 4 \u03bcg/ml of polybrene. The GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS, and Let-7b overexpression was analyzed by TaqMan assay. Protein lysates were prepared from Let-7b-overexpressing and vector-transfected GFP positive cells, followed by Western blot analysis. Briefly, the cells from 70% confluency cultures were washed twice with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0.25% Na-deoxycholate; 1 mM EDTA ;150 mM NaCl; 1% NP-40), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, 5 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM NaF, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. Protein lysates were quantified and resolved using 10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels (2% agarose gel for MUC4) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for at least 1 hour and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-Kras, anti-MSST1, anti-MUC4, anti-caspase 9 anti-cyclin D1 and anti-\u03b2-actin) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then, the membrane was washed (4X 10 min) with phosphate buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and probed with 1:5000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing the blots, the signal was detected with an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Bioscience, UK). The fold change in the miRNA expression was calculated by \u0394\u0394Ct method as a 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct. U6 and RNU6B were used for normalization in mouse and human samples, respectively. A change of two-fold or more (on a log scale of \u2265 0.3) was considered statistically significant. The miRNA ratios of experimental samples to controls were compared to one using the one-sample non-parametric Wilcoxon sign rank test. The p-value was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for data analysis."}, "26731607": {"pmid": "26731607", "pmcid": "PMC4832267", "title": "DNA\u2010damage response gene GADD45A induces differentiation in hematopoietic stem cells without inhibiting cell cycle or survival", "abstract": "\nAbstract\n\nHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain blood cell production life\u2010long by their unique abilities of self\u2010renewal and differentiation into all blood cell lineages. Growth arrest and DNA\u2010damage\u2010inducible 45 alpha (GADD45A) is induced by genotoxic stress in HSCs. GADD45A has been implicated in cell cycle control, cell death and senescence, as well as in DNA\u2010damage repair. In general, GADD45A provides cellular stability by either arresting the cell cycle progression until DNA damage is repaired or, in cases of fatal damage, by inducing apoptosis. However, the function of GADD45A in hematopoiesis remains controversial. We revealed the changes in murine HSC fate control orchestrated by the expression of GADD45A at single cell resolution. In contrast to other cellular systems, GADD45A expression did not cause a cell cycle arrest or an alteration in the decision between cell survival and apoptosis in HSCs. Strikingly, GADD45A strongly induced and accelerated the differentiation program in HSCs. Continuous tracking of individual HSCs and their progeny via time\u2010lapse microscopy elucidated that once GADD45A was expressed, HSCs differentiate into committed progenitors within 29 hours. GADD45A\u2010expressing HSCs failed to long\u2010term reconstitute the blood of recipients by inducing multilineage differentiation in vivo. Importantly, \u03b3\u2010irradiation of HSCs induced their differentiation by upregulating endogenous GADD45A. The differentiation induction by GADD45A was transmitted by activating p38 Mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and allowed the generation of megakaryocytic\u2010erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid lineages. These data indicate that genotoxic stress\u2010induced GADD45A expression in HSCs prevents their fatal transformation by directing them into differentiation and thereby clearing them from the system. Stem Cells\n2016;34:699\u2013710\n\n", "fulltext": "Significance StatementSince there have been a lot of controversies about the function of the DNA\u2010damage induced tumor suppressor gene Growth arrest and DNA\u2010damage\u2010inducible 45 alpha (GADD45A) in hematopoiesis, we revisited the role of GADD45A in hematopoietic stem cell fate choice control at single cell resolution. We show here that neither cell cycle arrest nor cell death was induced by GADD45A in HSCs, but a strong differentiation program via the initiation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Forcing terminal differentiation of damaged hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) might be a prominent function of GADD45A in the hematopoietic system, besides providing DNA repair and genomic stability. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) serve for the life\u2010long production of all blood cell lineages 1, 2. Their unique ability of renewing themselves maintains the HSC pool. Since HSCs are long\u2010lived they might be susceptible for acquiring genomic alterations leading to blood disorders. The genomic integrity of HSCs is instrumental to avoid detrimental mutations that may cause clonal dominance and leukemia initiation 3, 4. GADD45A belongs to the growth arrest and DNA damage\u2010inducible 45 family consisting of three genes Gadd45a, Gadd45b, and Gadd45g 5, 6, 7. Various cell fate decisions and functions are regulated by individual GADD45 family members including cell cycle progression and arrest, survival and death, DNA repair and epigenetic modifications 8. Because of their pleiotropic action, GADD45 proteins regulate basic cell biological mechanisms with wide implications in development, regeneration, aging, and disease 8, 9. We previously elucidated the function of the family member GADD45 Gamma as a hematopoietic cytokine\u2010induced mediator of differentiation and lineage choice control in HSCs 10. Different stimuli activate the expression of individual GADD45 family members which execute distinct and redundant functions in a cell type and context\u2010dependent manner 8, therefore, their individual functional contribution needs further attention. The importance of GADD45A in DNA excision repair through the interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 11, 12 becomes apparent in mice lacking Gadd45a (Gadd45a \u2212/\u2212) that show increased genome instability, reduced nucleotide excision repair, a higher rate of mutations, and consequently, a higher incidence of carcinogenesis 13. The absence of GADD45A in long\u2010term repopulating HSCs (LT\u2010HSCs) resulted in a delayed DNA repair and increased leukemogenesis in aged animals 14. GADD45A expression is initiated by ultra violet irradiation (UV), X\u2010rays, \u03b3\u2010irradiation, multiple DNA toxins, among other cellular stressors 8. These environmental stressors and DNA damaging agents endanger the integrity of the HSC genome. GADD45A is specifically involved in DNA repair, and thus, delays the cell cycle when DNA damage is detected. Thereby Gadd45a is a tumor suppressor under the transcriptional control of p53 and the homologs p63 and p73 15. However, p53\u2010dependent and \u2010independent pathways are involved that regulate Gadd45a induction by genotoxic stress; the later may use BRCA1\u2010related or MAPK\u2010mediated signals 16, 17. The role of GADD45A in inducing a cell cycle arrest as a direct consequence of DNA damage is well\u2010established. GADD45A expression arrests the cell cycle progression at G2/M phase in normal and cancer cells by the interaction with the protein kinase cell division cycle 2, cyclin B1, and p53\u2010inducing proteins such as PCNA and p21 18, 19, 20. Also cellular senescence in human fibroblasts is associated with a p53\u2010dependent induction of GADD45A 21. Along the same line, mouse embryonal fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and bone marrow (BM) myeloid cells from Gadd45a \u2212/\u2212 mice showed an increased proliferation with an accelerated mitotic index upon methylmethane sulfonate or UV\u2010induced stress 13. GADD45A plays a dual function in cell survival and death control in a cell type\u2010specific manner. Ectopic expression of GADD45A in leukemia cells and solid cancer cells triggers apoptosis via the Transforming growth factor, beta (TGFb)/MAP3K4/p38/c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinase (JNK) pathway 20, 22. Conversely, GADD45A acts antiapoptotic and increases hematopoietic cell survival under UV\u2010irradiation or treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs 23. While thymocytes from Gadd45a \u2212/\u2212 mice had no change in gamma irradiation (\u03b3\u2010IR)\u2010 or UV\u2010induced apoptosis 13, GADD45A\u2010deficient BM hematopoietic cells were more sensitive to UV\u2010radiation and chemotherapy\u2010induced apoptosis compared to wild\u2010type cells 23, 24, 25. GADD45A induces the Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B\u2010cells (NF\u03baB)\u2010mediated prosurvival pathway via p38 in myeloid cells 24. In contrast, HSCs from Gadd45a \u2212/\u2212 mice were more resistant to \u03b3\u2010IR than their wild\u2010type counterparts, suggesting a specific proapoptotic function of GADD45A in HSCs but not in myeloid\u2010committed progenitors 14. These controversies on the functional consequences of GADD45A expression motivated us to elucidate the changes in cell fate decision and function of long\u2010term repopulating HSCs (LT\u2010HSCs) after GADD45A expression at single cell resolution. GADD45A is higher expressed in LT\u2010HSCs than in more differentiated progenitor populations in steady\u2010state hematopoiesis 14, albeit at low levels in general, and is strongly induced by genotoxic noxins. We hypothesized that the induction of GADD45A in LT\u2010HSCs would cause alterations in cell survival and a delay in cell cycle progression in murine LT\u2010HSCs. Surprisingly, ectopic GADD45A expression did not change cell expansion, cell cycle progression or survival in murine LT\u2010HSCs, neither in vitro nor in vivo. GADD45A expression caused an immediate and accelerated differentiation of LT\u2010HSCs allowing all cell lineages to emerge. The differentiation induction is mediated by the activation of the MAP3K4\u2010p38 axis via GADD45A, and may provide a mechanism to circumvent the long\u2010term existence of damaged HSCs to avoid fatal transformation and leukemogenesis. C57BL/6J and B6.SJL\u2010Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ were used at 10\u201314 weeks of age. The mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen\u2010free conditions. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the German animal welfare legislation and were approved by the relevant authorities (Regierungspr\u00e4sidium Darmstadt). One hundred LT\u2010HSCs per well (96\u2010well format) were lentivirally transduced (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 100) and cultured in serum\u2010free expansion medium (SFEM) (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada, http://www.stemcell.com) supplemented with 100\u2009ng/ml SCF and Thrombopoietin (TPO) (both PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, http://www.peprotech.com). Cells were analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) (antibodies against CD48, CD117, CD16/32, CD11b). For Tetracycline (TET)\u2010inducible GADD45A expression studies, 300 LT\u2010HSCs were seeded per well in SFEM supplemented with stem cell factor (SCF), TPO, and Doxycycline at the indicated concentrations. The cells were lentivirally transduced and analyzed after 8 days of culture as described above. For analyzing the LT\u2010HSC fate upon DNA\u2010damage inducing conditions, 1,000 LT\u2010HSCs per well (96\u2010well format) were seeded in SFEM supplemented with SCF and TPO. After 24 hours, the cells were stimulated with \u03b3\u2010IR (2 Gy) and were analyzed for their marker expression after 5 days of culture as described above. For inhibitor studies 20\u2009ng/ml Interleukin 3 (IL3) (PeproTech) was additionally supplemented. Inhibitors were used as follows: VX\u2010702 (1\u2009\u03bcM), LY2228820 (0.1\u2009\u03bcM, all from Selleck, http://www.selleckchem.com). FACS antibodies are listed in Supporting Information Table S1. BM cells from femurs, tibias, coxae, and sternum were either crushed or flushed (without sternum) followed by a lineage depletion of lineage positive cells (EasySepTM Biotin Selection Kit, Stem Cell Technologies) using biotin\u2010labeled antibodies (CD3, CD45R, CD19, CD11b, CD41, Ter119, Gr1). Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) populations were sorted with a FACS Aria I or III (BD, http://www.bd.com) or analyzed using a LSR Fortessa (BD). Following surface marker combinations were used to identify and sort the different populations: CD117, Sca1, CD150, CD34, CD16/32, Streptavidin, and CD48 (Supporting Information Table S1 and Fig. S1A). Viable sorted cells were counted with trypan blue exclusion. 20,000 KSL (CD117+ Sca1+ Lin\u2212 cells) were lentivirally transduced with either control or GADD45A (MOI 100) and cultured in SFEM supplemented with SCF, TPO (both 100\u2009ng/ml), IL3, and IL6 (both 20\u2009ng/ml) for 9 days. An aliquot of the cells was used to determine the transduction efficiency via flow cytometry. Cells were lysed for 30 minutes on ice in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH\u20097, 4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 2\u2009mM EDTA, 1% Triton X\u2010100, protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland, http://www.roche-applied-science.com)), and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. 30\u2009\u00b5g of protein was applied to SDS\u2010PAGE and transferred to a Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using the Trans\u2010Blot Turbo\u2010Transfer System (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA, http://www.bio-rad.com). The bound primary antibodies (GADD45A (D17E8) rabbit mAb and HSP90 rabbit mAb; both Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, http://www.cellsignal.com) were detected by the use of horseradish peroxidase\u2010conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL Prime detection system (GE Health). The band density was semiquantified using ImageJ software. Freshly FACS\u2010sorted KSL were subjected to \u03b3\u2010IR (2 Gy), UV (1200 J/m2), or Cisplatin (10\u2009\u00b5g/ml) in SFEM supplemented with 100\u2009ng/ml SCF. Cells were harvested 4 hours post\u2010IR and UV or after 5 hours Cisplatin stimulation. The RNA was isolated and analyzed using TaqMan Gene Expression Cells\u2010to\u2010CT Kit (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, http://www.lifetech.com). Cells were lysed and RNA was transcribed into cDNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was preamplified for 14 cycles using the TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The TaqMan Gene expression MasterMix (Life Technologies) was used for the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) performed on a StepOne instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, http://www.appliedbiosystems.com). The expression of GADD45A (Mm00432802_m1) was normalized to Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) (Mm00446968_m1) using the \u0394CT method. 3,000 LT\u2010HSCs per well (96\u2010well format) were lentivirally transduced with control or GADD45A (MOI 100) and cultured in SFEM supplemented with 100\u2009ng/ml SCF and TPO (all PeproTech). After 3 days VENUS+, CD48\u2212 cells were directly sorted into the lysis buffer of the TaqMan Gene Expression Cells\u2010to\u2010CT Kit (Life Technologies). The whole lysate was used for the RT\u2010reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was preamplified for 14 cycles using the TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression of GADD45B (Mm00435123_m1) and GADD45G (Mm00442225_m1) was normalized to B2m (Mm00437762_m1) using the \u0394CT method. 100 LT\u2010HSCs per plate and 300 MEPs (megakaryocyte\u2010erythroid progenitor cell) per plate were lentivirally transduced (MOI 100), seeded 24 hours later in M3434 medium (Stem Cell Technologies), and scored microscopically after 9\u201312 (LT\u2010HSCs) and 6\u20138 days (MEPs) days, respectively, for transduction and colony formation (CellObserver, Zeiss, http://www.zeiss.com). FACS sorted LT\u2010HSCs were seeded in 24\u2010well plates (SFEM medium, 100\u2009ng/ml SCF and TPO) equipped with silicon culture inserts (IBIDI, Martinsried, Germany http://www.ibidi.com) and immediately transduced with lentiviral particles (MOI 100). Allophycocyanin (APC)\u2010conjugated anti\u2010CD16/32 was added to the medium at 50\u2009ng/ml. After preincubation at 5% CO2/37\u2009\u00b0C for 19 hours plates were gas\u2010tight sealed with adhesive tape. Microscopy was performed using a CellObserver (Zeiss) at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Phase contrast images were acquired every 2\u20133 minutes using a\u2009\u00d7\u200910 phase contrast objective (Zeiss), and an AxioCamHRm camera (at 13 1,388\u2009\u00d7\u20091,040 pixel resolution) with a self\u2010written VBA module remote controlling Zeiss AxioVision 4.8 software. Fluorescence was detected every 2 hours with HXP illumination (Osram) and the filter sets for YFP (F46\u2010003) and APC (HC628/40, ET66LP XR, ET700/75, AHF Analysetechnik). Cell tracking was performed using a self\u2010written computer program (TTT) as described 10, 26, 27, until the fate of all progeny in the third cell generation was determined. The generation time of an individual cell was defined as the time span from cytokinesis of its mother cell division to its own division. The first entry into mitosis of the purified LT\u2010HSCs was defined as time of first division. Dead cells are easily depicted by their shrunk, nonrefracting appearance with immobility. All cell tracking was done by scientists; the current analysis does not rely on data generated by an unsupervised computer algorithm for automated tracking. 350 FACS\u2010sorted LT\u2010HSCs from C57.BL/6J mice (CD45.2), which were lentivirally transduced (MOI 100) 24 hours prior transplantation were tail vein injected into lethally irradiated B6.SJL\u2010Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (CD45.1) recipients together with 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 BM competitor recipient cells from B6.SJL\u2010Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ. Transduction efficiency of the transplanted LT\u2010HSCs was determined with a remaining cell aliquot after three additional days in culture by FACS. Multilineage reconstitution was determined every 2\u201318 weeks post\u2010transplantation in peripheral blood (PB). Shortly, red blood cells were lysed with PharmLysis Buffer (BD), and cells were stained with antibodies against CD45.1, CD45.2, CD3, B220, Ter119, CD11b/Gr1, and a dead/live cell exclusion (Fixable Viability Dye, eBioscience). Lentivirally transduced hematopoietic cells were analyzed for VENUS expression by FACS (FACS Canto II or LSR Fortessa). A total of 100,000 KSL cells from B6.SJL\u2010Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (CD45.1) were lentivirally transduced (MOI 100) and after 24 hours equally distributed and intravenously transplanted into seven lethally irradiated C57.BL/6J (CD45.2) recipient mice per group together with 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 BM mononuclear recipient bystander cells (CD45.2). Mice were sacrificed 21 days after injection and analyzed for donor reconstitution in BM and spleen. For cell proliferation analyses 1.5\u2009mg Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (BD) were injected intraperitoneally 4 hours before sacrificing the mice. Dead cells were determined by fixable Viability Dye staining (eBioscience). BrdU incorporation and DNA content 7\u2010Amino Actinomycin D (7AAD) in living cells were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD) with an APC\u2010labeled anti\u2010BrdU antibody (BD) by FACS (Fortessa, BD). The open reading frame (ORF) of the fluorescent reporter protein VENUS\u2010hImportin subunit \u03b11 (AA2\u201067) was cloned into the third generation self\u2010inactivating lentiviral vector pRRL.PPT.SFFV.IRES.eGFP.wPRE by replacing the ORF of green fluorescent protein 28. A multiple cloning site (MCS) was inserted after the SFFV promoter. The ORF of murine Gadd45a was amplified by RT\u2010PCR (forward 5\u2032\u2010TTGGCCGGCCGAGGGACTCGCACTTGCAATATG\u20103\u2032, reverse 5\u2032\u2010TTACTAGTGAACTCGGCCCCTTGACAT\u20103\u2032) from murine cDNA and cloned into the MCS. The ORF of GFP in the TET\u2010responsive vector pRRL.PPT.TetT11\u2010GFP\u2010PGK\u2010M2\u2010pre 29 was replaced by the cassette containing Gadd45a\u2010IRES\u2010VENUS\u2010hImportin subunit \u03b11 (AA2\u201067) of the above described plasmid pRRL.PPT.SFFV.Gadd45a\u2010IRES\u2010VENUS\u2010hImportin.wPRE via BsrGI and SalI. Vesicular Stomatitis Virus\u2010G\u2010pseudotyped lentiviral particles were produced in a split genome approach by calcium\u2010phosphate\u2010mediated transient transfection of human embryonic kidney HEK293T producer cells as recently described 10, 30. After 48 hours, supernatant was collected, filtered (45\u2009\u00b5m), and enriched by ultracentrifugation (50,000g, 2 hours). Viral titers were determined by transduction of NIH3T3 cells with different concentrations of virus supernatant and FACS. FACS\u2010sorted LT\u2010HSCs were transduced with indicated lentiviral particles (MOI 100) and cultured for 4 days. After staining cells with Fixable Viability Dye (eBioscience) for live/dead cell exclusion, the cells were fixed with Fix Buffer I (BD) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 10 minutes and permeabilized with ice\u2010cold Perm Buffer III (BD) for 30 minutes on ice. Permeabilized cells were subsequently stained with antibodies against P\u2010p38\u2010Phycoerythrin (PE) (BD) to analyze the phosphorylation status of the cells by FACS. Four\u2010day cultured LT\u2010HSCs or MPPs were stimulated with 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml Anisomycin (Sigma) for 30 minutes prior to fixation as positive control. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPadPrism\u20106.0 software. Statistical significance was determined by a Student's t test (two\u2010tailed, unpaired, equal variances) if not otherwise mentioned. The significance level for all tests was set to \u03b1\u2009=\u20095%. In order to assess the influence of GADD45A expression on the expansion of LT\u2010HSCs and their progeny, we lentivirally transduced FACS\u2010sorted LT\u2010HSCs (CD150+ CD48\u2212 CD34low CD117+ Sca1+ Lin\u2212) with GADD45A or a control vector (Fig. 1A; Supporting Information Fig. S1A, S1B). The ectopic GADD45A expression enhanced GADD45A protein levels about twofold in lentivirally transduced cells (Fig. 1A). The number of transduced cells, that coexpressed a fluorescent VENUS reporter protein, was assessed at 5, 8, and 10 days in culture. There was no influence on the expansion of the cells by the expression of GADD45A (Fig. 1B). This unexpected result indicated that there might be no gross changes in proliferation and cell death caused by GADD45A. However, to confirm that these fate decisions were not skewed we investigated individual LT\u2010HSCs during differentiation via time\u2010lapse\u2010microscopy\u2010based cell tracking (Fig. 1C). This technology allows following individual LT\u2010HSCs and their progeny during their differentiation process over weeks in culture without losing cell identity. FACS\u2010sorted LT\u2010HSCs were subjected to time\u2010lapse microscopy while lentivirally transduced with GADD45A. The induction of transgene expression (VENUS+) could be followed in real time at a single cell level. We compared the time of first LT\u2010HSC division and the cell cycle lengths of subsequent progeny of LT\u2010HSCs transduced with GADD45A or control for several generations (Fig. 1D, 1E; Supporting Information Fig. S2). Neither did we determine any delay of the first entry into LT\u2010HSC division nor any increase in the cell cycle length in GADD45A\u2010expressing cells as originally expected by the expression of a protein normally involved in growth arrest. To the contrary, in later generations, the cell cycle was even shorter in GADD45A\u2010expressing cells, which might be a consequence of a further advanced differentiation stage rather than a direct influence of GADD45A on the cell cycle (Fig. 1E). Next, we assessed the cell cycle of hematopoietic cells after GADD45A expression in vivo (Fig. 1F). Since we sought to determine the influence of GADD45A on HSPC proliferation shortly after transplantation, a sufficient number of donor cells were required. Therefore, we transplanted KSL cells transduced with GADD45A or control and assessed the cell cycle status of GADD45A\u2010expressing progeny in the recipient BM 3 weeks after transplantation via a short BrdU pulse of 4 hours (Fig. 1F; Supporting Information Fig. S1C). When we analyzed the cell cycle phases of all cells, lineage\u2212 cKIT+ progenitor cells or immature HSPCs (KSL cells), neither of these subpopulations showed any signs of alterations upon GADD45A expression determined via FACS. The cell cycle distribution was unchanged in the presence of GADD45A, indicating that GADD45A does not alter the proliferation of HSPCs (Fig. 1G). GADD45A has been implicated in the decision of cells to either survive or to go into apoptosis upon cell damage. Both scenarios have been reported as a consequence of the absence of GADD45A in hematopoietic cells 14, 23, 24. We measured the rate of dying cells at a single cell level by observing GADD45A\u2010expressing LT\u2010HSCs and their progeny by time\u2010lapse\u2010microscopy\u2010based cell tracking (Fig. 2A). There was no increase in apoptosis in HSPCs upon GADD45A expression for several cell generations (Fig. 2A). Also in vivo, 3 weeks after transplanting GADD45A\u2010expressing KSL, there was no increase in apoptosis in BM cells originating from GADD45A\u2010expressing KSL cells (Fig. 2B). In order to investigate consequences of GADD45A on HSC differentiation and self\u2010renewal, we assessed the differentiation kinetics of LT\u2010HSCs that were lentivirally transduced with GADD45A by the analyses of surface marker expression via FACS (Fig. 3A). Already 5 days after transduction, almost 40% of the GADD45A\u2010expressing LT\u2010HSCs have differentiated into granulocyte\u2010macrophage progenitor (GMP)\u2010like cells, whereas only 4% of the control\u2010transduced LT\u2010HSCs have developed into this stage and the majority of cells were still considered immature (Fig. 3A, 3B). Along the same line, after 8 days of differentiation, 66% of GADD45A expressing cells developed into mature cells of the granulocyte/monocyte (GM) lineage. Only 12% of control\u2010transduced cells reached this stage of differentiation after 8 days (Fig. 3B). Since the level of GADD45A expression by a lentiviral vector may influence the true physiological cell fate decision of LT\u2010HSCs upon induced endogenous GADD45A expression, we additionally used an inducible and scalable TET\u2010regulated lentiviral system (Supporting Information Fig. S3A). The expression of Gadd45a\u2010IRES\u2010VENUS was under the control of a TET\u2010inducible promoter, and limiting concentrations of Doxycycline induced a linear range of GADD45A expression (Fig. 3C). Even at maximal induction, the GADD45A expression level was only 22% of the expression level of the SFFV promoter\u2010driven lentiviral vector and could be scaled down to 6% (Fig. 3C). Only 22% of the previously ectopically expressed GADD45A was required to efficiently induce and accelerate the differentiation in LT\u2010HSCs to the same extend as shown with the SFFV\u2010driven GADD45A expression (Fig. 3D; Supporting Information Fig. S3B). The stepwise reduction of ectopic GADD45A expression below 22% of the original level decreased the impact on differentiation in a linear way. Strikingly, even as little as 6% was sufficient to induce differentiation in LT\u2010HSCs, although not to the same extent (Fig. 3D; Supporting Information Fig. S3B). This result clearly showed that even low levels of GADD45A, once expressed in LT\u2010HSCs, initiate the differentiation program in these cells and accelerate the differentiation. To test whether LT\u2010HSCs would start to differentiate after GADD45A expression, or whether they are able to remain self\u2010renewing in their in vivo niche, we transplanted LT\u2010HSCs after transduction of GADD45A or control in lethally irradiated recipients (Fig. 3E). We assessed donor blood cell reconstitution in PB up to 18 weeks after transplantation. After 2 weeks, GADD45A\u2010expressing LT\u2010HSCs cells initially contributed almost equally to donor blood cell production, suggesting a successful homing to the recipient BM. Thereafter, the donor cell chimerism did not increase and completely disappeared after 8 weeks, and there was no contribution of GADD45A\u2010expressing cells at 18 weeks after transplantation, whereas a robust reconstitution was detectable using control\u2010transduced cells (Fig. 3E). As a consequence, the serial transplantation of GADD45A\u2010expressing cells into secondary recipients was obsolete. When we analyzed the BM and spleen of GADD45A\u2010expressing KSL recipient mice, it became apparent that already 3 weeks after transplantation, the donor blood cells were markedly reduced (Supporting Information Fig. S3C, S3D). These in vivo transplantations demonstrated that LT\u2010HSC differentiate upon GADD45A expression and were unable to maintain their self\u2010renewal program even in their natural niche environment. In order to measure the kinetics of differentiation induction in individual LT\u2010HSCs in real time, we investigated the onset of the differentiation marker CD16/32 expression that indicates GM\u2010committed cells, in the presence or absence of GADD45A. We transduced LT\u2010HSCs with GADD45A and control and subjected the cells to time\u2010lapse microscopy. The expression of the surface marker CD16/32 was determined by the binding of a fluorescently labeled antibody during differentiation in culture. In average, the time gap between the first GADD45A expression and the onset of CD16/32 was only 29 hours (\u00b119 SD). However, almost no cells expressed detectable CD16/32 after 6 days of cell observation and tracking under control conditions. So far we only provided evidence that ectopic GADD45A rapidly induces and accelerates differentiation in LT\u2010HSCs. Next we assessed whether conditions that cause DNA\u2010damage in cells, such as \u03b3\u2010IR, UV, or cisplatin treatment induce endogenous GADD45A expression in stem and progenitor cells. We therefore FACS\u2010sorted KSL cells and treated them with IR, UV, or cisplatin and compared the levels of Gadd45a mRNA to untreated control KSL. As previously shown 14, 24, all these regimens triggered the expression of GADD45A (Fig. 4A). To test whether these DNA\u2010damage causing conditions also lead to an induction and acceleration of differentiation in LT\u2010HSCs, as seen with the ectopic expression (Fig. 3), we cultured \u03b3\u2010IR\u2010treated LT\u2010HSCs for 5 days and determined the level of differentiation by FACS. Indeed, a significant lower proportion of immature HSPCs remained in the population of \u03b3\u2010IR\u2010treated LT\u2010HSCs in comparison to untreated LT\u2010HSCs, and the reduction was similar to the effects caused by ectopic GADD45A expression (Fig. 4B). The additional ectopic expression of GADD45A in \u03b3\u2010IR\u2010treated LT\u2010HSCs further enhanced their differentiation, probably by further increasing the levels of GADD45A (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that DNA\u2010damage causing conditions can indeed trigger the differentiation in LT\u2010HSCs, most likely caused by the upregulation of GADD45A. To elaborate whether GADD45A expression influences the lineage choice of LT\u2010HSCs and their progeny, we lentivirally transduced LT\u2010HSCs with either GADD45A or control and analyzed their colony\u2010forming ability in methylcellulose\u2010based medium (Fig. 5A). Mature cells of all myeloid lineages arose from LT\u2010HSCs transduced with GADD45A without major shifts in the lineage distribution in comparison to control\u2010transduced LT\u2010HSCs (Fig. 5A). Neither the colony size nor the lineage contribution was changed upon GADD45A expression. The video\u2010microscopy\u2010based tracking of GADD45A\u2010transduced LT\u2010HSCs elucidated their differentiation into megakaryocytes in culture (Supporting Information Fig. S4A; Video 1). Also in in vivo transplantations, PB B, T, and myeloid cell lineages were generated from LT\u2010HSCs transduced with GADD45A (Fig. 5B). The increased ratio of long\u2010lived lymphoid cells versus short lived myeloid cells upon GADD45A expression further suggest an advanced differentiation of immature HSPCs 8 weeks after transplantation. Later on, almost no GADD45A\u2010expressing cells were detectable for multilineage analyses. Furthermore, progenitor cells for GMPs and MEPs were unchanged in the BM 3 weeks after transplantation indicating that GADD45A\u2010expressing KSL give rise to all myeloid lineages (Supporting Information Fig. S4B). Since the other family member GADD45G induced a lineage selection against megakaryocyte\u2010erythroid cell fate, and MEPs could not handle the GADD45G\u2010induced program and died 10, we wanted to confirm that the program of GADD45A is not inhibiting cells of this lineage. In contrast to GADD45G, however, GADD45A\u2010transduced MEPs (CD150+ CD117+ Sca1\u2212 Lin\u2212, Supporting Information Fig. S1A, FACS\u2010sorting according to 31, 32) were largely unaffected in their ability to form mature erythroid/megakaryocytic colonies (Fig. 5C). Taken together, GADD45A expression did not lead to a skewing of the generated lineages as GADD45G expression does by selecting against megakaryocyte\u2010erythroid lineage choice 10. Therefore, we assessed the expression of endogenous GADD45 Beta and Gamma upon ectopic GADD45A expression in LT\u2010HSCs (Fig. 5D). While the GADD45B mRNA levels remained constant, the ectopic expression of GADD45A by lentiviral transduction of LT\u2010HSCs caused a sharp downregulation of endogenous GADD45G, thereby allowing the development of megakaryocytes and erythrocytes (Fig. 5D). To enlighten the molecular mechanism how GADD45A activates the differentiation program in LT\u2010HSCs, we focused on the recently unraveled mechanism of GADD45G\u2010mediated differentiation induction in LT\u2010HSCs 10. GADD45 proteins bind to mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP3K4) and release its autoinhibitory domain, leading to its activation and phosphorylation of downstream MAPK kinases (such as MKK3 and MKK6). Thereby, the binding of GADD45A to MAP3K4 initiates a MAPK cascade resulting in p38 and JNK activation 33. We showed that GADD45G specifically leads to p38 phosphorylation, and that the inhibition of p38, but not of JNK, resulted in a block in differentiation initiation of GADD45G 10. In order to see whether GADD45A also uses the same pathway we tested the induction of p38 phosphorylation by GADD45A via phosphoflow cytometry (Fig. 5A). As hypothesized, GADD45A\u2010expressing LT\u2010HSCs showed a stronger p38 phosphorylation than control\u2010transduced LT\u2010HSCs, indicating that the differentiation induction pathway is shared between GADD45G and GADD45A (Fig. 6A). To further corroborate that activated p38 is necessary for the GADD45A\u2010induced differentiation, we tested the differentiation kinetics of LT\u2010HSCs in the presence of p38 inhibitors (Fig. 6B). We lentivirally transduced LT\u2010HSCs with GADD45A or control and cultured them for 5 days in the presence or absence of two p38 inhibitors Vx702 and Ly2228820. In the presence of any p38 inhibitor, the differentiation induction and acceleration mediated by GADD45A was blocked, and the cells behaved like the control transduced cells (Fig. 6B). This clearly indicates that GADD45A induces its differentiation program by activation of the MAP3K4\u2010MKK6\u2010 p38 pathway. The function of GADD45A in hematopoiesis long remained controversial. Here we revisited the functional consequences of GADD45A on HSC fate decisions at single cell resolution. Constitutive GADD45A expression did not inhibit the cell cycle progression or forced HSCs into apoptosis but rapidly induced and accelerated multilineage differentiation by activating the p38 MAPK pathway. The absence of Gadd45a in HSCs has little effect on steady state hematopoiesis 14. In contrast, once genotoxic stress was applied to LT\u2010HSCs by \u03b3\u2010IR, the absence of GADD45A provided increased radioprotection and survival in HSCs at the expense of DNA integrity that resulted in a higher incidence of B cell leukemia 14. Additionally, ATM\u2212/\u2212 Gadd45a \u2212/\u2212 mice showed an increased incidence of hematopoietic malignancies as well as an increased rate of metastasis compared with ATM\u2212/\u2212 mice 34. Gadd45a deletion aggravated the DNA damage accumulation, which subsequently resulted in a further impaired self\u2010renewal capacity and an increased malignant transformation in ATM\u2212/\u2212 HSCs 34. Since GADD45A is obviously required for the genomic stability in HSPCs by allowing proper DNA repair, we expected to observe a cell cycle arrest upon GADD45A expression in LT\u2010HSCs. Surprisingly, GADD45A expression did not slow the cell cycle of HSCs and their progeny, neither in vitro nor in vivo, but rather shortened the cell cycle lengths in subsequent generations. Since GADD45A strongly accelerates the differentiation in HSCs, this might be a consequence of further differentiated progenitor stages with shorter generation times rather than a directly permitted effect by GADD45A on cell cycle progression. We cannot exclude that the absence of GADD45A may have an influence on the cell cycle progression 14, or that there are potential effects of GADD45A expression on the cell cycle of largely quiescent LT\u2010HSCs in steady\u2010state hematopoiesis. However, despite the fact that the GADD45 family members acquired their name as growth arrest genes it seems unlikely that cell cycle inhibition is of high relevance in the hematopoietic system. In contrast to a report that GADD45A expression resulted in increased apoptosis in LT\u2010HSCs 14 we did not observe increased cell death upon GADD45A expression, neither determined at the single cell level by continuous cell tracking nor after transplantation in vivo. This is in line with reports that propose a prosurvival function of GADD45A in hematopoietic cells 23, 24. Since ectopic GADD45A expression did not alter cell survival under normal conditions, it needs to be tested whether GADD45A expression increases HSC resistance to various noxins. We rather observed that LT\u2010HSCs were rapidly differentiating upon GADD45A expression with a loss of their self\u2010renewal ability. The differentiation\u2010promoting function of GADD45A is supported by the notion that GADD45A\u2010deficient LT\u2010HSCs exhibited increased self\u2010renewal 14 and colony\u2010replating abilities 25 albeit with a higher incidence of mutations. Similar to what we have previously reported for GADD45G, a GADD45 member that is under differentiation\u2010promoting cytokine control 10, GADD45A works as a toggle switch in inducing differentiation in LT\u2010HSCs. The trigger for GADD45A expression is mediated by DNA\u2010damaging events. We showed that GADD45G selectively activates the p38 pathway, most likely by the activation of MAP3K4 and MKK6, but not of JNK 10. Again, here we could reveal that GADD45A, albeit not induced by hematopoietic cytokines, uses a common pathway shared with GADD45G to induce p38\u2010mediated differentiation. However, the lineage selection against megakaryocyte\u2010erythroid fate by GADD45G expression 10 is not mirrored by GADD45A. As a possible explanation for this difference, we showed that GADD45A expression caused a sharp downregulation of GADD45G, thereby allowing all lineages to develop. Nevertheless, the exact molecular machinery that is initiated by different GADD45 family members to control lineage choice in HSPCs needs further clarification. It will be intriguing to unravel the downstream effectors that might be common or unique for individual GADD45 family members in HSC differentiation induction. The role of GADD45A in preserving the genomic integrity of HSCs is vital, but its mode of action as tumor suppressor for hematologic malignancies, especially the cell cycle inhibition and proapoptotic function, has been unclear so far. We showed that the differentiation induction might be the major antileukemia effect of GADD45A in the hematopoietic system, besides providing DNA repair and genomic stability. Importantly, we provide strong evidence that various DNA\u2010damaging conditions such as \u03b3\u2010IR and UV upregulate GADD45A expression in stem and progenitor cells and that these conditions ultimately lead to a differentiation induction and acceleration in LT\u2010HSCs. Damaged cells are forced to terminally differentiate and thereby cleared from the system. The hypothesis of differentiation check\u2010points for DNA\u2010damage response has been previously postulated 35, 36, 37. As one prominent example, the induction of the transcription factor BATF upon hematopoietic stress instructs terminal lymphoid differentiation 36. Our data supports the notion that also GADD45A exerts its important function in response to DNA damage at least partly in this respect. GADD45A and GADD45G are epigenetically silenced in many leukemias and solid cancers 9. Furthermore, GADD45A is frequently deleted in breast cancer 38. The reactivation of GADD45A by, for example, the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin promoted terminal differentiation and death of human carcinoma cells 39, 40. Enhanced p38 activation induces cell survival in many cancer cell types but obviously promotes a strong differentiation signal in HSCs, maybe by the phosphorylation of GATA3 41. Our data suggest that anticancer strategies using inhibiting agents against p38 MAPK should be carefully evaluated in blood cell malignancies, and reactivation of GADD45 might be of benefit for leukemia treatment. The long\u2010disputed functional consequences of genotoxic stress\u2010induced GADD45A expression in hematopoietic cells were revisited in this study, elucidating the role of GADD45A expression in murine LT\u2010HSCs at single cell resolution. We showed here that neither cell cycle arrest nor cell death was induced by GADD45A, but a strong differentiation program via the initiation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Forcing terminal differentiation of damaged HSPCs might be a prominent function of GADD45A in the hematopoietic system, besides providing DNA repair and genomic stability.

In one such mouse model, potent angiogenesis inhibitors elicit compartmental reorganization of cancer cells around remaining blood vessels. The glucose and lactate transporters GLUT1 and MCT4 are induced in distal hypoxic cells in a HIF1\u03b1-dependent fashion, indicative of glycolysis. Tumor cells proximal to blood vessels instead express the lactate transporter MCT1, and p-S6, the latter reflecting mTOR signaling. Normoxic cancer cells import and metabolize lactate, resulting in upregulation of mTOR signaling via glutamine metabolism enhanced by lactate catabolism. Thus, metabolic symbiosis is established in the face of angiogenesis inhibition, whereby hypoxic cancer cells import glucose and export lactate, while normoxic cells import and catabolize lactate. mTOR signaling inhibition disrupts this metabolic symbiosis, associated with upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT2.\n", "fulltext": "Judah Folkman\u2019s vision of targeting the tumor neovasculature as a new modality of cancer therapeutics has inspired a series of drugs that either exclusively (e.g., bevacizumab) or primarily (e.g., sunitinib, axitinib, and sorafenib) inhibit VEGF signaling (McIntyre and Harris, 2015, Vasudev and Reynolds, 2014; and references therein) with associated beneficial responses, representing proof of principle and new additions to the armamentarium of anti-cancer drugs. However, as with many targeted therapies, clinical responses to angiogenesis inhibitors (AI) are typically limited, manifested as increased, but limited progression-free survival and variable (or no) overall survival (Vasudev and Reynolds, 2014; and references therein). Concurrent with such clinical investigations, a number of preclinical studies of AI in various mouse models of human cancer have revealed multiple forms of adaptive resistance that enable tumors to evade the effects of AI therapy (Bergers and Hanahan, 2008, Clarke and Hurwitz, 2013, Welti et\u00a0al., 2013, McIntyre and Harris, 2015, Rigamonti et\u00a0al., 2014, Rivera et\u00a0al., 2015). One such model\u2014RIP1Tag2 transgenic mice, which develop de novo pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET) via a multistage pathway\u2014has been particularly instructive: tumorigenesis involves a discrete angiogenic switch (Folkman et\u00a0al., 1989), which is necessary for initial tumor formation. AIs, in particular ones targeting the VEGF signaling pathway, show demonstrable efficacy in this model (Bergers et\u00a0al., 2003), the results of which motivated clinical trials that led to the approval of one such agent, sunitinib, in human PanNET (Raymond et\u00a0al., 2011). Importantly, however, AIs are not curative in this mouse model, much as in human cancer patients. The basis for treatment failure lies in part in the development of multiple forms of adaptive resistance to AIs, including revascularization mediated by alternative pro-angiogenic signaling circuits (Casanovas et\u00a0al., 2005), recruitment of vascular-protective myeloid cells (Shojaei and Ferrara, 2008), and cooption of normal tissue vessels via increased invasion and metastasis (Sennino et\u00a0al., 2012, Ebos and Kerbel, 2011, Ebos et\u00a0al., 2009, P\u00e0ez-Ribes et\u00a0al., 2009). The RIP1Tag2 model has also been used to investigate other cancer hallmarks, including resistance to apoptosis and induction of invasiveness, which are variously regulated by signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, IGFR, IR, and ALK (Chun et\u00a0al., 2010, Nolan-Stevaux et\u00a0al., 2010, Ulanet et\u00a0al., 2010); these signals converge in part on the mTOR kinase, which orchestrates a broad program affecting cell survival and metabolism (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012, Cornu et\u00a0al., 2013). Notably, both preclinical (Chiu et\u00a0al., 2010) and clinical studies (Yao et\u00a0al., 2011) have demonstrated the efficacy of targeting mTOR in PanNET. We have continued to assess the effects on AI therapy in this PanNET model, including a comparative analysis of two multi-kinase inhibitors, sunitinib and axitinib, both of which target the VEGFR/PDGFR signaling pathways to inhibit new blood vessel growth and disrupt endothelial cells and pericytes of the preexisting tumor vasculature (Bergers et\u00a0al., 2003), reducing vascular density and functionality rather than producing the vascularization characteristic of less potent AI such as bevacizumab. Although both compounds have a similar target profile, axitinib exhibits fewer off target effects and toxicity (Gunnarsson et\u00a0al., 2015) (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov). In the course of further characterizing cellular and histologic responses to the two drugs, in particular their effects on the aforementioned mTOR signaling pathway, we observed an intriguing switch in the pattern of mTOR activity, reflected by phosphorylation of its downstream effector S6. Specifically, the diffuse pattern seen in untreated tumors was replaced by one of focal clusters. This focal reorganization of mTOR signaling motivated the investigation reported below, where we implicate metabolic symbiosis as another mode of adaptive resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. Given that mTOR signaling is prominently involved in the PanNET phenotype (see above), we had asked whether it was affected by disruption of the tumor vasculature with sunitinib. Indeed, mTOR signaling was found to be elevated in a set of sunitinib-treated tumors, as reflected in the heightened levels of phospho-S6 kinase (p-S6). In contrast, sunitinib treatment of cultured mouse PanNET cells did not elicit this upregulation (data not shown). To substantiate this observation, molecular efficacy trials were performed with sunitinib, in which mice with late stage tumors were treated for 7\u00a0days followed by analysis of tumor lysates by western blotting. Sunitinib elicited an increase in p-S6 (Figure\u00a01A, left), which was blocked by concomitant administration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Figure\u00a01A, right), demonstrating that its upregulation is mTOR dependent. Axitinib-treated tumors produced a similar trend (data not shown). The elevated mTOR signaling was surprising in that sunitinib- and axitinib-treated tumors become hypoxic in response to collapse of the tumor vasculature (P\u00e0ez-Ribes et\u00a0al., 2009, Sennino et\u00a0al., 2012), and observations presented below), and mTOR is typically downregulated in hypoxic conditions (Brugarolas et\u00a0al., 2004). Indeed, a derivative PanNET cancer cell line (\u03b2TC4) downregulated p-S6 in hypoxic versus normoxic conditions (Figure\u00a01B). Intrigued by this apparent dichotomy, we further investigated mTOR signaling in tumors treated for 4\u00a0weeks using immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure\u00a01C, p-S6 was elevated in sunitinib-treated tumors, but its expression was relocalized from the diffuse pattern seen in control tumors into focal clusters. The specificity of the p-S6 staining in control and sunitinib-treated tumors was confirmed by treatment with rapamycin, which ablated p-S6 expression, even when dosed in combination with sunitinib. Next, we assessed the relationship between p-S6 expression and hypoxia in treated tumors. Co-staining of sunitinib- and axitinib-treated tumors with antibodies to p-S6 and pimonidazole\u2014to reveal regions of hypoxia\u2014revealed an anti-correlation: p-S6 was predominantly expressed in the normoxic, and not hypoxic, regions of the treated tumors (Figure\u00a01D). Eventually, as the vascular regression and inhibition of new growth continues, the normoxic regions seen in Figure\u00a01D can coalesce into the focal clusters seen in Figure\u00a01C. This is further illustrated in Figure\u00a01E, which shows a highly necrotic/hypoxic tumor (left); within the regions of fibrosis/necrosis, focal clusters of viable cancer cells can be seen (H&E, middle left). These clusters are highly proliferative (Ki-67, middle right) and are cuffing blood vessels (CD31, right). The clustering of viable cancer cells around the few remaining blood vessels inside long-term treated tumors is consistent with their need for oxygen, but also for blood-borne nutrients, in particular glucose. We performed short-term trials using sunitinib alone or in combination with rapamycin and then performed RNA-sequencing (seq) analysis on the treated and control tumors. We conducted enrichment analysis on the top 2,500 unregulated genes in the control versus treated tumors, and the top ten enriched hallmark pathways for sunitinib monotherapy are depicted in Figure\u00a02A, including hypoxia and glycolysis. The enrichment plot for the hallmark glycolysis signature (Figure\u00a02A) includes Slc16a3 (MCT 4) and Ldha (lactate dehydrogenase\u00a0A; Figure\u00a02B), along with (to a lesser degree) Slc2a1 (GLUT1, data not shown). Both sunitinib and axitinib produced marked reductions in tumor vasculature (Figure\u00a0S1A) with widespread hypoxia, consistent with the hypoxia signature. Motivated by the glycolysis signature and the known induction of glycolysis by hypoxia, we assessed expression by immunostaining for the lactate transporter MCT4 and the glucose transporter GLUT1, whose elevated co-expression is diagnostic of glycolysis (Ullah et\u00a0al., 2006). Concordantly, the striking upregulation of Slc16a3/MCT4 revealed by the RNA profiling of sunitinib-treated tumors was detected by immunohistochemistry in tissue sections from the majority of sunitinib- and axitinib-treated tumors and was very low/absent in control or rapamycin-treated tumors (Figure\u00a02C). In treated tumors, GLUT1 and MCT4 were upregulated in the hypoxic regions, as revealed by co-staining with pimonidazole (Figure\u00a02D). Such upregulation in hypoxic conditions is consistent with previous reports that GLUT1 and MCT4 are regulated by the HIF hypoxia response system (Ebert et\u00a0al., 1995, Ullah et\u00a0al., 2006, Seagroves et\u00a0al., 2001). To confirm this interpretation, we evaluated compound mice carrying a tissue-specific gene knock out of HIF1\u03b1 in the oncogene-expressing cancer cells. Indeed, sunitinib treatment failed to upregulate GLUT1 and MCT4 in the Hif1\u03b1-knockout (KO) tumors (Figure\u00a02E), supporting the expectation that HIF1\u03b1 drives their upregulation. The compartmental expression of GLUT1/MCT4 was reminiscent of a phenomenon\u2014observed in certain tumors\u2014known as metabolic symbiosis, wherein hypoxic regions import and metabolize glucose (Ebert et\u00a0al., 1995) and secrete lactate, while normoxic regions import and metabolize the lactate (Sonveaux et\u00a0al., 2008, Kennedy et\u00a0al., 2013). We therefore assessed expression of the lactate transporter MCT1 and found that it was upregulated in a distinct compartment from the hypoxic, MCT4 positive region (Figure\u00a02F), although a small minority of cells are MCT1+/MCT4+ double positive (Figure\u00a0S1B). The hypothesis of metabolic symbiosis demands that the secreted lactate is not merely \u201ctoxic acidic waste\u201d, but rather a source of fuel that is imported and metabolized by the normoxic cancer cells. We assessed whether cultured \u03b2TC3 cells could recapitulate key aspects of the hypoxic response in culture and found that GLUT1 and MCT4 were upregulated under hypoxic conditions (Figure\u00a03A). We further assessed lactate utilization in cultured cancer cells and in tumor-bearing mice, by supplying isotopically labeled lactate or glucose, and assessing their catabolism into metabolites by NMR spectroscopy (Figures 3B and 3C). Thus, \u03b2TC3 cancer cells were cultured in hypoxic and normoxic conditions, in which they were supplied with 1\u201313C-glucose or with 3\u201313C-lactate in glucose-free media, in both cases similarly supplemented with glutamine and fetal calf serum (FCS); after 20\u00a0hr, the cells were harvested for NMR analysis. At this time point, cells cultured in 1\u201313C-glucose increased the levels of lactate in conditioned media both in hypoxia and normoxia, whereas cells cultured in 3\u201313C-lactate reduced the levels of lactate in conditioned media under normoxia and slightly increased lactate in hypoxic conditions (Figure\u00a03B, legend). The 13C NMR analysis revealed that in aerobic conditions 3\u201313C-lactate was catabolized to C4-glutamate, C2- and C3-aspartate (Asp), and C3-alanine (Figure\u00a03B), consistent with previous studies on lactate metabolism by cancer cells and neurons (Kennedy et\u00a0al., 2013, Waagepetersen et\u00a0al., 1998, Yang et\u00a0al., 2014). In contrast, lactate was imported,\u00a0but\u00a0not catabolized in hypoxic conditions (Figure\u00a03B). Notably,\u00a0the lactate catabolites coincide with those produced by 1\u201313C-glucose, indicating that both sets are likely produced through the same intermediate, pyruvate. Next, tumor-bearing mice treated for 10\u00a0days with sunitinib, rapamycin+sunitinib, or vehicle control were infused with 3\u201313C-lactate and the tumors excised and evaluated by NMR. Both treated and control tumors metabolized lactate (Figure\u00a03C). Additionally, the branched metabolic pathways involved in lactate catabolism may be altered in activity. The prominent 3\u201313C-alanine band produced from 3\u201313C-lactate \u2192 3\u201313C-pyruvate\u00a0+ glutamate \u2192 3\u201313C-Ala\u00a0+ \u03b1-ketoglutarate is relatively undiminished versus the glutamate and Asp species in the sunitinib-treated tumors; notably, the pathway producing 3\u201313C-Ala\u00a0+ \u03b1-ketoglutarate is involved in sustaining tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates important both for energy production and biosynthesis of cellular building blocks, a process referred to as anaplerosis. Intriguingly, RNaseq and RT-quantitative (q)PCR analysis (Table S1) of sunitinib versus control tumors revealed upregulation of Gpt2, an aminotransferase catalyzing the transamination that produces alanine\u00a0+ \u03b1-ketoglutarate from pyruvate and glutamate. In addition, Gls2, which converts glutamine to glutamate in the first step of its metabolism, is also upregulated (Table S1). In contrast, the rapamycin+sunitinib-treated tumors did not produce 3\u201313C-Ala. Rather, lactate-derived pyruvate evidently was converted to acetyl-CoA to enter the TCA cycle, producing C2- and C4-glutamate and C2- and C3-Asp (Figure\u00a03C). Thus, the data suggest that glutamine-associated catabolism of lactate to alanine becomes favored in the context of sunitinib therapy, which in the combination-treated tumors is repressed\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014by mTOR inhibition. Collectively, these observations, along with previous studies indicating the link between glutamine metabolism and mTOR signaling (Csibi et\u00a0al., 2014, Dur\u00e1n et\u00a0al., 2012), led us to consider the possible involvement of glutamine and the observed metabolism of lactate in the induction of mTOR signaling. Motivated by the observation that expression of Gls2 was increased in sunitinib-treated tumors (Table S1), we asked whether it was expressed in the hypoxic or normoxic compartment. Analysis of sunitinib-treated and control untreated tumors by fluorescent staining with anti-glutaminase 2 (GLS2) and pimonidazole demonstrated elevated expression of glutaminase 2 in both cases, and it could be found in both normoxic and hypoxic compartments in sunitinib-treated tumors (Figure\u00a04A), a result that was substantiated via RT-qPCR analysis of \u03b2TC3s cultured under normoxic and hypoxic growth conditions (Table S2); we also analyzed additional metabolic genes for differential expression and found significant upregulation of Slc2a1, Slc16a3, and Ldha in hypoxic conditions, whereas Slc2a2, Ldhb, and Gpt2 were elevated in normoxic growth conditions (Table S2). Next, we investigated possible links between glutamine, lactate metabolism, and mTOR signaling. First, we assessed the importance of glutamine for cell proliferation of \u03b2TC3 cells by EdU incorporation, which revealed minimal difference between the various culture conditions containing glutamine, with or without glucose and/or lactate; there was, however, a block in cell-cycle progression under glucose without glutamine conditions (w/wo lactate) (Figure\u00a0S2A), highlighting the dependence of these cells on glutamine. Then, we evaluated mTOR signaling in \u03b2TC3 cells (Figure\u00a04B) cultured in different combinations of lactate and glutamine. Cells were cultured in FCS and glutamine-supplemented, glucose-free media, with or without lactate. Net changes in lactate levels in conditioned media (CM) were assessed. Lactate levels in glutamine-supplemented, glucose-free cell media decreased reproducibly under aerobic conditions, consistent with its uptake by \u03b2TC3 cells (Figures 4B and S2B). Moreover, there was significant upregulation of p-S6 levels in cells cultured in lactate\u00a0+ glutamine versus glutamine alone (Figure\u00a04B, top and bottom), correlating with a net reduction of lactate in CM. As expected, upregulation of p-S6 could be reversed by rapamycin. Notably, p-S6 upregulation could also be reversed by inhibiting lactate uptake with CHC or 7ACC2, two distinctive inhibitors of the MCT1 lactate transporter (Sonveaux et\u00a0al., 2008, Draoui et\u00a0al., 2014) (Figure\u00a04B, top and bottom). In addition, a glutaminase inhibitor, DON (Dur\u00e1n et\u00a0al., 2012) (Figure\u00a04B, top and bottom), and an alanine aminotransferase inhibitor, AOA (Lamonte et\u00a0al., 2013) (Figure\u00a04B, top), also reversed p-S6 upregulation, whereas a glutaminase 1-specific inhibitor, BPTES, did not (Figure\u00a04B, bottom). We observed similar effects of lactate and glutamine on mTOR signaling in lactate-avid SiHa ovarian cancer cells (Figure\u00a0S2C), which have been extensively used to study metabolic symbiosis (Sonveaux et\u00a0al., 2008). Collectively, the data support a mechanism whereby cancer cells take up and metabolize lactate in the context of bioavailable glutamine in normoxic, but not hypoxic conditions (Figures 3B and 3C), thereby upregulating mTOR signaling (Figure\u00a04B). A schematic depicting the branched metabolic pathways involved in lactate catabolism in control and treated Rip1Tag2 PanNET tumors is depicted in Figure\u00a0S2D. In addition, we found that \u03b2TC3 cells cultured in lactate\u00a0+ glutamine upregulated \u03b1-ketoglutarate compared to cells cultured in glutamine only (Figure\u00a04C). Concordantly, Sonveaux and colleagues recently reported a link between lactate and glutamine metabolism in cultured SiHa and HeLa cancer cells under oxidative conditions (P\u00e9rez-Escuredo et\u00a0al., 2016). In light of the proposition that potent AIs were inducing tumors to adapt a strategy of metabolic symbiosis, and the observed relocalization of mTOR signaling into the normoxic compartment of putative symbiotic clusters, we investigated the impact of blocking mTOR signaling on the AI-induced symbiosis and consequent tumor phenotypes. Regression trials (depicted in Figure\u00a05A) were initiated at 13\u00a0weeks, when the mice already had appreciable tumor burden, and continued to a defined endpoint 2\u00a0weeks later (15\u00a0weeks), when most untreated animals have succumbed to hypoglycemia attributable to increased insulin secretion from the multiple pancreatic tumors that develop. Reasoning that vascular collapse might affect the bioavailability of rapamycin in the tumor microenvironment, we tested a trial regimen in which R+S and R+A arms were dosed for an initial 2D with rapamycin alone, followed by continuous dosing in combination with the AI (called \u201cstagger\u201d or \u201cSt\u201d). Another cohort of R+S was dosed simultaneously with both drugs from the beginning (\u201csimultaneous\u201d or \u201cSim\u201d). All three monotherapies (Mono-S, red triangles; Mono-R, yellow triangles; and Mono-A, green circles) showed anti-tumor activity, blocking further growth to produce tumor stasis compared to 13\u00a0week controls (Figure\u00a05B, blue circles). In marked contrast, each of the combinations of rapamycin plus an AI (R+S-St, purple diamonds; R+S-Sim, purple triangles; and R+A-St, rose squares) produced significant tumor regression versus the 13\u00a0week starting time point (Figure\u00a05B, blue circles). An additional 4-week-long intervention trial was performed with sunitinib, starting at 11\u00a0weeks, when the tumors were smaller, until the same defined 15\u00a0week endpoint (Figure\u00a05C). Again, while Mono-S (red triangles) and Mono-R (yellow triangles) produced significantly smaller tumors than vehicle-treated controls (blue circles), their combination (R+S-St, purple diamonds and R+S-Sim, purple triangles) produced significantly lower tumor burden than either efficacious monotherapy. Other dosing strategies were also assessed, including a shift from Mono-R to Mono-S (Figure\u00a05C, R->S, green circles), which appeared indistinguishable from each monotherapy in regard to tumor burden (TB). There was also an efficacious response to the combination R+S when sunitinib was reduced by half (Figure\u00a05C, R+1/2S, blue-gray circles). Thus, both experimental therapeutic trials demonstrated anti-tumoral efficacy for the combination of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and a potent AI. In order to further characterize the therapeutic response, open endpoint survival trials were performed with the combinations, in comparison to monotherapy- and vehicle-treated controls. Cohorts of mice were treated starting at 13\u00a0weeks until they became moribund and were sacrificed (Figure\u00a05D). All treatments, including the monotherapy arms, led to a significant survival advantage versus vehicle-treated mice. End stage tumors had progressed to a considerable size on rapamycin monotherapy, larger on average than untreated controls, indicating an adaptive resistance involving enhanced growth rates (Figure\u00a0S3A), as reported previously (Chiu et\u00a0al., 2010). Overall, TB at end stage was higher in regimens involving axitinib versus sunitinib (Figure\u00a0S3A). Interestingly, both AIs produced tumors that never revascularized (data not shown). Additionally, the combination therapies reduced the frequency of metastasis compared to both AI monotherapies, despite the significantly longer survival of mice in the dual therapy arms (Figure\u00a0S3B). It is unclear why the mice with only residual TB were dying, which is a topic worthy of future investigation. The combination of rapamycin plus sunitinib treatment for 1\u20132\u00a0weeks reproducibly elicited tumor regression, characterized by widespread necrosis and fibrosis, and markedly reduced proliferation, particularly in large tumors (Figures S4A, S4B, and S6). In contrast, while 8\u00a0weeks of Mono-S also produced tumors with pronounced necrosis and fibrosis, the remaining tumor cells were highly proliferative (Figure\u00a01E). When 13- to 15-week-treated tumors were analyzed comparatively for proliferation rates via Ki-67 staining, there was a significant reduction in proliferation in R+S-treated tumors versus controls and both monotherapies (Figure\u00a0S4B). Tumors treated with Mono-R had limited necrosis (data not shown), consistent with this and our previous study indicating it elicited heighted rates of apoptosis without appreciable necrosis (Chiu et\u00a0al., 2010) (Figure\u00a0S4C). Seeking to understand the basis for this heightened necrosis, and having identified putative symbiotic clusters of cancer cells associated with remaining blood vessels in the Mono-S-treated tumors, we asked whether rapamycin was affecting symbiosis in the R+S-treated tumors. The clusters could still be detected, as revealed by co-staining with MCT1 and MCT4, but their morphology was altered. Surprisingly, we observed that cancer cells in the hypoxic GLUT1high, MCT4high, and mTORlow compartment were selectively depleted compared to those cells in the normoxic GLUT1low, MCT1high, and mTORhigh regions where rapamycin was acting to suppress mTOR signaling. Only a rim of MCT4 cells could be detected, flanking regions of necrosis, in contrast to the multiple layers of such cells seen in the Mono-S-treated tumors (Figure\u00a06A). In contrast, rapamycin did not obviously disrupt the (previously p-S6high) MCT1high compartment (Figure\u00a06A). Thus, inhibition of mTOR signaling in the normoxic compartment was disrupting the symbiosis, but via an unexpected paracrine mechanism. A tenant of the symbiosis hypothesis is that the normoxic cancer cells have not upregulated glucose transporters, in contrast to the hypoxic cells (Figure\u00a02D), thereby sparing limited bioavailable glucose to diffuse from the nearest blood vessel to distal, but still viable hypoxic cancer cells. We wondered, therefore, if mTOR inhibition affected expression of glucose transporters? We first surveyed untreated tumors and observed heterogeneous expression of GLUT1 and a related transporter GLUT2, which is involved in glucose homeostasis in pancreatic islets (Guillam et\u00a0al., 1997) (Figure\u00a0S5A). A third transporter, GLUT3, was not consistently expressed (data not shown). Mono-S- and R+S-treated tumors were stained with antibodies that recognized pimonidazole adducts, indicative of hypoxia, and anti-GLUT1 and anti-GLUT2 antibodies (Figure\u00a06B). The analysis revealed appreciable upregulation of GLUT2 expression (red staining) in the normoxic regions of R+S, but not Mono-S-treated tumors (Figure\u00a06B, bottom); the Mono-S tumors express very little GLUT2 (or GLUT1) in normoxic regions proximal to the vessels. In contrast to GLUT2, GLUT1 is not widely upregulated in the normoxic compartment of R+S-treated tumors. We also performed comparative IHC using automated staining with GLUT1 and GLUT2 and saw a similar upregulation of GLUT2 in the normoxic regions of R+S- versus Mono-S-treated tumors (Figure\u00a0S5B). Western blot analysis on tumors also confirmed GLUT2 upregulation in R+S-treated tumors versus Mono-S (Figure\u00a0S5C), as did qRT-PCR (Table S1). There was also a modest upregulation of GLUT2 in \u03b2TC3 cells cultured in glutamine+lactate+rapamycin versus glutamine \u00b1 lactate (Figure\u00a0S5D), conditions we believe may be a surrogate for those found in the oxidative cancer cells inside AI-treated tumors. Although consistent with the in\u00a0vivo results, further work is required to substantiate these findings and determine the molecular pathway that governs this regulation. Thus, we envision that the normoxic compartment of the putative symbiotic clusters switches, in the context of mTOR inhibition, to importing and metabolizing blood-borne glucose instead of sparing it to favor lactate. Consequently, the vascular non-proximal hypoxic cells would starve from glucose deprivation and die; likely exacerbated by lactic acidosis, since the normoxic cells are now net secretors of lactate as a consequence of aerobic glycolysis. Transmission electron microscopy (Figure\u00a0S6) of cancer cells in the peri-necrotic region of a R+S-treated tumor reveals cells with granulated cytoplasm and grossly distended mitochondria, and abundant insulin granules, potentially indicative of the extreme conditions of insufficient oxygen and glucose, and an acidic microenvironment. To further substantiate these associations, Figure\u00a0S7 shows images of additional Control, Mono-S-, and R+S-treated tumors on serial sections stained with anti-MCT1, anti-MCT4, and pimonidazole, matched with anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (pS6), -GLUT1, and -GLUT2. These images further document the upregulation of MCT1/4 in Mono-S- and R+S-treated tumors versus untreated controls and abundant MCT1 staining in the R+S tumors. The pimonidazole/pS6 panels show strong and relatively homogenous staining of pS6\u00a0in non-hypoxic control tumors, and compartmentalized pS6 staining in the normoxic regions of Mono-S tumors, but no reactivity in the R+S-treated tumors. The TEM and immunostaining analysis both support the interpretation that the hypoxic compartment is being eliminated faster than the normoxic one in the R+S-treated tumors. In this and the two companion reports in this issue of Cell Reports from Pisarsky et\u00a0al., 2016 and Jim\u00e9nez-Valerio et\u00a0al., 2016, we describe an unanticipated new mode of adaptive resistance\u2014metabolic symbiosis\u2014that is induced in response to potent anti-angiogenic therapies that cause vascular collapse and consequent hypoxia. We show that cancer cells compartmentalize themselves in the acute condition of vascular insufficiency into comparatively hypoxic and normoxic compartments, based on their relative proximity to the few remaining functional blood vessels. The hypoxic cancer cells induce expression of the glucose importer GLUT1 and the lactate exporter MCT4, which is dependent on HIF1\u03b1. The normoxic cells express the lactate transporter MCT1, and we show that both normoxic cancer cells in culture and tumors in\u00a0vivo import and catabolize lactate; thus lactate is not just toxic waste from glycolysis, but rather is being used for energy metabolism. Moreover, our data reveal that the metabolic branch of lactate catabolism involving glutamine metabolism is favored, and this branch is blocked in tumors treated with rapamycin and anti-angiogenic therapy. Moreover, PanNET cancer cells cultured in the presence of lactate and glutamine upregulate phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6); the proposition that glutamine metabolism upregulates mTOR activity is consistent with previous studies in other cell culture systems (Dur\u00e1n et\u00a0al., 2012). The association of lactate and glutamine catabolism in the regulation of mTOR in these conditions of stressful vascular insufficiency is further substantiated by our results showing that mTOR upregulation can be suppressed by impairing lactate uptake with known inhibitors of MCT1, or by inhibiting enzymes involved in glutaminolysis, namely glutaminase 2 that converts glutamine to glutamate in the first step of its metabolism and an alanine aminotransferase that in turn catalyzes the production of alanine\u00a0+ \u03b1-ketoglutarate from (lactate-derived) pyruvate and glutamate. Other studies have reported that mTOR regulates glutamine flux and glutaminase levels (Csibi et\u00a0al., 2014). The observed upregulation/segregation of mTOR activity into the normoxic cell compartment induced by two potent AIs, and the resultant putative metabolic symbiosis, can be disrupted by concomitant inhibition of mTOR signaling with rapamycin. Remarkably, the initial impact of inhibiting mTOR in normoxic cancer cells is the necrotic death of the hypoxic cells, which lack elevated levels of mTOR signaling. An explanation for this intercellular crosstalk is offered by the observation that another glucose importer, GLUT2, is upregulated in normoxic peri-vascular cancer cells in response to rapamycin. The data suggest that the normoxic cancer cells proximal to the few remaining vessels consume the available blood-borne glucose when mTOR is inhibited, thereby starving distal hypoxic cancer cells, leading to their demise. Additionally, our NMR analysis of tumors suggests that mTOR inhibition blocks lactate catabolism via the anaplerotic pathway, and this abrogation of lactate consumption may lead to the intra-cellular and peri-cellular accumulation of toxic levels of lactate. The regulatory pathways involved in GLUT2 induction and metabolic reprogramming when the normoxic compartment is subjected to mTOR inhibition warrant future investigation. Remarkably, as summarized in the introduction, multiple modes of adaptive or evasive resistance to therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis have been reported (Casanovas et\u00a0al., 2005, Shojaei and Ferrara, 2008, Bergers and Hanahan, 2008, Ebos et\u00a0al., 2009, P\u00e0ez-Ribes et\u00a0al., 2009, Sennino et\u00a0al., 2012) in experimental therapeutic trials performed using conventional transplant and genetically engineered de novo mouse models of cancer. Of these, only heighted invasiveness has been clearly implicated as an adaptive resistance mechanism in a human cancer, namely glioblastoma (Lu and Bergers, 2013; and references therein), although similar mechanisms can be envisioned to underlay the transitory clinical responses to AI therapy in virtually all tested forms of human cancer. Notably, the accompanying report by Jim\u00e9nez-Valerio et\u00a0al. (2016, this issue of Cell Reports) documents the induction of MCT1/MCT4 lactate transporters in a pattern consistent with metabolic symbiosis in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patient-derived xenograph tumor (PDX) models treated with AI therapy. Moreover, analysis of biopsies of tumors from RCC patients treated with sunitinib produced histologic signatures of metabolic symbiosis that were exacerbated in relapsing/progressing (resistant) tumors from patients on anti-angiogenic therapy. Their data further show that this metabolic patterning is associated with TOR signaling, since its inhibition can evidently block this characteristic patterning. This study in human RCC, along with the accompanying article by Pisarsky et\u00a0al. (2016, this issue of Cell Reports) in a mouse model of breast cancer and the results presented herein collectively and compellingly add metabolic symbiosis to the roster of adaptive/evasive resistance mechanisms to anti-angiogenic therapy. In a broader context, the existence of metabolic symbiosis in tumors has been previously reported by Dewhirst, Sonveaux, Feron, and colleagues to arise spontaneously in certain transplant tumor models (Kennedy et\u00a0al., 2013, Sonveaux et\u00a0al., 2008, Semenza, 2008). They have described in a series of publications a metabolic symbiosis that conveyed decreased reliance on bioavailable glucose that limited the collateral damage from secreted lactate and consequent lactic acidosis, achieved by symbiotic cells importing and utilizing the lactate produced by glycolysis (Kennedy et\u00a0al., 2013, Sonveaux et\u00a0al., 2008, Semenza, 2008). The concept of metabolic symbiosis in neoplasia has been extended to interactions between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts endothelial cells, macrophages (Nakajima and Van Houten, 2013; and references therein), and also documented in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Guillaumond et\u00a0al., 2013). Its physiological basis lays in analogous symbiotic relationships operative in certain normal tissues, in particular brain and muscle (Draoui and Feron, 2011; and references therein). The concept can now be extended further, with the demonstrations that metabolic symbiosis can be induced in response to a serious environmental stress\u2014angiogenesis inhibition, with consequent dropout and insufficiency of the tumor vasculature, and widespread hypoxia\u2014in models of pancreatic neuroendocrine, breast, and renal cancer and in human RCC (this report, and the accompanying reports by Pisarsky et\u00a0al. and Jim\u00e9nez-Valerio et\u00a0al.). The question arises as to whether disruption of this mode of resistance might have value in extending the duration of efficacious responses by anti-angiogenic therapies. We show that metabolic symbiosis induced by sunitinib/axitinib can be disrupted by concomitant inhibition of mTOR signaling, resulting in significant reductions in TB and viability, but with only modest (albeit significant) extension in survival. The limited survival benefit suggests that \u201crapalogs\u201d may not prove to be ideal drugs to disrupt this form of adaptive resistance; moreover, combinations of sunitinib/axitinib with the rapalog everolimus have been tested clinically, with limited benefit and significant toxicity (Molina et\u00a0al., 2012). An alternative and potentially more attractive strategy may be to inhibit the MCT1 and/or MCT4 lactate transporters with highly selective drugs. Indeed, the preliminary studies reported herein and in the companion paper by Christofori et\u00a0al. (2016), in which expression of MCT4 was suppressed genetically, encourages further preclinical and then potentially clinical evaluation, given that a number of MCT1 and MCT4 inhibitors are in pharmacological development. An important further consideration is that tumors faced with vascular dropout and insufficiency evoked by potent AIs may activate multiple modes of adaptive/evasive resistance, in different regions of the tumor microenvironment. For example, in the RIP1Tag2 mouse model of PanNET, sunitinib is apparently inducing two distinctive modes of adaptive resistance, namely, symbiosis in hypoxic regions of regressing tumors, and, as reported previously, increased invasion and metastasis (P\u00e0ez-Ribes et\u00a0al., 2009), in part by upregulating cMET signaling (Sennino et\u00a0al., 2012). It is presently unclear whether these invading cancer cells also induce symbiosis upon reaching a size/location where diffusion of oxygen and glucose from co-opted normal vessels is insufficient, evoking hypoxia and, in turn, symbiosis. In fact, others have postulated that tumor acidity may promote local invasion (Gatenby and Gillies, 2004, Estrella et\u00a0al., 2013). Interestingly, we observed that co-inhibiting angiogenesis and mTOR reduces the incidence of metastasis, but it is unclear whether this effect relates to disruption of symbiosis or some other physiological parameter. Future studies in preclinical and clinical trials may shed light on the interplay between adaptive resistance mechanisms and means to concomitantly disrupt them. An interesting question, not fully answered by the current studies, is how these metabolic clusters are induced to form, and in particular, why the peri-vascular normoxic cancer cells choose to take up and metabolize lactate and spare the limited glucose for their hypoxic brethren. A plausible explanation for the formation and disruption of metabolic symbiosis is illustrated schematically in Figure\u00a07, and might transpire as follows: extensive vascular collapse elicited by the AIs results in hypoxia to trigger the HIF1\u03b1 transcription factor; HIF1\u03b1 induces GLUT1 and MCT4 and activates glycolysis in the hypoxic cancer cells, leading to high levels of lactate secretion; accumulating extracellular lactate induces expression of the MCT1 lactate transporter and, consequently, import of lactate into the normoxic cancer cells; in concert with serum-derived glutamine, lactate is catabolized in the normoxic cancer cells with consequent induction of mTOR signaling to promote tumor metabolism. Notably, mTOR expression must be both cause and consequence, since its pharmacological inhibition results in the normoxic cancer cells upregulating a glucose transporter (GLUT2), and apparently switching to secrete rather than import lactate, resulting both in insufficient glucose for the hypoxic cells and likely toxic acidosis in the extracellular microenvironment. In addition, mTOR has been shown by others to be upregulated by (Dur\u00e1n et\u00a0al., 2012) and also to control glutamine metabolism (Csibi et\u00a0al., 2014). We extend these results by showing that its inhibition blocks the conversion of lactate-derived pyruvate/glutamate to alanine/\u03b1-ketoglutarate in R+S-treated tumors, disrupting the production of TCA cycle intermediates, potentially\u00a0contributing to increased levels of (toxic and non-catabolized) lactate. While plausible, this rationale for the assembly and disruption of symbiosis will require future experimental validation. In conclusion, the induction of metabolic symbiosis in response to vascular insufficiency elicited by potent AIs further illustrates the remarkable propensity of cancer cells to circumvent barriers that arise during tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and in response to treatment. This symbiotic adaptation evidently constitutes another mechanism that enables tumors to overcome the damaging effects of targeted therapies, by co-opting cellular processes intended for important homeostatic purposes that instead serve the evolving cancer. Sunitinib and axitinib were purchased from LC laboratories. Rapamune (rapamycin) was purchased from Galexis. Please see Supplemental Information for details on dosing regimens, formulations, etc. All mice used in this study were maintained in a pathogen-free barrier animal facility of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EFPL) in accord with Swiss regulations for the care and use of mice in experimental research. \u03b2TC3 cells were acclimated to \u201clow\u201d glucose (6.25\u00a0mM glucose\u00a0+ 4\u00a0mM Gln\u00a0+10% FCS). They were subsequently plated at 7\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells/10\u00a0cm tissue culture dish in low glucose culture media for 2\u00a0days, switched to 0% glucose/0% Gln\u00a0+ 10% FCS ON, then cultured in 20\u00a0mM 3\u201313C-lactate or 20\u00a0mM 1\u201313C-glucose\u00a0+ 4\u00a0mM Gln (no glucose) for 16\u00a0hr in hypoxic (1% O2/5% CO2) or normoxic (21% O2/5% CO2) conditions, and harvested for NMR. Plates were harvested individually on ice, rinsed twice with PBS, and collected in 0.9\u00a0M perchloric acid, which was subsequently titrated to approximately neutral pH with 0.9\u00a0M potassium hydroxide (KOH); extracts were lyophilized for NMR. Mice were treated for 10\u00a0days with sunitinib or vehicle control and were infused with 3\u201313-C-lactate in PBS, by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, over a period of 90\u00a0min. Pentobarbital was administered, and the mice were perfused intravenously (i.v.) with a fluoresceinated lectin. Tumors were excised and immediately quick frozen in liquid nitrogen. For NMR, the frozen tumors were pulverized in liquid nitrogen, 0.9\u00a0M perchloric acid was added to the pulverized tumor tissue, rotated at 4\u00b0C for 2\u00a0hr, and titrated with 0.9\u00a0M KOH to a final of approximately pH 6\u20137. NMR analysis was performed using a Bruker AVII 800 MHz spectrometer (18.8\u00a0T) equipped with a triple channel 5\u00a0mm cryoprobe (CPTCIz). 13C and 1H spectra were acquired using 30\u00b0 angle pulses on 13C with decoupling on proton (zgpg). A repetition delay (d1) of 3\u00a0s and 2,048 scans (ns) was used. Spectra were processed with MestreNova software 10 using 5\u00a0Hz of line broadening. The chemical shift scale was calibrated with 3\u201313C lactate (21\u00a0ppm) as a reference, according to Shen et\u00a0al. (1999) and Patel et\u00a0al. (2005). To prepare samples for introduction into the NMR, 300\u00a0\u03bcl of pulverized cell solution was mixed with 100\u00a0\u03bcl of D2O (99.9% deuterated), shaken for 2\u00a0min, and directly poured into a 5\u00a0mm NMR tube. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) software, and a log rank test was performed using software from the Broad Institute (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/russell/logrank/index.html). Due to the small sample size (as few as eight animals per treatment group) and the fact that not all the data are normally distributed, a non-parametric, suitable Mann-Whitney test was used (Figures 1A, 5B, 5C, S1A, S3A, S4B, and S4C; Tables S1 and S2), the log rank test was used for survival studies (Figure\u00a05D), and the Student\u2019s t test was used for Figures 4C, S5C, and S5D. For the incidence of metastasis during survival trials (Figure\u00a0S3B), data were analyzed using R, where the event is \u201cmetastasis\u201d and the horizontal axis is \u201cage of sacrifice due to declining health status\u201d, we tested whether the metastases are more frequent in one group versus the other (function \u201csurvdiff\u201d).

Here, Wistar Kyoto/spontaneous hypertensive (WKY/SHR) rats fed a high-salt diet developed severe proteinuria, resulting from pronounced renal inflammation, fibrosis and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. All these were mainly non-pressure-related effects. Hsp90\u03b2, TGF-\u03b2, HIF-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MCP-1 were shown to be highly expressed in response to salt loading. Next, we found that Hsp90\u03b2 might play the key role in non-pressure-related effects of salt loading through a series of cellular signalling events, including the NF-\u03baB, p38 activation and Bcl-2 inactivation. Hsp90\u03b2 was previously proven to regulate the upstream mediators in multiple cellular signalling cascades through stabilizing and maintaining their activities. In our study, 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown dramatically alleviated the high-salt-diet-induced proteinuria and renal damage without altering blood pressure significantly, when it reversed activations of NF-\u03baB, mTOR and p38 signalling cascades. Meanwhile, Co-IP results demonstrated that Hsp90\u03b2 could interact with and stabilize TAK1, AMPK\u03b1, IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, HIF-1\u03b1 and Raptor, whereas Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition disrupted this process. In addition, Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition-mediated renal improvements also accompanied the reduction of renal oxidative stress. In conclusion, salt loading indeed exhibited non-pressure-related impacts on proteinuria and renal dysfunction in WKY/SHR rats. Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition caused the destabilization of upstream mediators in various pathogenic signalling events, thereby effectively ameliorating this nephropathy owing to renal hypoxia and oxidative stress.\n", "fulltext": "1. A long-time phenomenon has been observed and confirmed that hypertensive patients from northern China usually suffer from more serious kidney disease than those from southern China, mainly because people in northern China favour a high-salt diet, whereas people in southern China do not. Based on previous investigations, high-salt diet often increases glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, size and weight of rat kidneys. However, it was found that the augmented proteinuria was not simply owing to the adverse effects of hypertension on kidneys. Atenolol treatment was reported to reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) effectively, but it hardly relieved the increased urinary protein excretion in salt-loaded SHR, suggesting blood-pressure-independent factors possibly contribute to renal disease. Thus, it was concluded that the increases in SBP and proteinuria might be independent consequences of a high-salt diet. In addition to the well-known effect of salt loading on blood pressure, such clinical and experimental observations were in favour of non-pressure-related effects of salt that could contribute to its influence on nephropathic outcome. A reduction in renal oxygenation often occurs in most chronic kidney diseases irrespective of aetiology. This is due to a combination of several pathophysiological and morphological changes, which consist of increased oxygen demand from hyperfiltration, tubular hypertrophy, capillary rarefaction and glomerular injury. The resulting reduction in renal oxygen availability is furthermore exacerbated by renal fibrosis, which limits oxygen diffusion. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is a hallmark of tissue hypoxia, which is responsible for the induction of genes that facilitate tissue fibrosis from normoxia to hypoxia. Among numerous growth factors and cytokines, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) has been identified as the most potent target cytokine of HIF-1\u03b1 in renal fibrosis. On the other hand, HIF-1\u03b1 levels paralleled not only tissue hypoxia, but also oxidative stress and accumulation of inflammatory mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice previously demonstrated reduced histological evidence of tubular injury when they were subjected to renal infusion/repression (I/R). In the kidney, TNF-\u03b1 often contributes to the chronic inflammation that often precedes interstitial matrix deposition, and is also implicated in obstruction-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis. MCP-1 has been recognized as an angiogenic cytokine, which was implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases characterized by monocytic infiltrates, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or atherosclerosis. Furthermore, MCP-1 was likewise produced in renal tubular cells, and increased MCP-1 expression usually contributed to renal tubular damage. Although hypoxia is well known to increase HIF-1\u03b1, a growing body of evidence indicates that oxidative stress-dependent mediators, including inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, also stimulate HIF-1\u03b1 gene activity. In short, high-salt-induced nephropathy is an extremely complicated biological process, which contains the cross-talk between renal hypoxia and excessive oxidative stress. Thus, animal models were much better research objects than cell models in this study. Urine is easily obtainable biological fluid that contains useful biological markers for renal diseases. It has been widely used to study renal pathophysiology. Urinary proteins mainly come from the glomerular filtration of blood plasma. Urine has been defined as a fluid biopsy of the kidneys because it provides direct (and indeed substantial) information about the kidney. Thus, many changes and alterations in kidney functions can be detected in the urinary proteome. Here, with the help of the latest proteomic technology, we investigate the possible mechanisms of high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy in normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY)/spontaneous hypertensive (SHR) rats. 2. 2.1. Primary antibodies against Hsp90\u03b2, TAK1, p-TAK1 (phospho-T187), TAB-1, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 (ERK1: phospho-Y204, ERK2: phospho-Y187), JNK1/2, p-JNK1/2 (phospho-T183/Y185), p38, p-p38 (phospho-T180/Y182), I\u03baB\u03b1, p-I\u03baB\u03b1 (phospho-S32/S36), NF-\u03baB p65, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, p-Bcl-2 (phospho-S87), p-p70S6 K (phospho-T389), p-mTOR (phospho-S2448), IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, p-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (phsopho-S176/S177), HIF-1\u03b1, Lamin B1 (internal standard in nuclear protein fractions), \u03b2-actin (internal standard in cytosolic protein fractions) were from Abcam. Monoclonal antibodies against MKK3/6, p-MKK3/6 (MKK3: phospho-S189, MKK6: phospho-S207), AMPK\u03b1 and phospho-AMPK\u03b1 (phosphor-T172) were from Cell Signaling Technology and R&D Systems, respectively. Control rabbit IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem. Secondary antibodies coupled to IRDye800 fluorophore for use with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System were purchased from Rockland. Hsp90 inhibitor, the water-soluble 17-DMAG, was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 2.2. All rats purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA) were maintained in animal facilities of Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine and allowed free access to rodent feed and tap water. At first, eight-week-old male SHR rats (n = 40) and WKY rats (n = 40) were used. SHR rats were regularly tested with polymorphic markers to confirm their inbred status. At the age of 10 weeks, SHR rats were randomly divided into two groups (SHR group, SHR + HS group), while WKY rats were also randomly divided into two groups (WKY group, WKY + HS group). WKY group and SHR group received a normal-NaCl (0.4%) diet for 10 weeks, whereas WKY + HS group and SHR + HS group received a high-NaCl (4%) diet for 10 weeks. 2.3. Paraffin-embedded kidney tissues were cut into sections 4 \u00b5m thick. Sections were stained with haematoxylin\u2013eosin (HE) according to conventional histological examination techniques. Analysis of tubules included the evaluation of epithelial histology. The degree of injury was scored semi-quantitatively on a 0\u20134 scale for reabsorption granules, vacuolization and epithelial degeneration as follows: 0, no lesion; 1, minimal (minor focal changes); 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, severe. Semi-quantitative analysis of glomeruli included glomerular histology as well as foot process morphology assessed by electron microscopy, and was graded as follows: 1, minimal (involving less than 5% of glomerulus); 2, mild (5\u201324%); 3, moderate (25\u201349%); 4, severe (greater than or equal to 50%). Assessment of glomerular involvement, an average of 80\u2013120 glomeruli per section was examined on multiple levels. All scoring was achieved in a blinded manner by an experienced renal pathologist. Semi-quantitative analysis of tubular morphology in rats was also performed in a blinded fashion exactly as described previously. 2.4. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Gibco) as described by the manufacturer. RT-PCR was performed using the Access RT-PCR Introductory System (Promega) with indicated primers (electronic supplementary material, table S1). PCR was performed for 30 cycles in 25 \u00b5l of reaction mixture. PCR products were monitored by microchip electrophoresis system (MultiNA, Shimadzu Biotech, Kyoto). GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene here. 2.5. At this stage, 10-week-old SHR rats (n = 60) received a high-NaCl (4%) diet for six weeks. SHR rats were also regularly tested with polymorphic markers to confirm their inbred status. Then, these SHR rats were randomly divided into three groups (SHR + HS group, SHR + HS + 0.5 mg kg\u22121 17-DMAG group and SHR + HS + 2 mg kg\u22121 17-DMAG group). 17-DMAG was diluted in saline, and its dose was adopted according to previous papers. Rats received 1 ml i.p. administration of 17-DMAG or vehicle (saline) every 2 days for four weeks (from the 16th week to 20th week). 2.6. The rat cell line, NRK-52E (ATCC, CRL-1571\u2122), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Hyclone, Herndon, VA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, NY) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco; Grand Island, NY), and incubated at 5% CO2 and 95% humidified atmosphere air at 37\u00b0C. The culture medium was replaced twice a week. Once the cells reached confluency, they were passaged using trypsin (0.05%)\u2013EDTA (0.02%) solution. The two recombinant lentiviral expression vectors used in this study were synthesized by Bioworld. One vector expressed Hsp90\u03b2-specific siRNA (sense strand: 5\u2032-GAGCTGATACCTGAGTACCTCAACT-3\u2032) and GFP, whereas the other expressed Control siRNA (sense strand: 5\u2032-GCAACCAGGACACTCGTTACATGTT-3\u2032) and GFP. Cells were plated at a density of 2 \u00d7 105 cells well\u22121 in six-well culture plates for lentiviral infection. After 24 h, the medium was removed and 1.0 ml DMEM containing 10% FBS, 10 \u00b5l (5 \u00d7 107) lentivirus and 1 \u00b5l (10 mg ml) polybrene (Bioworld, Nanjing) was added to each culture well and gently mixed. After 12 h, the cell culture medium was removed again, and 2 ml DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics was added. Infection was confirmed after 72 h by fluorescence microscopy and little to no toxicity was seen. The cells were passaged and immediately assessed by RT-PCR to ensure the effects of Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown. Cadmium was added to the medium to induce Hsp90 expression, which could upregulate Hsp90 level in NRK-52E cell line. 2.7. At this stage, 10-week-old SHR rats (n = 60) received a high-NaCl (4%) diet for six weeks. SHR rats were also regularly tested with polymorphic markers to confirm their inbred status. Then, these SHR rats were randomly divided into three groups (SHR + HS group, SHR + HS + Control siRNA group and SHR + HS + Hsp90\u03b2 siRNA group). NRK-52E transfectants (1 \u00d7 106 cells) expressing either Control siRNA sequence or Hsp90\u03b2 siRNA sequence were injected into kidneys of SHR + HS rats via the renal artery as previously described. Rats received 1 ml renal arterial injection of vehicle (saline) as control. 2.8. Tissue samples of whole kidneys were homogenized in ice-cold PBS buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail, and the total proteins were extracted using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protein concentration of tissue supernatant was determined by BioSpec-nano (Shimadzu Biotech, Kyoto). Proteins were immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies respectively. The precleared Protein A/G Plus\u2013agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with immunocomplexes for 2 h and washed four times with the lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE followed by transferring onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences). The immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously. The antibody\u2013antigen complexes were visualized by the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System according to the manufacturer's instruction using IRDye800 fluorophore-conjugated antibody (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) or using TMB immunoblotting system (Promega, Madison, WI). Quantification was directly performed on the blot using the LI-COR Odyssey analysis software. 2.9. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e. Statistical analyses were performed by unpaired t-test, ANOVA and subsequent Tukey's test or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. 3. 3.1. We first examined whether a high-salt diet affected blood pressure and proteinuria in WKY/SHR rats. Even at the age of 20 weeks, the SBP of high-salt-diet groups was not considerably higher than the normal-salt-diet group (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). However, the relativity of the relationship between natriuresis and blood pressure tended to be somewhat significant with increasing age, thereby indicating that blood pressure might be sensitive to salt loading with old age. Urinary microalbumin and \u03b22-microglobulin are common nephropathic indicators that reflect the severity of renal pathogenesis. Strikingly, the differences of microalbumin and \u03b22-microglobulin were much more pronounced (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). At the age of 20 weeks, the degree of proteinuria in WKY + HS group was nearly twice that seen in WKY group, and the degree of proteinuria in SHR + HS group even reached three times that of SHR group. Thus, the data implied that non-pressure-related effects of salt loading mainly contributed to its impact on nephropathic outcome. 3.2. HE staining and injury indices showed that high-salt diet indeed caused nephropathy in WKY/SHR rats (figure\u00a01), where renal tubular hyalinecasts enlargement and atrophy were obviously seen in high-salt-diet groups. Meanwhile, hypertension-induced renal arteriole wall thickening was also markedly seen in either SHR group or SHR + HS group. In human renal disease, the reduction in glomerular filtration rate is significantly related to the histological changes observed in the tubules and interstitium. The excess filtered protein reabsorption by the proximal tubules is degraded by lysosomes. When the intracellular products of this degradation reach the interstitial space, they give rise to focal infiltrates of inflammatory cells with an increased deposition of collagen, matrix and fibrous tissue. Our data also yielded that high-salt diet resulted in the inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis of rat kidneys. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed severe renal damage, such as renal tubular epithelial cell vacuolization in high-salt-diet groups (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). Interestingly, renal tubular atrophy and epithelial cell vacuolization were usually indicative of epithelial cells undergoing programmed cell death. 3.3. Many changes and alterations in kidney functions can be monitored in rat models through urinary proteomic analysis. Here, we performed urine quantitative proteome analysis in either normotensive or hypertensive rats that could specifically reflect non-pressure-related proteomic changes upon salt-loading. Contrasted with WKY group, there were 28 upregulated proteins and 12 downregulated proteins in WKY + HS group (electronic supplementary material, table S2). Moreover, contrasted with SHR group, there were 39 upregulated proteins and 18 downregulated proteins in SHR + HS group (electronic supplementary material, table S3). Among these differentially expressed proteins, 25 upregulated proteins and 10 downregulated proteins were common in WKY + HS group and SHR + HS group (bold in electronic supplementary material, table S2 and S3). Elevated level of fibronectin is usually involved in tissue fibrosis, which can be directly regulated by HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptionally. Superoxide dismutase [Cu\u2013Zn] was also upregulated, which was involved in excessive renal oxidative stress. On the other hand, EGF, u-PA and cadherin-1 were downregulated in high-salt-diet groups, which were proven to have cytoprotective effects in the kidney, such as the prevention of fibrosis and degradation of accumulated extracellular matrix. We finally selected heat shock protein \u03b2 (Hsp90\u03b2) owning to two factors: it was previously proven to regulate the upstream mediators in multiple cellular signalling cascades through stabilizing and maintaining their activities, and it is the only protein possibly involving renal fibrosis, inflammation and tubular epithelial cell death here; it has been rarely seen in previous investigations of salt-loading-induced renal dysfunction. 3.4. Immunohistochemical analysis of Hsp90\u03b2 were performed here, and revealed that its expression was indeed elevated in high salt diet groups (electronic supplementary material, figure S3), which was also confirmed by RT-PCR measurements. Interestingly, high-salt diet did not affect Hsp90\u03b1 expression (figure\u00a02). TGF-\u03b2, HIF-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MCP-1 expressions were similarly elevated in high-salt-diet groups markedly (figure\u00a02). These nephropathic markers are universal proinflammatory or profibrotic cytokines, which can be directly or indirectly regulated by diverse cellular signalling cascades, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Therefore, we examined the effects of high-salt diet on NF-\u03baB, extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK signalling cascades here. The results showed that high-salt diet augmented the activations of NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK without altering the activations of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 in high-salt-diet groups (figure\u00a03). Meanwhile, NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation was also increased markedly by high-salt diet (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). In addition, due to the fact that tubular epithelial cell death occurred in high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy, we also examined the effects of salt-loading on Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2, an anti-apoptotic protein) activation, and the data showed that it indeed led to the phosphorylation/inactivation of Bcl-2. 3.5. In this study, SHR rats developed more severe nephropathy than WKY rats in response to high-salt diet, because essential hypertension is often characterized to induce vascular remodelling (VR). VR mainly involves thickening of the arterial wall, and this change also facilitates the development of tissue damage. Thus, we selected SHR + HS group as the target of Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition in this study. A water-soluble Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-DMAG, was administrated to investigate the role of Hsp90\u03b2 in high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy. On the other hand, Hsp90\u03b2 siRNA was also transfected into rat kidneys to improve the specificity of Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition, whereas immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the effects of Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown in vivo (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). It was demonstrated that Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition hardly affected the SBP of SHR + HS group (electronic supplementary material, figure S6a,d). However, urinary secretion of microalbumin and \u03b22-microglobulin was reversed significantly by 17-DMAG dose-dependently (electronic supplementary material, figure S6b,c), and this effect was also confirmed by treatment with Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown (electronic supplementary material, figure S6e,f). HE staining and TEM analysis were carried out to evaluate the effects of Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition on renal histology. We discovered that 17-DMAG or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown significantly impaired glomerular fibrosis, renal tubular hyalinecasts, enlargement and atrophy (figure\u00a04), and renal tubular epithelial cell vacuolization was also relieved by Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). 3.6. Contrasted with SHR + HS group, 17-DMAG or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown reversed the phosphorylations of inhibitor of NF-\u03baB \u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1), Bcl-2 and p38 MAPK, without altering their protein expressions (figure\u00a05). Meanwhile, NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation was impaired significantly by Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition (electronic supplementary material, figure S8). Next, we examined the effects of Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition on upstream kinases of NF-\u03baB and p38, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3/6) and IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (I\u03baB kinase \u03b1/\u03b2). The results showed that 17-DMAG or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown also reversed the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 in SHR + HS rats, suggesting that Hsp90\u03b2 is required for the protein stability of IKK. Surprisingly, MKK3/6 activation was not affected by Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition. It was suspected that p38 activation might be regulated via other uncanonical activators. MKK3/6-independent p38 activation is usually associated with TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB-1) interaction, when active AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can trigger p38 recruitment to TAB1 and p38 autophosphorylation. Our data revealed that Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition reversed TAB-1-mediated p38 phosphorylation via inactivation of AMPK\u03b1 (electronic supplementary material, figure S9). In addition, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylates and activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6 K, Thr389), which is also involved in the phosphorylation/inactivation of Bcl-2. Inactivation of Bcl-2 triggers the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, leading to the activations of downstream pro-apoptotic caspases. Our data also showed that 17-DMAG or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown indeed reversed the activations of mTOR/p70S6 K and the release of cytochrome c (figure\u00a06), suggesting that Hsp90\u03b2 promotes the tubular epithelial cell apoptosis mediated by mTOR signalling. 3.7. A variety of signalling proteins involved in cell survival, growth and differentiation are recognized as Hsp90 client proteins. On ATP binding, the Hsp90 client complex associates with co-chaperones such as cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) and p23 to facilitate client stabilization. Here, we investigated whether Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition affected the stability of some potential Hsp90\u03b2 client proteins in rat kidneys (figure\u00a07). The results demonstrated that 17-DMAG or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown effectively reduced the interactions of TAK1 (TGF-\u03b2-Activated Kinase 1), AMPK\u03b1, IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, HIF-1\u03b1 and Raptor (regulatory-associated protein of TOR, an important positive regulatory subunit of mTOR complex) with Hsp90\u03b2, indicating that endogenous Hsp90\u03b2 protein complex was required to maintain the high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy. In addition, we measured the urinary secretion of 8-OHdG (8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine, an indicator of renal oxidative stress; electronic supplementary material, figure S10). Compared with normal-salt-diet groups, high-salt-diet induced greater renal oxidative damage. However, 17-DMAG or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown decreased the urinary secretion of 8-OHdG in SHR + HS group. In spite of the effects of Hsp90\u03b2 on ROS-mediated cellular signalling pathways, our results indicated that Hsp90\u03b2 was also required for excessive renal oxidative stress in salt-loaded rats. 4. Here, we identified a novel mechanism of high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy, including renal inflammation, fibrosis and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. Our data showed for the first time that, to the best of our knowledge, high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy was specifically associated with enhanced levels of Hsp90\u03b2, which played the key role in non-pressure-related effects of salt loading. However, Hsp90\u03b1, another important isoform of Hsp90, tended to be sensitive to hypertension instead of salt loading in this study. It indicated that Hsp90\u03b1 and Hsp90\u03b2 might exhibit significantly different behaviours under stress conditions, though they had similar interactions with co-chaperones. The majority of renal oxygen consumption results from reabsorption of approximately 99.5% of filtered sodium, so the increased kidney metabolism is usually associated with high-salt diet, as well as the decreased renal oxygen availability in both animals and patients. This change directly results in renal hypoxia, which often leads to the overexpression of HIF-1. Here, HIF-1 was indeed increased dramatically in response to salt loading in WKY/SHR. HIF-1 is often responsible for renal fibrosis. Here, our in vivo data showed that Hsp90\u03b2 protected HIF-1\u03b1 in high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy, which was reversed by 17-DMAG or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown. Hsp90 has been reported to induce the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1. Thus, Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition resulted in the decreased expression of HIF-1\u03b1, leading to the impaired transcriptional regulatory activity of HIF-1. In this study, the expression of TGF-\u03b2 (a key downstream target gene of HIF-1) was indeed reduced by Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition, and the TGF-\u03b2-mediated renal fibrosis obtained effective restriction simultaneously. In the kidney, a high salt intake often favours not only renal hypoxia, but also renal oxidative stress. The reason might be that hypoxia could accumulate ROS in renal tissue, and this oxidative stress conversely facilitated renal hypoxia owing to inefficient cellular respiration. In vitro COS-7 cell experiments previously demonstrated that Hsp90 could interact with Nox5, and was required for enzyme stability and ROS production of Nox. Our in vivo data also yielded that secretion of urinary 8-OHdG was strikingly elevated in response to salt loading, and reversed by Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition. Besides the direct effect on renal oxidative stress, Hsp90\u03b2 might also affect ROS-mediated renal inflammation and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis together. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MCP-1, were indeed induced substantially in response to salt loading, which could be transcriptionally regulated by NF-\u03baB or p38 MAPK signalling cascades. Our results showed that high-salt diet simultaneously promoted the inflammatory response via NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK activations in rat kidneys, which were markedly reversed by 17-DMAG or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown. Here, Hsp90\u03b2 maintained the protein stability of IKK, and IKK activated downstream I\u03baB\u03b1, where inactivated I\u03baB\u03b1 blocked the transcriptional regulatory activity of NF-\u03baB. Decreased nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB confirmed the role of Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition. Similarly, Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition might induce the degradation of AMPK\u03b1, and cause a significant decrease in enzyme ability of AMPK\u03b1, where AMPK\u03b1\u2013TAB1 complex maintained the kinase activity of p38. More importantly, Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition significantly suppressed salt-loading-stimulated expression of TAK1, where TAK1\u2013TAB1 complex maintained the kinase activity of IKK. In addition, HIF-1\u03b1 has been reported to be phosphorylated by p38 directly, and NF-\u03baB could stimulate the transcription of HIF-1\u03b1 gene. Thus, there might be a cross-talk between renal inflammation and fibrosis. On the other hand, high-salt-diet-induced oxidative stress damages epithelial cells directly, causing the tubular epithelial cell death. mTOR may have a pleiotropic function in the regulation of cell apoptosis. The binding of raptor to mTOR is required for the mTOR-catalysed phosphorylation of downstream effectors, where it strongly enhances the mTOR kinase activity towards p70S6 K. Activation of mTOR and downstream target p70S6 K is associated with increased inactivation of Bcl-2 and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, suggesting that the mTOR pathway plays a critical role in the apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells in response to salt loading. Our results showed that 17-DMAG or Hsp90\u03b2 knockdown impaired the protein stability of Raptor, and this change resulted in the suppression of mTOR activity. Thus, Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition might relieve the renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis via downregulating mTOR-p70S6 K-Bcl2 axis, and the reduction of renal tubular epithelial cell vacuolization confirmed this point. Moreover, IKK has been reported to phosphorylate and inactivate tuberous sclerosis protein 1, which could facilitate the activation of mTOR signalling. It indicated that renal inflammation might not only promote renal fibrosis reciprocally, but also affect the renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. In this study, the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by Hsp90\u03b2 inhibition indeed accompanied the downregulation of HIF-1-mediated fibrosis and Bcl-2-mediated cell death. As a conclusion, the renal hypoxia and oxidative stress driven by high-salt diet promoted the progress of renal damage, including renal inflammation, fibrosis and tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. Hsp90\u03b2 maintained the stability and activity of various cellular signalling proteins, which might be required for non-pressure-related effects of high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy (figure\u00a08). We also believed that the regulatory functions of Hsp90\u03b2 would not be merely confined to our study, because the latest discovery revealed that 17-DMAG also ameliorated diabetic nephropathy via the suppression of NF-\u03baB and STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) signalling in experimental mice. All these factors suggest that Hsp90\u03b2 has potential therapeutic value in high-salt-diet-induced nephropathy."}, "27384305": {"pmid": "27384305", "pmcid": "PMC5007899", "title": "Male 11\u03b2-HSD1 Knockout Mice Fed Trans-Fats and Fructose Are Not Protected From Metabolic Syndrome or Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "abstract": "\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) defines a spectrum of conditions from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis and is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Glucocorticoids can promote steatosis by stimulating lipolysis within adipose tissue, free fatty acid delivery to liver and hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Glucocorticoids can be reactivated in liver through 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2-HSD1) enzyme activity. Inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD1 has been suggested as a potential treatment for NAFLD. To test this, male mice with global (11\u03b2-HSD1 knockout [KO]) and liver-specific (LKO) 11\u03b2-HSD1 loss of function were fed the American Lifestyle Induced Obesity Syndrome (ALIOS) diet, known to recapitulate the spectrum of NAFLD, and metabolic and liver phenotypes assessed. Body weight, muscle and adipose tissue masses, and parameters of glucose homeostasis showed that 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and LKO mice were not protected from systemic metabolic disease. Evaluation of hepatic histology, triglyceride content, and blinded NAFLD activity score assessment indicated that levels of steatosis were similar between 11\u03b2-HSD1KO, LKO, and control mice. Unexpectedly, histological analysis revealed significantly increased levels of immune foci present in livers of 11\u03b2-HSD1KO but not LKO or control mice, suggestive of a transition to NASH. This was endorsed by elevated hepatic expression of key immune cell and inflammatory markers. These data indicate that 11\u03b2-HSD1-deficient mice are not protected from metabolic disease or hepatosteatosis in the face of a NAFLD-inducing diet. However, global deficiency of 11\u03b2-HSD1 did increase markers of hepatic inflammation and suggests a critical role for 11\u03b2-HSD1 in restraining the transition to NASH.\n", "fulltext": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) defines a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, progressing in rare cases to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1\u20133). Around 30% of the United States adult population has NAFLD with 3%\u20135% diagnosed with NASH (4), leading to increased morbidity and mortality (5). Accumulating evidence supports an association between NAFLD and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Around 75% of obese people have NAFLD, with insulin resistance a key mechanistic factor between both conditions (6). As such, NAFLD can be regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the MetS, which together increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (6, 7). Patients affected by glucocorticoid (GC) excess (Cushing syndrome) present with many of the disorders associated with MetS and can develop NAFLD (8). GCs promote steatosis through multiple mechanisms including stimulation of lipolysis within adipose tissue resulting in increased free fatty acid (FFA) delivery for utilization in the liver to produce lipids through enhanced hepatic de novo lipogenesis (9\u201311). In most patients with NAFLD and MetS, circulating GC concentrations are not elevated (12). However, GCs can be activated in a tissue-specific manner through the prereceptor activity of the 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2-HSD1) enzyme, with the site of greatest activity being the liver (13). Thus, hepatic metabolism affected by GCs is a balance between circulating delivery and 11\u03b2-HSD1-mediated intracellular activation. Preclinical studies using 11\u03b2-HSD1 knockout (KO) and transgenic mice have exemplified the role 11\u03b2-HSD1 can play in determining hepatic metabolic phenotype. Global deletion of 11\u03b2-HSD1 protects against high-fat diet induced obesity and glucose intolerance, whereas liver-specific 11\u03b2-HSD1 deletion does not (14\u201316). 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice are protected from hepatosteatosis in the face of circulating GC excess and reveal the importance of adipose tissue in determining hepatic phenotype (14). Furthermore, mice with transgenic overexpression of 11\u03b2-HSD1, specifically in adipose and liver, develop hepatosteatosis in the context of a high-fat diet (17, 18). Data from studies in humans support the idea that with steatosis there is decreased hepatic 11\u03b2-HSD1-mediated GC reactivation, possibly due to decrease local GC availability and preservation of metabolic phenotype (19). 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors have been the subject of interest regarding their use in the treatment of conditions associated with MetS, with in-excess of 170 compounds having been developed for this purpose (20\u201323). Human clinical studies evaluating NAFLD patients showed that pharmacological inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD1 was able to modestly reduce liver fat content over a 12-week treatment period, although whether this was a direct or peripheral effect was unclear (24). Given the important role that 11\u03b2-HSD1-mediated GC metabolism plays in determining systemic and liver metabolic phenotype, we hypothesized that global deletion (11\u03b2-HSD1KO) and hepatocyte-specific deletion (LKO) mice would be protected from MetS and hepatosteatosis when subjected to a potent steatogenic diet. To this end, we fed 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice the American Lifestyle Induced Obesity Syndrome (ALIOS) diet which, unlike a standard high-fat diet, is known to more faithfully recapitulate the spectrum of NAFLD, from steatosis to NASH (25). Our data suggest that 11\u03b2-HSD1 loss of function affords no protection from ALIOS induced obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance or hepatosteatosis. Unexpectedly, we show that in the context of hepatosteatosis, 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice have increased inflammation, a prerequisite for the progression to NASH, as revealed by an accumulation of hepatic immune foci and increased expression of immune and inflammatory markers. These results suggest a role for 11\u03b2-HSD1 in restraining hepatic inflammation in NAFLD. Male mice aged 7\u20138 weeks, with global (11\u03b2-HSD1KO) and hepatocyte-specific (LKO) deletions of 11\u03b2-HSD1 (16, 26); along with age-matched C57BL/6 control mice (Charles River) were used. Male mice were used as we did not want to deviate from the original ALIOS protocol, where advanced hepatosteatosis was attained using the feeding protocol described below (25). Mice were housed 2\u20133 per cage and maintained at the Biomedical Services Unit at the University of Birmingham, and all procedures conducted in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986; regulated by the United Kingdom Home Office. Mice were maintained on a 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycle at 21\u00b0C\u201322\u00b0C and were fed ad libitum, a diet consisting of 45% of calories from fat, of which 11.6% were derived from transfats (D13022701; Research Diets, Inc). Mice were also given a high fructose corn syrup equivalent drinking water replacement (55% fructose:45% glucose [wt/vol] deionized H2O at a concentration of 42 g/L). This feeding regimen, referred to as the ALIOS diet (25), was maintained for 16 weeks, after which mice were subjected to exsanguination via cardiac puncture under general anesthetic (isoflurane), followed by cervical dislocation; upon which tissues were excised and weighed. Once weighed, tissues were dissected then promptly snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN2) or fixed in 4% formaldehyde (10% formalin [vol/vol] PBS). After 13 weeks of ALIOS treatment, blood from each mouse was collected into Microvette EDTA lined hematological tubes, from lateral tail veins and blood-glucose concentrations measured using an Accu-Chek monitor. The week after, mice were fasted overnight and glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) performed; whereby ip injections of 20% glucose (vol/vol) 0.9% sterile saline solutions at a dose of 2 g/kg were administered. Blood-glucose concentrations were measured at times (T)0, T15, T30, T60, T90, and T120 minutes after glucose injections. Blood samples were also collected at T0 and T30 after glucose injection and plasma insulin concentrations measured using the Ultra Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem). Insulin tolerance testing (ITT) was performed during week 15 of the study. Mice were fasted for 4 hours and blood-glucose concentrations measured (T0), followed by the administration of insulin (Actrapid) via ip injection at a concentration of 0.1 IU/mL (0.1% 100 IU/mL [vol/vol] 0.9% sterile saline) at a dose of 0.75 IU/kg. Blood-glucose concentrations were subsequently measured at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after insulin injections. Plasma FFA, triglyceride (TAG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)/low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were measured from blood taken via terminal cardiac bleeds using protocols outlined according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioVision). Hepatic TAG content was ascertained using Biovision's colorimetric assay (Cambridge Bioscience). Briefly, 100 mg of frozen liver tissue was homogenized in 5% Nonidet P-40 before being heated for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C in a water bath to solubilize TAGs, samples were left to cool to room temperature and the process repeated before centrifugation at 13 000 rpm. The resultant supernatants were diluted in distilled H2O and analyzed on a 96-well Wallac plate reader at \u03bb570 nm. Freshly excised livers were dissected, processed and embedded in paraffin wax, from which 5-\u03bcm sections were cut for analyses via histological staining. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to score hepatosteatosis and inflammation using the NAFLD activity score (NAS) (27) and trichrome staining to access fibrosis. All images pertaining to histological analyses were viewed via light microscopy and photomicrographs taken using a Leica imaging system. Fragments of frozen liver tissue were homogenized using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) for total RNA isolation. One microgram of total RNA was reversed transcribed to cDNA using Applied Biosystems High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction mixes consisting of Applied Biosystems TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and primer/probes (assays on demand), along with 1-\u03bcL cDNA, were made to 20 \u03bcL with nuclease-free water. All primer/probes targeted to genes of interest were labeled with FAM, whereas the reference gene, invariably 18s, was labeled with VIC; all reactions were singleplex and performed using Applied Biosystems ABI 7500 sequence detection system. Gene expression data was graphically represented as fold changes against controls. Reference genes' (18s) cycle threshold (Ct) values from each sample were subtracted from Ct values of corresponding samples genes of interest for \u03b4Ct values (\u0394Ct). These values were then averaged and controls averages taken from those of KOs to give \u0394\u0394Ct values which were then incorporated into the equation 2\u2227 \u2212 \u0394\u0394Ct; to normalize cohort controls values to 1 and KO cohort as fold changes compared with controls (28). All data are derived from n = 13 controls, n = 11 11\u03b2-HSD1KO, n = 9 LKO, and n = 9 LKO control male mice with data presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney and Student's t tests and statistical significance assigned where P < .05. Although graphical representation of RT-qPCR data are presented as fold change verses controls, statistical analyses were performed using \u0394Ct values. NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of the MetS. Thus, we used the ALIOS diet as a means to induce MetS and fatty liver disease in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and control mice. After 16 weeks of ALIOS diet, controls and 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice showed similar rates of body weight gain (Figure 1A). Body weight normalized sc fat, gonadal fat, and perirenal fat pad weights showed no differences, with evidence for moderately increased accumulation of mesenteric fat in 11\u03b2-HSD1KOs compared with controls (P < .01) (Figure 1B). No differences were seen in lean mass (quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscles) between 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 1C). 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice showed no difference in glucose or insulin tolerance when compared with control mice (Figure 1, D and E). Furthermore, neither fed nor fasted state blood-glucose concentrations were different between 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 1F). Blood-insulin concentrations in the fasted state and 30 minutes after glucose bolus injection showed no differences between 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 1G). We also assessed plasma lipid profiles and show HDL and LDL cholesterol, FFAs and TAGs were no different between 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 1, H\u2013J). Taken together, these data suggest that global deletion of 11\u03b2-HSD1 does not protect form the metabolic dysregulation associated with 16 weeks of ALIOS diet feeding, a time frame validated to cause obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia (25). ALIOS diet is also an established means to induce the classical features of hepatosteatosis and fatty liver disease (25), from which 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice should be protected. However, there were no differences in the macroscopic appearance of the liver, or body weight normalized liver weight between 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 2A). Hepatic TAG content endorsed the liver weight data, with no differences observed (Figure 2B). Steatosis analysis, using blind scoring of H&E-stained livers of 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and control mice, showed microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis in both 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and control mice. Although the severity varied across the cohorts, no differences in overall distribution in lipid accumulation were observed (Figure 2C). Indeed, qualitative assessment using NAS showed there was no statistically significant difference between hepatosteatosis in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and control mice (Figure 2D). Overall, we find that deletion of 11\u03b2-HSD1 in mice treated with the ALIOS diet affords no protection from hepatic TAG accumulation or classical histological profile associated with hepatosteatosis and an overall MetS. We also wished to delineate the contribution of hepatocyte specific-11\u03b2-HSD1 deletion to the development of a MetS and fatty liver in ALIOS-fed mice given the high level of enzyme expression in this cell type and its prominent role in GC-regulated lipid metabolism. To do this, we subjected hepatocyte-specific KO mice (LKO) to ALIOS diet for 16 weeks. As in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO, LKO mice gained weight at a similar rate to controls over the 16 weeks, with no discernible differences in end-point weight observed (control 34.73 \u00b1 1.47 vs LKO 36.56 \u00b1 0.70 g). No differences in body weight normalized adipose or lean tissue weights tissue weights were seen. In terms of glucose metabolism, area under the curve (AUC) analysis of GTTs and ITTs again showed no differences between LKO and control mice (GTT AUC, control 17.23 \u00b1 2.26mM vs LKO 20.32 \u00b1 2.22mM; ITT AUC, control 7.92 \u00b1 0.33mM vs LKO 7.35 \u00b1 0.37mM). Furthermore, there were no differences between normalized liver weight and hepatic TAG content between control and LKO mice, being equivalent to the 11\u03b2-HSD1KO (Figure 3, A and B). Hepatosteatosis analysis was conducted and showed equally distributed microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis in both LKO and control mice (Figure 3C). NAS-assessed LKO and control livers showed similar levels of hepatosteatosis (Figure 3D). These data confirmed the overall view that ALIOS diet and its associated induction of MetS and NALFD is unaffected by the 11\u03b2-HSD1 loss of function. It became apparent during the process of blind assessing histological NASs that certain sections displayed accumulations of hepatic immune foci in the context of steatosis. To better characterize this, blinded NAS system quantification of inflammatory and immune foci was conducted and revealed an average of 80% of fields of view from 11\u03b2-HSD1KO livers had 2 or more inflammatory foci compared with 30% in controls (P < .001) (Figure 4, A and B). Importantly, scoring of LKO immune foci showed no discernible differences with their controls (Figure 4C). These data suggest that despite no differences in systemic or hepatic metabolic parameters being observed, 11\u03b2-HSD1KO livers are potentially engaged in the early transition to inflammatory disease, and that extrahepatocyte 11\u03b2-HSD1 activity is important to this process. Following the observation of increased immune foci and early stage inflammatory disease in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice, we conducted gene expression analysis for markers of cytokines, macrophages, lymphocytes and fibrosis to further characterize this finding. The proinflammatory genes Tnf and Ccl2 were significantly increased in livers of 11\u03b2-HSD1KO compared with controls (Figure 5A). Further to this, macrophage markers Lgals3, Fsp1, and Cd11b, known to be involved in the early modulation of NASH, were significantly increased, as were lymphocyte specific markers Cd8 and B220 in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO compared with controls (Figure 5, B and C). These suggest that 11\u03b2-HSD1 expression in nonhepatocyte cells is important to restraining the immune response to ectopic liver fat accumulation. Because the pathogenesis of NASH involves the deposition of collagen and the formation of fibrotic lesions as hallmark features of advancing disease, we assessed the expression of fibrosis markers and show that Col1a1, encoding the major protein component of type 1 collagen, is significantly increased (P = .004) in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO but not in control livers. Reelin (Reln) expressed by hepatic stellate cells can act as a marker of hepatocyte damage, and was shown not to be altered (Figure 6A). However, trichrome staining showed no ectopic collagen deposition evident in either 11\u03b2-HSD1KO or control liver, with only collagen of the tunica externa of blood vessels stained (Figure 6B), suggesting that increased Col1a1 expression was a marker of the very earliest progression to NASH only seen in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice. Mice deficient in 11\u03b2-HSD1, or treated with 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors, resist obesity and a MetS phenotype when fed conventional high-fat diets (15, 21). Based on observations from such models and recent human clinical studies we postulated that 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and hepatocyte-specific KO (LKO) mice would be protected against the development of MetS and resist hepatosteatosis when challenged with the ALIOS diet. After 16 weeks of ALIOS, we show that male 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and LKO mice are indistinguishable from control mice displaying obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and indeed hepatosteatosis. An increase in mesenteric adipose tissue mass was measured in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice. This runs contrary to that found for 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice fed a high-fat diet, in which there was preferential adipose deposition away from the mesenteric depot (15). Nonetheless, positive correlations have been shown between mesenteric fat mass and hepatosteatosis in human subjects (28\u201330). Unlike conventional high-fat diets, ALIOS diet includes transfats and fructose, both of which can drive hepatic lipid metabolism and accumulation, and have been shown to exacerbate the development of MetS beyond that achieved by conventional high-fat diets (25, 31\u201333). Indeed ALIOS is also validated to induce a more vigorous progression from simple steatosis to NASH, something that high-fat diets rarely achieve (25, 34). We had further hypothesized that KO mice would be protected from developing overt fatty liver and show a decrement in lipid accumulation. However, hepatic lipid accumulation and quantitative NAS analysis demonstrated no differences between 11\u03b2-HSD1KO, LKO, and their control mice. A number of preclinical animal models have demonstrated the potential for 11\u03b2-HSD1 to modulate lipid accumulation and the NAFLD phenotype. Mice with transgenic over expression of 11\u03b2-HSD1, specifically in adipose and liver, develop steatosis in the context of a HFD (17, 18). 11\u03b2-HSD1KO and adipose-specific 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice resist hepatosteatosis when GCs are in circulatory excess, achieved through the lack of adipose 11\u03b2-HSD1 limiting lipolysis and hepatic FFA delivery, whereas LKO maintained florid steatosis as in wild-type mice (14, 16). Furthermore, a recent phase 1B clinical trial using the 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitor RO5093151 effectively reduced liver-fat content of those treated; however, the tissues mediating this effect were not identified (24). On this basis, we conclude that in the context of the ALIOS diet, neither global nor hepatocyte-specific 11\u03b2-HSD1 loss of function in male mice has any protective effect against the development of hepatosteatosis. Simple and benign steatosis is a reversible condition which precedes more destructive NASH, fibrosis and cirrhosis (35). Our unanticipated observations of inflammatory disease only, in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice, implied that we had collected liver transitioning to the early stage of NASH. Inflammatory scoring was not a primary end-point measure in terms of our initial hypothesis regarding metabolic disease. However, there is accumulating evidence for a prominent role for 11\u03b2-HSD1 in modulating local tissue inflammatory responses, regulating early restraint of the acute inflammatory process. 11\u03b2-HSD1 deficiency has been shown to worsen acute inflammation with greater infiltration of inflammatory cells into target sites in experimental models of rheumatoid arthritis and myocardial infarction (36, 37). However, this is not a universal observation. Reduced inflammation in adipose tissue has been observed in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice, suggesting tissue-specific inflammatory phenotypes are important (38). We endorsed our histological observations by showing elevated expression of markers of inflammation and immune cell infiltration/activation in livers of 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice when compared with controls. Fibroblast-specific protein-1 (Fsp1/S100a4), a marker for a subpopulation of macrophages specific to liver damage was increased yet F4/80 and Cd68, pan macrophage markers, and Clec4f, expressed in Kupffer and migrant liver macrophages were not. Although no firm conclusions can be drawn, they do suggest differential regulation of FSP1+ve macrophages in the context of 11\u03b2-HSD1 and diet-induced hepatic inflammation. Importantly, FSP1+ve macrophages also express Cd11b, Ccl2, and Tnf, all of which were also significantly increased in 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice. Because several liver resident immune cells types express these markers, elucidation of the subpopulations involved could not be ascertained (39\u201342). In healthy livers, resident immune cells are found in portal tracts and migrate into the parenchyma upon initiation of an inflammatory response (43\u201345). It has been shown that they automodulate their physiology via intracrine 11\u03b2-HSD1-mediated reactivation of GC, regulating processes such as mast cell degranulation, dendritic cell differentiation, and neutrophil and dendritic cell susceptibility to apoptosis (46\u201350). This evidence suggests the intrinsic ability of immune cells to autoregulate availability of GC is crucial to appropriate immune function. We postulate that ALIOS induced hepatic inflammation is initially restrained by extrahepatocyte 11\u03b2-HSD1 activity in resident hepatic immune cells or/and by peripheral extravasated immune cells such as macrophages (51, 52). This is supported by data showing macrophages deficient in 11\u03b2-HSD1 fail to phagocytose apoptotic neutrophils when treated in vitro with 11\u03b2-HSD1 substrate; with 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice having delayed macrophage phagocytic competence during induced peritonitis (49). The enhanced inflammatory phenotype exhibited by 11\u03b2-HSD1KO mice also endorses clinical data, whereby steatohepatitis was accompanied with an increase in 11\u03b2-HSD1, suggesting a requirement for increased GC activity in inflamed livers (19). Although we show significantly increased hepatic expression of Col1a1, an early marker of liver collagen deposition (53), we could not demonstrate histological evidence of fibrosis, and may be due to 16 weeks of ALIOS being insufficient to evoke fibrotic lesions. ALIOS diet fed for 12 months has been shown to recapitulate the development of NASH, as 80% of animals developed fibrosis and 60% hepatocellular carcinoma (34). These data indicate ALIOS as a useful means to examine the relationship between hepatic 11\u03b2-HSD1-mediated GC metabolism, MetS and inflammatory disease. Importantly, we highlight the need to further explore 11\u03b2-HSD1 in the context of hepatic inflammation and its role in the mechanisms that gateway the development of NASH. Further work is required to elucidate the cell types and mechanisms critical to resolving hepatic inflammation in the setting of ALIOS induced NAFLD and MetS. Ultimately, the clinical application of 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors as treatments for many of the conditions associated with MetS may not be advisable when NAFLD is also present."}, "27640183": {"pmid": "27640183", "pmcid": "PMC5027120", "title": "Erythropoietin does not activate erythropoietin receptor signaling or lipolytic pathways in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue in vivo", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nErythropoietin (Epo) exerts direct effects on white adipose tissue (WAT) in mice in addition to its erythropoietic effects, and in humans Epo increases resting energy expenditure and affect serum lipid levels, but direct effects of Epo in human WAT have not been documented.

Moreover, Epo receptors (Epo-R) of alleged functionality have been identified in numerous tissues. In particular, data in mice suggest high expression of Epo-R mRNA in spleen and in white adipose tissue (WAT). Studies in end-stage renal disease (ERSD) patients show that serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL decrease to normal levels after Epo treatment [3\u20135], but acute administration of rHuEpo in healthy subjects do not significantly affect lipid levels, although a tendency to increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels have been observed. However, prolonged treatment to healthy humans with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) significantly increases serum FFA levels and hepatic lipid content. In mice overexpressing the Epo gene, increased fat oxidation and an up-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle has been shown. On the other hand, mice with a lack of Epo-R, except for the bone marrow, have a significantly higher body weight, increased fat mass and increased serum TG levels [2, 9]. Furthermore, a reduction in body weight due to reduced WAT mass in obese mice is found after Epo treatment [2, 8\u201311]. The mechanism by which Epo regulates fat metabolism and body weight is currently unknown. One explanation could be an increase in resting energy expenditure including fat oxidation, but only the former has been documented in healthy human subjects [6, 7]. As regards direct peripheral actions of Epo, there is no evidence to support such effects in human skeletal muscle [12, 13]. The effect of Epo treatment on WAT in humans has so far not been evaluated, but Epo-R protein and mRNA has been detected in WAT from mice in addition to a suppressive effect of Epo on fat accumulation and preadipocyte differentiation and expansion in vitro [2, 14]. Epo administration in mice is also associated with induction of brown adipose tissue (BAT) like features in WAT with increased mitochondrial content and uncoupling. Furthermore, adipocyte specific deletion of the Epo-R in mice lead to obesity and decreased insulin sensitivity. In contradiction, specific knockdown of the adipocyte Epo-R showed that Epo signaling at physiological levels was not essential for WAT metabolism. The aim of the current study was to evaluate both the acute and prolonged effects of Epo treatment on human subcutaneous WAT on; 1) Epo-R expression, 2) activation of Epo-R related signaling pathways, and 3) direct and indirect effects on lipolysis and WAT metabolism. Ten healthy young men (23 (20\u201328) years, 179 (173\u2013192) cm, and 77 (68\u201390) kg, median (range)) participated after providing written informed consent, in adherence to the declaration of Helsinki. The Local Ethical Committee of Central Denmark Region (M-2008-0016) approved the study and it was further registered at clinicaltrials.gov (M-20080035). Results regarding whole body and skeletal muscle metabolism from the same study have previously been published. Eighteen healthy untrained men (placebo group: 23 (21\u201335) years, 183 (172\u2013191) cm, and 80.1 (67.7\u201396.5) kg; ESA group: 22 (19\u201329) years, 186 (177\u2013198) cm, and 80.3 (70.7\u2013102.5) kg, median (range)) were included after receiving oral and written information and written informed consent to participate, in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the Local Ethical Committee of Central Denmark Region (M-20110035) and registered at clinical trials (NTC01320449). This study is part of a larger study where the effects of erythropoietin and endurance training on skeletal muscle and whole body metabolism have been compared [7, 13, 16, 17]. The subjects were in a single-blind, crossover design randomized to receive placebo and rHuEpo on two occasions with a 14-day wash-out period in-between. On the experimental days, the subjects arrived fasting (from 10\u00a0pm the evening before, water allowed) at the clinical research unit in the morning. Placebo (saline) or rHuEpo (Epoietin alpha, Eprex, 400\u00a0IU/kg) were administered i.v. and subcutaneous fat biopsies were collected 1\u00a0h post administration from the abdomen by liposuction under local anesthesia. Fat biopsies were cleaned from blood, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at\u00a0\u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until further analysis. The experiments were performed under thermo neutral conditions (21\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C). Only subjects fulfilling the following criteria were included in the study: maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) below 50\u00a0ml/min/kg, age between 18 and 35, body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29\u00a0kg/m2, normal blood pressure <135/85, and a hematocrit <45\u00a0%. The subjects were randomly assigned to either a placebo group (saline, n\u2009=\u20099) or an Epo group (n\u2009=\u20099). The subjects were in a single blinded manner treated with either an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) (Darbepoietin-\u03b1, Aranesp, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) or placebo (saline) for 10\u00a0weeks. ESA/placebo were administrated subcutaneously once weekly and the ESA dose was 40\u00a0\u03bcg for the first 3\u00a0weeks and 20\u00a0\u03bcg for the remaining 7\u00a0weeks as previously detailed. Subcutaneous fat biopsies were collected from the abdomen with liposuction under local anesthesia, before and after the 10\u00a0weeks treatment. The biopsies were cleaned for blood, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at\u00a0\u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until further analysis. The procedure was performed under thermo neutral conditions (21\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C). The participants were instructed to refrain from hard physical activity, alcohol intake, or dietary changes 3\u00a0days prior to collection of the biopsies. On the day of biopsy collection the subjects arrived at the clinical research unit after an overnight fast (water intake allowed). During the study period the participants were informed not to change their level of physical activity or dietary habits. Subcutaneous WAT from the subjects in the acute study (placebo treatment), bone marrow, and K-562 cells were used for RNA extraction using TRIzol (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Roskilde, Denmark) and homogenized with 1 tungsten bead (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) using a Mixer Mill. RNA was quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280\u00a0nm using a NanoDrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Pierce, Waltham, ME, USA). Integrity of the RNA was checked by visual inspection of the 2 ribosomal RNAs on an agarose gel. cDNA was synthesized using a Verso cDNA kit (cat# Ab-1453, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with random hexamer primers. The levels of Epo receptor mRNA was investigated, b2microglobolin were used as housekeeping gene. For\u00a0Epo receptor PCR a RealTime ready Assay (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, 9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN 46250-0414 USA) was used. In this assay the following primers were used: Epo-R: 5\u2032-GCATTGCTGATTTTGTCTGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AAATACTGCAAGGTTGTGGTTTC-3\u2032 together with a small Universal hydrolysis probe substituted with Locked Nucleic Acids from Roche (no152). No amplification was observed in negative control tubes (without reverse transcription or with only water). The b2microglobulin PCR was performed as a SYBR-Green assay using KAPA SYBR\u00ae FAST qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc. Woburn, MA, USA) with primers: 5\u2032-GAGGCTATCCAGCGTACTCC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AATGTCGGATGGATGAAACCC-3\u2032. The PCR-reactions were performed in duplicate in a LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) using the following protocol: EPO-receptor assay: One step at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min., then 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s., 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s., and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 11\u00a0s. b2microglobulin assay: One step at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min., then 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s., 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0s., and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s, and finally a melting curve analysis was performed (for the b2microglobulin assay). The increase in fluorescence was measured in real time during the extension step. The relative gene expression was estimated using the default \u201cAdvanced Relative Quantification\u201d mode of the software version LCS 480 1.5.0.39 (Roche Applied Science). Approximately 100\u00a0mg subcutaneous fat tissue was homogenized in homogenization buffer (Acute study: 20\u00a0mM HEPES, 10\u00a0mM NaF, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 5\u00a0% SDS, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Soybean trypsin inhibitor, 4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Leupepsin, 0.1\u00a0mM Benzamidine, 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Antipain, and 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Pepstatin; Prolonged study: 50\u00a0mM HEPES, 20\u00a0mM NaF, 2\u00a0mM Na3VO4, 5\u00a0mM EDTA, 5\u00a0% SDS, HALT, 5\u00a0mM NAM, 10\u00a0\u03bcM TSA) on a Precellys 24 (Bertin technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). Hereafter, samples were thermo mixed at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 500-1000\u00a0rpm for 1\u00a0h, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 20\u00a0min at room temperature. The homogenate was carefully separated from the lipid layer by a syringe, snap frozen, and centrifuged again, in order to purify the homogenate even further. The homogenate was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until further analysis. In short, western blotting was performed as follows; 10\u00a0\u03bcl homogenate was loaded onto a 4\u201315\u00a0% SDS gel (Criterion TGX stain-free gels, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), followed by electro blotting onto a PVDF membrane. The stain-free technology was used to ensure equal loading. Membranes were blocked with 2.5\u00a0% skimmed milk for 2\u00a0h before the primary antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The following primary antibodies were used: From Cell signaling, Danvers, MA, USA; phospho-LYN (Thr507) (#2731), LYN (#2732), phospho-Akt (Ser473) (#9271), phospho-Akt (Thr308) (#9275), pan-Akt (#4691), phospho-p70S6k (Thr389) (#9205), p70S6k (#9202), phospho-STAT5 (Thr694) (#9359), STAT5 (#9358), phospho-p38MAPK (Thr180/Thr182) (#9211), p38MAPK (#9212), phospho-HSL (Ser660, corresponding to Ser650 in humans) (#4126), phospho-HSL (Ser563, corresponding to Ser552 in humans) (#4139), phospho-HSL (Ser565, corresponding to Ser554 in humans) (#4137), HSL (#4107), ATGL (#2138), HSP60 (#12165), SDHA (#11998), PDH (#3205), VDAC (#4661), phosphor-AMPK\u03b1 (Thr172) (#2531), and PKA (#9624), from Abcam, Cambridge, UK; CGI-58 (#ab183739), anti-\u03b2-actin (#ab8227), and G0S2 (#ab80353), from Novus bio, Littleton, CO, USA; Cidea (#NB100-94219), from Abnova, Atlanta, GA, USA; Cidec (#H00063924-M07), from Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany; AMPK\u03b1 pan (#07-181) and phospho-ACC (Ser79) (#07-303), from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA; anti-Epo-R (#A82), from Southernbiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA: HRP streptavidin (#7100-05), from Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA; G0S2 (#sc-133424), and from Pierce antibody production, Thermo scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Perilipin (#PA1-1052). Following several washes, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody (donkey-anti-rabbit IgG, #NA934, Amersham, GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA/goat-anti-rabbit IgG, #sc-2054, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence detection system (Super signal dura extended duration substrate, Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA/Clarity Western ECL substrate, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA #170-2054) using a ChemiDocTM MP imaging system (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Precision Plus Protein All Blue Prestained Protein Standard (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA #1610373) was used as molecular weight marker. To evaluate adipocyte morphology, selected WAT biopsies from the prolonged study was fixed in cold (4\u00a0\u00b0C) 4\u00a0% formaldehyde (pH\u00a07.0) for 2\u00a0days and embedded in paraffin, after which sections of 3\u00a0\u03bcm were obtained. After de-waxing and rehydration, the sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and examined under an Olympus light microscope (Olympus BX50). Due to a low sample size and non-normally distributed data, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test for treatment effect on intracellular signaling in the acute study. Results are shown as median and 25\u00a0% and 75\u00a0% percentiles. A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze results from the prolonged study, QQ-plots and plots of residuals vs. the fitted values checked normality, and data were log-transformed when not normally distributed. The level of significance was set to p\u2009<\u20090.05. Results are presented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE. Statistical analyses were made in STATA version 12 (StataCorp, Collage Station, TX, USA) and graphical presentations were made in Sigmaplot version 11.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). Epo-R mRNA was detected in WAT from all subjects (average ct level of 29.0\u00a0cycles), as well as in the positive K-562 cells (ct level of 29.6\u00a0cycles). A slightly lower level of Epo-R mRNA was observed in bone marrow (average ct level of 29.3\u00a0cycles) (Fig.\u00a01a). No band corresponding to the Epo-R (59kD) was identified in any of the fat biopsies or the negative control 769-P cells (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA), however a band was identified in the two positive controls, K-562 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and UT-7/Epo cells (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) (Fig.\u00a01b\u2009+\u2009c). Western blot analysis was used to measure phosphorylation levels of pertinent proteins indicative of Epo-R activation and signaling. Phosphorylation levels were measured 1\u00a0h post placebo/rHuEpo treatment. Neither p-Akt (Thr308, p\u2009=\u20090.915; Ser473, p\u2009=\u20090.244), p-STAT5 (p\u2009=\u20090.309), p-p70s6k (p\u2009=\u20090.405), p-LYN (p\u2009=\u20090.245), or p-p38MAPK (p\u2009=\u20090.735) levels were significantly different between placebo and rHuEpo treatment (Fig.\u00a02). Acute rHuEpo administration did not induce any differences in the phosphorylation levels of p-HSL (Ser563, p\u2009=\u20090.259; Ser565, p\u2009=\u20090.892; Ser660, p\u2009=\u20090.480), p-ACC (p\u2009=\u20090.132), p-Perilipin (p\u2009=\u20090.295), or p-AMPK (p\u2009=\u20090.665). Furthermore, total protein levels of G0S2 (p\u2009=\u20090.276) did not change (Fig.\u00a03). Changes in both phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a04) and total protein levels (Fig.\u00a05) of proteins involved in lipolysis in adipose tissue after prolonged treatment with ESA were evaluated. We did not record changes in any of the proteins analyzed (two-way ANOVA, interactions p\u2009>\u20090.05, time effects p\u2009>\u20090.05, ESA effects p\u2009>\u20090.05). Selected WAT sections after prolonged treatment with ESA were stained with haematoxylin/Eosin in order to evaluate WAT morphology and visually evaluate adipocyte size. Biopsies from 2 subjects in each group were evaluated (Fig.\u00a06), the morphology appeared normal and adipocyte size did not change substantially during the 10\u00a0weeks of placebo/ESA treatment. Different mitochondrial proteins (VDAC, HSP90, PDH, and SDHA) were measured before and after prolonged ESA treatment in order to evaluate mitochondrial protein content, as an indirect measure of mitochondrial biogenesis. None of these proteins changed in response to prolonged ESA treatment (Fig.\u00a07). The level of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was also measured as a marker of BAT in the human subcutaneous adipose biopsies. A band corresponding to UCP1 was detected in rat BAT but not in our human WAT biopsies (data not shown). Previous studies in mice have shown significant effects of Epo treatment on adipose tissue lipolysis and total body weight. In human studies, FFA levels is increased both after acute and prolonged rHuEpo/ESA treatment [6, 7]. However, the current study did not confirm either acute or prolonged effects of rHuEpo/ESA treatment on adipose tissue lipases and signaling pathways involved in the regulation of lipolysis. Mouse WAT contains a sizable amount of Epo-R mRNA, and Epo treatment associates with phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, mice lacking the Epo-R in non-hematopoietic tissues exhibit significantly reduced phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK, ERK42/44, and PPAR\u03b3. Furthermore, phosphorylation of ERK42/44, p38MAPK, and PPAR\u03b3 in preadipocytes does not depend on Epo-R expression under normal culture conditions, but during adipocyte differentiation the expression of Epo-R increases in concomitance with increased phosphorylation of ERK42/44, p38MAPK, PPAR\u03b3, Akt, and STAT5 [2, 19]. In our human study, we detected higher Epo-R mRNA levels in WAT than in bone marrow and than previously found in human skeletal muscle. However, we were not able to measure any Epo-R protein in subcutaneous WAT and no evidence of pertinent signaling cascades related to the Epo-R after acute Epo exposure. Species and dosing differences could be an explanation for these conflicting results. The direct effects of Epo on lipolysis in WAT have not previously been investigated. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) converts triglycerides (TG) to diacylglycerol, and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) hydrolyses diacylglycerol to monoacylglycerol, in the process of converting TG to FFA. HSL and ATGL were not affected by rHUEpo/ESA treatment in the current studies. ATGL is primarily activated by protein-protein interaction with the co-activator comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58). G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) is identified as an inhibitor of ATGL. Inhibition by G0S2 appears to be dominant to activation by CGI-58 [22, 23]. In the current study, prolonged ESA treatment did not affect protein levels of CGI-58., nor did G0S2 change after acute or prolonged rHuEpo/ESA treatment. Different lipid droplet proteins are involved in the regulation of lipolysis. Perilipin (PLIN1) regulates the activity of ATGL and HSL and their access to lipid substrates in the lipid droplet. Cidea and Cidec are negative regulators of lipolysis and promote lipid droplet stabilization and inhibit lipolysis by providing a barrier around the lipid core. No alteration in PLIN1 or Cidea/Cidec was found in the current study. Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC) is involved in the regulation of beta-oxidation. In its active state ACC catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which inhibits beta-oxidation. Phosphorylation levels of ACC were not altered in the current studies. Insulin also affects lipolysis, with increased insulin levels inhibiting lipolysis and stimulating lipogenesis. Insulin levels were not altered in response to either acute or prolonged rHuEpo/ESA treatment [6, 7]. In addition, ESA treatment did not result in a visual reduction in adipocyte morphology evaluated from haematoxylin/eosin staining. It cannot be excluded that Epo can affect lipolysis in other indirect ways not evaluated in the current study. High-dose Epo treatment to mice leads to pronounced reductions in body weight and knock-down of the Epo-R in non-hematopoietic tissues leads to dramatic elevations in WAT amount [2, 9]. In contradiction, specific knock-down of the Epo-R in mice adipose tissue did not affect either body weight or body composition. In support hereof, in the current prolonged human study we did not observe any changes in weight or body composition. Recently it was shown that Epo treatment leads to increased AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation both in preadipocytes and in WAT from diet-induced obese mice. The increased AMPK\u03b1 activity changed the NAD+/NADH ratio resulting in activation of Sirt1 followed by increased deacetylation of PGC-1\u03b1. Thus, Epo could through activation of the AMPK\u03b1-Sirt1-PGC-1\u03b1 pathway acts as an energy sensor and modulate cellular redox state and energy homeostasis in adipocytes. In the current study, AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation was not altered 1-h post rHuEpo administration. Alterations in body weight and the amount of WAT could also be due to alterations in energy expenditure. In a mouse model, Epo was shown to affected activity levels, total oxygen consumption, and respiratory quotient (RQ). The authors speculated that Epo could directly stimulate the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus to induce \u03b1-melanocyt-stimulating hormone production that exerts direct effects on food intake and energy homeostasis. In support of this, adipose tissue specific deletion of Epo-R in mice did not significantly alter whole-body energy expenditure or RQ values. Resting energy expenditure significantly increased in the current studies, and fat oxidation tended to be increased in relation to rHuEpo treatment [6, 7]. The effect of Epo on POMC was not measured in our human studies, hence, we cannot conclude on the neurological effects. Diet-induced obese mice treated with EPO exhibit increased CytC, Cpt1, and PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA levels indicating an increased mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, Epo stimulation increases citrate synthase activity and fatty acid oxidation in both adipocytes and WAT from diet-induced obese mice. Thus, Epo seems to increase cellular mitochondrial respiration and oxidative metabolism beyond its effects on increased oxygen transport in these animal studies. However, prolonged ESA treatment to humans did not support the hypothesis that ESA should induce alterations in mitochondrial content in humans. In contradiction to WAT, BAT does not respond to Epo treatment in mice models. However, Epo treatment seems to promote a BAT-like phenotype in WAT in mice with increased gene expression of e.g. Cidea, UCP1, UCP3, PPAR\u03b1, and PGC-1\u03b1, resulting in mitochondrial biogenesis and increased uncoupled respiration. In the current study, UCP1, Cidea and Cidec protein levels were not significantly altered after 10\u00a0weeks of ESA treatment, thus, ESA treatment does not seem to induce browning of WAT in humans. In contrast to alluring data in mice model, the present human studies do not support direct effects of Epo on adipose tissue lipases and signaling pathways involved in the regulation of lipolysis. Although Epo-R mRNA was detected in human WAT samples, this did not translate into detectable Epo-R protein, which is compatible with the absence of evidence of Epo-R signaling. However, it has to be acknowledged that the sample size in the current study is small and the variation substantial.

In 5 mM glucose medium, we observed a stepwise activation of oxidative metabolism during cell differentiation that was characterized by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1)\u2013dependent stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, with concomitant reduction of the glycolytic enzyme content. Conversely, when podocytes were cultured in high glucose (20 mM), stepwise oxidative phosphorylation biogenesis was aborted, and a glycolytic switch occurred, with consecutive lactic acidosis. Expression of the master regulators of oxidative metabolism transcription factor A mitochondrial, PGC-1\u03b1, AMPK, and serine\u2013threonine liver kinase B1 was altered by high glucose, as well as their downstream signaling networks. Focused transcriptomics revealed that myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) and myogenic factor 5 (MYF5) expression was inhibited by high glucose levels, and endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNA\u2013mediated combined inhibition of those transcription factors phenocopied the glycolytic shift that was observed in high glucose conditions. Accordingly, a reduced expression of MEF2C, MYF5, and PGC-1\u03b1 was found in kidney tissue sections that were obtained from patients with diabetic nephropathy. These findings obtained in human samples demonstrate that MEF2C-MYF5\u2013dependent bioenergetic dedifferentiation occurs in podocytes that are confronted with a high-glucose milieu.\u2014Imasawa, T., Obre, E., Bellance, N., Lavie, J., Imasawa, T., Rigothier, C., Delmas, Y., Combe, C., Lacombe, D., Benard, G., Claverol, S., Bonneu, M., Rossignol, R. High glucose repatterns human podocyte energy metabolism during differentiation and diabetic nephropathy.\n", "fulltext": "One in 2 patients with diabetes suffers from diabetic nephropathy, the leading cause of chronic kidney disease worldwide (1). Previous studies have revealed that glomerular visceral epithelial cells, namely podocytes, could play a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (2\u20135). Podocytes have complex structures, which are known as foot processes, slit diaphragm, and the focal adhesion complex, all of which are altered in diabetic nephropathy (2\u20135). Because a considerable number of mitochondria have been observed in the cell body and in the narrow peripheral foot processes, it is thought that podocytes could be sensitive to an alteration of oxidative metabolism (6, 7). Furthermore, in cases of mitochondrial disorders, podocytes lose the interdigitating foot processes and accumulate dysmorphic mitochondria (8, 9). Such foot process effacement resembles an early morphologic change of diabetic nephropathy (2); therefore, understanding the peculiarities of podocyte energy metabolism, notably in diabetic conditions, could provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and the role of mitochondria (10, 11). We hypothesized that high glucose levels could alter mitochondrial function in human podocytes, as found in pancreatic \u03b2-cells (12), muscle cells (13), adipocytes (14), or neurons (15), which should lead to diabetic complications (16). Because podocytes dedifferentiate in the process of injuries as diabetic nephropathy (17, 18), we investigated podocyte energetics and proteome remodeling during normal differentiation as well as under hyperglycemic stress. Human podocytes, previously described (19), were used in our study. These cells began to differentiate after switching from 33\u00b0 to 37\u00b0C and were fully differentiated 15 d after this switch (19, 20). Podocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium that was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, insulin (10 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France), transferrin (5.5 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), selenium (5 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and penicillin-streptomycin 1X (100\u00d7; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), with 5 mM glucose from d 0 (day of temperature switch) to d 7 (7 d after temperature switch). We confirmed that podocytes at d 15 expressed nephrin, podocin, and podocalyxin by Western blot. To observe mitochondrial network morphology, MitoTracker Red CMXRos 100 nM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to culture medium and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 25 min (21). Endogenous cellular oxygen consumption rate was monitored in intact podocytes at 37\u00b0C in a 1-ml thermostatically controlled chamber (1.0 \u00d7 107 cells/ml/run) that was equipped with a Clark oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, United Kingdom). Endogenous respiratory rate was expressed in nanomolar O2 per min per 105 cells. Data were collected from 3 independent flasks for each condition. Podocytes were collected and resuspended in culture medium at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 105 cells/ml. Cell suspension (0.1 ml/tube) was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min with or without 5 \u03bcl of 100 mM antimycin (Sigma-Aldrich) to block mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. After incubation, cells were treated with a cell lysis buffer (ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and ATP content that was released into the medium was measured by bioluminescence (21). ATP produced by mitochondria was calculated as the total ATP content minus the ATP content measured in the presence of antimycin. Cell culture medium was deproteinized with a 10-kDa MW cut-off spin filter to remove lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate concentration was determined by using an enzymatic assay (Lactate Assay Kit; Sigma-Aldrich). We measured the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1). After collecting cultured podocytes, total DNA was extracted by using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized in a 20-\u03bcl volume using 1 \u03bcg total RNA, with 50 units of M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H\u2212) and Oligo d(T)16 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time quantitative PCR for nuclear DNA, mtDNA, and PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA was performed by using IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) on a thermocycler CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad), as previously described (22). Normalized units to the endogenous references (RPLP0 and GUSB) were calculated by using the CFX Manager Software program (Bio-Rad). All assays were performed in 200 \u00b5l of Tp II:Mannitol buffer (225 mM mannitol, 75 mM saccharose, 10 mM TrisHCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2). All results were normalized by protein concentration (BCA protein assay; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). We determined several respiratory chain complexes (complex III and IV) and citrate synthase enzymatic activities, as previously described (23). Western blot was performed as previously described (22) by using the following antibodies: PGC-1\u03b1 (P-19; sc-5815, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1; ab55744, 1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM; ab119684, 1:500; Abcam), AMPK (2532, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), phospho-AMPK-\u03b1 for the detection of endogenous AMPK\u03b1 only when phosphorylated at threonine 172 (2531, 1:1000: Cell Signaling Technology), serine\u2013threonine liver kinase B1 (LKB1; ab15095, 1:100; Abcam), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; ab87540, 1:200; Abcam). Changes in reactive oxygen species levels were monitored by using the CM-H2DCFDA probe (C6827; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were plated in 96 wells (20,000 cells/well). The probe was added to cell medium and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Of H2O2, 10 \u00b5l was used a positive control. Fluorescence was measured on a Xenius Spectrofluorometer (Safas, Monaco, France). This analysis was performed by the proteomic facility of Bordeaux University (http://www.cgfb.u-bordeaux2.fr/en/synthese-proteome). The steps of sample preparation and protein digestion, nano-scale liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry analysis, and database search and results processing were performed as previously described (24). Label-free quantitative data analysis was performed by using Progenesis Liquid Chromatography\u2013Tandem Mass Spectrometry 4.0 software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, United Kingdom). Data processing included the following steps: 1) feature detection, 2) feature alignment, 3) volume integration for 2\u20136 charge-state ions, 4) normalization of the total protein abundance, 5) import of sequence information, 6) ANOVA test at the peptide level and filtering for features P < 0.05, 7) calculation of protein abundance (sum of the volume of corresponding peptides), and 8) ANOVA test at the protein level and filtering for features P < 0.05. Of note, only nonconflicting features and unique peptides were considered for calculation at the protein level. We selected proteins that showed >20% change in their expression levels with statistical significance (P < 0.05) between 2 groups (n = 3 in each group). Furthermore, these proteins were categorized according to their functions by using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis in the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins (STRING) database (http://string-db.org). A more global analysis of the data was performed via use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen). In this study, we used 2 different quantitative PCR microarrays: Human Glucose Metabolism RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen) and Human Transcription Factors RT2 Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen). At d 12, we transfected cells with endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNA (esiRNA) under 4 conditions: esiRNA enhanced green fluorescent protein, esiRNA myogenic factor 5 (MYF5), esiRNA myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), and esiRNA MYF5 plus MEF2C. Human esiRNA from Sigma-Aldrich and Dharmafect transfection reagent provided by Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Lafayette, CO, USA) were used. We prepared 5 \u00b5M esiRNA solutions in serum-free medium, mixed them with Dharmafect transfection reagent, and incubated them at room temperature for 20 min. Then, antibiotic-free complete medium was added for a final esiRNA concentration of 25 nM. We removed the medium in flasks and added the appropriate esiRNA solution for each condition. Podocytes were cultured in 5 mM glucose. At d 15, protein from podocytes was extracted. Kidney biopsied tissues from 5 patients with diabetic nephropathy and 5 normal participants were used in this study. Primary antibodies were PGC-1\u03b1 (P-19; sc-5815; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and pyruvate kinase muscle type 2 (PKM2; D78A4; #4053; Cell Signaling Technology), as well as MYF5 (C-20, sc-302; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and MEF2C (ab191428; Abcam). Numbers of PKM2-positive podocytes per glomerulus were counted. In addition, we calculated mean percentages of PGC-1\u03b1-, MYF5-, and MEF2C-positive nuclei of total nuclei per glomeruli; more than 10 glomeruli per patient were counted in these analyses. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Chiba-East Hospital. Upon induction of podocyte differentiation (19, 20), cell morphology changed from a small, circular cell to a reticulated one, which became mature at d 15. The size of the mitochondrial network also increased progressively (Fig. 1A). Oxygen consumption rate (Fig. 1B) increased significantly during cell differentiation (P < 0.01, ANOVA analysis), with an increment factor of 2.2 after 15 d of growth in 5 mM glucose medium. Cellular ATP content (Fig. 1C) also increased between d 0 and 15 (P < 0.05, ANOVA analysis), and this increase was attributed to oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos), but not glycolysis (Fig. 1D\u2013F). Accordingly, the amount of mtDNA increased during differentiation (Fig. 1G). Likewise, PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA levels increased significantly (Fig. 1H), with a factor of 2.7 between d 0 and 15. In addition, NRF-1 and TFAM mRNA expression also increased by factors of 1.5 and 4.2, respectively (Fig. 1I, J). To investigate the molecular changes in podocytes undergoing differentiation, we compared the proteome between d 0\u20133, 3\u20137, and 7\u201315 (Table 1). Approximately 8% of the proteins whose expression levels changed within those 3 periods belonged to mitochondria. Among proteins that increased between d 0\u20133 and 3\u20137 (Fig. 2A, B), the proteasome comprised the largest population (>30 proteins). Then, >10 proteins associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, oxphos, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle also increased during both periods. From d 7\u201315 (Fig. 2C), a considerable number of proteins (>40) that were associated with ribosome biogenesis and function increased, which suggested an intense phase of protein translation and cellular reprogramming. In particular, enzymes that were involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (>20 proteins), oxphos (>15 proteins), branched-chain amino acid degradation (>10 proteins), and the TCA cycle (>10 proteins) increased their content by a factor above +20% (P < 0.05). Components of oxphos did not increase simultaneously during the 3 phases of differentiation introduced above (Table 2). Subunits of respiratory chain complex IV and V were increased at later stages compared with complex I. In particular, synthesis of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits of the F1 catalytic-domain of the F1F0ATP synthase complex was increased at the final stages of podocyte differentiation (Table 2 and Fig. 2E). Proteomic analysis also revealed that most glycolytic enzymes were decreased during podocyte differentiation (Table 2). In accordance with an oxidative shift, proteins that were involved in the fueling of oxphos with fatty acid, amino acids, or ketones were also up-regulated (Table 2). Premature podocytes that were cultured from d 7 to 15 in media with 8 different glucose concentrations showed an increase in lactate levels (Fig. 3A) that was suggestive of a glycolytic switch. Although hyperglycemia is clinically observed when glucose concentration ranges above 7 mM, diabetes symptoms do not typically become noticeable until 15\u201320 mM. To mimic this situation, we conducted in vitro studies with 20 mM glucose. Podocyte dependency on oxphos for cellular ATP production was decreased in high glucose (HG; 20 mM), whereas that of glycolysis increased compared with podocytes cultured in normal glucose (5 mM; Fig. 3B). This metabolic switch was explained, in part, by a reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis, as PGC-1\u03b1, NRF-1, and TFAM expression as well as mtDNA content were reduced in HG conditions (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, activity of citrate synthase, an indicator of mitochondrial active content, was also decreased in those conditions (Fig. 3C). We performed a differential proteomic analysis between podocytes that were grown in 20 mM (HG) or those grown in 5 mM glucose (normal glucose) between d 7 15. Thirty-one mitochondrial proteins were decreased in podocytes that were cultured under HG (Table 1). Oxphos was severely impacted, with >10 proteins reduced. Key components of intermediate metabolism, such as glutaminolysis or TCA cycle, were altered (Table 2). On the one hand, at the level of the respiratory chain, key components of complexes III, IV, and V were decreased (Table 2), as well as key components of ADP phosphorylation, such as ATPsynthase (Fig. 2E), ANT2, and the mitochondrial phosphate carrier. Measurement of respiratory chain enzyme activities confirmed a reduction for complexes III and IV (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, the content of 5 glycolytic enzymes was increased in HG conditions (Table 2). Lactate dehydrogenase A was also increased in HG (+48%), which was consistent with the elevated lactate production described in Fig. 3A. Lastly, proteomic analysis showed that antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (+86%), glutathione S transferase (+65%), glutathione S transferase \u03c9 1 (+21%), thioredoxin reductase (+59%), and peroxredoxin 2 (+51%) were increased in hyperglycemia. This could be consecutive to the higher steady-state of H2O2 levels that were measured in the HG conditions (Fig. 3E). First, we observed an alteration of the LKB1-AMPK pathway\u2014a master regulator of oxphos\u2014in podocytes that were grown under HG conditions (Fig. 3F). Analysis of the mRNA content of 84 genes that are involved in glucose metabolism (Fig. 4A) also showed that hyperglycemia stimulated glycolysis but also activated expression of the oxphos inhibitor, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) (25). Search for potential transcription factors involved in metabolic reprogramming induced by hyperglycemia (Fig. 4B) showed a decrease in MEF2C and MYF5. A previous study revealed that MEF2C controls the expression of numerous components of oxidative metabolism, notably PGC-1\u03b1 (26). Accordingly, the concomitant down-regulation of MEF2C and MYF5 by using esiRNA in human podocytes triggered a significant down-regulation of respiratory chain complex IV (Fig. 4C) and PGC1-\u03b1 (Fig. 4D). In these conditions, dual inhibition of MEF2C and MYF5 also altered podocin expression (Fig. 4E). Of note, use of a single esiRNA against MEF2C or MYF5 alone did not change the levels of complex IV, PGC-1\u03b1, or podocin (Fig. 4C\u2013E). Such a cooperative effect between MEF2C and MYF5 was previously described for the synergistic transactivation of a myogenin (27). We further observed that MEF2C controlled MYF5 expression (Fig. 4F), whereas the opposite did not occur (data not shown). In addition to energy metabolism and the role of MEF2C-MYF5 cooperation in reducing PGC-1\u03b1 and oxphos, changes in the cellular signaling pathways of podocytes challenged with HG are listed in Table 3. As discussed above, NRF-2\u2013mediated oxidative stress response was identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software as activated under HG conditions, as well as glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Because proteomics showed up-regulation of the glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 podocyte, under HG (Table 2), and given the role of this enzyme in anabolic glycolysis (28), we measured PKM2 expression in human kidney sections (Fig. 5). Intense labeling was found in podocytes and Bowman\u2019s capsules in glomeruli, and PKM2-positive podocytes were significantly more numerous in diabetic kidney patients (Fig. 5). Furthermore, expression of MYF5 and MEF2C, which were detected as decreased transcriptomic factors in our in vitro study, was significantly decreased in patients with diabetic nephropathy (Fig. 5). Likewise, intensities of PGC-1\u03b1 expression were also down-regulated in samples from patients with diabetic nephropathy (Fig. 5). Mitochondria are increasingly recognized as key players in acquired renal diseases (29), and Reidy et al. (30) recently reviewed their role in diabetic kidney disease initiation. In the present study, we described the metabolic reprogramming of human podocytes that are confronted with HG levels and we demonstrated the role of MEF2C and MYF5 in the glycolytic switch. Our work has implications for the fundamental understanding of human podocyte differentiation, but also for the study of diabetic nephropathy, as we could validate some of the in vitro findings on human kidney samples that were obtained from patients with diabetes. Regarding the analysis of the determinants of podocyte differentiation, our study has relevance as podocyte dedifferentiation may occur in the context of podocyte injuries (17, 18). Moreover, previous analyses of the alteration of mitochondrial bioenergetics were performed in diabetic podocytes that were obtained from rats and mice, which could differ from human podocytes (31, 32) or between different mouse strains (33). Moreover, the situation is unclear in mice podocytes, as Wang et al. (34) reported an alteration of oxphos by hyperglycemia, whereas other authors showed the opposite (10, 35). In contrast with mice or rat podocyte studies, our data were obtained from human podocytes and from kidney sections from patients with diabetic nephropathy. A novel finding of our study is that MEF2C and MYF5 were involved in the bioenergetic dedifferentiation of human podocytes toward oxphos, and that hyperglycemia altered these transcription factors. In addition, we described a sequential change in the energetic machinery without precedent. We found that glycolytic enzymes are immediately repressed when podocyte differentiation occurs and that respiratory chain proteins increase in a specific order. In particular, the components of the F1F0-ATP synthase complex are only built up when the rest of the machinery has been produced, which could potentially be to avoid hydrolysis of glycolytic ATP by this complex. A recent study showed that the respiratory chain complex III assembly depends on the energy state of mitochondria (36); thus, feedback mechanisms could also control synthesis of ATP synthases and the overall maturation of oxphos. Another feature of podocyte differentiation resides in the stimulation of oxidative fueling processes. Fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids are excellent fuels for oxphos in skeletal muscle and the heart, and our findings suggest that those energy substrates could also play an important role in podocyte physiology (37). Our findings indicate that onset of oxphos that was observed during normal podocyte differentiation (5 mM glucose) required expression of both MEF2C and MYF5, but also that of TFAM, NRF-1, and PGC-1\u03b1 (38). The second part of our work focused on the toxic effect of HG levels (in vitro) and of hyperglycemia (in vivo) on podocyte bioenergetic apparatus. Podocytes that were exposed to 20 mM glucose not only aborted the bioenergetic differentiation process discussed above, but they also shifted to a different program that favored glycolysis (bioenergetic dedifferentiation). Ateration in mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase subunits might impact mitochondrial structure (39), dynamics, and function (40) in podocytes, thereby leading to foot process effacement as an early pathologic change in diabetic nephropathy (2). Of interest, knockdown of MEF2C and MYF5 also triggered the reduction of podocin expression in our in vitro study, which suggested a more global dedifferentiation process caused by hyperglycemia. Glycolytic switch observed in podocytes that were grown in 20 mM glucose resembles the Warburg effect described in cancer cells wherein a reduction of PGC-1\u03b1 content and mitochondrial biogenesis was previously reported (41). Increase in oxidative stress triggered by HG growth conditions in our in vitro study also correlates with the consequences of hyperglycemia in humans (42). In different models, mechanisms of HG-mediated reactive oxygen species increase involved the alteration of mitochondrial respiration (43), which suggested the importance of restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics in this disease. In our study, human podocytes that were confronted with HG showed an increase in oxidative stress despite up-regulation of several antioxidant defenses proteins. In patients with diabetes, advanced glycation end products that induced increased oxidative stress were considered therapeutic targets for using Kremezin and benfotiamine, 2 U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved advanced glycation end product inhibitors (44). Regarding the signaling mechanisms that are involved in hyperglycemia-induced metabolic shift in podocytes, we observed that HG and hyperglycemia reduced the expression of MEF2C, which participates in control of the expression of numerous components of oxidative metabolism, notably PGC-1\u03b1 (41). Previous findings demonstrated the association between MEF2C and the AMPK axis during exercise training in skeletal muscle (45), and our findings revealed that HG altered both the activation of AMPK and the protein content of AMPK activator LKB1 (24, 46, 47). Of interest, we observed that only a combined inhibition of MEF2C and MYF5 expression with esiRNA was required to block the oxphos shift. This could suggest that both transcription factors cooperate at the site of gene transcription to induce expression of target genes. In agreement with our findings, a synergistic transactivation of a myogenin by Myf5 and MEF2 was previously demonstrated (27). The recently identified RNA-binding activity of MYF5 (48) might also suggest the need to conduct further genetic investigations on the collaboration between MEF2C and MYF5. In addition, we observed up-regulation of PDK1, a critical component of the Warburg effect that is capable of shutting down glucose-dependent oxphos in situations of pseudohypoxia (49) or in conditions of high fatty acid and HG intake in pancreatic \u03b2-cells (50). The link between MEF2C and PDK1 remains to be established. Lastly, our signaling study showed that mTOR expression was inhibited in podocytes that were cultured in HG medium, as expected in conditions of LKB1-AMPK axis activation. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that mTOR is activated in podocytes in diabetic nephropathy (51, 52). Recently, mTOR inactivation (52, 53), restoration of the LKB1-AMPK activity (54), and PGC-1\u03b1 activation (55) were proposed as novel potential therapeutic options for diabetic nephropathy. Our findings further suggest that stimulation of MEF2C and MYF5 expression could permit the restoration of podocyte bioenergetics and mitochondrial biogenesis in these conditions."}, "28098423": {"pmid": "28098423", "pmcid": "PMC5345637", "title": "Brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor attenuates doxorubicin\u2010induced cardiac dysfunction through activating Akt signalling in rats", "abstract": "\nAbstract\nThe clinical application of doxorubicin (Dox) is limited by its adverse effect of cardiotoxicity. Previous studies have suggested the cardioprotective effect of brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We hypothesize that BDNF could protect against Dox\u2010induced cardiotoxicity. Sprague Dawley rats were injected with Dox (2.5 mg/kg, 3 times/week, i.p.), in the presence or absence of recombinant BDNF (0.4 \u03bcg/kg, i.v.) for 2 weeks. H9c2 cells were treated with Dox (1 \u03bcM) and/or BDNF (400 ng/ml) for 24 hrs. Functional roles of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiac injury were examined both in vivo and in vitro. Protein level of BDNF was reduced in Dox\u2010treated rat ventricles, whereas BDNF and its receptor tropomyosin\u2010related kinase B (TrkB) were markedly up\u2010regulated after BDNF administration. Brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor significantly inhibited Dox\u2010induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction in rats.

Investigations of the underlying mechanisms revealed that BDNF activated Akt and preserved phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin and Bad without affecting p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase and extracellular regulated protein kinase pathways. Furthermore, the beneficial effect of BDNF was abolished by BDNF scavenger TrkB\u2010Fc or Akt inhibitor. In conclusion, our findings reveal a potent protective role of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiotoxicity by activating Akt signalling, which may facilitate the safe use of Dox in cancer treatment.\n", "fulltext": "Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug in clinical setting 1. Despite successful treatment of various malignancies, Dox\u2010induced dose\u2010dependent progressive myocardial damage seriously limits its clinical usage 2. Doxorubicin\u2010induced cardiotoxicity is characterized by oxidative stress, DNA damage, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis et al. 3, 4, 5. During the past years, many studies were performed to explore the methods for attenuating Dox\u2010induced cardiac dysfunction 6. Several agents have been uncovered to protect against the cardiotoxicity of Dox such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril) 7, \u03b2\u2010blockers (metoprolol, carvediol) 8, 9 and resveratrol 10, 11. Recently, other new measures were developed to mitigate Dox\u2010induced cardiomyopathy 12, 13. For example, mesenchymal stem cells produced promising cardioprotective effects against Dox\u2010induced damage by paracrine of potent cytokines such as migration inhibitory factor and growth differentiation factor\u201015 12. However, the direct effects of those cytokines/growth factor on Dox\u2010induced cardiomyopathy remain largely unknown. Brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most abundant neurotrophins in the mammalian central nervous system that promotes neuronal survival and differentiation 14. Growing studies have documented that BDNF plays crucial roles in the cardiovascular system 15, 16, 17, 18. Among them, two recent studies proved that BDNF modulated the contraction of normal heart 16, 17. Studies by other laboratories and ours demonstrated BDNF could repair injured myocardium by ameliorating endothelial function and inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis 18, 19. Previous studies also found that BDNF repressed neuroblastoma cells from chemotherapy\u2010induced apoptosis by activating its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) 20, 21. However, whether BDNF could attenuate Dox\u2010induced cardiotoxicity remains unclear. PI3K/Akt and mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) are two key intracellular signalling transduction pathways, which participate in various important biological activities such as apoptosis and autophagy 22, 23. Previous studies have illustrated that activation of Akt and downstream signals, for example, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Bad and/or inhibition of p38 MAPK are capable of inhibiting Dox\u2010induced cardiac injury 24, 25, 26. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate determine the therapeutic role of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiotoxicity by regulating Akt or MAPK signals to facilitate their safe use in cancer treatment. All animal experiments were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethic Committee of Harbin Medical University and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (Publication, 8th Edition, 2011). Healthy male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (weight 220 \u00b1 20 g) were provided by Animal Center of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China. The rats have free access to standard rat chow and water and 15 rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham, Dox and BDNF treatment group (5 rats in each group). In Dox group, rats were injected with Dox (2.5 mg/kg, 3 times/week, intraperitoneally) for 2 weeks. In BDNF group, rats were injected with Dox (2.5 mg/kg, 3 times/week, 2 weeks, intraperitoneally) and recombinant human BDNF (0.4 \u03bcg/kg/day) every day for 2 weeks via tail vein. The dose of BDNF referred to previous study 27. For sham rats, equivalent volume of saline was given. All rats were killed at the end of the 2\u2010week treatments after detecting cardiac function, and the hearts were quickly excised in cold buffer. Both left and right ventricles were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for subsequent histological, biochemical and Western blot analysis. Left ventricles were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and then rinsed in buffer, post\u2010fixed in PBS 1% OsO4 for 2 hrs. Then, they were stained by 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin. The sections were electron\u2010stained and observed by electron microscope (JEM\u20101200; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Both left and right ventricular samples were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 \u03bcm thick sections. Then, they were stained with haematoxylin and eosin or Masson trichrome for histological and collagen analysis. The interstitial fibrotic areas were calculated by image analysis software (Image\u2010pro plus 6.0; Meida Cybernetics LP, Washington, USA). Collagen volume fraction (CVF) was calculated as the ratio of collagen area to total area. Cardiac function was measured by Acuson Sequoia 512 Ultrasound System (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). Left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) and left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) were measured, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (FS) were calculated. The concentrations of three enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in both left and right ventricular homogenate were determined using commercial kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). H9c2 cells were cultured in DMEM (high glucose; Corning, Manassas, VA, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were maintained under a water\u2010saturated atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. The cells were exposed to Dox at different concentrations range from 0.3, 1 to 3 \u03bcM for different time\u2010points (6, 24 or 48 hrs), respectively. Recombinant human BDNF (200 and 400 ng/ml) and/or BDNF scavenger TrkB\u2010Fc (4 \u03bcg/ml) were pre\u2010treated 30 min. before Dox treatment in the presence or absence of Akti (0.5 \u03bcM). The effects of Akti and TrkB\u2010Fc in this concentration have been validated in previous work 19, 28. Cell viability was determined by cell counting kit\u20108 (CCK\u20108) kit as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). After stimulation as designated, the supernatant was removed and 100 \u03bcl of DMEM medium containing 10 \u03bcl CCK\u20108 was added. Then, the plate was incubated for 2 hrs in the incubator. The optical density values were read at 450 nm using an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria). For each sample, five parallel experimental wells were used to evaluate the cell viability. In situ Cell Death Detection Kit (TUNEL fluorescence FITC kit; Roche, Indianapolis, USA) was used to examine the apoptosis in rat ventricles and H9c2 cells. After washing with PBS for three times, treated samples were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton x\u2010100 sodium citrate buffer for 2 min. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:30; Beyotime, Haimen, China). Fluorescence staining of ventricles was viewed by Olympus BX\u201060 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) while fluorescence staining of cells was scanned by a laser scanning confocal microscope (FV1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Five high power fields were randomly selected and analysed. The ratio of TUNEL\u2010positive cells per field was calculated by Olympus Fluoview version 2.0a Viewer software. DNA damage was evaluated according to previous study 29. After exposure to Dox in the presence or absence of BDNF, H9c2 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and probed with anti\u2010\u03b3H2AX antibody (Ser139, 20E3; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by fluorescence\u2010labelled secondary antibody. Immunofluorescence images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Annexin\u2010V\u2010FLUOS kit (Roche) was used with procedures described in previous studies 30. Briefly, H9c2 cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml) were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH [pH 7.4], 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2). A total of 5 \u03bcl of AnnexinV\u2010FITC and 10 \u03bcl of 20 \u03bcg/ml PI were then added to the cells, which were analysed with a flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Viable cells were negative for both PI and Annexin V, while apoptotic cells were positive for Annexin V and negative for PI. Late apoptotic dead cells showed both Annexin V and PI positivity. The apoptotic rate was calculated by BD FACSDiva software. Total protein was extracted and separated from both ventricles and H9c2 cells for immunoblotting analysis with the procedures described in our previous work 19. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against BDNF (1:500), TrkB (1:500), p\u2010Akt (1:1000), t\u2010Akt (1:1000), p\u2010mTOR (1:1000), mTOR (1:1000), p\u2010Bad (1:500), Bad (1:1000), p\u2010ERK (1:2000), extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK; 1:1000), p\u2010p38 (1:1000), p38 (1:1000) or GAPDH (1:1000) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with a fluorescence\u2010labelled secondary antibody (LI\u2010COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The images were scanned on the Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging System (LI\u2010COR Biosciences). Western blot bands were quantified using Odyssey CLx v2.1 software and normalized to GAPDH as an internal control. Anti\u2010BDNF and anti\u2010TrkB antibodies were bought from Abclonal (Wuhan, China). Anti\u2010p\u2010Akt (Ser473), anti\u2010t\u2010Akt, anti\u2010p\u2010mTOR, anti\u2010mTOR, anti\u2010p\u2010Bad (Ser136), anti\u2010Bad, anti\u2010p\u2010ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), anti\u2010ERK, anti\u2010p\u2010p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), anti\u2010p38 and anti\u2010\u03b3H2AX (Ser139, 20E3) antibodies were provided by Cell Signaling Technology. Anti\u2010GAPDH antibody was obtained from Kangchen Biotech Co Ltd (Shanghai, China). Doxorubicin was provided by Aladdin Industrial Company (Shanghai, China, purity 98%). Recombinant human BDNF and TrkB\u2010Fc were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Akt inhibitor (Akti) was provided by Sigma\u2010Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All value were presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. and analysed by SPSS17.0 software. Student's t\u2010test was performed for two\u2010group comparisons. One\u2010way anova followed by Dunnet's t\u2010test was used for multiple\u2010group comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Protein expression of BDNF and its receptor TrkB were detected in both left and right ventricles to observe the change in cardiac BDNF/TrkB axis in Dox\u2010treated myocardium and validate the efficiency of BDNF supplement. Figure 1A indicated that protein expression of BDNF was decreased in left ventricles of Dox\u2010treated rats, which was significantly restored after BDNF administration. Meanwhile, protein expression of TrkB was markedly increased by BDNF, although no significance was found between sham and Dox\u2010treated rats (Fig. 1B). Similar results of BDNF and TrkB expression were obtained in right ventricles (Fig. 1C and D). Thus, cardiac BDNF was down\u2010regulated by Dox and was successfully reversed after BDNF injection. Brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor/TrkB axis was activated in BDNF\u2010treated rat hearts. Transmission electron microscopy and haematoxylin and eosin staining were employed to examine the ultrastructural and histological changes of LV myocytes in Dox and BDNF\u2010treated rats. As shown in Figure 2A and D, a clear regular structure was observed in the cardiac muscle fibres of sham rats at different magnifications. However, disorganized myofibres and swollen mitochondria were shown in Dox\u2010treated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2B and E), which was markedly improved by BDNF (Fig. 2C and F). Similarly, haematoxylin and eosin staining results displayed compactly arranged fibres without inter\u2010cellular space in cardiomyocytes of sham rats (Fig. 2G). In contrast, disordered myocardial fibres as well as hypertrophic and oedematous cardiomyocytes were observed in the Dox\u2010treated rats (Fig. 2H), which was significantly reversed by BDNF (Fig. 2I). Thus, these findings together displayed that BDNF mitigated Dox\u2010induced cardiac injury in rat ventricular myocytes. We further detected cardiomyocyte apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis in Dox and BDNF\u2010treated rats. As shown in Figure 3A\u2013F, TUNEL assay was used to detect the effect of BDNF on cardiac apoptosis in Dox\u2010treated rat left ventricles at different magnifications. TUNEL\u2010positive cells in left ventricles were significantly higher in the Dox\u2010treated rats than sham rats, which was markedly reduced by BDNF (Fig. 3G). In addition, the cardimyocytes of sham rats appeared grossly normal under light microscopy. However, obvious interstitial fibrosis was examined in Dox\u2010treated rats. Bundles of myofibres were packed less tightly and were separated by thick layers of fibrous tissue in Dox\u2010treated rats, which was slightly reversed by BDNF (Fig. 3H\u2013J). Statistically, CVF was significantly elevated in Dox\u2010treated rats compared to sham rats but did not significantly changed by BDNF (Fig. 3K). Consistently, the effects of Dox and BDNF on cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis in right ventricles were similar to left ventricles (Fig. S1). It is well known that SOD, MDA and reduced GSH are good indicators of oxidative stress. Therefore, these markers are examined to assess the effects of BDNF on oxidative stress in our study. It was found that BDNF significantly restored antioxidant markers (SOD activity and GSH content) and decreased MDA level in Dox\u2010treated left and right ventricles (Fig. 4A\u2013F). We further validated the salutary role of BDNF in protection of Dox\u2010induced cardiac dysfunction. Echocardiographic data indicated that BDNF significantly ameliorated cardiac function in Dox\u2010treated rats (Fig. 4G). In detail, BDNF markedly increased LVEF and FS (Fig. 4H and I), as well as decreased LVESV and LVEDV (Fig. 4J and K). Therefore, the above findings strongly supported that BDNF protected against Dox\u2010induced oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction. We then examined the role of Akt signals in the anti\u2010apoptotic effect of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiac injury in both left and right ventricles. It was found that protein level of p\u2010Akt was significantly repressed by Dox, which was recovered by BDNF (Fig. 5A) in left rat ventricles. Meanwhile, no significant change in t\u2010Akt was observed among these groups (Fig. 5A). We further detected protein expression of mTOR and Bad, the downstream signal of PI3K/Akt pathway, and found that p\u2010mTOR and p\u2010Bad were inhibited by Dox and was restored by BDNF. In addition, mTOR and Bad protein levels did not change in those three groups (Fig. 5B and C). Consistently, similar results were found in right ventricles (Fig. 5D\u2013F). So, these data supported that Akt regulated mTOR and Bad signals were involved in the protective effect of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiotoxicity. Mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase family members including p38 MAPK and ERK were also examined. We found that protein levels of p\u2010p38 and p\u2010ERK as well as ratios of p\u2010p38/p38 and p\u2010ERK/ERK were increased in Dox rats, however, did not significantly change after BDNF treatment (Fig. 6A and B). Similarly, expression of p38 MAPK and ERK in right ventricles are consistent with findings in left ventricles (Fig. 6C and D). Then, we aimed to validate the effect and mechanisms of BDNF on the cardiotoxicity of Dox in vitro. First, we examined the dose\u2013response of Dox in H9c2 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, the cell viability was markedly reduced by Dox at 1 and 3 \u03bcM for 24 hrs, whereas not significantly changed by 0.3 \u03bcM Dox. Then, we tested the various time\u2010points and found that Dox (1 \u03bcM) treatment for 24 and 48 hrs markedly reduced the cell viability, however, 6 hrs treatment did not significantly reduced the cell viability (Fig. 7B). Accordingly, 1 \u03bcM Dox treatment for 24 hrs were selected for subsequent experiments. Furthermore, we detected the effect of BDNF on cell viability treated with Dox. We found that BDNF (400 ng/ml) significantly reversed cell viability induced by Dox (Fig. 7C). Therefore, BDNF (400 ng/ml) was determined for the following studies. TUNEL assay and flowcytometry were employed to confirm the anti\u2010apoptotic effect of BDNF in Dox\u2010treated H9c2 cells. It was suggested that TUNEL\u2010positive cells dramatically increased in Dox group, which was reversed by BDNF (Fig. 7D and E). Phosphorylated \u03b3H2AX, a sensitive marker of double\u2010stranded DNA break, was employed to assess whether BDNF reduced DNA damage in Dox\u2010treated H9c2 cells (Fig. 7F). Fluorescence intensity of \u03b3H2AX was higher in Dox group than untreated cells, which was limited by BDNF (Fig. 7G). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 8A, the apoptotic rate was increased by Dox, which was attenuated by BDNF (Fig. 8B). Taken together, these findings supported that BDNF protected against Dox\u2010induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. We further confirmed the impact of BDNF on protein expression of Akt in H9c2, and found that BDNF treatment significantly increased p\u2010Akt level without affecting t\u2010Akt level (Fig. 8C and D), which is agreement with previous in vivo results. Then, BDNF blocker TrkB\u2010Fc and Akti were employed to validate the pivotal role of BDNF/TrkB/Akt cascade in beneficial effect of BDNF. The cell viability in BDNF\u2010treated cells was reversed by BDNF scavenger TrkB\u2010Fc or Akti (Fig. 8E). It was also found that the anti\u2010apoptotic effect of BDNF against Dox was significantly restored by TrkB\u2010Fc or Akti (Fig. 8F and G). Collectively, our findings suggest that Akt signal is indispensible for the cardioprotective effect of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiotoxicity. This study mainly found that (i) cardiac BDNF expression was downregulated in Dox\u2010treated rat; (ii) exogenous BDNF inhibited Dox\u2010induced cardiac dysfunction including oxidative stress, DNA damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis by activating Akt signalling and preserving phosphorylation of mTOR and Bad; (iii) BDNF did not affect p38 MAPK and ERK in Dox\u2010treated rat heart. In our previous study, it was found that protein expression of BDNF was increased in response to acute ischaemia for 1 or 6 hrs 19. On the contrary, other study reported that chronic myocardial ischaemia (range from 1 to 14 days) significantly decreased protein level of BDNF with time\u2010dependent manner 15. Besides, plasma BDNF level was elevated in acute myocardial infarction patients 19 while reduced in heart failure patients 31, 32. On the basis of these findings, we speculated that increment of BDNF expression in acute injury was a compensatory mechanism while reduction expression after sustained injury was the outcome of decompensation. In agreement with the above findings, we found that protein level of BDNF in the myocardium of Dox\u2010treated rats was markedly decreased. Exogenous BDNF not only reversed cardiac BDNF expression but also improved Dox\u2010induced cardiac dysfunction. Accordingly, BDNF deficiency is probably the consequence of Dox\u2010induced cardiotoxicity, which was restored after BDNF treatment. It is well known that TrkB is the high\u2010affinity receptor of BDNF, which is indispensable for functional role of BDNF in both neurons 33 and heart 16, 17. Our previous study also confirmed the crucial role of BDNF/TrkB pathway in the heart 19. In this study, we observed the protective effect of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was recovered by TrkB\u2010Fc. In addition, TrkB could induce PI3K activity and leads to Akt activation by phosphorylating Akt at ser473 34. We demonstrated the BDNF/TrkB/Akt axis in the protection of Dox\u2010induced cardiac injury. Once Akt is activated, the phosphorylation of downstream key molecules mTOR and Bad are up\u2010regulated and regulates many important cellular activities including proliferation, growth, survival and angiogenesis. PI3K/Akt pathway was well recognized to promote survival by downregulating pro\u2010apoptotic factors and up\u2010regulating anti\u2010apoptotic factors. Through phosphorylation, PI3K/Akt inhibits the activity of proapoptotic members while activating anti\u2010apoptotic members 35. On the other hand, MAPK family members p38 MAPK and ERK have also been demonstrated participated in Dox\u2010induced cardiac dysfunction 26. In our present study, both p\u2010p38 MAPK and p\u2010ERK were activated by Dox, however, neither of them was affected by BDNF. So, p38 MAPK and ERK were not involved in the protective role of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced injury. Consistently, it has been previously described with effects of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced apoptosis in cancer cells 36. Middlemas et al. reported the beneficial role of BDNF against cytotoxic agents including cisplatin, Dox and topotecan 20. They found that BDNF protected cell against DNA damaging caused by these agents. Moreover, they also speculated that BDNF regulate a common signalling pathway which is required for cell death 20. Similarly, Ho et al. revealed that BDNF/TrkB signalling pathway has a beneficial impact when exposed to DNA\u2010damaging reagents in neuroblastomas. Moreover, they also found that activation of PI3K/Akt survival pathway may contribute to the increased Dox resistance in TrkB\u2010expressing neuroblastomas 21. Lately, another study reported that BDNF has potent cytoprotective effects against Dox\u2010induced injury in pancreatic \u03b2 cells 37. These findings suggest that the protective effect of BDNF may exist in different types of cells. PI3K/Akt pathway phosphorylates many intracellular substrates 38. It has been revealed that BDNF exerted its pro\u2010survival effects by binding TrkB and activating downstream signalling pathways. In particular, TrkB\u2010induced PI3K activity lead to Akt activation and thereby phosphorylated downstream pro\u2010apoptotic targets, including Forkhead and Bad2 39, 40. Moreover, up\u2010regulation of BDNF activated Akt and promotes hippocampal neuronal proliferation in mice by regulating Bcl\u20102 and caspase\u20103 41. Combined ampakine and local delivery of BDNF improved post\u2010stroke functional recovery in aged mice by activating Akt/CREB signalling 42. Here, we validate that phosphorylation of mTOR and Bad are preserved by BDNF in Dox\u2010induced cardiotoxicity. Of course, other signals modulated by BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiac injury could not be excluded, although p38 and ERK were determined. But the present findings strongly suggest that Akt signals are central in the protection of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiac injury. On the other hand, although BDNF has promising effect on cardiomyocyte injury, it should be noted that Dox\u2010induced interstitial fibrosis was not significantly ameliorated by BDNF. Thus, whether BDNF reverses cardiac remodeling in several periods of Dox treatment is interesting to study in the following work. In summary, the findings of this study highlight potential implications of BDNF against Dox\u2010induced cardiac dysfunction, which may enhance our understanding of therapeutic role of neurotrophic factors against chemotherapeutic agents induced cardiotoxicity to facilitate their safe use in cancer treatment. The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest."}, "28279980": {"pmid": "28279980", "pmcid": "PMC5440020", "title": "GLUT4 Is Not Necessary for Overload-Induced Glucose Uptake or Hypertrophic Growth in Mouse Skeletal Muscle", "abstract": "\nGLUT4 is necessary for acute insulin- and contraction-induced skeletal muscle glucose uptake, but its role in chronic muscle loading (overload)-induced glucose uptake is unknown. Our goal was to determine whether GLUT4 is required for overload-induced glucose uptake. Overload was induced in mouse plantaris muscle by unilateral synergist ablation. After 5 days, muscle weights and ex vivo [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake were assessed. Overload-induced muscle glucose uptake and hypertrophic growth were not impaired in muscle-specific GLUT4 knockout mice, demonstrating that GLUT4 is not necessary for these processes. To assess which transporters mediate overload-induced glucose uptake, chemical inhibitors were used. The facilitative GLUT inhibitor cytochalasin B, but not the sodium-dependent glucose cotransport inhibitor phloridzin, prevented overload-induced uptake demonstrating that GLUTs mediate this effect. To assess which GLUT, hexose competition experiments were performed. Overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was not inhibited by d-fructose, demonstrating that the fructose-transporting GLUT2, GLUT5, GLUT8, and GLUT12 do not mediate this effect. To assess additional GLUTs, immunoblots were performed. Overload increased GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and GLUT10 protein levels twofold to fivefold. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GLUT4 is not necessary for overload-induced muscle glucose uptake or hypertrophic growth and suggest that GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and/or GLUT10 mediate overload-induced glucose uptake.\n", "fulltext": "Lifestyle modification, including an increase in physical activity, has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes (1). Resistance exercise training has been specifically recommended due to its ability to reduce fasted blood glucose levels (2,3), fasted blood insulin levels (3), and hemoglobin A1c levels (2\u20134), as well as to increase whole-body glucose disposal (2,5), skeletal muscle mass (2\u20134), and muscle glucose uptake (5). Given the importance of muscle in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis, understanding how resistance training alters muscle glucose metabolism may lead to new treatments for type 2 diabetes.Resistance exercise training is defined as repeated muscle contraction against a load (2\u20135). In rodents, chronic muscle loading (overload) can be achieved via surgical ablation of synergist muscles or tendons (6\u20139), and studies have shown that it rapidly and consistently induces adaptations in skeletal muscle similar to resistance training, such as muscle hypertrophy (6\u20139). In both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant mouse muscle, 3\u20134 days of overload is sufficient to increase muscle mass (30\u201340%) (6\u20138) and glucose uptake (\u223c80%) (6), suggesting that resistance training and overload may use the same cellular mechanisms to regulate muscle metabolism. Unfortunately, these mechanisms are not well understood.GLUT4 is considered to be the main GLUT in skeletal muscle as a number of studies have demonstrated a positive association between GLUT4 protein levels and muscle glucose uptake. In mouse skeletal muscle, overexpression of GLUT4 increased basal (20\u2013300%), insulin-induced (60\u2013200%), and contraction-induced (35%) muscle glucose uptake (10,11). In contrast, muscle-specific loss of GLUT4 decreased basal glucose uptake (70\u201380%) and completely prevented insulin- and contraction-induced muscle glucose uptake (11\u201313). Thus, these findings demonstrate that GLUT4 plays an essential role in mediating skeletal muscle glucose uptake in response to short-term stimulation.In contrast to short-term stimulation, the role of GLUT4 in mediating muscle glucose uptake in response to long-term stimulation, such as resistance training or muscle overload, is less clear. Studies conducted in humans and rodents have demonstrated an increase (5,9,14\u201318) as well as no change (16,18\u201320) in skeletal muscle GLUT4 protein levels in response to resistance training or muscle overload. In addition, previous work in rodent muscle has demonstrated a dissociation between resistance training\u2013induced increases in muscle glucose uptake and GLUT4 protein levels (18), suggesting that another GLUT may be involved. Thus, the role of GLUT4 in mediating resistance training/loading\u2013induced increases in muscle glucose uptake is not clear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether GLUT4 expression is necessary for the long-term adaptation of overload to stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.Plasmids containing mouse GLUT1 (catalog #MR207871), GLUT3 (catalog #MR2097915), GLUT6 (catalog #MR219710), and GLUT10 (catalog #MR227535) and an HEK293 cell GLUT10 overexpression lysate (catalog #LY410718) were purchased from OriGene Technologies. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (catalog #D8375), d-mannitol (catalog #M4125), phloridzin dihydrate (catalog #P3449), cytochalasin B (catalog #C6762), l-glucose (catalog #G5500), d-glucose (catalog #G8270), d-fructose (catalog #F0127), d-galactose (catalog #G0750), and d-xylose (catalog #X3833) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 2-[1,2-3H(N)]-Deoxy-d-glucose (catalog #NET549001MC) and d-[1-14C]-mannitol (catalog #NEC314250UC) were purchased from PerkinElmer.All procedures were performed in accordance with the East Carolina University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were housed in cages at 21\u201322\u00b0C with a 12 h light/dark cycle and fed a standard chow diet (Prolab RMH 3000, catalog #5P00; PMI Nutrition International). Food and water were available ad libitum.Female CD-1 mice (7\u20138 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. GLUT4 LoxP mice were generated as previously described (21) and obtained from Dr. Barbara B. Kahn (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). GLUT4 LoxP mice were bred with muscle creatine kinase Cre recombinase transgenic mice (MCK-Cre+; C57BL/6J strain; The Jackson Laboratory) to generate the following mice: wild-type (WT), GLUT4 LoxP+/\u2212, LoxP+/+ (control), MCK-Cre+ (control), muscle-specific GLUT4 heterozygous (mGLUT4 HET) and muscle-specific GLUT4 knockout (mGLUT4 KO). For these studies, both male and female mGLUT4 KO, mGLUT4 HET, and their WT/control littermates (11\u201312 weeks old) were used.Mice were weighed, and body composition was assessed using an EchoMRI Model 700 Body Composition Analyzer prior to any surgical procedure.In vivo muscle gene transfer/electroporation was performed using methods described by Hinkley et al. (22). Five days post-transfection, muscles were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and processed for immunoblot analyses.Muscle overload was induced via unilateral ablation of synergist muscles using methods described by Ferey et al. (7). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2\u20133%). For plantaris muscle overload, the distal two-thirds of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were ablated. For soleus muscle overload, the distal two-thirds of the gastrocnemius muscle was ablated. A sham surgery was performed on the contralateral leg. After 1, 3, or 5 days (as indicated in the figure legends), mice were fasted overnight, anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (90\u2013100 mg/kg body weight) for 40 min or isoflurane (2\u20133%) for 3\u20135 min, and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Muscles were excised, weighed, and then used to assess [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake or processed for immunoblot analyses.Ex vivo muscle [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was assessed using methods adapted from Hinkley et al. (22). Muscles were preincubated in continuously oxygenated 37\u00b0C Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB) composed of the following (in mmol/L): 117 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2 \u22c5 2H2O, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4 \u22c5 7H2O, and 24.6 NaHCO3, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 mmol/L pyruvate. For glucose uptake, muscles were incubated in KRBB supplemented with 1.5 \u03bcCi/mL [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose, 1 mmol/L 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 0.45 \u03bcCi/mL [14C]-mannitol, and 7 mmol/L mannitol, unless otherwise indicated. All radioactive incubations were conducted at 30\u00b0C for 10 min. Cytochalasin B and phloridzin were added into buffers as described in the figure legends.Hexose competition experiments were performed using methods adapted from Ryder et al. (23). Muscles were preincubated in KRBB plus pyruvate and then incubated in 90% KRBB supplemented with 1.5 \u03bcCi/mL [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose, 1 mmol/L 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 0.45 \u03bcCi/mL [14C]-mannitol, and 35 mmol/L d-fructose, d-galactose, d-glucose, d-xylose, or l-glucose. The osmolarity of the radioactive solution was kept at \u223c310 mOsm by the 10% dilution of the KRBB and the removal of nonradiolabeled mannitol.After radioactive incubations, muscles were frozen in liquid nitrogen, weighed, and solubilized in 1 mol/L NaOH at 80\u00b0C for 15 min. Solubilized muscles were neutralized with 1 mol/L HCl. Nonsoluble particulates were precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000g for 1 min. Aliquots were removed for scintillation counting of the [3H] and [14C] labels, and the extracellular and intracellular spaces calculated to determine [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake.Immunoblot analyses were performed using standard methods as previously described by Hinkley et al. (22) and Ferey et al. (7). Frozen muscles were homogenized in buffer containing the following (in mmol/L): 20 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 EDTA, 10 Na4P2O7, 100 NaF, 2 NaVO4, 0.01 leupeptin, 3 benzamidine, 1 phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1% Tergitol, and 10 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin. Samples were rotated end over end at 4\u00b0C for 60 min and centrifuged at 14,000g for 30 min. Lysate protein concentrations were determined via the Bradford method. Lysates (80 \u03bcg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blocking, primary, and secondary antibody conditions were as described in Table 1. Horseradish peroxide\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies were detected using chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was performed using Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad).Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05 and was determined by Student t tests, one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis. The number of mice or muscles used to determine statistical significance is indicated in the text or figure legends.Previous work demonstrated that muscle-specific loss of GLUT4 led to slight (10\u201315%) or nonsignificant alterations in mouse body weight (11,12,24), and this small difference in phenotype was attributed to the heterogeneity of the background strain (i.e., mixture of C57BL6, 129, and FVB). Consistent with those findings, at the current level of backcross to the C57BL6 strain neither female or male mGLUT4 KO mice exhibited a significant difference in body weight, fat mass, or lean mass compared with WT/controls (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1).To determine whether GLUT4 was necessary for overload-induced muscle hypertrophy, unilateral synergist ablation of the distal two-thirds of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was performed to induce plantaris overload. As shown in Table 2, after 5 days overload-induced muscle hypertrophy was not impaired in female mGLUT4 HET or mGLUT4 KO mice compared with WT/controls. Similar results were obtained in male mice (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, GLUT4 is not necessary for overload-induced muscle growth in either sex.To determine whether GLUT4 was necessary for overload-induced muscle glucose uptake, muscles were incubated in buffer containing [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose. Female mGLUT4 KO mice had significantly lower basal muscle glucose uptake compared with both WT/control and mGLUT4 HET mice, but in response to overload all three groups increased glucose uptake to the same level (Fig. 1A). Thus, the percentage change in muscle glucose uptake in response to overload was enhanced in the mGLUT4 KO mice compared with WT/control and mGLUT4 HET mice (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained in male mice (Supplementary Fig. 1A and B). Thus, GLUT4 is not necessary for overload-induced muscle glucose uptake in either sex.There are two main glucose transporter families in mammalian cells: the solute carrier family 2, which consists of facilitated GLUTs; and the solute carrier family 5, which consists of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLTs). To determine whether overload uses SGLTs or GLUTs to increase glucose uptake, isolated muscles were treated in the short term with the chemical SGLT inhibitor phloridzin or the GLUT inhibitor cytochalasin B, and [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was assessed. As shown in Fig. 2, while phloridzin did not alter glucose uptake (Fig. 2A), cytochalasin B lowered basal and overload-induced glucose uptake compared with vehicle (Fig. 2B). Since the overload-induced increase in muscle mass was the same among the groups (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), these results indicate that GLUTs mediate overload-induced glucose uptake.There are 14 members of the GLUT family found in mammalian cells (GLUT1 to GLUT14). To narrow down the list of GLUT isoforms involved in overload-induced glucose uptake, the isoforms were screened for the following characteristics: 1) presence in the mouse genome, 2) ability to transport 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and 3) inhibition by cytochalasin B. Importantly for this study, previous work has demonstrated that the mouse genome does not possess GLUT11 or GLUT14 (25,26), that neither GLUT7 nor GLUT13 (also known as the H+/myo-inositol transporter) can transport 2-deoxy-d-glucose (27,28), and that [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose transport via GLUT9 is not inhibited by cytochalasin B (29). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GLUT7, GLUT9, GLUT11, GLUT13/H+/myo-inositol transporter, and GLUT14 cannot be part of the mechanism by which overload mediates [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in mouse muscle.Hexose competition experiments have been performed in Xenopus oocytes expressing individual GLUT isoforms (27,30\u201335), and these studies have demonstrated considerable substrate transport heterogeneity among the GLUTs. For example, GLUT2, GLUT5, GLUT8, and GLUT12 have a higher affinity for transporting d-fructose over 2-deoxy-d-glucose (30\u201333), while GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT10 have a higher affinity for transporting d-galactose (30,34,35), and GLUT3 has a higher affinity for d-xylose (30,35). To further narrow down the list of GLUTs involved in overload-induced glucose uptake, experiments were performed to assess the ability of different hexoses to compete against [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose for transport into muscle cells. For all experiments, overload-induced increases in muscle mass were not significantly different (Supplementary Tables 4A and B). As shown in Fig. 3A, d-glucose completely blocked [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in both the sham and overload-stimulated muscles compared with l-glucose controls. In contrast, d-fructose did not impair either sham or overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that the fructose-transporting GLUT2, GLUT5, GLUT8, and GLUT12 are not involved. d-galactose and d-xylose inhibited both sham and overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake by \u223c40\u201350% (Fig. 3A and B), suggesting a possible role for GLUT1, GLUT3, and/or GLUT10. To date, no studies have examined GLUT6 substrate transport preference.The results of the hexose competition experiments suggested that overload uses GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and/or GLUT10 to increase muscle glucose uptake. To assess the potential involvement of these GLUTs, immunoblots were performed in muscles 1, 3, and 5 days after overload. Commercially available GLUT antibodies were validated for the ability to detect their specified protein using GLUT isoform overexpression samples and/or tissues known to express that GLUT isoform (Supplementary Fig. 2). Muscle weights time-dependently increased after overload (Supplementary Table 5). Overload did not significantly alter GLUT4 protein levels (Fig. 4). In contrast, overload significantly increased GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and GLUT10 protein levels (Fig. 4), suggesting that any or all of these GLUTs could be involved in overload-induced muscle glucose uptake.To determine whether the overload-induced increase in GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, or GLUT10 protein levels was enhanced by the loss of GLUT4, immunoblots were performed in muscles from the mGLUT4 HET and mGLUT4 KO mice. Immunoblot results for female mice are provided in Fig. 5, whereas results for male mice are provided in Supplementary Fig. 3. A direct comparison of GLUT immunoblot data between male and female mice is provided in Supplementary Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 5, the overload-induced increases in GLUT3 and GLUT10 protein levels were not altered by the loss of GLUT4. In contrast, although the overload-induced increase in GLUT1 trended toward being higher in the mGLUT4 KO mice (P = 0.13), the overload-induced increase in GLUT6 was significantly impaired (Fig. 5). In addition, GLUT6 protein levels were lower in the sham muscles from the mGLUT4 KO mice compared with WT/control mice (P = 0.05).The data presented in this study are the first to demonstrate that GLUT4 is not necessary for overload to stimulate glucose uptake or hypertrophic growth in skeletal muscle. In addition, these studies demonstrate that overload-induced muscle glucose uptake is mediated via a facilitated GLUT with a hexose transport preference of d-glucose > d-galactose \u2248 d-xylose > 2-deoxy-d-glucose and not d-fructose. Immunoblot analyses found that muscle GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and GLUT10 protein levels are increased by overload, suggesting that one or more of these transporters is responsible for overload-induced glucose uptake.Five days of overload increased glucose uptake \u223c80% in plantaris muscles from both male and female WT/control mice (11\u201312 weeks old) (Figs. 1\u20133 and Supplementary Fig. 1) and \u223c90% in soleus muscle from female mice (8\u20139 weeks old) (Supplementary Fig. 4). These findings, along with previous work that showed that 4 days of overload increased soleus muscle glucose uptake \u223c80% in male mice that were 25\u201330 weeks old (6), demonstrate that overload can stimulate muscle glucose uptake irrespective of fiber type, sex, or age.In this study, muscle GLUT4 protein levels were not significantly changed by overload (Fig. 4). Although this is in contrast with work that demonstrated an \u223c70% increase in GLUT4 protein levels after overload (9), there are a number of important differences between these studies that could account for the observed inconsistency in findings, including species examined (rat vs. mouse), age of animals (6 vs. 2\u20133 months old), duration of overload (120 vs. 5 days), type of surgery (bilateral vs. unilateral), and muscle examined (medial gastrocnemius vs. plantaris). Consistent with no change in GLUT4 protein levels, overload-induced muscle glucose uptake was not impaired in either the male or female mGLUT4 KO mice (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). This finding is in agreement with work in rat hind limb muscle that demonstrated a disconnect between resistance training\u2013induced increases in muscle glucose uptake and GLUT4 protein levels (18) and work in human muscle that demonstrated no change in GLUT4 protein after resistance training in healthy subjects (4,5). Thus, collectively these results suggest that GLUT4 does not regulate loading-induced glucose uptake in healthy muscle. However, overload and resistance training are not identical stimuli and elicit some differential adaptations in muscle (e.g., change in fiber type), so future studies will need to examine the necessity of GLUT4 in other models that induce hypertrophy (e.g., weighted ladder climbing).Treatment of mouse plantaris muscles with the SGLT inhibitor phloridzin (10 or 100 \u03bcmol/L) had no significant effect on basal or overload-induced glucose uptake (Fig. 2A). These findings are in contrast with previous work in mouse soleus in which a 30-min preincubation with phloridzin (5 mmol/L) impaired basal and overload-induced glucose uptake 70\u201375% (6). Since the current study allowed a longer time (60 min) for phloridzin diffusion to the innermost muscle fibers, the discrepancy between these findings is most likely due to inhibitor dose. Phloridzin has an IC50 of \u223c0.760 \u03bcmol/L for SGLT1 (36), \u223c0.066 \u03bcmol/L for SGLT2 (36), \u223c360 \u03bcmol/L for GLUT1 (37), and \u223c140 \u03bcmol/L for GLUT4 (37). Thus, the decreased glucose uptake observed with 5 mmol/L phloridzin was most likely due to nonspecific inhibition of GLUTs and not to a muscle fiber type\u2013specific difference in inhibitor action.d-Fructose had no effect on either sham or overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with those found in mouse soleus muscle demonstrating no inhibition of basal or insulin-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake by d-fructose (23) and indicate that the GLUTs capable of transporting fructose (i.e., GLUT2, GLUT5, GLUT8, GLUT9, and GLUT12) do not functionally contribute to basal, insulin-induced, or overload-induced muscle glucose uptake. d-Galactose and d-xylose both partially impaired basal and overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake (Fig. 3A and B). Since previous work has shown that d-galactose is a competitive inhibitor of [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake via GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT10 (30,34) and d-xylose is a competitive inhibitor of [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake via GLUT3 (30), these results suggest that GLUT1, GLUT3, and/or GLUT10 mediate overload-induced muscle glucose uptake.The mouse GLUT1 gene encodes a 492-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of \u223c54 kDa, and in this study GLUT1 was detected at \u223c55 kDa in mouse muscle (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Overload time-dependently increased muscle GLUT1 protein levels up to \u223c480% in WT mice (Fig. 4), and overload-induced increases in GLUT1 protein were elevated \u223c50% in mGLUT4 KO mice compared with WT/control mice (Fig. 5). These data are consistent with those in cardiac muscle, in which pressure overload time-dependently increased GLUT1 protein up to \u223c200% by 4 days (38), and in cardiac-specific GLUT4 KO mice, which exhibited \u223c200% increases in cardiac GLUT1 protein levels (21). At 5 days postoverload, GLUT1 protein was increased \u223c480% (Fig. 4), but muscle glucose uptake was only increased \u223c80% (Figs. 1\u20133), suggesting that at least some of the GLUT1 proteins were not actively transporting glucose. These findings are consistent with those in muscle-specific GLUT1 overexpression mice in which >40-fold increases in GLUT1 protein only increased basal muscle glucose uptake approximately ninefold (39). Thus, future studies will need to assess the activity of muscle GLUT1 in order to determine a role for this protein in overload-induced muscle glucose uptake.The mouse GLUT3 gene encodes a 493-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of \u223c54 kDa, and in this study GLUT3 was detected at \u223c66 kDa in mouse sciatic nerve and muscle (Supplementary Fig. 2B). These data are consistent with those from studies detecting GLUT3 in mouse neurons (mRNA and protein) (40) and C2C12 muscle cells (mRNA) (41) but are in contrast with work that failed to detect GLUT3 protein in mouse soleus (23). The reason underlying this inconsistency in the predicted versus observed molecular weight of GLUT3, as well as the discrepancy in detection of GLUT3 protein in mouse muscle, is unclear. However, since [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake via GLUT3 can be competitively inhibited by d-xylose (30) and muscle [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was impaired by d-xylose in this study (Fig. 3B), these results support the conclusion that GLUT3 protein is present in mouse plantaris muscle and suggest that GLUT3 expression in rodent muscle may be fiber type specific. Overload time-dependently increased GLUT3 protein levels up to \u223c140% in WT mice (Fig. 4). Since overload stimulates muscle satellite cell recruitment and myocyte fusion (42) and GLUT3 mRNA levels transiently increase during myocyte fusion (43), these findings suggest that overload-induced increases in GLUT3 protein levels may be due to an increase in muscle satellite cells. Overload-induced increases in GLUT3 protein levels were not impaired in mGLUT4 KO mice (Fig. 5), suggesting that GLUT3 could regulate overload-induced glucose uptake. Consistent with this hypothesis, work in Xenopus oocytes has shown that GLUT3 exhibits a fivefold or greater capacity to transport glucose than GLUT1 or GLUT4 (35). Thus, even a small increase in GLUT3 protein levels could have a significant impact on muscle glucose uptake.The mouse GLUT6 gene encodes a 497-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of \u223c55 kDa, and in this study GLUT6 protein was detected at \u223c52 kDa in mouse brain and muscle (Supplementary Fig. 2D). These data are consistent with those in human tissues in which GLUT6 mRNA was strongly detected in brain with lower transcript levels found in muscle (44). Overload increased muscle GLUT6 protein levels \u223c200\u2013300% in WT/control and mGLUT4 KO mice (Figs. 4 and 5), suggesting that GLUT6 could mediate overload-induced glucose uptake. In support of this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated that GLUT6 transports d-glucose within a physiological range (1\u20135 mmol/L) (44) and that GLUT6 knockdown impaired [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in malignant human endometrial cells (45). However, even though studies in 3T3L1 adipocytes demonstrated that mutation of an N-terminal di-leucine motif in GLUT6 caused its relocalization to the cell surface (46), to date no studies have demonstrated GLUT6 translocation in response to any stimulus in any cell type (46). Thus, future studies will need to determine whether overload increases cell surface GLUT6 protein levels. Interestingly, GLUT6 protein levels were decreased \u223c40\u201350% in the sham and overload-stimulated muscles from the female and male mGLUT4 KO mice (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that GLUT4 and GLUT6 may interact to coordinately regulate glucose uptake. Future studies will need to determine the relationship between GLUT4 and GLUT6 in skeletal muscle.The mouse GLUT10 gene encodes a 536-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of \u223c57 kDa, and in this study GLUT10 was detected at \u223c66 kDa in mouse muscle (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Although the reason behind the discrepancy in the predicted versus observed molecular weight of GLUT10 is unclear, the current finding is consistent with previous work that reported GLUT10 mRNA in C2C12 cells (41) and mouse muscle (47). Overload increased GLUT10 protein levels 100\u2013150% in muscles from WT/control, mGLUT4 HET, and mGLUT4 KO mice (Figs. 4 and 5), suggesting that GLUT10 could regulate overload-induced glucose uptake. However, in 3T3L1 adipocytes GLUT10 is localized to the Golgi and mitochondria and not to the cell surface (48). Thus, even though GLUT10 has the lowest Km value for 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport of all of the overload-regulated GLUTs (i.e., Km \u223c0.3 mmol/L) (34), without localization to the cell surface, GLUT10 could not be involved in overload-induced muscle [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake. Future studies will need to determine the intracellular localization of GLUT10 in muscle.A direct comparison of the GLUT immunoblot data from the male and female mice revealed a sex difference in the expression of GLUT4, GLUT6, and GLUT10 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Although the physiological significance of these findings is presently unclear, it may explain the different rates of muscle glucose uptake observed between the sexes (e.g., basal muscle glucose uptake rates were 0.88 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcmol/g/h in WT/control female mice [Fig. 1] and 0.59 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcmol/g/h in male mice [Supplementary Fig. 1]).In conclusion, the results from this study demonstrated that GLUT4 is not required for overload-induced increases in skeletal muscle glucose uptake or hypertrophic growth and suggest that GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and/or GLUT10 may play a key role in the regulation of overload-induced glucose uptake. Future studies are currently underway to identify the GLUTs that are responsible for this effect and to determine whether they also play a key role in the beneficial effects on whole-body glucose metabolism elicited by resistance exercise training in individuals with type 2 diabetes."}, "28348168": {"pmid": "28348168", "pmcid": "PMC5450841", "title": "FGFR2 is required for airway basal cell self-renewal and terminal differentiation", "abstract": "\nAirway stem cells slowly self-renew and produce differentiated progeny to maintain homeostasis throughout the lifespan of an individual. Mutations in the molecular regulators of these processes may drive cancer or degenerative disease, but are also potential therapeutic targets. Conditionally deleting one copy of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) in adult mouse airway basal cells results in self-renewal and differentiation phenotypes. We show that FGFR2 signalling correlates with maintenance of expression of a key transcription factor for basal cell self-renewal and differentiation: SOX2. This heterozygous phenotype illustrates that subtle changes in receptor tyrosine kinase signalling can have significant effects, perhaps providing an explanation for the numerous changes seen in cancer.\n", "fulltext": "Like human airways, the mouse trachea contains three major epithelial lineages. Basal cells (BCs) are a stem cell population and include slowly dividing stem cells and committed luminal precursors. Luminal secretory cells self-renew and produce terminally differentiated ciliated cells. Multiple studies have shown that SOX2 is a key transcription factor (TF) for the development and maintenance of all airway epithelial cells. Deletion of Sox2 in adult mouse tracheal epithelium caused loss of differentiated cells. Moreover, the Sox2\u0394/\u0394 BCs were less able to proliferate in vitro or in vivo following injury. SOX2 is thus required for BC self-renewal and luminal differentiation. SOX2 overexpression can be a driver of squamous cell carcinoma, which has a predominantly basal cell phenotype. FGFR2 function has been extensively studied during lung branching where one of its roles is to maintain undifferentiated epithelial progenitors by inhibiting SOX2 expression. However, at later stages of embryonic development ectopic FGF10 can promote BC differentiation in SOX2+ airway progenitors. The same study expressed a secreted dominant-negative FGFR2 in the late stages of embryogenesis and suggested that there could be a role for FGFR2 signalling in maintenance of airway BCs. We have now specifically tested this hypothesis in the steady-state adult mouse trachea, and show that FGFR2 is required for BC self-renewal and terminal differentiation. Moreover, FGFR2 signalling maintains SOX2 expression. We detected FGFR2 protein in airway basal cells and at the apical surface of secretory cells (Fig.\u00a01A,B), confirming previous results. To determine the role of FGFR2 in BCs, we conditionally deleted one copy of Fgfr2 and activated a GFP reporter in adult tracheal BCs using Tg(KRT5-CreER); Rosa26RfGFP/+; Fgfr2fx/+ (Fgfr2 conditional heterozygous, cHet) and control Tg(KRT5-CreER); Rosa26RfGFP/+ mice (Fig.\u00a01C). To test for co-recombination between Fgfr2fx and the reporter, we isolated GFP+ BCs by flow cytometry as GFP+, GSI\u03b24-lectin+ cells at 3\u2005weeks post-tamoxifen (tmx) induction and performed RT-qPCR for Fgfr2 (Fig.\u00a01D). This confirmed that cHet BCs had \u223c50% of the control Fgfr2 mRNA level. Hence, we use GFP+ cells as a surrogate marker for Fgfr2\u0394/+ cells, being aware that co-recombination will not be 100%. Tracheae were harvested at intervals to assess the contribution of GFP+, Fgfr2\u0394/+ BCs to the epithelium during homeostatic turnover (Fig.\u00a01E). At 1.5\u2005weeks post-tmx, \u223c30% of total BCs were GFP+ in Fgfr2cHet and control mice. In controls, this percentage increased to \u223c60% at 5\u2005weeks post-tmx, before dropping to initial levels by 24\u2005weeks. By contrast, in the Fgfr2cHet tracheae, the percentage of GFP+ BCs remained approximately constant at 5\u2005weeks, but decreased to less than 5% of total basal cells by 24\u2005weeks (Fig.\u00a01F). In both genotypes, labelled BCs produced labelled luminal cells. Luminal differentiation initially appeared more rapid in the Fgfr2cHets. However, luminal cell production was not sustained over time, likely due to the loss of GFP+ BCs, and by 24\u2005weeks the percentage of labelled luminal cells was significantly lower in the Fgfr2cHet tracheae (Fig.\u00a01G). This showed that Fgfr2cHet BCs can produce luminal cells, but that mutant basal and luminal cells are gradually lost. One possible reason for the loss of Fgfr2cHet cells is differential fitness and competition with neighbouring wild-type cells. To test this, we mixed pure populations of Rosa26RtdTomato/+; Fgfr2\u0394/+ with unlabelled Fgfr2+/+ BCs (1:2 ratio) and assessed their ability to compete in vitro at steady-state and following injury. We were unable to find evidence for differential proliferation or survival in the mixed cultures and conclude that it is unlikely that cell competition contributes to the observed loss of mutant cells (Fig.\u00a0S1; Movies\u00a01-5). We asked whether the loss of Fgfr2cHet cells was due to a decrease in cell division. As expected, proliferation rates were low in all tracheae, but dividing GFP+ cells were observed (Fig.\u00a0S2A). We noted an increase in proliferation of the Fgfr2cHet GFP+ cells at 1.5\u2005weeks post-tmx, although this was not statistically significant and the change was not sustained over time (Fig.\u00a0S2B). Thus, altered proliferation does not explain the phenotype. We also assessed apoptosis using cleaved caspase 3 staining, but did not identify caspase 3+ cells (665 GFP+ cells scored in four independent 5\u2005week samples; Fig.\u00a0S2C,D). We assessed the ability of Fgfr2cHet cells to differentiate by analysing the luminal (KRT8) and basal (KRT5) cytokeratins at 5\u2005weeks post-tmx (Fig.\u00a02A). A higher percentage of the total GFP+ cells co-stained with KRT8 in the mutants, indicating that more cells had begun differentiation to a luminal fate (Fig.\u00a02B). Similarly, plotting the GFP/T1\u03b1 staining (Fig.\u00a01D) as a percentage of GFP+ cells (GFP+, T1\u03b1\u2212) showed more differentiating cells in the mutants (Fig.\u00a02B). Thus, Fgfr2cHet cells exit the basal layer at a greater rate than controls and their descendants take on a luminal KRT8+, T1\u03b1\u2212 fate, suggesting a self-renewal defect. At steady-state, BCs initially differentiate into secretory cells that later produce ciliated cells. Cell fate analysis at 5\u2005weeks post-tmx showed that both control and Fgfr2cHet BCs produce secretory SCGB1A1+ cells (Fig.\u00a02C,D). Moreover, there were no signs of goblet cell production in the mutants (Fig.\u00a02C; n=4 MUC5AClo cells observed from 859 cells counted in 5 Fgfr2cHet individuals). However, analysis of acetylated tubulin-positive cilia (marker of terminal luminal differentiation) at 24\u2005weeks post-tmx showed that the Fgfr2cHet cells never took on a ciliated cell identity (Fig.\u00a02E). We tested the ability of Fgfr2cHet cells to proliferate and differentiate in vitro using a high dose of an adenovirus containing CMV-Cre (Ad-Cre) to recombine Rosa26RfGFP/+; Fgfr2fx/+ and control Rosa26RfGFP/fGFP BCs grown in self-renewing conditions (Fig.\u00a03A). When analysed by genomic PCR, this resulted in an almost-pure population of Fgfr2\u0394/+ cells (Fig.\u00a0S3A,B). Four days after Ad-Cre-mediated deletion, we observed an increased proportion of KRT8+ cells in the Fgfr2cHet cultures (Fig.\u00a03A-C). This recapitulates the in vivo phenotype and supports the conclusion that Fgfr2cHet BCs have a self-renewal defect. Additional cultures were passaged and grown to confluence before differentiation at air-liquid interface (Fig.\u00a0S4A-D). The Fgfr2cHet cells survived passaging but did not reach confluence and failed to express markers of ciliated or basal cell differentiation. Moreover, passaged cells were unable to grow in sphere-forming assays (Fig.\u00a0S4E-H). The passaged Fgfr2cHet cells were somewhat enlarged and flattened, possibly indicating a senescent phenotype (Rodier and Campisi, 2011). We therefore tested for senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity in primary cultures of Fgfr2cHet cells. \u03b2-Galactosidase activity was detected in 3/3 Fgfr2cHet cultures and 0/3 controls (Fig.\u00a03D). Senescence of the Fgfr2cHet cells in vivo could potentially explain why the luminal GFP+ cells can express secretory markers, but do not later produce ciliated cells. However, we cannot absolutely exclude a luminal fate choice defect in Fgfr2cHet BCs. We determined the effects of decreasing FGFR2 signalling on downstream pathways using immunoblotting. There was a 1.5-fold decrease in phosphorylated AKT in the Fgfr2\u0394/+ cells (Fig.\u00a03E,F), but no change in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig.\u00a0S3C,D). These changes are consistent with a decrease in FGFR2 signalling via the PI3K-AKT pathway, which was implicated as the main pathway downstream of FGFR2 in adult small airway secretory cells and the developing trachea. Most strikingly, there was a twofold decrease in SOX2 in the Fgfr2\u0394/+ cells (Fig.\u00a03E,F; Fig.\u00a0S3C,D). We confirmed the decrease in SOX2 protein at a cellular level by in vitro immunostaining (Fig.\u00a03G). Similarly, there was consistently lower SOX2 expression in GFP+ cells in the Fgfr2cHet tracheae in vivo (Fig.\u00a03H, arrows). As expected from the genetic strategy, in the mutants we also observed GFP+, SOX2+ cells (Fig.\u00a03H, arrowheads) and GFP\u2212, SOX2\u2212 cells (Fig.\u00a03H, yellow arrows), both are likely to have recombined only one floxed allele. Co-immunostaining with FGFR2 confirmed that the GFP+, SOX2+ cells observed in the mutants retained high levels of FGFR2 protein (Fig.\u00a03I). We predicted that if a decrease in Fgfr2 results in loss of BC self-renewal, then activation of FGFR2 in vitro should promote the growth of BC colonies. FGF7 and FGF10 are expressed in homeostatic tracheae and are known to activate FGFR2 preferentially in vitro and in vivo. We plated wild-type BCs at low density and added FGF7 or FGF10 on culture day 2 after colonies were established (Fig.\u00a04A). Addition of FGF7 or FGF10 had the opposite effect to decreasing Fgfr2 and significantly increased colony size (Fig.\u00a04B,C). Interestingly, FGF7 and FGF10 had no effect on the level of Sox2 mRNA (Fig.\u00a04D). In conclusion, our data suggest that a normal function of FGFR2 signalling in adult airway BCs is to promote asymmetric self-renewing divisions (Fig.\u00a04E). This is consistent with work in the embryonic trachea where ectopic FGF10 was observed to promote BC fate. By contrast, our previous work on FGFR1 in adult BCs showed that FGFR1 is required to inhibit steady-state proliferation and does not change the ability of BCs to self-renew. Thus, FGFR1 and FGFR2 have independent functions in airway BCs. We cannot exclude the possibility that they also have other overlapping functions. We also show that steady-state FGFR2 signalling is required, directly or indirectly, to maintain SOX2 protein levels in the adult airway. This is in contrast to the branching lung, where FGFR2 inhibits SOX2 expression at the tips. Interestingly, an FGFR2-SOX2 inductive relationship has been observed in other cell types. An FGFR2-SOX2 relationship may be maintained in some squamous lung cancers where FGFR2 and SOX2 transcript levels are often correlated. We were surprised that our Fgfr2cHet BCs displayed striking phenotypes when germline Fgfr2\u0394/+ animals are viable and fertile. We therefore looked for subtle epithelial defects in germline-deleted Fgfr2\u0394/+ tracheae compared with wild-type siblings, but were unable to find any abnormalities (Fig.\u00a0S5). Fgfr2 is haploinsufficient in several organs, including the lacrimal and salivary glands. We suggest that in mouse embryos heterozygous for Fgfr2, genetic compensation operates in most tissues. However, conditional heterozygous deletion in the adult by-passes such mechanisms. This is very similar to recent findings from zebrafish genetics where genetic compensation has been found to operate in germline mutants, but not in acute knockdowns. It raises the possibility that many genes that the mouse developmental community assume are uninteresting/redundant based on lack of germline knockout phenotypes do play important roles in development/homeostasis. Experiments were approved by local ethical review committees and conducted according to UK Home Office project licenses PPL80/2326 and 70/812. Fgfr2fx, Tg(KRT5-CreER), Rosa26R-fGFP, Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(CAG-tdTomato*,-EGFP*)Ees and Fgfr2\u0394/+ animals were generated by crossing Fgfr2fx to Zp3-Cre. The genetic background was C57Bl/6J. Males and females >8\u2005weeks old were used. The wild types were C57Bl/6J. Adult (>8\u2005week) animals were injected intraperitoneally four times, every other day, with 0.2\u2005mg/g body weight tamoxifen. Tracheal cells were isolated following published methods. Briefly, cells were incubated in Dispase II (Gibco, 16\u2005U/ml) for 20\u2005min at room temperature. Epithelial sheets were dissociated using 0.1% trypsin/EDTA. Unless otherwise stated, 5\u00d7104 cells in 0.5\u2005ml MTEC/+ media were plated on collagen-coated 12-well tissue culture inserts (BD Falcon, 353180). For tracheospheres, cells were passaged into 50% matrigel (Becton Dickinson). Adeno-Cre (University of Iowa, Gene Transfer Vector Core) was incubated at MOI 2500; vector pfu 1\u00d7106 for 8\u2005h. Recombinant mouse FGF7 and FGF10 (R&D Systems) were used at 100\u2005ng/ml. For competition assays, mixed populations of cells were grown to confluence and then imaged every 4\u2005h for 10\u2005days in a Nikon Biostation. Alternatively, confluent cultures were scratched and imaged every 2\u2005h for 5\u2005days. In vitro experiments were preformed in triplicate. Tracheae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C for 4\u2005h; washed PBS, sucrose protected, embedded in OCT (Optimum Cutting Temperature Compound, Tissue Tek) and sectioned at 6\u2005\u03bcm. Airway culture inserts were washed in PBS, fixed for 10\u2005min in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies are listed in Table S1. Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000) were from Life Technologies (Table S1). DAPI and fluoromount were from Sigma. X-gal staining was performed using Senescence \u03b2-galactosidase staining kit (Cell Signaling, 9860). Slides were imaged on a Zeiss AxioImager compound, or a Leica Sp8/Sp5 confocal microscope. Cells were scored manually in Fiji. For cryosections, every epithelial cell along the entire proximal to distal length of a longitudinal section from the centre of the trachea was scored. For cultured cells at least three random fields of view from each insert were scored. Raw cell counts are available in Fig. S6. Primary tracheal epithelial cells were isolated and sorted using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting MoFlo flow cytometer. GFP+ basal cells from control and Fgfr2cHet tracheae were sorted as GFP+, GSI\u03b24 lectin+. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNEasy Mini Kit. Taqman gene expression assays for Ppia (Mm02342429_g1), Fgfr2 (Mm01269930_m1) and Sox2 (Mm03053810_s1) (Life Technologies) were used. Cells were collected in Cell Extraction Buffer (Invitrogen, FNN0011) with protease inhibitor (Roche 04693116001) and PMSF (Sigma, P7626). Proteins were separated on 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE gels before being transfer onto Millipore Immobilon-P PVDF Membrane (Merck Millipore, IPVH00010). Primary antibodies are listed in Table S1. Detection with HRP-conjugated secondaries (Abcam, 1:10,000) and enhanced chemiluminescense (Thermo Scientific, PI-32109) was carried out. Quantitation is based on protein from three biological replicates separated on the same polyacrylamide gel. Band intensity was analysed in Fiji normalised to the loading control. P-values were obtained using an unpaired two-tailed student's t-test with unequal variance."}, "28481876": {"pmid": "28481876", "pmcid": "PMC5481462", "title": "Oncogenic Activity of Amplified Miniature Chromosome Maintenance 8 in Human Malignancies", "abstract": "\nMiniature chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins play critical roles in DNA replication licensing, initiation and elongation. MCM8, one of the MCM proteins playing a critical role in DNA repairing and recombination, was found to have over-expression and increased DNA copy number in a variety of human malignancies. The gain of MCM8 is associated with aggressive clinical features of several human cancers. Increased expression of MCM8 in prostate cancer is associated with cancer recurrence. Forced expression of MCM8 in RWPE1 cells, the immortalized but non-transformed prostate epithelial cell line, exhibited fast cell growth and transformation, while knocked down of MCM8 in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells induced cell growth arrest, and decreased tumor volumes and mortality of severe combined immunodeficiency mice xenografted with PC3 and DU145 cells. MCM8 bound cyclin D1 and activated Rb protein phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 in vitro and in vivo. The cyclin D1/MCM8 interaction is required for Rb phosphorylation and S phase entry in cancer cells. As a result, our study showed that copy number increase and overexpression of MCM8 may play critical roles in human cancer development.\n", "fulltext": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the US. It is estimated 1,658,370 new cancer cases diagnosed and 589,430 cancer deaths in the US in 2014(1, 2). The understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the development of these lethal diseases remains incomplete. Prostate cancer is one of the most diagnosed cancers in men in the US. Over 161,000 new cases of prostate cancer were identified in 2016, accounting for approximately 10% of all new cancer cases. Unfortunately, the disease is not always indolent; about 26,730 men are expected to die from prostate cancer this year(3). Despite the high incidence of prostate cancer, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the aggressive behavior of some prostate cancer cases remain unclear. Identification of the molecular events that trigger the aggressive behavior of prostate cancer is crucial in reducing the mortality of this disease. Comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analyses of human cancers had revealed numerous numerical or mutational, or epigenomic changes in the cancer genome that may drive gene expression alterations in cancers(4\u201317). The pattern changes of gene expression and genome abnormalities may provide significant insight into the mechanism of human cancer development. However, the relationship between these abnormalities and behavior of cancers remains unclear. To gain a clear and new understanding of the roles of these genes in the biology of human cancers, experimental analysis of these genes one at a time is required. In this report, we performed meta-analyses of genome-wide copy number analysis on MCM proteins and led to the identification of MCM8, a critical component of DNA replication licensing gene(18\u201321), amplified or gain in 17 human malignancies. Similarly, overexpression of MCM8 was found in a wide variety of human malignancies. Over-expression of MCM8 was also identified in prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145 and LNCaP. Forced expression in immortalized prostate epithelial cell lines RWPE1 induced transformation, while knocked down of MCM8 induced growth arrest of PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cells. It appears that MCM8 amplification and over-expression underlie the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Significant evidence suggests that amplification and overexpression of DNA replication licensing factor have been associated with aggressive human malignancies(22\u201330). One of these DNA replication licensing factors, MCM7, had been well characterized to drive the aggressive behavior in prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer and gastric cancer(23, 25, 31\u201338). To investigate whether other DNA replication licensing factors are also implicated in human cancers, we screened 3 data sets of prostate cancer. We found that MCM8, a DNA replication licensing factor involving replication elongation and DNA homologous recombination, were consistently up-regulated in prostate cancer samples in comparison with normal prostate tissues (Table 1). To investigate whether MCM8 is also similarly up-regulated in other human malignancies, microarray data from European Bioinformatics Institute of EMBL were screened for MCM8 expression in a variety of human cancers. The analyses suggest that MCM8 is over-expressed in a large number of human cancers, including, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, liver cancer, medulloblastoma, and glioblastoma multiforme (Table 1). The magnitudes of over-expression range from 2- to 5.2 fold, suggesting a wide significance of MCM8 overexpression in human malignancies. To investigate the cause of MCM8 over-expression in prostate cancer, we analyzed 2 prostate cancer copy number data set from University of Pittsburgh and TCGA. The results showed that 19 and 8% of prostate cancer genomes have a gain of MCM8 genome copy, respectively. To examine whether other human malignancies also have similar gain of MCM8 gene copy number, we analyzed additional large sets of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays on 16 other human malignancies including glioblastoma multiforme, breast cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoma, diffuse large cell lymphoma, thyroid cancer, rectal adenocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia and bladder cancer. The gain of MCM8 gene copy is widespread among human malignancies: ranging from 4.2% in thyroid cancer to 79.7% in rectal adenocarcinoma (Table 2). In some breast and colon cancer samples, up to 16 copies of MCM8 were found in the genomes of cancer cells, suggesting that the gain of MCM8 was the result of amplification of the genome sequence encoding MCM8 in some of these cancers. These analyses suggest that the copy number gain of MCM8 is probably the underlying mechanism of MCM8 overexpression in human malignancies. Analysis of prostate cancer data set from TCGA indicates that gain of MCM8 is associated with higher Gleason\u2019s grade (p=0.0007), more advanced pathological stage (p=0.036) and more likely to have lymph node metastasis (p=0.0025). The gain of MCM8 is also associated with higher level of residual tumors of lung adenocarcinoma (p=0.002), lymph node metastasis (p=0.03) and higher grades (p=0.000098) of esophageal cancer, more advanced stages (p=0.00025) and more frequent lymph node metastasis (p=0.0017) of colon cancer. The gain of MCM8 is also found disproportionately in ovarian cancer (p=0.026) and uterine endometrial carcinoma (p=0.0000024) that were presented as advanced stages of cancer at the time of diagnosis. Urothelial carcinoma with a gain of MCM8 also showed a higher level of aggressiveness by displaying frequent lymph node metastasis and recurrence of cancer after treatment (p=0.049). These results indicate that gain of MCM8 is likely a marker for the aggressiveness of human cancers. To validate the gain of MCM8 in prostate cancer, qPCR was performed using primers corresponding to intron16/exon17 region on 115 prostate samples, including 19 organ donor prostate tissue samples with ages ranging from 15 to 72, three benign prostate tissues adjacent cancer, and 93 prostate cancer samples. As shown in figure 1A, the gain of MCM8 was not detected in any of the organ donor prostates and benign prostate tissues adjacent to cancer, while 52% (52/93) of the prostate cancer samples were detected with a gain of MCM8. Among those prostate cancer samples from patients that experienced recurrence of the disease after radical prostatectomy, the frequency of gain of MCM8 reached 70.5% (43/49). In contrast, the rate of MCM8 gain was only 26.5% (9/34) for prostate cancers that did not reoccur for at least 5 years after the surgery. These results indicate a strong association between prostate cancer recurrence and the gain of MCM8 (p<0.0001). To visualize the gain of MCM8 in prostate cancer samples, fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed using bacterial artificial chromosome probe corresponding to genome region where MCM8 resides (Figure 1B and C). The results indicate MCM8 gain in 40% (8/20) of the samples examined: 83% (5/6) samples from patients who experienced prostate cancer recurrence had MCM8 gain in their cancer genomes, while only 21% (3/14) indolent cancer samples were positive of the gain of MCM8. Kaplan-Meir analysis based on the status of MCM8 gain showed that patients with MCM8 gain in their cancer genome had PSA-free survival rate of 33.3%, while patients with no MCM8 gain had the 5-year PSA-free survival rate of 74.5% (figure 1D), suggesting that the gain of MCM8 signals a significantly poorer clinical outcomes (p=7.8 \u00d7 10\u22125) for prostate cancer. To examine whether MCM8 protein is over-expressed in prostate cancer samples, 533 prostate samples were examined for MCM8 expression through immunostaining using antibodies specific for MCM8 protein. The expression of MCM8 was quantified based on the number of cells positive for MCM8 staining: negative (0), focal positive (0.5), 1\u201320% cells positive (1), 20\u201350% cells positive (2), 50\u201380% cells positive (3) and more than 80% cells positive (4). As shown in figure 2A and B, most organ donor prostate cancers are only focally positive for MCM8 protein with an average score of 0.56. In contrast, a significant number of prostate cancer samples had the expression of MCM8 in more than 20%, with an average of scores of 1.6. The average of MCM8 expression scores for prostate cancer that proved recurrent reached 1.99. Higher MCM8 protein expression score is strongly associated with prostate cancers that had cancer recurrence (p=3.5 \u00d7 10\u221215). To analyze the impact of MCM8 protein expression on PSA-free survival of prostate cancer, Kaplan-Meir analysis was performed based on MCM8 expression levels. As shown in figure 2C, 42.4% patients with MCM8 expression scoring 2 or more survived 5 years without prostate cancer recurrence. In contrast, approximately 90% patients with MCM8 scoring less than 2 survived at least 5 years cancer free. These results indicate that MCM8 overexpression had a significant negative impact on the prostate cancer prognosis (p=9.25 \u00d7 10\u221213). To investigate the biological role of MCM8 over-expression in prostate epithelial cells, RWPE1, the immortalized but non-transformed prostate epithelial cells, were transfected with pCDNA4-MCM8-FLAG. Fifteen colonies were screened for inducible expression of MCM8. Two clones were selected for further analysis (RM8#2 and RM8#9). As shown in figure 3A and B, induced expression of MCM8 in RWPE1 cells resulted in an average of 2.5 fold (p<0.01) increase of S-phase and concomitant 32.6% (p<0.01) decrease of G0/G1 phase cells. MCM8 expression increased colony formation by 2.8 fold (p<0.01) and anchorage independent growth by 12.7 fold (p<0.01) of RWPE1 cells (figure 3C and D). Most non-transformed cells grow poorly in anchorage-independent growth assays. Dramatic improvement of anchorage-independent growth of RWPE1 cells induced by MCM8 clearly indicates that RWPE1 cells were transformed. MCM8 appears abundantly expressed in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells, in comparison with RWPE1 (figure 3A). To assess the impact of MCM8 overexpression in prostate cancer, prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145 and LNCaP were transfected with pSingle-tts-siMCM8 that expresses a shRNA targeting at MCM8 mRNA upon the treatment of doxycycline (5\u03bcg/ml). Two clones of each cell lineage were selected for analysis. Knocked down of MCM8 in PC3 (73% for M8P#5 and 71% for M8P#7) by shRNA specific for MCM8 reduced S-phase entry by an average of 51% (p<0.01), and reduced colony formation by over 83% (p<0.01) (figure 3C and D). These biological changes were accompanied by drops of DNA replication licensing of Cdt1 (average 66.7% for M8P#5 and M8P#7), MCM6 (average 59.2%) and MCM7 (average 78.7%), suggesting that down-regulation of MCM8 have significant negative impact on DNA replication licensing. Similar results were also found when DU145 (51% knocked-down for M8D#1 and 75% for M8D#4) and LNCaP (65% for M8L#3 and 63% M8L#5) cells were knocked down with shRNA specific for MCM8: 65% drop (p<0.01) in S-phase cells and 94% drop (p<0.01) in colony formation for DU145, and 44% drop (p<0.01) in S-phase cells and 91% drop (p<0.01) in colony formation for LNCaP cells. Over-expression of MCM8 in non-transforming prostate epithelial cells RWPE1 (RM8#2 and RM8#9, average 2.3 fold) resulted in 2.5 fold increase of S-phase entry in average (figure 3A and B). These were also accompanied by significant increase of Cdt1 (>5 fold), MCM6 (2.2 fold) and MCM7 (>5 fold) licensing. Over-expression of MCM8 is clearly necessary for cancer cell growth and transformation. To investigate the impact of MCM8 overexpression on prostate cancer growth metastasis in vivo, M8P#5 and M8D#1cells were xenografted into the subcutaneous regions of severe combined immunodeficiency mice. These mice were treated with doxycycline to knock down the expression of MCM8 in these cancer cells. As shown in figure 3E\u2013F, mice treated with doxycycline water (5\u03bcg/ml) had 74.3% (p<0.01) decrease in tumor volume for M8P#5 cells and 65% (p<0.01) decrease for M8D#1 cells, in comparison with the untreated controls. The mice treated with doxycycline water had 93.8% survival rate. In contrast, only 31% mice xenografted with tumor cells without treatment survived 6 weeks (p=0.00015). These results suggest that MCM8 expression is crucial for cancer growth and aggressiveness. To investigate the mechanism of MCM8 mediated cancer growth and transformation, Yeast two-hybrid cDNA library from human prostate was screened for MCM8 interacting protein by pBD-MCM8full that expresses bait domain-MCM8 fusion protein (BD-MCM8). Thirty-one colonies were found to grow in most stringent selective medium and positive for \u03b2-galactosidase. Eleven unique clones were identified. One of these clones contains a cDNA encoding cyclin D1 (CCND1). To validate these results, pAD-CCND1 and pBD-MCM8 were co-transfected into Yeast AH109 cells. Co-transfection of pBD-MCM8 (full length) and pAD-CCND1 showed positive galactosidase activity and grew in most stringent selective medium, while all negative controls were negative, confirming the initial Yeast Two-hybrid screening results (Figure 4A). To test the binding between MCM8 and cyclin D1 in vivo, co-immunoprecipitations of MCM8 and cyclin D1 were performed on the protein extracts of PC3 and RWPE1 cells. As shown in Figure 4B, co-immunoprecipitation of MCM8 and cyclin D1 was readily apparent. To visualize whether MCM8 and cyclin D1 co-localize in the nucleus, double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against MCM8 and cyclin D1 were performed in RWPE1 cells. As demonstrated in figure 4C, MCM8 and a significant amount of cyclin D1 were colocalized in the nuclei. Similar colocalization results were obtained with PC3 cells (data not shown). To validate the interaction between MCM8 and cyclin D1 in vitro, MCM8 coding region was segmented into 4 regions: MCM8N (aa2-204), MCM8M1 (aa205-409), MCM8M2 (aa409-618), MCM8C (aa615-880). These cDNA fragments were constructed into pGEX-5X-3 to create GST-MCM8N, GST-MCM8M1, GST-MCM8M2 and GST-MCM8C fusion proteins. These constructs were transfected into E.coli strain BL21. Each of these fusion proteins was induced to express with Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), purified and assayed for their binding activity with recombinant HisTAG-cyclin D1 purified from bacterial protein extract. The results of the binding assays indicate that GST-MCM8M1 (aa408-618) bound with cyclin D1 in the cell-free system (figure 4D and E), while GST-MCM8N, GST-MCM8M2, and GST-MCM8C were negative in the binding assays. These results indicate that the cyclin D1 binding motif is located in the region of amino acids 205\u2013409 in MCM8 protein. The interaction between MCM8 and cyclin D1 is direct. No \u201cbridge protein\u201d is required in their interaction in vitro. A series of deletion mutants of GST-MCM8M1 were assayed to identify the motif that is required for interaction with cyclin D1. A stretch of 30 amino acid sequence located in 261\u2013290 of MCM8 was found crucial for MCM8 binding with cyclin D1 because the fusion proteins with deletion of this sequence did not bind with cyclin D1, while all proteins containing this sequence bound with cyclin D1 (figure 4D and E). Cyclin D1 is a binding protein and co-factor for cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)(39), and plays a crucial role in promoting cell cycle entry to S phase through phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein(40). Interestingly, in vitro binding assays indicate that the presence of MCM8 produced a multi-protein complex that includes CDK4, cyclin D1and MCM8 (figure 5A). To investigate whether binding of MCM8 with cyclin D1 has an impact on the kinase activity of CDK4, protein kinase assays were performed on recombinant CDK4/cyclin D1 protein with or without MCM8, using recombinant Rb as a substrate. As shown in figure 5, the presence of recombinant GST-MCM8 enhanced kinase activity of CDK4 and reduced the Km value by 6.8 fold (455 \u03bcM vs. 3100 \u03bcM) in comparison with cyclin D1/CDK4 alone. These experiments suggest that MCM8 is a cofactor for enhancing the kinase activity of CDK4. In contrast, such enhancement of CDK4 kinase activity was abrogated when the cyclin D1 interaction motif was deleted from GST-MCM8 (GST-dMCM8, figure 5B). The peptide corresponding to aa261-290 of MCM8 blocked the kinase enhancement effect of MCM8 on CDK4/cyclin D1 complex (figure 5B). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that MCM8 formed a large complex with cyclin D1, CDK4, p21 and p27 in PC3 cells (figure 5C), suggesting complex nature of these interactions. To investigate the impact of MCM8 on Rb phosphorylation in vivo, MCM8 mRNA was knocked down by induction MCM8 shRNA with doxycycline in M8P#5 (PC3) and M8D#1 (DU145) cells. As shown in figure 6A, a decrease of MCM8 protein (>90% for M8P#5 and 82% for M8D#1) level accompanied by a reduction of Rb phosphorylation in both cell types. The in vitro CDK4 kinase activity also showed similar decreases when MCM8 was knocked down in these cell lines (figure 6B). These experiments suggest that the presence of MCM8 is essential for Rb phosphorylation. To examine whether binding of MCM8 with cyclin D1 is required for CDK4 kinase activation, a mutant MCM8 that contains only 31 amino acids from MCM8 (aa1,261-290) and FLAG-TAG sequence was ligated into pCDNA4 to create pCDNA4-CBM-FLAG (cyclin D1 binding motif-FLAG) to interfere the binding between MCM8 and cyclin D1. The mutant was cotransfected with pCDNA6 into PC3 cells. Two clones were selected for further analysis. As shown in figure 6A, induction of mutant MCM8 effectively decreased the phosphorylation level of Rb, in comparison with uninduced controls. Similar decreases were also identified in the in vitro kinase assays (figure 6B), while MCM8 mutant that contains no cyclin D1 binding motif had no impact on Rb phosphorylation (figure 6A\u2013B), DNA replication licensing and cell cycle S-phase entry (figure 3B). These analyses support that MCM8/cyclin D1 interaction is crucial for CDK4 kinase activation. It appears that DNA replication licensing in vivo is also dependent on MCM8/cyclin D1 interaction. Interestingly, over-expression of cyclin D1 partially reversed the inhibitory effect induced by MCM8 knockdown (58\u201365% for M8P#5 and 41\u201367% for M8D#1) in cell cycle analysis (figure 6C and D), probably due to forcing more CDK4/cyclin D1 complex formation due to a larger quantity of cyclin D1. In addition, copy number analysis of TCGA data suggests that most samples with MCM8 gain contain at least one intact Rb copy (Supplemental Table 1), supporting a clinical significance of MCM8/cyclin D1/CDK4/Rb signaling. MCM8 is one of the DNA replication licensing factors participating in DNA replication initiation and elongation(41\u201343). Recent studies suggest that MCM8 is recruited to the DNA repair site to facilitate DNA homologous recombination and double-strand breaks(44, 45). Genome instability was identified in mice that are deficient in MCM8(46). Mutations of MCM8 resulted in human gonadal failure(47). To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that widespread gain and overexpression of MCM8 are present in human malignancies. Since the gain of MCM8 is associated with aggressive characteristics of several human cancers, it implies that the gain of MCM8 may play significant roles in driving the cancer metastasis. Most aggressive cancer genomes demonstrate extensive chromosome rearrangement, deletion, and amplification of genes critical to cell survival, growth and migration. It is conceivable that overexpression of MCM8 may facilitate and exacerbate the process of chromosome rearrangement. Cyclin D1/CDK4 complex has been a critical target by many proteins that regulate cell cycle progression, including p27(48, 49), p16(50), p21(51), Hsp90(52), ccdc37(53), PCNA(54), MyoD(55), etc. MCM8 probably contains versatile functions beyond DNA replication licensing and repair. It is possible that MCM8 serves as one of the assembly factors in building CDK4/cyclin D1 complex since the presence of MCM8 enhanced the recruitment of CDK4/cyclin D1 complex. In addition, our analysis showed that MCM8 is crucial in CDK4 activation by significantly lowering the substrate threshold required for CDK4 kinase activation. Phosphorylation of Rb correlates with the level of MCM8. Indeed, forced expression of MCM8 in cancer cell lines resulted in dramatic increase of cell entry into S phase in non-transformed cells, while knocked down of MCM8 generates growth arrest of cancer cells. These results indicate that MCM8 is essential for cell S phase entry. Over-expression of MCM8 may produce two consequences: Promoting cell growth through increasing phosphorylation and inactivation of Rb molecule and promoting DNA recombination that produces abnormal chromosome rearrangements and mutations. As a result, abnormal expression of MCM8 could be one of the fundamental causes that initiate the carcinogenic process. The underlying cause of MCM8 overexpression in human cancers is probably the gain of MCM8 gene copy in the cancer genome. For most cases, the increase of copy number of MCM8 appears moderate, estimated 3\u20134 copies per cancer genome. However, in some samples of breast and colon cancers, the copy number reached 16 copies per genome, clearly indicating amplification in the region of MCM8. The expression of MCM8 is inhibited during S, G2 and early M phase to prevent additional DNA synthesis(56). Terminally differentiated cells do not express replication complex proteins. Amplification or gain of MCM8 may weaken the control of its expression. The continuing presence of MCM8 throughout the cell cycle may induce improper DNA synthesis that leads to genome instability of cancer cells, in addition to increased recruitment of larger proportion of cell population into the proliferation cycle. The association of MCM8 gain with some of the aggressive features of human cancers may indicate the significance of MCM8 in driving the behavior of human cancers. Overexpression of MCM8 gene in prostate immortalized epithelial cells inducing marked transformation underlies the important role of this gene in cancer development. The significance of the discovery of MCM8 gain and over-expression in human malignancies not only lies at a new insight gained towards understanding the carcinogenic process of human cancers but also at identifying a new base to develop potential therapeutic intervention to treat cancers that over-express MCM8 protein. All cell lines, including PC3, Du145, RWPE1, and LNCaP were purchased from American Type Cell Culture (Manassas, VA). PC3 cells were cultured with F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). DU145 cells were cultured with modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (InVitrogen). LNCaP cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. RWPE1 cells were cultured with K-SFM supplemented with recombinant human Epidermal Growth Factor (rhEGF) and Bovine Pituitary Extract (BPE). The genomes of these cell lines were tested for a short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profile on eight different loci (CSF1PO, D13S317, D16S539, D5S818, D7S820, THO1, TPOX, and vWA) of the genomes by PCR using the primer sets for CSF1PO, D13S317, D16S539, D5S818, D7S820, TH01, TPOX, vWA recommended by ATCC on April 22, 2016 (latest). These cell lines were authenticated because the STR profiles of the cell lines perfectly matched those published by ATCC. All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), including: Antibodies for MCM6 (sc-55577), MCM7 (sc-9966), MCM8 (sc-47117), Cdt1 (sc-28262), CCND1 (sc-20044), p27 (sc-1641), p21 (sc-6246), CDK4 (sc-136241), Rb (sc-102), pRb (sc-271930) and \u03b2-actin (sc-47778). Fresh prostate cancer tissues were prepared as described previously(11, 12). Tumor samples were microdissected to 70% purity for qPCR analysis. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were used in FISH assays. One hundred thirty-three samples including 93 prostate cancers, three benign prostate tissues adjacent to cancer and 19 normal prostate samples from healthy organ donors were examined. The construction of microarrays of prostate tissues was previously described(25). The procedure of tissue collection, de-identification, and experimental protocols were approved by institutional review board of University of Pittsburgh. The similar procedure was previously described[12\u201314]. The FISH probe was prepared by combining 7 ml of SpectrumOrange-labeled Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequence containing MCM8 (RP11-1203216, InVitrogen, Inc, Grand Island, NY) /50% formamide with 1 ml of direct-labeled CEP20 SpectrumGreen (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). The cutoff for a gain of MCM8 is an average of at least 2.5 copies per genome (for detailed procedure, please see Ren et al. (25)). For quantitative RT-PCR, QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, CA) was used, and the reaction was carried out in an Eppendorf Realplex Mastercycler machine (Thermo-Fisher, Inc Waltham, MA). The procedure was similar to those previously described(25). The assays were performed with 100 ng genomic DNA for all of the experimental and control samples. MCM8 amplification was performed with primers CTATGGCAGTGCTACATTGGG/CCTGTTGCTCATTCCAGAACC for 45 cycles of the following program: 94\u00b0C for 10 s, 62\u00b0C for 5 s, and 72\u00b0C for 10 s. A separate quantification of \u03b2-actin DNA copy was also performed in parallel with MCM8 analysis using the following primers TCTTTGCACTTTCTGCATGTCCCC/GTCCATCACGATGCCAGTGGTAC. For construction of pBD-MCM8full fusion protein, a mutagenic primer set (5\u2032- TGTGGCCTATAATCATATGAATGGAGAGTATAGAGGC -3\u2032 and 5\u2032- TTCATTTCAAGCAAAGTCGACTCTGCAATAAACCCAGGAGGC- 3\u2032) was used. PCR was performed on the cDNA template from the donor prostate (Clontech) using the following conditions: 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 68 \u00b0C for 3 min, and a final 3 min extension step at 68 \u00b0C. The PCR product was restricted with Nde1 and Sal1 (New England Biolabs, MA), gel purified, and ligated into a similarly digested pGBKT7 vector. The fusion protein contained 840 amino acids from the MCM8. For the construction of pGST-MCM8N, a GST fusion protein, a mutagenic primer set (5\u2032- AGGAATTCCCGGGTCGACAATGGAGAGTATAGAGGC -3\u2032 and 5\u2032- AGTCACGATGCG GCCGCCAAAGGCTCATAGTTGTACAC -3\u2032) was used. PCR was performed using these primers under the following conditions: 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 68 \u00b0C for 3 min, and a final 10 min extension step at 68 \u00b0C. The PCR product was then ligated into a pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). A similar strategy was used for constructing pGST-MCM8M1, pGST-MCM8M2 and pGST-MCM8C using the following pair of primers: AGGAATTCCCGGGTCGACACACAGCTCAAGAATGTCAGA/AGTCACGATGCGGCCGCCCGAGTTGACAATGAGTTTAAAC for pGST-MCM8M1, AGGAATTCCCGGGTCGACtCGCTTTGCCCTGTCATTTTTG/AGTCACGATGCGGCCGCCTCTCTGCTTTCCAGCTCTTATTG for pGST-MCM8M2, and AGGAATTCCCGGGTCGACGGAAAGCAGAGAACCATTAGC/AGTCACGATGCGGCCGCCTCTGCAATAAACCCAGGAGGC for pGST-MCM8C. The inserts of these plasmids were retrieved with Sal1 and Not1 and were ligated into a similarly restricted pGEX-5x-3 vector. A series of deletions, including 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 deletions, of pGST-MCM8M1 were then constructed using the primer sets listed in Table 3. The procedures for constructing these mutants are similar to that described for pGST-MCM8N. E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with these mutant constructs for induction of recombinant protein expression. MCM8 cDNA was obtained by extended long PCR (Roche Applied Science, NJ) using primers (AGAAGCTTCCAGTTGTGAACTAGGAGAGC/AGCTCGAGCATAGTTTGAAGCTGGTAAACTTTTGGGC) on cDNA templates from donor prostate tissue. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and XhoI and ligated into a similarly digested pCDNA4-FLAG vector. This construct and pCDNA6 were transfected into RWPE1 cells, the immortalized prostate epithelial cell line with low MCM8 expression, using superfect\u2122 kit (InVitrogen, CA). The transformed cells were cultured with 100 \u03bcg/ml zeocin and 5 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin. Colonies were selected for MCM8-FLAG expression in the presence of (5 \u03bcg/ml) tetracycline. To construct the vector that expresses shRNA specific for MCM8, the following oligonucleotides were used: 5\u2032-tcgagctctcaattccaaccttgctcgtgccgaagcacgagcaaggttggaattgagaga-3\u2032/5\u2032-agcttctctcaattccaaccttgctcgtgcttcggcacgagcaaggttggaattgagagc-3\u2032. These primers were annealed and ligated into a pSingle-tts-shRNA vector. The constructs were then transfected into PC3, LNCaP, and DU145 cells to generate cells that are doxycycline-inducible for the suppression of MCM8 expression. The procedure of MCM8 immunoblotting is similar to previously described(25). The primary mouse anti-MCM8 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. The MCM8 expression was detected with the ECL system (Amersham Life Science) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin association analyses were performed similarly to those previously described(57). The similar procedure was described previously(58\u201361). Briefly, cells were cultured to 40%-50% confluence. These cells were synchronized with medium containing no serum for 24 h to G0 phase. The cells were then stimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum for 4 h and labeled with 5-Bromo-2-DeoxyUridine (10 \u03bcM). The cells were then harvested and stained with propidium iodide /tritonX-100. BrdU labeling and nuclei were quantified using a FACSCalibur Automated Benchtop Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, MA), and analyzed by WinMDI 2.9 program. The clinical features of these cases were tabulated in Table 4. The procedure was described previously (62, 63). The expression of MCM8 was graded as 0 (0%), 0.5 (focal positive), 1 (<20%), 2 (20\u201350%), 3 (50\u201380%) or 4 (>80%) based on % cells positive. The scores were the averages of 2 independent observers. Power analysis were performed based on the assumption that 75% mice xenografted with M8P#5 and M8D#1 without doxycycline treatment may die in 6 weeks, while mice treated with doxycycline may have a mortality of 27% in the same period. Thus, a total of 32 mice (3 weeks old) were used. All male mice severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice (Taconic, Germantown, NY) were chosen due to the relevance of prostate cancer. No randomization was performed due to inbred nature of the SCID mice. These mice were subcutaneously implanted at the abdominal flank with ~1 \u00d7 107 viable cells. The detailed procedure of xenograft tumor monitoring was described previously(25). All procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccessMatrix.htm). Hg19 CNV (SNP array, BI Genome-wide SNP 6) level 3 tumor sample data were collected for multiple cancer types: BLCA (bladder urothelial carcinoma), BRCA (breast invasive carcinoma), COAD (colon adenocarcinoma), ESCA (esophageal carcinoma), GBM (glioblastoma multiforme), LIHC (liver hepatocellular carcinoma), LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma), LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma), PAAD (pancreatic adenocarcinoma), PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma), LAML (acute myeloid leukemia), OV (ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma), THCA (thyroid carcinoma), UCEC (uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma), SARC (sarcoma), READ (rectum adenocarcinoma), DLBC (lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), HNSC (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma). CNV segments overlapped with the MCM8 gene were defined to be the MCM8 related CNVs. Fisher\u2019s exact test was applied to test whether amplification (with segment mean equal to or greater than 0.2) or non-amplification (with segment mean smaller than 0.2) status of MCM8 related CNVs was associated with the clinical information. Clinical information chosen included: ajcc_pathologic_tumor_stage (Stage I, II VS III, IV), ajcc_metastasis_pathologic_pm (M0 VS M1), lymph_nodes_examined_he_count (0 VS others), tumor_grade (G1, G2 VS others), residual_tumor (R0 VS others), pathologic_N (N0 VS others), pathologic_T (T2 VS higher), clinical_stage (Stage I, II VS others), gleason_score (for PRAD, <=7 VS higher), aggressive (new_tumor_event_dx_indicator is \u201cYes\u201d, lymph_nodes_examined_he_count is non-zero, lymph_nodes_examined is not 1 VS new_tumor_event_dx_indicator is \u201cNo\u201d, lymph_nodes_examined_he_count is non-zero, lymph_nodes_examined is not 0 or 1). For lymph_nodes_examined, Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied. These association p-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple comparisons. The samples were divided into A (red), and B (blue) group and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted. Groups were segregated based on MCM8 gain or non-gain status (figure 1) or MCM8 expression score\u22652 or <2 status (figure 2) or treated with or without doxycycline (figure 3). The p-value by the log-rank test was calculated to indicate the significant level of the difference between these two groups. The Yeast competent cell preparation and the procedure of Yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screening were described previously(64). Fresh AH109 competent cells (100 \u03bcl) were co-transfected with pBD-MCM8full (0.5 \u03bcg) and 0.5 \u03bcg DNA from prostate Yeast Two-Hybrid cDNA library constructed in pACT2. The transformants were plated on the high stringency selection plate (SD-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp). The grown colonies were then assayed for \u03b2-galactosidase as described previously (64). Thirty-one transformants were found positive for \u03b2-galactosidase and grown in most stringent selection condition. Through restriction enzyme cutting pattern analysis, 11 transformants were found unique. One of these transformants was identified as a clone containing cyclin D1 cDNA in frame with the activation domain of GAL4. GST-CDK4 was purchased from Abcam, Inc (Cambridge, MA), while GST-CDK4/cyclin D1 was from Signal Chem, Inc (Richmond, Canada). For GST protein, E. coli. harboring GST or GST-CDK4 were grown overnight in room temperature. The recombinant proteins were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 hours. GST was purified by glutathione column and diluted to 1 ng/ul with 1X kinase assay buffer provided by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling, Inc, Danvers, MA). This was followed by combining 25 \u03bcl GST or GST-CDK4 with 1 ng substrate (GST-Rb) with or without 25 ng of cyclin D1, or HisTAG-MCM8, or HisTAG- \u0394MCM8del261-290 or 2 ng of HisTAG-MCM8CBM in 1xkinase reaction buffer. The solutions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes. The reactions were terminated by adding 25 \u03bcl of 2N NaOH stop solution to each reaction well. The kinase activities were quantified using the kit and protocols of ADP-Glo\u2122 Kinase Assay from Promega, Inc, Madison, WI. For in vitro MCM8/cyclin D1/CDK4 binding assay, the following condition was used: 25 ng of each of HisTAG-MCM8, GST-cyclinD1 and GST-CDK4 produced from E.coli. were incubated with 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 12.5 mM \u03b2-glycerol phosphate at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. The products were then resolved in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."}, "28687665": {"pmid": "28687665", "pmcid": "PMC5551700", "title": "Mutation of the \u03b1-tubulin Tuba1a leads to straighter microtubules and perturbs neuronal migration", "abstract": "\nMutation of \u03b1-tubulin isotypes is associated with cortical malformations.

Inhibitory neurons or interneurons (INs) are a critical and complex population that regulates resulting brain networks. IN precursors in different brain structures can migrate long distances to reach their appropriate final targets. Embryonic IN precursors destined for the olfactory bulb (OB) originate mainly from the lateral ganglionic eminences and migrate long distances to arrive at their final position. Continuously, during adult life, new neurons are added in the granular cell layer (GCL) and periglomerular layer of the OB through the rostral migratory stream (RMS), allowing them to become integrated into the preexisting local olfactory circuitry. This is thought to be important for forming olfactory memories and represents an intensively studied topic. However, the regulation of neurogenesis and migration is not well understood. Cell displacement from regions of production may be an essential step to permit the correct integration and function of these INs.Neuronal migration to the OB is finely tuned by the synergistic action of cell-extrinsic and -intrinsic cues that contribute to the precise targeting of migrating neurons into the right layer of the OB at the correct time. There, they differentiate into GABAergic INs according to a well-defined sequence of maturation.Among the different cytoskeletal components that are crucial for neuronal migration, microtubules (MTs) are thought to support a wide range of functions, such as growth of the leading process and its dynamic reorientation and coupling of the nucleus with the centrosome during the saltatory movement of neurons (Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015; Kawauchi, 2015). In response to extrinsic signals, MTs are extensively remodeled during cell movement. MTs are cytoskeletal fibers that are dynamically assembled from heterodimers made up of evolutionarily conserved \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin subunits. Despite this high degree of conservation, \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulins are each coded by multiple genes, several of which are expressed in migrating neurons (Jaglin and Chelly, 2009; Reiner and Sapir, 2009). The study of the specific contribution of each of these tubulin isotypes during migration has so far been challenging, as they exhibit a high degree of homology. Indeed, different tubulin isotypes may be required for specialized MT functions in different cells and compartments (Tischfield and Engle, 2010).In recent years, the interest in the functional role of tubulin isotypes has strongly increased, as tubulin genes have been found mutated in human cortical malformations that are part of an emerging heterogeneous family known as the tubulinopathies. Alpha\u2013tubulin 1A (TUBA1A) mutations were among the first identified, leading to lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum agenesis, and, in rare cases, perisylvian asymmetrical polymicrogyria. Detailed analyses of fetal cases also identified agenesic or dysmorphic OBs. Thus, Tuba1a is likely to play a critical role in the formation of several brain areas, and its mutation may change the behavior of MTs to an extent that cannot be compensated for by other \u03b1-tubulin isotypes expressed in the same cells. Here, we sought to characterize molecular and cellular alterations induced by the S140G mutation of Tuba1a.We investigated a mouse model with a chemically induced Tuba1a missense mutation and report that this protein plays an important role in neuronal migration in the RMS. This mouse mutant has hippocampal and subtle cortical defects, but abnormalities in the RMS were never previously recognized. Our data show that the heterozygote S140G mutation is sufficient to produce a strong migratory phenotype in mutant mice, despite the fact that several other \u03b1-tubulin genes are also expressed in postmitotic neurons in the affected brain region. Histological and live-imaging studies using organotypic brain slices revealed a malformed RMS and OB, as well as distinctly altered characteristics of migration. Postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) electroporations of the same mutation demonstrated impaired nucleus\u2013centrosome (N\u2013C) coupling, directionality, speed, and branching. Using fluorescence imaging and structural-modeling studies, we demonstrate that these alterations are related to functional and structural MT defects. Finally, we demonstrate that Tuba8, another \u03b1-tubulin isotype previously associated with cortical malformations, has altered function compared with Tuba1a, thus highlighting the specificities of these \u03b1-tubulins. Our data pinpoint an essential, noncompensated key role of Tuba1a in the RMS, related to tubulin heterodimer structure and to MT integrity, critical in migrating neurons.To evaluate the consequences of the Tuba1a S140G mutation during neuronal migration, the RMS was analyzed in sagittal sections from adult control and Tuba1a-mutant mice. In contrast to control mice where the RMS appeared as a thin pathway (Fig. 1, A and C), we observed a large accumulation of cells within the RMS of Tuba1a-mutant animals (Fig. 1, B and D). The overall organization of the OB was preserved, but its size appeared greatly reduced (Fig. 1 B). In coronal sections, whereas in control mice the RMS remained thin all along the rostral\u2013caudal axis (Fig. 1 E), in Tuba1a-mutant mice, a cell accumulation was observed in the central part of the RMS (Fig. 1 F), with a concomitant rostral reduction in the number of cells, clearly visible at the level of the OB. Developmental studies in Tuba1a-mutant animals revealed subtle changes in the OB GCL already at embryonic (E16.5; Fig. S3, A and B) and early postnatal stages (Fig. S3, C and D). The RMS develops mainly postnatally (Pencea and Luskin, 2003), and anatomical alterations were clearly visible from P8 onwards (Fig. S3, E\u2013J). Embryonic cortical IN migration streams from the GEs also showed abnormalities in the mutant, with less INs reaching the dorsal telencephalon and hippocampal primordium (Fig. S1, A\u2013G). Measuring RMS thickness in the adult revealed a significant increase in size at two different rostrocaudal levels, RMS2 (75.4 \u00b1 7.2 \u00b5m in control vs. 350.8 \u00b1 9.8 \u00b5m in mutant mice; P < 0.001; Fig. 1 G) and RMS3 (76.4 \u00b1 12.2 \u00b5m in control vs. 269 \u00b1 23.9 \u00b5m in mutant mice; P < 0.001; Fig. 1 G). Conversely, the OB surface measured on sagittal sections was smaller in mutant compared with control mice (6.68 \u00b1 0.187 mm2 in control vs. 5.55 \u00b1 0.119 mm2 in mutant mice; P < 0.01; Fig. 1 H). Once they reach the OB, neuronal precursors settle mainly in the GCL. We observed a decrease in its surface in mutant mice (3.91 \u00b1 0.147 mm2 in control vs. 2.51 \u00b1 0.126 mm2 in mutant mice; P < 0.001; Fig. 1 I). Together, these data show consistent IN migration defects with a severe accumulation of cells in the Tuba1a-mutant RMS leading to a reduction of OB size related to the GCL in the mutant brain.We further characterized the identity of cells that accumulate in the RMS. Staining with the neuronal anti\u2013PSA-NCAM (polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule) antibody revealed a normal thin stream in control mice (Fig. 2, A\u2013C) but an abundance of PSA-NCAM\u2013positive (PSA-NCAM+) cells in the core of the mutant RMS (Fig. 2, D\u2013F). At higher magnification, PSA-NCAM+ neurons were observed to form chains of cells in the control RMS (Fig. 2 C, and Fig. S3, K\u2013N) but appeared more numerous and less directional in the mutant RMS2 region (Fig. 2 F) and unchanged in the RMS1 region (Fig. S3, K\u2013N). Neurons in chains migrate within glial corridors. When comparing these glial structures by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining, we observed a corresponding increase in the size of the astrocytic tunnels that surround the clusters of neurons in adult mutant animals (Fig. 2, G\u2013J). Glial defects were less obvious at early postnatal (P8) stages (Fig. S2, A\u2013D), despite the neuronal accumulation. We estimated the density of GFAP+ glial fibers in the RMS of adult control and mutant mice and observed a significant decrease in the RMS1 region and similar tendencies in RMS2 and RMS3 (Fig. S2, E\u2013K). Thus, the increase in size of the GFAP+ region is partially compensated by a decrease of fiber density, and larger dispersions of GFAP+ fibers are observed in mutant caudal regions.Furthermore, most cells migrating toward the OB are transiently present in the RMS and do not differentiate along its path (Luskin, 1993; Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994; Jankovski and Sotelo, 1996). Whereas migrating neurons in control brains rarely express calretinin, a marker of IN differentiation, many calretinin+ cells were found in the mutant RMS (Fig. 2, K\u2013M). The numbers of calretinin+ cells were quantified at four different rostrocaudal levels (RMS1, RMS2, RMS3, and RMS4; Fig. 2 N), and a tendency of decreasing densities from RMS1\u20134 was observed in control brains. At the RMS2 level, a significant increase of calretinin+ cells was observed in the Tuba1a mutant (37.33 \u00b1 10.6 cells in control vs. 171.91 \u00b1 24.95 cells in mutant mice; P < 0.001; Fig. 2 N). This suggests that slowed or blocked neurons in the RMS are able to continue an intrinsic program of maturation.To test whether the defect observed in the Tuba1a-mutant RMS is cell autonomous, we electroporated the SVZ of P0\u2013P2 WT mice with a construct expressing either GFP alone or GFP and the Tuba1a protein, with or without the S140G mutation, under the control of the doublecortin (Dcx) promoter (Fig. 3 G). This allowed us to test the expression of WT or mutant \u03b1-tubulin in GFP+ migrating neurons. The majority of cells electroporated with GFP only or with the WT Tuba1a construct migrated along the RMS and reached the OB (Fig. 3, A, B, D, and E), indicating no obvious effect of WT Tuba1a overexpression. On the contrary, the S140G mutation led to less GFP+ neurons reaching the OB and more retained at the beginning of the RMS (Fig. 3, C and F). Automated counting of GFP+ cells per region (Fig. 3 H, SVZ, RMS, and OB) showed that those expressing S140G were significantly increased in the SVZ and the RMS and reduced in the OB in comparison with the control constructs (Fig. 3 H). Together, these data show that a cell-autonomous defect of the S140G mutation leads to a phenotype in migrating neurons. Glial fibers in early electroporated brains resembled WT (Fig. S2, L and M), although glial defects that accumulate over time cannot be excluded in this model.To study more precisely the neuronal migration defects generated by the S140G mutation, WT mice were again electroporated with either Tuba1a WT or S140G-mutant constructs (as no difference was observed between GFP alone and Tuba1a WT-GFP previously). We analyzed migration in the RMS 5 d post-electroporation (dpe) by live imaging with a spinning-disk microscope. Control Tuba1a GFP+ cells migrated tangentially along the RMS within the normal stream (Fig. 4, A and C; and Video 1). Neurons expressing the S140G mutation migrated less uniformly, no longer parallel and unidirectional within the main stream as in the control (Fig. 4, B and D; and Video 2). In both conditions, individual neurons were numbered and tracked as shown in the displayed sequences (Fig. 4, A\u2013D). The speed of migration as well as directionality and branching were quantified from time-lapse videos. First, we quantified mean migration speed by tracking and performing instantaneous speed measurements. A significant decrease in the mean speed was observed for S140G-mutant neurons (90.3 \u00b1 2.79 \u00b5m/h for control vs. 74.4 \u00b1 2.14 \u00b5m/h for mutant; P < 0.001; Fig. 5 A). Similar defects in cortical IN migration speed were also observed in E12.5 GE explant cultures from WT and Tuba1a-mutant brains (Fig. S1 G). In the RMS, Tuba1a S140G-electroporated neurons showed abnormal directionality (Fig. 4, C and D). This was quantified by plotting each cell according to their angles deviating from the rostral direction, comparing positions at the beginning to the end of the sequence. Whereas a high proportion of control neurons (54%) migrate rostral and tangential to the stream (at 270\u00b0, rostral; Fig. 5 B), only 22% of the mutant neurons do this (Fig. 5 B, P < 0.001). Many Tuba1a S140G neurons migrated oblique and perpendicular to the stream and even backward (Fig. 5 B), confirming the initial observation of the more randomized migration direction in the mutant condition (Video 2).Analysis of WT neuron migration speed distributions revealed a potential bimodal distribution. This was assessed using Hartigan\u2019s dip test (P < 0.01) together with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The experimental data fitted with a Gaussian mixture model revealing two Gaussian curves (Fig. 5 C). The threshold between the two classes of migrating neurons was mathematically defined as the intersection between the two curves, occurring at 75.4 \u00b5m/h. We termed these slow (<75.4 \u00b5m/h) and fast (>75.4 \u00b5m/h) migrating cells (Fig. 5 C). As speed of migration has been associated with complexity of neuronal branching, individual neurons exhibiting fast and slow speeds were then classified according to four different categories, depending on the number of processes they exhibited during migration (one, two, three, or four processes; Fig. 5 D). Among control neurons, no significant difference in categories was observed between fast and slow migrating neurons (Fig. 5 E). For the mutant, we observed a modest but significant difference within categories 1 (slow migration, 70.3 \u00b1 3.3% of neurons vs. fast migration, 79.3 \u00b1 3.1% of neurons, P < 0.01; Fig. 5 E) and 2 (slow migration, 25.8 \u00b1 2.6% of neurons vs. fast migration, 18.7 \u00b1 2.9% of neurons, P < 0.05; Fig. 5 E). Indeed, slow mutant neurons are more complex than fast mutant neurons, and mutant neurons, in general, are more complex than control neurons.We also correlated morphology with directionality (unidirectional vs. non-unidirectional). Comparing even control migrating neurons between them revealed a significant decrease of category 1 (unidirectional, 83.1 \u00b1 6.2% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 43.1 \u00b1 6.4% of neurons, P < 0.001; Fig. 5 F) and increase of category 2 (unidirectional, 16.8 \u00b1 6.2% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 41 \u00b1 5.7% of neurons, P < 0.001; Fig. 5 F) neurons related to non-unidirectionality. Hence, less directionality is associated with increased branching complexity. Comparatively, in the mutant, the same trends were observed; significantly decreased non-unidirectional category 1 neurons (unidirectional, 67.8 \u00b1 4.9% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 22.1 \u00b1 5.5% of neurons, P < 0.001; Fig. 5 F) were replaced by higher complexity neurons (category 2: unidirectional, 32.1 \u00b1 4.9% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 47.3 \u00b1 6.2% of neurons, NS; category 3: unidirectional, 0% of neurons vs. non-unidirectional, 25.2 \u00b1 7% of neurons, P < 0.001; Fig. 5 F). Thus, mutant neurons show increased complexity associated with abnormal directionality. Abnormal neuronal complexity and directionality hence strongly contribute to the Tuba1a-mutant RMS phenotype. Further analyses (unpublished data) revealed that abnormal new branches can occur either from the soma or from the leading process with no differences between the genotypes.The cyclic repetition of elongation of the leading process, followed by nucleokinesis and retraction of the trailing process, generates a global forward progression of the neuron. Nucleokinesis in migrating INs depends strongly on synchronization with forward movement of the centrosome. To more precisely track the movement of the centrosome relative to the nucleus (measured from soma position), the distance separating these two organelles was assessed. For this, a PACT-mKO1 centrosome targeting vector was coelectroporated with Tuba1a WT and S140G-mutant constructs to label the centrosome with monomeric Kusabira Orange (mKO1) fluorescent protein. This allowed visualization of centrosome displacement during the migration cycle. Videos showed that, at the beginning of the cycle, the centrosome is very close to the soma and then progressively moves forward with the extension of the leading process (Fig. 6 A and Video 3). To complete neuronal movement, in most cases, the nucleus rejoins the centrosome followed by the advancement of the trailing process. Hence, migration is composed of the cyclic repetition of the separation and recoupling of the nucleus and the centrosome (Fig. 6 B). The oscillating cycle time and the distance between the edge of the soma and the centrosome were measured (Fig. 6 C and Videos 3 and 4). The automatized analysis of WT and mutant cells revealed a significant increase in the mean duration of the saltatory cycle (14.1 \u00b1 0.39 min for control vs. 15.9 \u00b1 0.53 min for the S140G-mutant construct; P < 0.01; Fig. 6 D) and in the maximum distance coupling the nucleus and the centrosome in the S140G-mutant condition (10.3 \u00b1 0.44 \u00b5m for control vs. 12.3 \u00b1 0.67 \u00b5m for the S140G-mutant construct; P < 0.01; Fig. 6 E). In most WT migrating neurons, a forward recoupling of the nucleus was observed, with only in rare cases a reversal of centrosome movement (Fig. 6 F and Videos 3 and 4). A significant increase of events when the centrosome moved backward to rejoin the nucleus was observed in mutant cells (3.2% for control vs. 11.4% for the S140G-mutant construct; P < 0.05; Fig. 6 G). This observation, as well as the N\u2013C distance, and the increased duration of the saltatory cycle indicate substantial perturbations in somatic regions likely to contribute to abnormal migration speed and directionality in the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition.To identify MT defects potentially contributing to these cell phenotypes, Neuro-2a cells were differentiated and transfected with an end-binding 3 (EB3)\u2013mCherry construct to track the plus ends of MTs during ongoing polymerization. MT polymerization dynamics were first monitored in the presence of Tuba1a WT or S140G constructs and then compared with experiments in which Tuba8 WT alone or in the presence of Tuba1a S140G was expressed in these cells. We wished to test whether Tuba8 could rescue the effects of the Tuba1a S140G mutation when present in the same cells.We analyzed two parameters: MT polymerization speed and MT straightness (Fig. 7, A\u2013E; and Videos 5\u20138). Both parameters were measured independently in the soma and in the neuritic processes. In the soma, the Tuba1a S140G mutation lead to increased polymerization straightness in comparison with control Tuba1a (Fig. 7 B and Table S1), whereas polymerization speed was not significantly altered (Fig. 7, C and E). Strikingly, Tuba8 led to an MT behavior that differed from both control and mutant Tuba1a in both the soma and the process, reducing straightness and increasing polymerization speed (Fig. 7, B\u2013E). Similarly, the combination of Tuba8 and Tuba1a S140G led to significantly different MT dynamics compared with Tuba1a S140G alone (Fig. 7, B\u2013E). Indeed, coexpression had a similar effect to Tuba8 overexpression alone. Thus, in most conditions tested, Tuba8 overexpression overrides the effects of Tuba1a when it is present in the same cell (Fig. 7 E). These results suggest functional specificities of Tuba1a versus Tuba8 related to their capacities of modulating dynamic parameters during MT polymerization.These data also demonstrate that the Tuba1a S140G mutation has functional consequences on growing MTs. The specific effects on straightness might contribute to alterations in N\u2013C coupling, as well as to increased branching. These defects are likely to affect the overall efficiency in speed and direction of neuronal migration.We further explored the impact of the mutation on the structure of the tubulin heterodimer by structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations (Fig. 8, A\u2013E; and Figs. S4 and S5). In our dynamics simulation, the time-dependent changes in values of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin subunits in WT and mutant dimers indicated that mutant \u03b1-tubulin, more so than \u03b2-tubulin, undergoes structural changes compared with WT (Fig. S4, A and B). Root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) calculate the flexibility of different regions in the protein: those that are highly flexible show a larger RMSF value, whereas those that are rigid show a lower RMSF value. We observed that the mutant shows slower dynamics in several important structural elements known to be involved in lateral and longitudinal MT contacts along the lattice compared with the WT protein (Fig. S4, C and D). Thus, the incorporation of mutant tubulin dimers is likely to induce changes in MT dynamics.Simulations further showed that mutant S140G induces a straighter conformation of dimers compared with WT, which adapts a slightly curved conformation in the nonpolymerized state. Fig. 8 A shows the superposition of time-averaged structures of WT (green) and S140G-mutant (red) proteins and shows a deviation between mutant and WT tubulin dimers. To further characterize their conformational flexibility, the intradimer angles subtended by the axes of \u03b1-core helix H7 and \u03b2-core helix H7 were computed. The resulting time-dependent angle changes between WT and mutant are shown in Fig. 8 B. The inset shows the probability of computed angular distributions over 25-ns simulations. The distribution is nearly Gaussian, showing a peak at an angle of \u223c22\u00b0 for WT and \u223c12\u00b0 for the S140G mutant (P < 0.001). The angle values indicate that the S140G mutant restricts the conformational flexibility of the tubulin dimer and favors a straighter conformation compared with WT.We further analyzed the mode of GTP interactions in Tuba1a WT (Fig. S5 A) and S140G mutant (Fig. S5 B). In WT heterodimers, S140, which is close to the GTP-binding site, stabilizes GTP in the active site by forming hydrogen bonds. In contrast, in the S140G mutant, the stabilizing interactions with \u03b1-GTP are lost, which results in the flipping of GTP in the active site (Fig. S5, A\u2013C). As a result, some of the native tubulin dimer interactions are lost (Fig. S5, A, B, D, and E). Determining the effects on the intradimer interface contacts, we demonstrated an alteration of the native contacts for the S140G mutant (Fig. S5, D and E), and the total number of intradimer interactions was also increased. This could lead to an increase in the overall stability of the mutant tubulin dimer, thus reducing its curvature. Indeed, further detailed analysis of the intradimer interface contacts revealed that the S140G mutant forms an additional buried salt-bridge triad between \u03b1:N98 and \u03b2:R251, as well as \u03b2:R162 (Fig. 8, C\u2013E). The strength of this salt\u2013bridge interaction increases the stability and proximity in this region (Fig. S5, F and G), indicating that the S140G mutation leads to closer and stronger intradimer interface interactions.Then, we compared the structures of Tuba1a and Tuba8. Superposing the models of these \u03b1-tubulins showed only slight changes in the core structure (Fig. 8 F). Next, we characterized the distribution of charges in the tubulin models by electrostatic analyses. We found unique charge differences between Tuba1a and Tuba8 (Fig. 8 G) in the H1-S2 loop, which is known to interact laterally with M-loop of the tubulin molecule in the adjacent protofilament (Sui and Downing, 2010). Whereas in Tuba1a the electrostatic distribution in the H1-S2 loop complements well with the M loop region because of its positive-charge distribution, in Tuba8 this region shows negative-charge distribution (Fig. 8 G). These electrostatic differences might result in different binding affinities of Tuba1a and Tuba8 within the MT lattice and thus provide the structural basis for the functional specificities observed in MT polymerization studies for Tuba1a and Tuba8.Altogether, our detailed analyses demonstrate for the first time the different functional contributions of specific isoforms of \u03b1-tubulin in neuronal cells. In particular, our molecular analyses show that mutant Tuba1a affects MT polymerization straightness and heterodimer stability, and the strict regulation of these parameters is clearly important for correct saltatory neuronal migration.To date, studies of Tuba1a-mutant mice focused on organizational defects in different brain structures such as subtle wave-like perturbations in the neocortex, a fractured pyramidal layer in the hippocampus, and abnormalities in the superior colliculus. These were attributed to defects in neuronal migration, considering the well-known functions of MTs in this process and the disorganized cortical lamination in human patients carrying TUBA1A mutations. However, little was known concerning molecular and cellular mechanisms affected by the expression of mutated TUBA1A. In light of potential functional redundancy between different \u03b1-tubulin isotypes, it is intriguing that single heterozygous mutations can have a significant effect on MT functions. According to expression databases (e.g., http://mouse.brain-map.org/), Tuba1a, Tuba1b, Tuba3a, and Tuba3b are expressed in the adult RMS, whereas Tuba8 is expressed in a subpopulation of cells in the OB. These isotypes often only differ by a few amino acids, and little is known about their specific functions. Transgenic lines and in situ hybridization for Tuba1a have demonstrated that most neuronal-committed postmitotic precursors along the RMS and in the OB are Tuba1a+ (and Sox2\u2212) from P0 to the adult stage.. Consistent with developmental studies showing that Tuba1a is expressed in \u03b23-tubulin\u2013 and MAP-2\u2013positive neurons, it hence appears that this protein is expressed in most early postmitotic neurons with no exception in the RMS/OB system.Our current study confirms and adds to a previous study that, despite the presence of different \u03b1-tubulin proteins, a heterozygote Tuba1a missense mutation in the mouse leads to a robust neuronal migratory defect. We also found that Tuba8 overexpression in vitro was able to counteract the effect of the Tuba1a S140G mutation. Hence, phenotypes would be expected to be different in coexpressing cells; however, this protein is not expressed in RMS migrating neurons. Recent data also show that the Tuba8-knockout mouse model presents no obvious defect in brain development but instead affected spermatogenesis. Specific molecular features may be expected for these two proteins, which we confirmed here by structural modeling.It still remains unclear whether the Tuba1a mutant represents a cell-autonomous consequence of Tuba1a S140G in neurons or whether non\u2013cell autonomous defects are also involved. The dispersed glial phenotype observed in the adult RMS could either contribute to the neuronal defects or be a consequence of neuronal accumulation in the RMS. Previous expression data have shown that Tuba1a is restricted to neuronally committed cells and not expressed in glial cells. Nevertheless, adult mutant mice present glial defects in regions where neurons do not accumulate abnormally (i.e., RMS1; Fig. S2, E\u2013K). The reasons for this are currently unclear, although glial directionality signaling cues such as Slit/Robo may be abnormal, or defects in the overlying corpus callosum and/or oligodendrocyte progenitor migration defects might also contribute to glial abnormalities. Further studies are needed to understand whether Tuba1a influences MT regulation in glial cells directly or whether these are influenced by surrounding cells.During neuronal migration, the extension of the leading process needs to be fine tuned, not only to provide directionality to the neurons, but also to constitute an anchor during the displacement of the soma (Solecki, 2012; Kawauchi, 2015). Biochemical studies have previously suggested that the S140G mutation leads to a reduction in the ability of the mutated tubulin to incorporate GTP, which is consistent with our modeling data. This may result in a declining efficiency of tubulin heterodimer formation or affect the structure of the tubulin dimer as we show here and, consequently, the MT lattice. Changed MT dynamics in neuronal cells could be detrimental for the rapid construction and deconstruction of the leading process, as well as for its stabilization, affecting migration. Altered MT dynamics could also be the origin of increased neuronal branching observed in Tuba1a S140G-mutant neurons, a phenotype described previously for migrating INs with mutations of different MAPs such as p27Kip1 or Dcx, which also affect dynamics by binding and stabilizing MTs. Less stable MTs have been associated with membrane intrusion and emergence of new growth cones, the origins of neuronal processes. Excessive branching in mutant neurons appears in both fast and slow migrating populations and indistinctly in both soma and collaterals in unidirectional and non-unidirectional migrating neurons (unpublished data). It could be one of the major causes for the lack of directionality, as well as potentially contributing to N\u2013C coupling defects to subsequently reroute the neurons from their main target, the OB.Based on the availability of novel structural data for tubulin within the MT lattice, we have modeled the impact of Tuba1a mutations into the structure of the \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulin dimer and demonstrated that the mutation straightens the natively curved dimer structure. This change in longitudinal curvature will potentially reduce the dynamics of the MT lattice, thus affecting architecture and function of the MT network. More stable dimers would also translate into straighter polymerized MTs in cells, which is what we observed with live imaging in differentiated cells. It has also been shown recently that more flexible MTs generated by acetylation of lysine 40 of \u03b1-tubulin become more resistant to breakage. However, MT breakage by severing enzymes such as Spastin and Katanin is a prerequisite for neuronal branching. Thus, in the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition, straighter MTs could be more susceptible to mechanical stress, breaking more often, and be at the origin of the excessive branching we observed.The precise and dynamic regulation of N\u2013C coupling is also a fundamental prerequisite for correct neuronal migration. Even subtle centrosomal dysfunction can cause massive IN migratory defects between the SVZ and OB. Koizumi et al. (2006) also showed abnormal nuclear translocation in the Dcx mouse mutant. In the case of the Tuba1a S140G mutation, less curvature of the heterodimer and an increased MT straightness in the soma may contribute to an increased amplitude and augmented duration of N\u2013C separation. Thus, less stable straighter MTs could affect the synchronization between nuclear and centrosome movements. Although migration for some specific neuronal subtypes and species might not require strict N\u2013C coupling, our results for RMS neurons show that lack of adequate N\u2013C oscillations contribute to their defective movement, characterized by increased pauses and slowed saltatory movements.Our data show direct consequences of the Tuba1a S140G mutation on MT straightness and polymerization, which are likely to account for pathological alterations of neuronal migration in the mouse brain. We cannot exclude that the observed phenotypes are not also partially related to secondary consequences of altered MT structure, such as defects in MT-based intracellular vesicle traffic. For instance, the Tuba1a mutation could have an effect on the turnover of receptors such as integrins, which are required to interact with the cellular environment, or guidance molecules such as Robo/Slits, netrins/DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), Prokineticin2, S1P1, or SDF1. This could potentially explain regional effects in the RMS. A possible deleterious cumulative effect of the Tuba1a S140G-mutant protein depending on the age of the neuroblast is also not excluded. Moreover, radial migration in the OB might also be affected, although in our experiments we observed no obvious defects in these migrating INs. Future studies could also address these questions.In summary, we have demonstrated how variations in an \u03b1-tubulin gene mutated in cortical malformations can lead to neuronal migration defects in mice. Notably, we identified diverse effects that are related to an underlying conformational defect of the tubulin dimer and which are likely to alter MT curvature, flexibility, and polymerization straightness. Also, we reveal for the first time that the tight regulation of MT flexibility might constitute a prerequisite for correct branching and N\u2013C coupling during saltatory neuronal migration, affecting speed and directionality. This work hence provides important new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying observed cellular defects. Conceptually, our work reveals how variations that generate apparently subtle alterations on the structure of tubulin molecules can potentially alter complex MT behavior in neuronal cells, thus leading to severe pathological conditions.The Tuba1a S140G (Jenna)\u2013mutant mouse line (provided by D. Keays, IMP, Vienna, Austria) has been described previously and is present on the C3H background. In brief, this mouse line was originally identified from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) behavioral screen based on a semidominant hyperactive locomotor phenotype. For electroporation studies, P0\u2013P2 RjOrl:SWISS mouse pups were obtained from Janvier Labs. Animals were maintained in standard conditions (12-h light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to dry food and water). All the experimental procedures were accomplished according to the European Community Council Directives (86/609/EEC) and European Union General Guidelines. Procedures were reviewed by the French Minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Enseignement Sup\u00e9rieur et de la Recherche and approved by a local ethical committee (agreement MESR 00984.02). Gad67-GFP mice were obtained from K. Obata\u2019s laboratory. Crosses were also performed with ubiquitous CAG-GFP reporter mice for certain video microscopy experiments.Adult mice were deeply anaesthetized with pentobarbital and intracardially perfused with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2. The brains were removed, postfixed overnight in the same fixative solution at 4\u00b0C, and then stored in PBS. For studies in mouse pups and embryos, animals were rapidly decapitated, and brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then, dissected brains were embedded in 3.5% agarose (Invitrogen) and 8% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich). 70-\u00b5m sagittal sections were prepared using a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica), and Nissl staining was performed on sections mounted on Superfrost slides (Thermo Fisher). The sections were analyzed with a brightfield microscope (Provis; Olympus) using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (CoolSNAP CF; Photometrics) with 2\u00d7 (NA = 0.08) and 4\u00d7 (NA = 0.13) objectives. Minimum contrasts were adjusted using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Immunostaining was performed on floating sections in 24-well plates. Sections were incubated with PBS supplemented with 10% bovine serum (Life Technologies) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (blocking buffer) for 1 h at RT and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies in blocking buffer: mouse IgM anti\u2013PSA-NCAM (clone 2-2B; Eurobio Abcys), rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (A11122; Life Technologies), chicken anti-GFP (AB16901; Millipore), rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (ZO334; Dako), and rabbit polyclonal anti-calretinin (7697; Swant). Sections were rinsed three times with PBS for 10 min and incubated at RT for 2 h with secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (Life Technologies). Nuclei were counterstained for 10 min at RT with 1 \u00b5g/ml DAPI dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were rinsed with PBS and mounted with Fluoromount anti-fade mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Stained sections were analyzed with epifluorescence (DM6000; Leica) with the following objectives: 4\u00d7 (NA = 0.1), 10\u00d7 (NA = 0.3), 20\u00d7 (NA = 0.7), and 40\u00d7 (NA = 1.25) linked with a CoolSNAP EZ CCD camera (Photometrics) controlled by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) or a confocal microscope (SP5; Leica) with a 40\u00d7 (NA = 1.25\u20130.75) objective controlled by LAS-AF software (Leica). Minimum contrast adjustment was performed using ImageJ software.For Nissl staining experiments, three to seven littermate animals per condition and per stage were studied from E16.5, P0, P8, P21, and adult. RMS thickness and OB and GCL surfaces were quantified from three sections per adult animal (five animals per condition). All values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM, and a Student\u2019s t test was performed.For calretinin staining quantification in the RMS, five control and four Tuba1a S140G-mutant littermate animals were studied; four rostrocaudal levels were selected along the RMS, and three adjacent slices per level were analyzed. The RMS was manually delineated with DAPI counterstaining. Automated countings were performed in four RMS regions with ICY Bioimage Analysis software using the Spot Detector plugin. All values are given as the mean of the number of calretinin+ cells per RMS \u00b1 SEM, and a Mann-Whitney test was performed.For GFAP quantification in the RMS, four control and three Tuba1a S140G-mutant littermate adult animals were studied; three rostrocaudal levels were selected along the RMS (RMS1, RMS2, and RMS3), and three adjacent slices per level were analyzed. The GFAP+ staining from each region within a region of interest (ROI; 75.8 \u00d7 75.8 \u00d7 21 \u00b5m) was converted to a 3D volume using the Surface module from Imaris software (Bitplane). All values are given as the mean of GFAP+ glial fiber volume in cubic micrometers per ROI \u00b1 SEM, and a two-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.For embryonic studies on GFP-positive brains, 20-\u00b5m serial coronal cryostat sections were prepared from frozen embryonic brains. Nine rostrocaudal levels were chosen for GFP analyses covering the lateral GE, medial GE, and caudal GE regions. Sections were imaged using a microscope (DM6000; Leica) with the following objectives: 4\u00d7 (NA = 0.10) and 10\u00d7 (NA = 0.3) linked to a CCD camera (CoolSNAP EZ; Photometrics) controlled by Metamorph software. For E13.5 migration distances, the region of the cortex studied was identified by drawing a horizontal line across the top of the GE. The reference distance was a line extended from this position to the apex of the cortex. The length of the GFP-positive migratory stream was then measured from the GE to the point where no further migrating neurons could be observed. The migration index was calculated from the ratio of this measurement to the reference distance. Coronal sections of E15.5 cortices were analyzed in the region of the developing hippocampus. Gad67-GFP\u2013positive cells in marginal zone, intermediate zone, SVZ, and ventricular zone migratory streams were observed, and individual cells were counted in a defined ROI (ROI = 300 \u00d7 300 \u00b5m).P0\u2013P2 RjOrl:SWISS mouse pups were anaesthetized on ice for 3 min before being maintained on a 4\u00b0C pad during the injection procedure. Mice were injected with the different plasmids directly into the lateral ventricle by transluminescence with an optical fiber (Leica). Approximately 2 \u00b5l of plasmid solutions at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l (in endotoxin-free Tris-EDTA buffer; Qiagen) was injected with a 3.5-in glass-pulled pipette (Drummond) connected to a 15-\u00b5l Hamilton syringe. The brain was placed between a 10-mm Tweezertrode (Harvard Apparatus), with the positive pole oriented toward the injected side. Five, 50-ms square-wave pulses of 100 V, with a latency of 950 ms, were given with an electroporator (BTX ECM 830; Harvard Apparatus). Reanimated mice were kept warm on a 37\u00b0C heated pad and quickly returned to their mother after the procedure. Electroporated plasmids were as follows: Dcx-ires (internal ribosomal entry site)-GFP; Dcx-Tuba1a S140G-ires-GFP obtained by subcloning Tuba1a S140G\u2013pET23 (gift from G. Tian, New York University, New York, NY) into the Dcx-ires-GFP vector; Dcx\u2013WT Tuba1a\u2013ires-GFP for control conditions, produced by PCR mutagenesis from Dcx\u2013Tuba1a S140G\u2013ires-GFP; Dcx-Tuba8-ires-GFP obtained after amplification of Tuba8 by PCR from adult mouse brain cDNA using the following primers: 5\u2032-AATTCACTAGATGCATCACCATGAGGGAATGCATATCGGTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGAGAGGGGCGGATCCTTAAAATTCCTCCCCCTCATTCTC-3\u2032 (the 1.35-kb PCR product was purified and cloned into pDcx-ires-GFP); and the pCAG-PACT-mKO1 vector (PACT domain of Pericentrin protein fused with the fluorescent protein mKO1), a gift from F. Matsuzaki (RIKEN CDB, Kobe, Japan) to track the centrosome.For GFP staining quantification in the OB, four P1 mouse pups electroporated with the GFP construct only, five P1 with the Tuba1a control construct, and five P1 with the Tuba1a S140G-mutant construct were studied; two sections per mouse were selected for all three conditions. The SVZ, RMS, and OB were manually delineated with DAPI counterstaining. The total number of GFP+ cells in the three regions (SVZ, RMS, and OB) was quantified to avoid cell density variability within each region. This unbiased automatic counting was performed with ICY Bioimage Analysis software using the Spot Detector plugin. All values are given as a mean of percentage of GFP+ cells per region \u00b1 SEM, and a two-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.For neuron migration analysis, 5 dpe, mouse pups were rapidly decapitated, and the brain was extracted. 150-\u00b5m sagittal brain slices were prepared with a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica) in cold HBSS (Life Technologies). Organotypic brain slices were mounted on a CM translucent membrane (Millipore) within a glass-bottom dish (Matek). Slices were perfused with the following culture medium: 46% MEM and 25% HBSS, supplemented with 25% horse serum, 2% 1 M Hepes, 6 mg/ml d-glucose, and primocin antibiotic (InVivoGen). The culture dish was placed within a thermostatic chamber maintained at 37\u00b0C. Time-lapse imaging was performed using an inverted confocal spinning-disk microscope (DMI4000; Leica) linked with a CCD camera (QuantEM:512c; Photometrics) controlled by Metamorph software. Typically, the slices were imaged from 12\u201324 h with a 20\u00d7 (NA = 0.4) long-distance objective (Leica), and images were captured every 5 min; each frame in the time-lapse videos was generated from a 20 \u00b5m\u2013thick z stack containing three separate images that were compressed into a single frame.For neuronal speed quantification, 140 neurons in both conditions were studied by measuring instantaneous speeds manually with Metamorph software independent of direction. All values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM, and a Student\u2019s t test was performed. To distinguish slow and fast migration, we first performed a Hartigan\u2019s dip test, confirming that the frequency distribution of migration speeds was not unimodal. Then, using the AIC, we showed that the best fitting model for the frequency distribution is bimodal (AIC = 1,376.8 for a bimodal distribution). The threshold between low- and high-speed migration was defined mathematically as the intersection of the two Gaussian distributions fitting the frequency distributions of instantaneous speeds. Migration was correlated with the number of processes exhibited by the neuron. Instantaneous speeds, grouped according to fast (>75.48 \u00b5m/h) and slow (<75.48 \u00b5m/h) migration, were classified according to the four categories of morphology (Fig. 5 D): category 1, one process; category 2, two processes; category 3, three processes; and category 4, four processes. A total of 90 neurons were studied for each condition from three independent experiments. All values are given as a percentage of slow and fast migrating neurons \u00b1 SEM represented in these four categories for both control and Tuba1a S140G-mutant constructs. A two-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.GE explant cultures were performed as previously described. Time-lapse imaging was performed using an inverted confocal spinning-disk microscope (DMI4000) linked with a CCD camera (QuantEM:512c) controlled by Metamorph software for 24 h with a 20\u00d7 long distance objective (Leica), and images were captured every 5 min. Neuronal speed quantifications were performed by automated tracking of cell bodies using the Imaris image analysis software. A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare WT and mutant means.For RMS migratory directionality quantification, each cell was plotted according to the angle formed between the beginning and end of the migratory sequence (from 0 to 360\u00b0 with ranges of 30\u00b0 and 0\u00b0/360\u00b0 corresponding to dorsal, 90\u00b0 to caudal, 180\u00b0 to ventral, and 270\u00b0 to rostral). A total of 90 neurons were studied for each condition from three independent experiments. All values are given as a percentage represented as a polar graph, and a \u03c72 test was performed.For morphology directionality\u2013related quantifications, we manually correlated each migratory step with the number of processes exhibited by the neuron and the type of migration (unidirectional, i.e., parallel to the main migratory stream, or non-unidirectional migration, i.e., not parallel to the RMS and perpendicular to the stream or reversing and switching direction) according to the four categories of morphology described in the first paragraph of this section. A total of 100 neurons were studied for each condition from three independent experiments. All values are given as a percentage of unidirectional or non-unidirectional migrating neurons \u00b1 SEM represented in these four categories for both control and Tuba1a S140G-mutant constructs. A two-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.For N\u2013C coupling quantification, we measured every 5 min (time separating two acquisitions) the distance that separated the front part of the nucleus (GFP+ soma used as the limit for delineating the nucleus) from the centrosome (stained with PACT-mKO1). Over time, these distances vary and can be represented as oscillations, as at the beginning of the saltatory cycle, the distance is minimal but becomes maximal when the centrosome moves forward in the leading process and then becomes minimal again when the nucleus rejoins the centrosome. Oscillations were studied using an automated analysis of cycles in Matlab. In brief, the variation of distance (\u0394d) between the centrosome and nucleus was computed for each time and categorized between increasing (\u0394d > 3 \u00b5m), unchanged (\u22123 \u00b5m < \u0394d < 3 \u00b5m), and decreasing (\u0394d < \u22123 \u00b5m) distance. A cycle was determined as a succession of increasing and decreasing distances. Cycles could be interrupted by periods of unchanged distance as long as these were consecutive. For each cycle, its duration and its amplitude (maximum distance to minimum distance) were subsequently retrieved. A total of 93 neurons were studied for the control condition and 79 neurons for the S140G-mutant condition from three independent experiments. All values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM, and a Student\u2019s t test was performed.To quantify the specific movement of the centrosome according to the migratory steps, we manually correlated all the cases when the nucleus joined the centrosome (= forward population) or on the contrary when the centrosome moved back to rejoin the nucleus (= backward population). A total of 30 neurons (94 cycles) were studied for the control condition and 40 neurons (158 cycles) for the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition from three independent experiments. All values are given as a percentage of neurons in these two classes (forward or backward) in both conditions, and a Fisher test was used.To image the polymerization dynamics of MTs, we cultivated Neuro-2a cell lines (ATTC) with DMEM + 10% FCS (Life Technologies) directly on glass-bottom dishes (Ibidi Biosciences). 2 d before transfection, cells were cultivated in the same medium but deprived of serum to differentiate the cells. Differentiated cells were recognized by the growth of processes. Then, cells were transfected with a normalized amount of total plasmids (3 \u00b5g) of Dcx\u2013WT Tuba1a\u2013ires-GFP, Dcx\u2013Tuba1a S140G\u2013ires-GFP, or Dcx\u2013WT Tuba8\u2013ires-GFP or Dcx\u2013Tuba1a S140G\u2013ires-GFP and Tuba8-ires-GFP together with EB3-mCherry vector (a gift from A. Andrieux, Institut des Neurosciences, Grenoble, France) using ExGen500 reagent (Euromedex) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 24 h later, EB3-mCherry time-lapse imaging was performed using an inverted confocal spinning-disk microscope (DMI4000) with a 63\u00d7 objective (NA = 1.4) linked with a CCD camera (QuantEM:512c;) controlled by Metamorph software for 4 min, and each frame in the time-lapse video was generated from a 0.6 \u00b5m\u2013thick z stack containing three separate images taken every second that were compressed into a single frame.For the MT polymerization quantification, the Track module from Imaris software was used to detect automatically the EB3-mCherry+ spots and track them over time. Different parameters were extracted, such as the speed of EB3-mCherry spots (by measuring the instantaneous speed of the spot) and the straightness of the EB3-mCherry polymerization (which is the total displacement of the spot divided by the length of the trajectory). For the studies in the soma, a total of 8,253 spots were tracked for the control condition, 8,933 spots for the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition, 8,450 spots for the Tuba8 condition, and 9,182 spots for the Tuba1a S140G + Tuba8 condition. For the studies in the processes, a total of 2,185 spots were tracked for the control condition, 1,450 spots for the Tuba1a S140G-mutant condition, 2,242 spots for the Tuba8 condition, and 3,065 spots for the Tuba1a S140G + Tuba8 condition. All the quantifications were performed from three independent transfection experiments. For both the polymerization speed and the polymerization straightness, all values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM in the two cellular compartments (soma and processes), and a one-way ANOVA test was performed followed by Bonferroni posthoc tests.The atomic coordinates for the WT tubulin dimer were obtained from the crystal structure of tubulin in the Protein Data Bank. The coordinates for missing residues in \u03b1-tubulin (42\u201344) were constructed using the Pymol software package (Schr\u00f6dinger). The hydrogens for heavy atoms were added by the leap program in the AmberTools13 package. Added hydrogens were energy minimized for 2,000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm. The partial atomic charges for GTP were obtained via quantum electronic structure calculations using the Gaussian 09 program (Gaussian Inc.) with the 6\u201331+G* basis set with the Hartree-Fock geometry optimization procedure. The atom-centered restrained electrostatic potential charges were determined by fitting the electrostatic potentials obtained from the calculated wave functions. The missing interaction parameters in the nucleotide were generated using the antechamber module in AmberTools.After relaxing the added atoms in the gas phase, the structure was solvated in a cubic periodic box of explicit 3-site TIP3P water molecules extending 12 \u00c5 outside the protein on all sides. The system was neutralized, and 150 mM KCl was used to maintain the ionic strength. Particle-Mesh Ewald sum with a 10-\u00c5 cutoff was used to treat the long-range electrostatics. The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain the bond lengths between heavy atoms and hydrogens. Then, the system was equilibrated for 10 ns in the NPT ensemble with a simulation time step of 2 fs and further simulated to generate 25-ns trajectory data for WT. In the equilibrated structure of the WT tubulin dimer, the S140G mutation was introduced in the \u03b1-tubulin, and the mutant tubulin was further equilibrated for 10 ns following the same procedure as described for WT. Subsequently, a simulation run of 25 ns was generated for the S140G-mutant protein. Both WT and mutant simulations were performed using the NAMD 2.10 package with an AMBERFF99SB force field. The data were saved at an interval of 2 ps for analyses.To compare the overall structural variations during WT and mutant simulations, RMSD for the backbone atoms for WT and mutant were calculated. RMSD values were calculated for each frame along the entire trajectory as a function of time with respect to the respective starting structure of the WT and mutant simulation. The C\u03b1 RMSF was calculated to detect the mean fluctuations of each residue during simulations. RMSF calculates the movement of each C\u03b1 around its mean position, indicating highly flexible regions with larger RMSF values and rigid regions with lower RMSF values.To characterize the conformational flexibility of the tubulin dimer in WT and mutant simulations, the intradimer angle subtended by the axes of \u03b1-core helix H7 and \u03b2-core helix H7 was calculated along the respective trajectories. The vector drawn along the \u03b1:H7 was termed as A^, and the vector drawn along \u03b2:H7 was termed as \u00a0B^. The intersection of the two vectors represents the intradimer bending angle of the tubulin dimer. We selected this angle because a relative translational motion was noted between \u03b1:H7 and \u03b2:H7 during simulations. The intradimer bending angle in the tubulin dimer was computed as \u0398=cos\u22121A^.B^/A^B^.The amino acid sequences of Tuba1a and Tuba8 were retrieved from the UniProtKB database (accession nos. Q71U36 [Tuba1a] and Q9NY65 [Tuba8]). The structures of Tuba1a and Tuba8 were homology modeled using the I-TASSER server using the crystal structure of \u03b1-tubulin from Protein Data Bank accession no. 4I4T chain A as a template. The structural superposition and structure-based sequence alignment were performed using University of California, San Francisco chimera software.The electrostatic analysis of Tuba1a and Tuba8 was calculated using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation implemented in the ABPS program. The structures were assigned the correct protonation state of residues using PROPKA, and the PQR files were generated using the PDB2PQR server. Electrostatic calculations were performed using the following parameters: ionic strength of 150 mM, ionic radius 1.5 \u00c5, dielectric constant for the protein interior 1, and dielectric constant in water 80.Fig. S1 shows cortical IN migratory defects in Tuba1a-mutant mice during embryonic development.

Supplementary Matlab code is available as a text file and contains the script that determines the N\u2013C distance during saltatory movements by detecting the start/stop of each cycle and retrieving both their amplitude and duration. If necessary, it also performs comparisons between two populations (e.g., WT and mutants)."}, "29045486": {"pmid": "29045486", "pmcid": "PMC5646851", "title": "Thiamine deficiency activates hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 to facilitate pro-apoptotic responses in mouse primary astrocytes", "abstract": "\nThiamine is an essential enzyme cofactor required for proper metabolic function and maintenance of metabolism and energy production in the brain. In developed countries, thiamine deficiency (TD) is most often manifested following chronic alcohol consumption leading to impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation and excitotoxicity. These biochemical lesions result in apoptotic cell death in both neurons and astrocytes. Comparable histological injuries in patients with hypoxia/ischemia and TD have been described in the thalamus and mammillary bodies, suggesting a congruency between the cellular responses to these stresses. Consistent with hypoxia/ischemia, TD stabilizes and activates Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) under physiological oxygen levels. However, the role of TD-induced HIF-1\u03b1 in neurological injury is currently unknown. Using Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, we have demonstrated that TD induces HIF-1\u03b1 expression and activity in primary mouse astrocytes. We observed a time-dependent increase in mRNA and protein expression of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory HIF-1\u03b1 target genes MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa during TD. We also observed apoptotic cell death in TD as demonstrated by PI/Annexin V staining, TUNEL assay, and Cell Death ELISA. Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 activity using YC1 and thiamine repletion both reduced expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1\u03b1 target genes and apoptotic cell death in TD. These results demonstrate that induction of HIF-1\u03b1 mediated transcriptional up-regulation of pro-apoptotic/inflammatory signaling contributes to astrocyte cell death during thiamine deficiency.\n", "fulltext": "Thiamine deficiency (TD) may occur in numerous conditions such as cancer and diabetes, or following bariatric surgery. Additionally, it may occur in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, although it is most prevalent in chronic alcoholics [2\u20135]. Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS) is a life-threatening consequence of TD occurring in up to 12.5% of chronic alcoholics. It is characterized by memory loss, motor dysfunction and ocular disturbances resulting from focal damage in the thalamus and mammillary bodies. Mechanistically, TD in alcoholism is multi-factorial involving poor nutrition, impaired coenzyme activation, and reduced intestinal absorption and renal transport [7\u20139]. It is estimated that ~30\u201380% of alcoholics have low circulating thiamine. Although acute TD symptoms can be successfully treated by thiamine administration, untreated TD leads to irreversible lesions that are unresponsive to treatment. A central feature in TD-induced neurological damage is severe deficits in cerebral metabolism through impairment of thiamine dependent enzymes [12, 13]. The resulting metabolic disruption leads to oxidative stress, inflammation, excitotoxicity, blood brain barrier dysfunction, cytotoxic edema, and apoptotic cell death [12, 14, 15]. Many effects of TD-induced metabolic disruption occur in astrocytes [16, 17]. TD disrupts neuron-astrocyte metabolic trafficking and induces focal lactic acidosis that further contributes to neurological damage. Additionally, astrocyte-specific morphological changes are an early marker of TD-induced damage [18, 19]. Since astrocytes are essential to maintenance of neuronal energy and metabolism, astrocyte dysfunction may contribute to TD-induced neurological injury. However, the fundamental elements that initiate cell death as a consequence of TD are unresolved. Recently, we have demonstrated that TD stabilizes Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) in the absence of ischemic stress. HIF-1\u03b1 is a stress response transcription factor that regulates expression of genes with pro-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and pro-survival functions. The consequences of gene regulation by HIF-1\u03b1 have been extensively investigated in ischemic stroke [22, 23]. Whether cells undergo apoptotic cell death or metabolic adaptation following ischemia is determined by both the severity of the insult and the cell type. In neuron/astrocyte co-cultures exposed to hypoxia, HIF-1\u03b1 expression mediated pro-survival responses in neurons, but pro-apoptotic responses in astrocytes. Acute neuronal HIF-1\u03b1 signaling promotes survival through metabolic reprogramming, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis through expression of genes such as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [24\u201327]. Pro-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and BCL2/Adenovirus E1B 19kDa Interacting Protein 3 Like (Nix) are also established targets of HIF-1\u03b1 and have been shown to induce apoptosis in an ischemic model [28, 29]. Other damaging responses such as inflammation have also been linked to chronic HIF-1\u03b1 activation through direct up-regulation of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP1) [30\u201332]. Comparable histological lesions in patients with hypoxia/ischemia and TD have been described in the thalamus and mammillary bodies, suggesting a congruency between the cellular response to hypoxic and TD stress [33, 34]. Thus, stabilization and persistence of HIF-1\u03b1 activity during TD may be a critical underlying initiator of apoptosis in astrocytes. It is unclear whether HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptional activation during TD may contribute to neurological damage, as previously described in ischemia. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to determine whether HIF-1\u03b1 activation during TD in mouse primary astrocytes may contribute to cell death through activation of pro-apoptotic proteins. The animal protocol was approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and was compliant with Guidelines for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health. Primary mouse astrocyte cultures were prepared from both male and female C57BL/6 mouse pups (Taconic Biosciences, Hudson, NY) as described by Schildge et al. with slight modifications. Within 48h of birth, pups were euthanized and cortices were dissected, minced and digested with 0.25% trypsin and 2.21mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Corning, Corning, NY) for 30min at 37\u00b0C. Trypsin was inactivated with 5mL RPMI 1640 media (Corning), and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 300xg for 5min at 4\u00b0C in an Allegra X-22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The supernatant was discarded, and pelleted cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 media and subsequently filtered through a 100\u03bcm cell strainer (Greiner Bio-one, Monroe, NC). The filtered suspension was centrifuged at 300xg for 5min at 4\u00b0C in an Allegra X-22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Supernatant was discarded and the pelleted cells were resuspended in 5mL RPMI 1640 media and subsequently filtered through a 40\u03bcm cell strainer (Greiner Bio-one). The filtered cell suspension was then seeded into RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Seradigm, Radnor, PA) and 0.1% gentamycin (Corning, Corning, NY) in an incubator at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 21% O2 at a density of ~3 brains in a T75 flask (Greiner Bio-one) with the media being refreshed after 24h. Mixed glia were maintained until they grew to full confluency, and then cultures were enriched for astrocytes by shaking at 180rpm in a Incubating Orbital Shaker (VWR, Radnor, PA) for 30min at 37\u00b0C followed by a media change and subsequent shaking for 6h at 260rpm. Following enrichment, cells were passaged into a T175 flask until they reached confluency, and were subsequently passaged for treatments. Characterization of glial and astrocyte cultures was performed by both Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry (S1 Fig). Custom formulated thiamine deficient RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), contains ~10nm thiamine (Data not shown). Therefore, this was not sufficient to achieve complete thiamine deficient conditions. While the use of dialyzed FBS may remove the majority of thiamine, other essential nutrients and growth factors are also lost. Therefore, thiamine deficiency was achieved using a thiamine pyrophosphate kinase-1 inhibitor, pyrithiamine hydrobromide (PT) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) which inhibits the conversion of thiamine to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate. While chemicals such as amprolium which inhibit thiamine transport may also induce thiamine deficiency, these have no effect on intracellular thiamine/thiamine pyrophosphate pools, which take long treatment periods to diminish. Pyrithiamine treatment is commonly used to reproducibly induce a series of pathological changes both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, pathological changes associated with TD in primary astrocytes were observed following treatment with 10\u03bcM pyrithiamine, the concentration used in this study [39\u201341]. Confluent astrocyte-enriched cultures were seeded into custom formulated thiamine deficient RPMI 1640 media (United States Biological, Salem, MA) and refreshed with 10\u03bcM PT containing media every 48h during treatments up to 14 days. For thiamine repletion experiments, primary astrocytes were treated with 10\u03bcM pyrithiamine for 4d (PT). Subsequently, 3\u03bcM thiamine- containing RPMI 1640 was repleted into the culturing media for up to 5d (5R) without the presence of PT. To pharmacologically inhibit HIF-1\u03b1 expression, 10\u03bcM YC1 was supplemented into PT containing media after a loading dose of 20\u03bcM for 24h. YC1 +/- pyrithiamine treatments lasted a total of 4d. A loading dose of YC1 was utilized prior to induction of thiamine deficiency to circumvent HIF-1\u03b1 induction during simultaneous treatment with PT. Cisplatin treatment was used to demonstrate that the effects of YC1 treatment were specific to the inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1, without corresponding non-specific effects on apoptotic cell death. Primary astrocytes were treated with 30\u03bcM cisplatin +/- 10\u03bcM YC1 for 48h, following a loading dose of 20\u03bcM YC1 for 24h. In each treatment condition, control cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 3\u03bcM thiamine for the duration of treatment. Additionally, treatment start times were staggered such that each treatment period concluded at the same time. Therefore, all dishes were maintained equally in culture to control for changes in cell confluency and media conditions. Gene expression was assessed using quantitative real time PCR analysis. RNA was extracted using the E.Z.N.A. Total RNA Kit I (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop 2000c Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and 1\u03bcg was reverse transcribed to cDNA with the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta BioSciences) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Changes in gene expression of the established HIF-1\u03b1 target genes LDHA, GLUT1, and VEGF, as well as the pro-apoptotic genes BNIP3, Nix, Noxa and MCP1 were evaluated by qRT-PCR using a LightCycler 480 II (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Gene specific primers were designed using the Roche Universal Probe Library assay design center to correspond with a specific hydrolysis probe labeled at the 5\u2019 end with fluorescein (FAM) listed in Table 1. Actin was used as a housekeeping gene, with probe and primer from the Roche Applied Science reference assay kit. Changes in gene expression were calculated using 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method, with an assumed efficiency of 2 for relative quantification. Changes are expressed as the fold change relative to untreated samples. To assess changes in protein expression and localization, primary astrocytes were harvested as whole cell lysates (WCL) or nuclear lysates for Western blot analysis as previously described. WCL (50\u03bcg) and nuclear lysates (25\u03bcg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in tris buffered saline-tween 20 (TBS-T) for 3 h at 4\u00b0C. The membrane was immunoblotted for HIF-1\u03b1 (GeneTex Cat# GTX127309 also ENCAB052WQI RRID:AB_2616089), HIF-2\u03b1 (GeneTex Cat# GTX30123 RRID:AB_386038), LDHA (GeneTex Cat# GTX101416 RRID:AB_10726413), \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# A2228 RRID:AB_476697), p84 (GeneTex Cat# GTX70220 RRID:AB_372637), p53 (GeneTex Cat# GTX28590 RRID:AB_1241148), BNIP3L (Nix; GeneTex Cat# GTX111876 RRID:AB_2036357), Noxa (GeneTex Cat# GTX85521 RRID:AB_10725878), CCL2 (MCP1; GeneTex Cat# GTX48813 RRID:AB_11169950), Caspase-3 (GeneTex Cat# GTX110543 RRID:AB_10722709), Bax (GeneTex Cat# GTX61026 RRID:AB_10619997), Bid (GeneTex Cat# GTX22388 RRID:AB_368032), Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (Parp; GeneTex Cat# GTX26079 RRID:AB_367420), NeuN (GeneTex Cat# GTX30773 RRID:AB_1949456), Iba1 (GeneTex Cat# GTX100042 RRID:AB_1240434), GFAP (GeneTex Cat# GTX108711 RRID:AB_2037091), or BNIP3 (Abcam Cat# ab38621 RRID:AB_725737) for 24 h at 4\u00b0C (BNIP3, Nix, Noxa) or overnight at 4\u00b0C. Blots were washed 3 times each for 10 min in TBS-T, and then immunoblotted with 1:20,000 goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA), 1:10,000 (BNIP3, Nix, Noxa) or 1:20,000 goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were visualized using Supersignal West Pico (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and captured with a Fluorchem HD2 digital imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Densitometry was performed using Fluorchem SP software. DNA fragmentation was assessed with the Apo-BrdU Tunel Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for both flow cytometry and microscopy applications. To analyze cells by flow cytometry, 1x106 cells were fixed in 1% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were centrifuged at 300xg in an Allegra X-22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter), washed with ice cold PBS and centrifuged again. Supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol and incubated overnight at -20\u00b0C. Cells were centrifuged at 300xg in an Allegra X-22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter) and washed with PBS to remove ethanol. Pelleted cells were resuspended in DNA-labeling solution supplied by the kit and incubated for 60min at 37\u00b0C with shaking every 15 min. Cells were rinsed in buffer supplied by the manufacturer and centrifuged at 300xg for 5 min in an Allegra X-22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Cells were then incubated in antibody staining solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature protected from light. Additionally, propidium iodide/RNase A staining buffer was added, cells were incubated for 30 min protected from light. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a CyAn ADP analyzer (Beckman Coulter) with fluorescence emission at 530nm and 575nm. Data were analyzed using FlowJo v. 10 software (RRID:SCR_008520; FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR). For the microscopy application, cells were grown on chamber slides (BD Falcon, Corning, NY) and fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Slides were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 70% ethanol at -20\u00b0C overnight. Fixed cells were stained with 17\u03bcM DAPI for 10 min protected from light, washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with DNA-labeling solution supplied with the kit for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were rinsed and stained with antibody staining solution supplied by the kit for 30 min at room temperature protected from light. Images were captured using an Axio Observer.A1 Inverted Microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany). For quantitative determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS (Roche LifeScience, Indianapolis, IN) was utilized following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer supplied by the kit for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. Lysates were collected and centrifuged at 200xg for 10 min at 4\u00b0C in a Microfuge 22R Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Supernatant was added to the supplied microplate in duplicate along with Immunoreagent for 2h at room temperature with shaking at 300rpm. At the end of the incubation period, the solution was removed and plates were washed 3 times each with incubation buffer. Additionally, ABTS solution was added to each well and left for 10 min at room temperature with shaking at 250rpm. Finally, ABTS stop solution was added, and the absorbance at 405nm was measured using a SpectraMax M2 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA). To assess phosphatidylserine translocation to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane as a marker of apoptotic cell death, the FITC Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Invitrogen) was used following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 1x106 cells were harvested, washed in ice cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 500xg in an Allegra X-22R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Cells were resuspended in 1X annexin-binding buffer supplied by the kit, and sample was stained for 15 min at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, cells were diluted in additional 1X annexin-binding buffer and kept on ice. Staining was analyzed by flow cytometry using a CyAn ADP analyzer (Beckman Coulter) with fluorescence excitation and emission at 530nm and 575nm, respectively. Data were analyzed using FlowJo v. 10 software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR). All experiments were performed with three independent replicates unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was evaluated among groups using a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test with a significance level of p<0.05 using GraphPad Prism 6\u00ae (GraphPad Software; La Jolla, CA). Induction of thiamine deficiency in mouse primary astrocytes resulted in an ~3 fold increase in total HIF-1\u03b1 expression as early as 24h of pyrithiamine (PT) treatment, which was maintained with minimal fluctuation in expression for up to 14 days (Fig 1A and 1B). Additionally, nuclear localization of HIF-1\u03b1 increased as early as 8h after exposure to PT and was also maintained up to 14 days (Fig 1C and 1D). In contrast, no change in total protein or nuclear localization of HIF-2\u03b1 was observed (Fig 1A\u20131D) In these same conditions, mRNA levels of the established HIF-1\u03b1 target genes LDHA, GLUT1 was significantly increased ~2 fold (Fig 1E). Transcript levels of the target gene VEGF increased ~10 fold by day 14 (Fig 1E). There was no observed change in total p53 expression (Fig 2A and 2C) or nuclear localization (Fig 2B and 2D) after 14 days of PT treatment. Protein expression of the pro-apoptotic p53 target gene Bax was not altered, while Bid expression significantly increased ~2.5 fold (Fig 2A and 2C). In contrast, Fig 3 demonstrates that both protein and mRNA expression of various pro-apoptotic HIF-1\u03b1 target genes increased following PT treatment. Specifically, protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine MCP1 increased ~3 fold, while pro-apoptotic BNIP3 protein levels increased up to 8 fold (Fig 3A and 3B). Similarly, protein levels of Nix increased up to 8 fold, while Noxa protein levels increased ~6 fold after 14 days of PT treatment (Fig 3A and 3B). Fig 3C demonstrates a significant increase in mRNA levels of MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa as compared to the untreated control. To achieve thiamine repletion following TD, astrocytes dosed with 10\u03bcM PT for 4 days were switched to normal (control) RPMI media containing 3\u03bcM thiamine (no PT) for up to an additional 5 days. Within 1 day of thiamine repletion following PT treatment a significant reduction in HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels was observed that returned to control levels by day 5 of repletion (Fig 4A and 4B). The HIF-1\u03b1 target gene LDHA was induced by thiamine deficiency, and subsequently reduced following thiamine repletion, although the protein did not return to control levels (Fig 4B). Furthermore, the expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1\u03b1 target genes was reduced following thiamine repletion. Noxa protein levels were significantly reduced following 24 h thiamine repletion, while BNIP3 protein was returned to control levels after 5 days repletion (Fig 4B). Although MCP1 and Nix protein levels were significantly reduced after thiamine repletion, they did not return completely to control levels after 5 days of repletion (Fig 4B). Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 was achieved using YC1, which reduces HIF-1\u03b1 protein stabilization and transcriptional activity [43, 44]. After pre-treatment of astrocytes with a loading dose of 20\u03bcM YC1 for 24 h, 10\u03bcM YC1 was then supplemented into control (3\u03bcM thiamine) or PT containing media for a total of 4 days. In samples supplemented with 3\u03bcM thiamine and YC1, there was no significant change in expression of the proteins evaluated as compared to control samples (Fig 5A and 5B). In contrast, YC1 treatment significantly suppressed HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization and attenuated protein expression of the HIF-1\u03b1 target gene LDHA during PT treatment (Fig 5A and 5B). Additionally, YC1 was sufficient to minimize expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1\u03b1 target genes during PT treatment (Fig 5). A significant reduction in the protein expression of MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa was observed with PT and YC1 treatment compared to PT treatment alone (Fig 5A and 5B). Thiamine deficiency induced expression of pro-apoptotic proteins that was inhibited by YC1 treatment and reduced following thiamine repletion (Fig 6). Cleaved Caspase-3 levels were significantly increased ~4 fold with PT treatment compared to the untreated control, while cleaved Parp expression was significantly increased ~3 fold (Fig 6A and 6B). Although Parp and Caspase-3 cleavage was significantly reduced, protein expression did not return to control levels following 5d of thiamine repletion (Fig 6C and 6D). Inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 activation through YC1 treatment was sufficient to block the cleavage of Caspase-3 and Parp (Fig 6E and 6F). DNA fragmentation was determined by a TUNEL assay where hydroxyl ends of damaged DNA were specifically labeled with dUTP. Fig 7A depicts representative plots generated by flow cytometry of all treatment groups subjected to the TUNEL assay. A shift of the cell population to the right side of the plot represents increased TUNEL staining, and therefore increased DNA fragmentation as seen in the PT treated group (Fig 7A). Quantification of TUNEL stained cells from each independent flow cytometry replicate reveals a statistically significant increase in DNA fragmentation in the PT treated group relative to control or YC1 treated cells (Fig 7B). Thiamine repletion for 2 days reduced DNA damage relative to PT treatment, although the change was not statistically significant (Fig 7B). Immunofluorescence images of the astrocytes subjected to the TUNEL assay visually confirm DNA fragmentation in PT treated cells, which was not observed following YC1 treatment or thiamine repletion (Fig 7C). Similarly, a significant increase in nuclear fragmentation into nucleosomal units was induced by PT treatment as demonstrated by the Cell Death ELISAPLUS kit (Fig 7D). This effect was also significantly inhibited through YC1 treatment, and significantly reduced with thiamine repletion for 2 days (Fig 7D). Additionally, treatment with 30\u03bcM cisplatin for 48h was used to demonstrate that YC1 treatment did not reduce apoptosis without co-occurring inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1. Cisplatin treatment induced nucleosomal fragmentation, which was not significantly altered with simultaneous YC1 treatment (Fig 7E). Finally, Fig 7E demonstrates representative plots generated by flow cytometry of all treatment groups subjected to PI/Annexin V staining. A shift of the cell population to the right side of the plot represents increased Annexin V staining, and therefore increased phosphatidyl serine translocation to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane as seen in the PT treated group (Fig 7E). Quantitation of flow cytometry replicates reveals that Annexin V staining was significantly increased following PT treatment, and significantly reduced following YC1 treatment and thiamine repletion (Fig 7F). The consistency between TD and hypoxia/ischemia (H/I) is apparent with many cellular responses centralizing on HIF-1\u03b1 activity. For instance, HIF-1\u03b1 regulation of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) lead to edema and blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption during ischemia [45, 46]. Focal edema during TD also correlates with increased expression of AQP-4 and MMP9 [40, 47]. Neuronal expression of the HIF-1\u03b1 regulated chemokine MCP1 is induced in both H/I and TD [32, 48, 49]. Our findings have for the first time directly correlated HIF-1\u03b1 activation during TD to expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and subsequent apoptotic death in primary mouse astrocytes. A related protein HIF-2\u03b1 is also responsible for regulating the cellular hypoxic response. Although each protein recognizes the same consensus sequence, cell-type expression and activity of HIF-2\u03b1 is significantly more restricted [50, 51]. We found that HIF-1\u03b1 was stabilized in TD, however no induction of HIF-2\u03b1 was observed. Both HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 are stabilized by the loss of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) activity in H/I, although it appears in the context of TD that additional distinct regulatory mechanisms may be involved [22, 52]. Studies in renal carcinomas have demonstrated that BNIP3 expression correlates positively to HIF-1\u03b1 activity, but negatively to HIF-2\u03b1 suggesting distinct roles in apoptotic signaling as well. Furthermore, a study in hepatocytes demonstrated a correlation between p53-mediated apoptotic death and HIF-2\u03b1 expression, neither of which were observed in the primary mouse astrocytes during TD in this study. H/I studies have demonstrated that acute HIF-1\u03b1 activation is protective through increased oxygen availability due to the promotion of angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming to an aerobic shift [54, 55]. Direct HIF-1\u03b1 trans-activation of VEGF mRNA results in increased angiogenesis and subsequent oxygen availability. This is consistent with our work in mouse primary astrocytes, and previous studies in SK-N-BE cells which demonstrate an increase in VEGF mRNA during TD. TD-mediated HIF-1\u03b1 activation and up-regulation of VEGF may explain the clinical observation of high circulating VEGF and cerebral blood flow hyperperfusion observed in TD patients and rodent models [57\u201359]. HIF-1\u03b1 signaling also attempts to preserve metabolism through regeneration of NAD+ via LDHA activity and maintenance of ATP production via rapid glycolysis. HIF-1\u03b1 mediated up-regulation of GLUT1 and LDHA promotes rapid glycolysis and reduces oxidative phosphorylation. Likewise, up-regulation of GLUT1 and LDHA in mouse primary astrocytes as a direct consequence of HIF-1\u03b1 activation is consistent with established metabolic sequalae during TD. The observed alterations to glucose metabolism result in impaired ATP production in astrocytes, and impact the metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons. An increase in glucose utilization was found in TD animals that correlated with the onset of neuronal damage. Additionally, lactate accumulation via LDHA activity is an established metabolic consequence of TD in astrocytes that also contributes to neuronal death and the formation of histological lesions. Recent evidence suggests that lactic acidosis increases Aquaporin-4 protein expression and plasma membrane localization in astrocytes leading to cellular swelling, increased BBB permeability, and subsequent edema. Additionally, astrocyte swelling is associated with increased glutamate release resulting in glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity which has been implicated in neuronal cell death in TD. Glucose administration to TD patients further increases focal lactate production and LDHA expression in TD-vulnerable brain regions contributing to the precipitation and exacerbation of symptoms. Overall this suggests that loss of astrocyte energetic integrity due to HIF-1\u03b1 mediated metabolic reprogramming may contribute to neuronal injury and explain the clinical and biochemical manifestations of TD. In contrast to its pro-survival function, HIF-1\u03b1 mediated apoptosis is associated with chronic activation. Apoptosis during H/I is related to HIF-1\u03b1 trans-activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins BNIP3, Nix and Noxa [67, 68]. However, the increase in Noxa protein levels in astrocytes during TD did not appear to be linked to increased mRNA levels. Aside from transcriptional regulation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Noxa can be suppressed in response to cell stress. Similar to our observations in TD, Noxa protein levels rapidly increased in response to ischemic stress, while the transcriptional response was delayed. Further work is necessary to understand whether TD can suppress proteasome activity as a contributing factor to Noxa induction. Induction of BNIP3 and Nix expression induces plasma membrane permeability, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, pore opening, and increased ROS generation. Consistent with H/I, cell death and expression of BNIP3, Nix and Noxa were attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 during TD in astrocytes. Noxa suppression was sufficient to rescue cells from H/I death, and decrease injury in vivo. TD-induced apoptosis was suppressed by YC1 treatment, although the effects of thiamine repletion are less straightforward. Following thiamine repletion apoptotic cells are no longer detected, though it is unclear whether apoptosis is reversed to promote cell growth, or whether it merely halts the further progression of damage. YC1 is an established inhibitor of HIF-1\u03b1, although it was initially developed as a soluble guanyl cyclase (sGC) activator with effects on vasodilation. While studies have identified protective effects of YC1 through inhibition of glutamate-mediated toxicity, superoxide production, and pro-inflammatory activators, these are independent of sGC activation. To date, limited studies have demonstrated anti-apoptotic effects of YC1 mediated through activation of the sGC pathway. Our results demonstrate that YC1 had no impact on cisplatin induced apoptotic death, suggesting the reduction in apoptosis by YC1 during TD was mediated through HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 may be a potential therapeutic target to limit TD-induced neurological damage. This strategy has already been investigated for treatment of H/I, and may therefore be adapted to TD related conditions. Mechanistically, how TD induces HIF-1\u03b1 may involve accumulation of pyruvate and lactate, ROS, or signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway [73\u201375]. Lactate and pyruvate accumulation stabilizes HIF-1\u03b1 in the absence of ischemia. This is in contrast to canonical HIF-1\u03b1 activation, which occurs in H/I due to PHD inactivation. Hydroxylation of specific proline residues in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1\u03b1 facilitates binding of the von Hippel Lindau protein which acts to ubiquitinate the protein for degradation [76, 77]. Due to structural similarities of pyruvate and lactate to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, a required cofactor for PHD activity, an abundance of these metabolites stabilizes HIF-1\u03b1. While ischemic activation of HIF-1\u03b1 occurs rapidly within 4h of treatment, our data demonstrates TD-induced HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization within 8h. While this is still a rapid response, the difference may reflect the time required to achieve loss of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and sufficient pyruvate accumulation. Reduced activity of the thiamine dependent enzyme PDH and up-regulation of LDHA during TD is consistent with increased pyruvate and lactate in patients [12, 79]. Alternatively, an increase in ROS generated by complex III of the electron transport chain (ETC) has been implicated in HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization following H/I. An abundance of ROS is a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction in TD brains [11, 80]. A reduction in \u03b1-KGDH activity induces mitochondrial uncoupling and oxidative stress in astrocytes. ROS-mediated HIF-1\u03b1 activation limits flux through the ETC as a pro-survival response to combat oxidative stress. Activation of the Akt/PI3K signaling pathway may also contribute to HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization. Akt/PI3K plays an important role in regulating nutrient homeostasis, and promoting cellular survival in nutrient deficient conditions. Studies in breast cancer cells have observed no change in Akt total protein or phosphorylation following TD, suggesting this may not effect HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization. However, the role of Akt in TD still needs to be investigated in a primary cell model. This work has identified a potential underlying transcriptional regulator that centralizes on many cellular responses occurring during alcohol and TD neurological injury (Fig 8). Interestingly, ethanol induced HIF-1\u03b1 signaling is recognized as a mediator of Alcoholic Liver Disease [84\u201386]. In hepatocytes, CYP2E1 mediated ethanol metabolism increases oxygen consumption to induce a hypoxic microenvironment and produce ROS. Pretreatment of mice with a HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor before ethanol ingestion correlated with a reduction in apoptosis, confirming an important contribution for HIF-1\u03b1 mediated hepatotoxicity. CYP2E1 has also been associated with ethanol mediated neurotoxicity. High CYP2E1 expression in the hippocampus and cortex is observed in alcoholic patients and brain CYP2E1 was inducible after ethanol consumption in animal models [89, 90]. Increased HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA and protein in the cortex have been observed in a rat model of chronic alcohol ingestion. The concomitant induction of HIF-1\u03b1 via ethanol metabolism and associated TD in multiple brain regions may provide insight into the increased progression of damage in rats fed both ethanol and TD diet compared to either alone. Overall, this suggests that astrocyte cell death in either uncomplicated alcoholism or in conjunction with TD may centralize with a HIF-1\u03b1 mediated transcriptional response and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic/inflammatory genes. Due to the important role for astrocyte integrity in neuronal survival, these findings suggest that TD-induced HIF-1\u03b1 may contribute to neuronal cell death in TD. Moreover, along with thiamine administration, use of HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors such as YC1 may limit TD associated astrocyte death, similar to that following stroke."}, "30442153": {"pmid": "30442153", "pmcid": "PMC6236981", "title": "Ca2+-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress correlation with astrogliosis involves upregulation of KCa3.1 and inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nThe intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 was recently shown to control the phenotype switch of reactive astrogliosis (RA) in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD).\n\n\nMethods\nKCa3.1 channels expression and cell localization in the brains of AD patients and APP/PS1 mice model were measured by immunoblotting and immunostaining. APP/PS1 mice and KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice were subjected to Morris water maze test to evaluate the spatial memory deficits. Glia activation and neuron loss was measured by immunostaining.

The KCa3.1 channel was shown to regulate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through an interaction with the Ca2+ channel Orai1 in primary astrocytes. Gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 protected against SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and ER stress via the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in astrocytes. Importantly, gene deletion or blockade of KCa3.1 restored AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling both in vivo and in vitro. Consistent with these in vitro data, expression levels of the ER stress markers 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, as well as that of the RA marker glial fibrillary acidic protein were increased in APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Elimination of KCa3.1 in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice corrected these abnormal responses.

Reactive gliosis, including microglia activation and astrocyte reactivation, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD, both in transgenic rodent models and human patients [1, 2]. During the onset of AD, abnormal A\u03b2 metabolism has a profound effect on the local community of neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), while in the developmental stage of disease, the inflammatory response of reactive glial cells contributes to neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation. In neurons, A\u03b2 peptides induce neurotoxic effects that are mediated via deregulation of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis, which results in synaptic loss. However, little is known about the role of A\u03b2 in the regulation of astrocytic Ca2+ homeostasis and subsequent pathological influences. Stimulation of A\u03b2 in primary astrocytes triggers elevations in [Ca2+]i and the formation of reactive oxygen species, which are associated with metabolic failure of astrocytes and may directly induce neuronal loss [3\u20135]. Notably, spontaneous [Ca2+]i accumulation has been identified in astrocytes of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice in vivo, independent of neuron hyperactivity. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) regulates [Ca2+]i homeostasis and protein folding. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) channels, which are complexes composed of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1, an ER calcium sensor) and calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (Orai1, a pore-forming protein), can be activated by the depletion of Ca2+ stores in the ER. SOCE plays an essential role in the activation of non-excitable cells, including astrocytes and microglia, via triggering Ca2+ influx. Disruption of protein folding in the ER triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) via activation of three ER pathways: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) [9, 10]. The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) dissociates from PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 during ER stress, and then initiates proapoptotic signaling via activation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Accumulating evidence suggests that Ca2+-dependent ER stress is correlated with reactive astrogliosis (RA) in both an AD mouse model and ischemic stroke [11, 12]. In addition, the intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 is reported to be involved in cisplatin-initiated acute kidney injury and the phenotypic switch of RA in ischemic stroke via attenuation of ER stress. KCa3.1 regulates K+ efflux and subsequent Ca2+ entry via hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. The KCa3.1 channel has been investigated as a therapeutic target in neurodegeneration diseases, vascular restenosis, and autoimmune diseases [15\u201317]. Our group recently reported that KCa3.1 inhibition significantly ameliorated neuronal loss, RA, microglial activation, and memory deficits in both APP/PS1 mice and senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice [15, 18]. KCa3.1 also plays a key role in mediating A\u03b2-induced RA, which includes activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (MAPK/JNK) signaling pathway and upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Blockade of KCa3.1 channels with triarylmethane-34 (TRAM-34) was shown to attenuate microglial-dependent indirect neurotoxicity in vivo, which emphasizes the role of Ca2+ in the process of neuroinflammation [19, 20]. Collectively, these data clearly demonstrate that KCa3.1 presents a potential therapeutic target in AD. Therefore, the aim of present study was to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of A\u03b2-mediated ER stress in RA and to identify key molecules involved in the regulation of RA-induced neurotoxicity. We report that Ca2+ overload induces ER stress in primary astrocytes and ER stress is increased in AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mice. Blockade or gene deletion of KCa3.1 decreased SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and attenuated ER stress via the protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathway in primary astrocytes, which is essential to protect neurons against RA-induced neurotoxicity. We also show that the absence of KCa3.1 channels attenuated ER stress, gliosis, neuroinflammation, memory deficits, and neuronal loss in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice. These results reveal an important correlation between KCa3.1 activation and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 AD mice, suggesting that KCa3.1 may be an effective therapeutic target in AD. Frozen tissues and paraffin-embedded brain slices from the hippocampi of postmortem human samples of control and AD patients were obtained from the Netherlands Brain Bank (Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The Netherlands Brain Bank obtained written informed consent for brain autopsy specimens for research purposes after death. The Braak stage, neuropathological and clinical diagnoses, age and gender distributions, as well as diagnostic groupings are presented in Table\u00a01. The frozen tissues were used to isolate proteins, and expression of proteins was evaluated by Western blotting as described below. Immunofluorescence was performed on 8-\u03bcm sections using antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), KCa3.1, Orai1, and GRP78 antibodies as described below. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (male, 25\u201330\u00a0g) were procured from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China). KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed as described previously. APP/PS1 transgenic mice (an AD model) were also purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (no. 003378). KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 mice were crossed with APP/PS1 mice and the offspring were intercrossed to generate mice with the KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 genotype. Mouse cohorts of the four genotypes (WT, KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212, KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1, and APP/PS1) were generated and used for behavioral analysis. The protocols of all animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China (ethics protocol number: A-2015-010). The modified Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed as previously described. Briefly, the test requires the mice to receive 5 consecutive training days (1\u00a0day with the visible platform and 4\u00a0days with the hidden platform) in a circular water tank (diameter = 80\u00a0cm; height = 50\u00a0cm) containing opaque water (22\u00a0\u00b0C, 25\u00a0cm deep). A spatial probe trial was performed on day 6 with no platform present. During the hidden platform training days, the mice were allowed to swim for 60\u00a0s to find the hidden platform (1\u00a0cm below the water surface). The platform was removed from the pool on day 6 of the spatial probe trial and the mice swam freely for 60\u00a0s. Performance of the MWM test was recorded using a video camera and analyzed using a video tracking system (Jiliang Software Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Confocal microscopy was performed as previously described. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Then, 10% goat serum in 0.01\u00a0M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to block 12-\u03bcm sections of the mice brain or 8-\u03bcm sections of the human brain for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. The brain sections were then incubated with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), mouse anti-GFAP (1:200; Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), rabbit anti-NeuN (1:100; Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:500; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), mouse anti-KCa3.1 (1:100; Alomone Labs, Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel), rabbit anti-GRP78 (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), mouse anti-NG2 (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA), and rabbit anti-Orai1 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA). After incubation at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight, the brain sections were incubated with the respective Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488- or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (1500; Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Images were collected using a TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and processed with Leica LASAF Lite imaging software. The same reference position was used for each brain slice for quantification, i.e., between three and five random 0.01-mm2 microscopic fields. Quantification was measured from six sections per brain (120-\u03bcm intervals) in a blinded manner. Mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused with saline. Mice or human brain tissues and cells were lysed on ice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100; 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium orthovanadate, sodium fluoride, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, leupeptin) containing 1% phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The supernatants were collected after centrifuging at 13,500\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Equal concentrations of proteins were separated by 10% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was blocked for 1\u00a0h at room temperature (RT) in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C: mouse anti-KCa3.1 (1:100; Alomone Labs, Ltd.), mouse anti-STIM1 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-Orai1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-GRP78, rabbit anti-mTOR, rabbit anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), rabbit anti-phospho-PERK (Thr980), rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2\u03b1, rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308), rabbit anti-Akt, rabbit anti-phospho-4E-BP1, rabbit anti-phospho-p70 S6 Kinase, mouse anti-CHOP, rabbit anti-iNOS, rabbit anti-COX2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (1:1000; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China). The membranes were subsequently washed and incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP for 1\u00a0h at RT, and developed using BeyoECL solution (P0018A; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). Image Studio Lite Ver 5.2 software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) was used to analyze the proteins. ELISA was performed using the kit for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Rapidbio Labs, Langka Trade Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). The procedures were conducted according to manufacturer\u2019s protocols. The oligomeric A\u03b2 was prepared as described previously. Briefly, monomeric peptide A\u03b2 was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro 2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 1\u00a0mg/mL. The dried monomeric peptide A\u03b2 was resolved in ddH2O at a concentration of 100\u00a0mM and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h to induce aggregation. Primary cortical astrocyte cultures derived from newborn (P0\u2013P2) WT or KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mouse brains were prepared from mixed glial cultures (10\u201314\u00a0days in vitro) as described previously. Briefly, the cerebral cortices were dissociated into single cell suspensions. Dissociated single cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00a0\u00b0C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. When the astrocytes grew to confluence (10\u201314\u00a0days later), the flasks were shaken overnight (200\u00a0rpm, 37\u00a0\u00b0C) to deplete microglia and oligodendrocytes. The purified astrocytes were then plated onto 6-well or 96-well plates in serum containing medium. Astrocytes were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 24\u00a0h after reaching confluence again, and then were treated with A\u03b2 for different time periods before harvest. The culture medium (CM) was changed to neurobasal medium (NB) with B27 supplement (Invitrogen Corporation) after confluent astrocytes were serum-free for 24\u00a0h. The NB/B27-based WT and KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes were then treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 oligomer. The CM from the NB/B27-based cells was collected and used immediately. The primary cultured cortical neurons were isolated from neonatal (P0\u2013P2) C57BL/6 mice and cultured as described previously. Cells were stained with primary antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568-conjugated secondary antibody. A Cellomics Kinetic Scan reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to scan the MAP2-positive cells. Extended Neurite Outgrowth software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to analyze the data. The purified astrocytes were plated in the wells of 96-well plates containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After once again reaching confluence, the cells were incubated with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4AM (1.6\u00a0\u03bcM; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) for 25\u00a0min and then washed three times with 0.01\u00a0M PBS. Afterward, 2\u00a0\u03bcM ethylene glycol-bis (\u03b2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid was used to chelate the calcium in the DMEM and then 1\u00a0\u03bcM thapsigargin (Tg) was used to induce [Ca2+]i release. After the [Ca2+]i concentration was stable, 2\u00a0mM CaCl2 solution was added to the DMEM to induce Ca2+ influx. Fluorescence signals were recorded and analyzed using a FlexStation 3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). All data are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Data were tested for Gaussian distribution with the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov normality test and then analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc test. Data were analyzed with an unpaired, two-tailed Student\u2019s t test when comparing between two groups or the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney test was applied. Statistical significance was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. ER stress induced by increased protein misfolding and upregulation of the UPR has been observed in AD patients and in an AD mouse model [23, 24]. Disruption of protein folding in the ER triggers the UPR via activation of three ER pathways: PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 [9, 10]. The GRP78 dissociates from PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 during ER stress, and then initiates proapoptotic signaling via activation of CHOP. GRP78 and CHOP protein levels were increased in both the brains of AD patients (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a01a, b) and the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a01c, d), as compared to control tissues. The A\u03b2 oligomer was reported to disrupt Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER of astrocytes, which leads to ER stress-induced RA. The addition of A\u03b2 to primary cultured astrocytes significantly upregulated the protein levels of GRP78 and CHOP at 12\u00a0h, as compared with control cells, indicating that A\u03b2 induces the activation of the UPR in astrocytes (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a01e, f). Overall, these data obtained from AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mouse models demonstrate a potential mechanism of ER stress activation in AD. For evaluation of SOCE, Tg (1\u00a0\u03bcM), an ER Ca2+ ATPase pump blocker, was used to deplete ER Ca2+ stores. Without extracellular Ca2+ (0 Ca2+), Tg-induced upregulation of [Ca2+]i (first peak) showed no significant changes in response to treatment with 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 at 12\u00a0h, as compared to the control astrocytes (p\u2009>\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a01g, h). However, SOCE, initiated by external Ca2+ (2\u00a0mM), was increased at 12\u00a0h (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a01g, h) and 24\u00a0h (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a01g, h) in response to treatment with 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2, as compared to control cells. Colocalization experiments were conducted using antibodies against the ER stress marker GRP78 and the RA marker GFAP. Double-labeled staining showed that GRP78 and GFAP colocalized in the AD brain tissues, but not the controls (Fig.\u00a01i). The accumulation of A\u03b2 oligomers and amyloid plaques in the brain is associated with neuroinflammation and abnormal gliosis, including reactive astrocytes [3, 26]. We previously reported that KCa3.1 gene deletion attenuated ER stress in RA via the c-Jun/JNK and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in ischemic mice. Given the key role of A\u03b2-induced astrocytes ER stress due to SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload, we then measured the expression levels of KCa3.1 and SOCE channels following stimulation by prolonged A\u03b2 treatment. Although the exact SOCE molecular components in astrocytes are unknown, KCa3.1 and Orai1 have been reported as components of SOCE channels in some cell types [8, 27, 28]. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate changes in the expression profiles of KCa3.1, Orai1, and STIM1, which revealed upregulation of the KCa3.1 and Orai1 channels in response to stimulation with 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 for 24\u00a0h, as compared to the control group, whereas there was no obvious change in the expression of STIM1 (a regulator of KCa3.1 and Orai1) (p\u2009>\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a02a, b). Colocalization experiments were conducted using specific KCa3.1 and Orai1 antibodies. Double-labeled staining showed that the colocalization of KCa3.1 and Orai1 was increased in primary astrocytes in response to stimulation with 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 for 24\u00a0h, as compared to the control cells (Fig.\u00a02c). We then further studied the potential relevance of KCa3.1 and Orai1 in the hippocampi of control and AD patients. The results showed that the expression levels of the KCa3.1 and Orai1 proteins, but not STIM1, were upregulated in the hippocampi of AD patients, as compared to the control tissues (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a02d, e). Colocalization experiments were conducted by immunostaining the brain tissues of AD patients and controls with specific KCa3.1 and Orai1 antibodies. Double-labeled staining showed that the colocalization of KCa3.1 and Orai1 was increased in the brain tissues of AD patients, as compared to the controls (Fig.\u00a02f). In the present study, colocalization between KCa3.1 and astrocytes was detected in the brains of AD patients and 15-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Age-matched control humans and WT littermates were used as controls. In AD patients (Fig.\u00a02g) and APP/PS1 mice (Fig.\u00a02h), colocalization of KCa3.1 and GFAP+ astrocytes was increased, as compared to the controls. The findings of the above experiments suggest that KCa3.1 plays a key role during the process of SOCE and in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER. Pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 was then conducted to further confirm the critical role of KCa3.1 in Ca2+ homeostasis and stress in the ER. The results showed that blockade of KCa3.1 with 1\u00a0\u03bcM TRAM-34 attenuated A\u03b2-induced SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload, as compared with A\u03b2-treated cells (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a03a, b). Pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 with 1\u00a0\u03bcM TRAM-34 decreased the upregulation of GRP78 and CHOP, which was induced by treatment with 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 for 24\u00a0h, indicating that blockade of KCa3.1 could inhibit prolonged UPR activation (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a03c, d). KCa3.1 gene deletion (KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212) from astrocytes was stimulated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 or 1\u00a0\u03bcM Tg for 24\u00a0h, as compared to WT control cells. KCa3.1 gene deletion also decreased A\u03b2 or Tg-induced upregulation of GRP78 (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a03e\u2013h). As a critical transducer of the UPR, phosphorylation of PERK (p-PERK) was increased after stimulation with 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 or 1\u00a0\u03bcM Tg, but decreased in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a03e\u2013h). Similarly, prolonged UPR has been shown to activate eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), an important downstream signaling target, which was also increased in A\u03b2 or Tg-treated WT astrocytes, but was restored to normal in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a03e\u2013h). WT and KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes were used to test whether KCa3.1-mediated astrogliosis could induce dendritic damage. More dendritic damage was observed in the CM from 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2-stimulated WT astrocytes (WT/A\u03b2-CM) than in those treated with CM from WT astrocytes (WT/CM), as shown by immunofluorescent staining of the dendritic marker MAP2 (Fig.\u00a03i). Incubation with WT/A\u03b2-CM decreased total neurite length (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a03j) and number of branch points (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a03k). Incubation with CM from 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2-stimulated KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes (KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/A\u03b2-CM) attenuated the effect of WT/A\u03b2-CM by increasing total neurite length and the number of branch points (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a03j, k). In the present study, APP/PS1 mice were crossed with KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 mice to study the role of KCa3.1 channels in RA-mediated neuronal toxicity. Offspring intercrossing generated mice with the WT, KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212, APP/PS1, and KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 genotypes. Western blot analysis was conducted to identify changes in the expressions patterns of GRP78 and CHOP in the brains of 15-month-old APP/PS1 and KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice, as compared with WT and KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 controls. Similar to previous results in AD patients (Fig.\u00a01a, b), GRP78 and CHOP levels were significantly increased in APP/PS1 mice, as compared to WT and KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212 mice (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a04a\u2013c), while the expression levels of GRP78 and CHOP were significantly decreased in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice, as compared to APP/PS1 mice (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a04a\u2013c). It was reported that upregulation of GRP78 and phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in response to A\u03b2-induced ER stress contributed to RA in the AD mouse model and primary cultured astrocytes. We then investigated whether KCa3.1 gene deletion could prevent changes in GRP78 expression levels in the astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice. To compare the response in astrocytes specifically, immunofluorescence was used to quantify GRP78 levels in GFAP+ astrocytes in the hippocampi of WT, KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212, APP/PS1, and KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice. In the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice, GRP78 expression was increased in GFAP+ astrocytes, as compared to that of WT controls (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a04d, e). Meanwhile, hippocampal GRP78 immunoreactivity levels of KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice were significantly decreased, as compared to that of APP/PS1 mice (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a04d, e). The foregoing data suggest that KCa3.1 gene deletion prevented activation of the UPR and attenuated astrocytic ER stress in an in vivo AD model. However, the signaling intermediates linking KCa3.1 and astrocytic ER stress in AD remain unknown. Given the reported relationship between the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway and ER stress, we tested whether the AKT pathway is involved in KCa3.1-mediated astrocytes ER stress. Decreased phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) (Thr308) was observed in the brain tissues of AD patients (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a05a, b). In primary cultured astrocytes, A\u03b2 treatment for 1\u00a0h significantly decreased p-AKT (Thr308) levels without inducing changes in total AKT (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a05c, d), while KCa3.1 gene deletion (KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212) inhibited the decrease in p-AKT (Thr308) after A\u03b2 treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a05c, d). We then examined whether KCa3.1 gene deletion would activate the AKT/mTOR pathway in an in vivo AD model. Consistent with the in vitro results (Fig.\u00a05c), p-AKT (Thr308) levels were decreased in the brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a05e, f). KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1) attenuated p-AKT (Thr308) suppression (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a05e, f). Importantly, the phosphorylation of mTOR, a kinase that regulates cell survival, was decreased in the brain tissue of APP/PS1 mice (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a05e, f). mTOR suppression, in turn, suppressed its downstream proteins, including phosphorylated 4EBP1 (p-4EBP1) and p70 S6 kinase (p-p70 S6 kinase) (Thr389), while KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1) attenuated the suppression of mTOR phosphorylation (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a05e, f). It was reported that blockade of KCa3.1 significantly reduced neuronal loss and memory deficits in both APP/PS1 mice and SAMP8 mice [11, 15]. Given that neuronal loss and decreased expression of synaptic proteins are likely correlated with the severity of AD, we compared expression levels of the neuron marker NeuN in the brain tissues of APP/PS1 mice with those of KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mutants. Immunostaining analysis revealed that NeuN-positive neuron levels were decreased in the CA1 areas of the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice, as compared with that in the WT group, while KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1) attenuated the decrease of NeuN staining (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a06a, b). Both reactive astrocytes and microglial activation are predominant pathological features of AD. Immunostaining of the RA marker GFAP was measured to determine whether KCa3.1 gene deletion affects RA in APP/PS1 mice. Immunostaining of GFAP+ astrocytes was increased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, as compared with WT mice (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a07a, b), while KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1) attenuated the increase in immunostaining of GFAP+ astrocytes (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a07a, b). We also investigated whether KCa3.1 gene deletion attenuates microglial activation in APP/PS1 mice by measuring expression levels of the microglia marker Iba1. Our data show that the content of Iba1+ microglia was increased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, as compared with that of WT mice (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a07c, d). KCa3.1 gene deletion in APP/PS1 mice (KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1) attenuated the increase of Iba1+ microglia immunostaining (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a07c, d). Both the RA and microglia activation results suggest that, while brains of APP/PS1 mice show increased glial responses, these responses are attenuated in the brains of KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice. KCa3.1 deficiency in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice attenuated the upregulation of COX-2 (Fig.\u00a07e, f) and iNOS (Fig.\u00a07e, g), compared with APP/PS1 mice. Levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in brain homogenates from WT, KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212, APP/PS1, and KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 group mice were measured by ELISA experiments (Fig.\u00a07h, i). Levels of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 released were attenuated in the KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 group compared with the APP/PS1 group. Together, these findings indicate that elimination of KCa3.1 ameliorated the pathological hallmarks of AD in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice, such as neuronal loss, microglial activation, RA, and neuroinflammation. In this study, the MWM spatial memory test was used to determine whether loss of KCa3.1 had any effect on cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. With the use of a hidden platform during the MWM test, 15-month-old APP/PS1 mice showed memory deficits, as compared with WT mice (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a08a). Furthermore, the KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice showed improved spatial learning and memory, as compared with the APP/PS1 mice (Fig.\u00a08a). In the spatial probe trial without an escape platform, significantly more KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice were able to cross the target quadrant, as compared to APP/PS1 mice (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a08b), and spent more time and swam for greater distances in the target quadrant (p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a08c, d). In conclusion, the MWM test results indicate that APP/PS1 mice present significant spatial memory deficits and that elimination of KCa3.1 channels ameliorates these deficits. The importance of KCa3.1 channels to CNS function is underscored by a series of studies implicating KCa3.1 in various diseases, including stroke/ischemia [32, 33], AD [11, 15], traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. These studies showed that upregulation of KCa3.1 activity can profoundly influence CNS pathology. Here, we report that KCa3.1 expression was markedly associated with ER stress and UPR in both A\u03b2-stimulated primary astrocytes and brain lysates of AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mice. Gene deletion or blockade of KCa3.1 attenuated SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and ER stress, which regulates the AKT/mTOR pathway in RA to protect neurons from RA-induced neurotoxicity. Elimination of KCa3.1 can attenuate ER stress, neuronal loss, gliosis, neuroinflammation, and memory deficits observed in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice. These data suggest that KCa3.1 presents an effective therapeutic target in AD. Astrocytes perform brain homeostatic maintenance within the CNS and communicate with neighboring neurons and glial cells via [Ca2+]i signals triggering the gliotransmitters release [3, 36\u201340]. SOCE channels, composed of STIM1 and Orai1 (pore-forming proteins), can be activated by the depletion of Ca2+ stores in the ER. SOCE, which is regulated by STIM1/2 and Orai1, plays an essential role in the activation of non-excitable cells, including astrocytes and microglia, via triggering Ca2+ influx. STIM1/2 and Orai1 were identified as key molecules of SOCE in cortical and spinal astrocytes. SOCE plays an important role in the production of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interluekin-6 in spinal astrocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides. Dysfunctional astrocytic Ca2+ signaling is involved in many pathological states, such as epilepsy and ischemia. Vincent et al. reported that astrocytic Ca2+ homeostasis is disrupted in AD. Disruption of Ca2+ signaling of astrocytes was found both in the transgenic mouse models of AD in vivo and in A\u03b2-stimulated primary astrocytes in vitro [5, 6, 42, 43]. ER stress plays an important role in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [44, 45]. Much evidence indicates a relationship between ER stress and A\u03b2-induced cytotoxicity in the post-mortem brain tissue of AD patients and AD mouse models [45, 46]. A\u03b2 severely disrupts ER function and induces ER stress in neurons and glial cells [25, 47]. Stimulation with A\u03b2 oligomers deregulated ER Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons and astrocytes, which resulted in misfolding of proteins in the ER. Excessive and prolonged activation of ER stress may initiate apoptosis by regulation of several key proteins, including CHOP, caspase-12, and JNK, which can further aggravate A\u03b2 cytotoxicity. ER stress is reportedly linked with some inflammation signaling networks, suggesting that ER stress activation may be involved in the neuroinflammatory response. In the present study, we demonstrated that A\u03b2 induced ER stress in astrocytes in vitro and observed upregulation of CHOP and the ER-resident chaperone GRP78 [50, 51]. Gene deletion and pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 were shown to attenuate the upregulation of UPR hallmarks. APP/PS1 mice present the prodromal phase of AD, reflecting memory and spatial learning deficits, as assessed by performance in the MWM test. Soluble and plaque-associated A\u03b2 peptides, which are present starting at 6\u00a0months of age in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, induce ER stress and sequent phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2a, which are closely associated with the pathogenesis of AD. The results of the present study also suggest that elimination of KCa3.1 ameliorated the pathological hallmarks of AD in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice, such as neuronal loss, microglial activation, and RA. Although the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of memory deficits by elimination of KCa3.1 are not well known, they are likely associated with the decreased pathological markers noted in KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice, as compared with APP/PS1 mice. Similar to AD patients, phosphorylation of GRP78 and eIF2\u03b1 is upregulated in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice also showed decreased expression of NeuN and increased expression of Iba1 and GFAP, suggesting the presence of neuronal loss, microglial activation, and RA. Brain slices of KCa3.1\u2212/\u2212/APP/PS1 mice showed significantly lower levels of these markers than those of APP/PS1 mice, indicating that KCa3.1 gene deletion might involve in ER stress and, thereby, attenuate neuronal loss and glia inflammation in AD mice. Our data also demonstrated that KCa3.1 regulates ER stress via the downstream AKT/mTOR signaling pathway during RA in AD. We observed that A\u03b2 decreased the activation of AKT by decreasing AKT phosphorylation in primary astrocytes. Interestingly, KCa3.1 elimination prevented A\u03b2-mediated loss of AKT activation via upregulation of AKT phosphorylation at Thr308. Growing evidence indicates that the mTOR signaling pathway plays a vital role during apoptosis and autophagy. Our results show that A\u03b2 represses the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, p70 S6 kinase, and 4EBP1, and that a decrease in the phosphorylation of AKT led to UPR activation. The postmortem brain samples from patients with and without AD were also evaluated. The results indicate that KCa3.1 expression and activation of UPR-associated proteins are increased in the brains of AD patients. Overall, these data indicate that KCa3.1 plays an important role in the process of Ca2+ homeostasis in the ER and that KCa3.1 upregulation involves in the activation of the UPR pathway, which subsequently leads to neurodegeneration in AD."}}
