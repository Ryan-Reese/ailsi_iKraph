Of particular interest are genes involved in cell cycle pathways, which regulate cell division.\n\n\nMethods\nWe examined associations between common germline genetic variation in 13 genes involved in cell cycle control (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2 [p33], CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A [p21, Cip1], CDKN1B [p27, Kip1], CDKN2A [p16], CDKN2B [p15], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]) and survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer participating in the SEARCH (Studies of Epidemiology and Risk factors in Cancer Heredity) breast cancer study. DNA from up to 4,470 women was genotyped for 85 polymorphisms that tag the known common polymorphisms (minor allele frequency > 0.05) in the genes. The genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for association with survival using Cox regression analysis.\n\n\nResults\nThe rare allele of the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2479717 is associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 per rare allele carried, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001), which was not attenuated after adjusting for tumour stage, grade, and treatment. This SNP is part of a large linkage disequilibrium block, which contains CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC. We evaluated the association of survival and somatic expression of these genes in breast tumours using expression microarray data from seven published datasets. Elevated expression of the C6orf49 transcript was associated with breast cancer survival, adding biological interest to the finding.\n\n\nConclusion\nIt is possible that CCND3 rs2479717, or another variant it tags, is associated with prognosis after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Further study is required to validate this finding.\n\n", "fulltext": "Excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with 36,939 new cases diagnosed in 2004. The prognosis of breast cancer is generally good, with an overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 80% in England and Wales. Clinical stage at diagnosis, including tumour size, lymph node status, and presence of metastases, along with tumour biological factors such as histological grade and type are the most important determinants of prognosis. Cyclins and their regulators, which are involved in cell cycle control, are important as potential oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes in breast cancer. The cell cycle consists of a series of well-controlled events that drive DNA replication and cell division. These events are divided into specific phases: preparation for DNA synthesis (G1), DNA synthesis (S), a gap phase (G2), and mitosis (M). Transition between these phases requires tight control; the G1/S phase transition, in particular, includes many cell cycle events that are altered in breast cancer. Somatic alterations in these genes have been shown to correlate with breast cancer prognosis and survival, but few studies have examined the effects of inherited genetic variation in cell cycle genes. The a870g polymorphism of the CCND1 gene (rs603965) has been shown to be associated with breast cancer survival in a large Chinese population-based study and in a small population of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The V109G polymorphism of the p27 gene CDKN1B (rs2066827), examined by polymerase chain reaction analysis of tumour specimens, was associated with shortened disease-free survival in a subset of patients with infiltrating metastasis-free breast cancer. These previous studies, however, were only of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the genes involved in the G1 phase of cell cycle control have not been systematically evaluated. The purpose of this study was to assess whether common germline genetic variation in these genes is associated with breast cancer survival by using a comprehensive SNP tagging approach to efficiently capture the common variation. Thirteen genes involved in the G1 phase of the cell cycle have been investigated in this study, including those that encode for the cyclin family that regulate cyclin-dependent kinases (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, and CCNE1); cyclin-dependent kinases, which are necessary for the G1/S transition (CDK2 [p33], CDK4, and CDK6); and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN1A [p21, Cip1], CDKN1B [p27, Kip1], CDKN2A [p16], CDKN2B [p15], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]). Cases were selected from the Studies of Epidemiology and Risk factors in Cancer Heredity (SEARCH) breast cancer study, an ongoing population study of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the region of England included in the Eastern Cancer Registration and Information Centre (ECRIC) (formerly the East Anglian Cancer Registry). Eligible participants include women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer who were either under 70 years of age since the beginning of the study on 1 July 1996 (incident cases) or age 55 or younger since 1 January 1991 and who were alive at the start of the study (prevalent cases). Due to boundary changes, some prevalent cases diagnosed before 1995 were identified by the North Thames Cancer Registry. Of those eligible, 67% returned a comprehensive epidemiological questionnaire and 64% returned a blood sample for genotyping. All participants in the study provided informed consent, and the study was approved by the Eastern Multicentre Research Ethics Committee. DNA is available from 4,470 cases for genotyping; 27% of these participants are prevalent cases. The samples have been split into two sets in order to save DNA and reduce genotyping costs. Cases with high genomic yield were randomly selected from the first 3,500 recruited to comprise set 1 (n = 2,270), with set 2 comprising the remainder of these plus the next 970 incident cases recruited (n = 2,200). DNA yield was not associated with genotype for those cases included in set 1 or set 2. SNPs showing a positive association with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer (P trend < 0.05) were genotyped in set 2. Data from both sets were then combined (n = 4,470) to jointly analyze the SNPs with positive associations. This joint analysis approach results in increased power to detect genetic association despite more stringent significance levels with Bonferroni correction. As the prevalent cases were the first recruited, the proportion of prevalent cases was somewhat higher in set 1 than set 2 (33% versus 20%). In total, 1,370 prevalent cases were included in both sets; median time from diagnosis to blood draw was 3.4 years (range: 0.8 to 9.34 years). Median age at diagnosis was similar in the two sets (50 and 53 years old, respectively). Median time from diagnosis to blood draw was slightly longer for set 2 (18 months) than for set 1 (9 months), but the number of deaths in each set was similar (359 in set 1 and 278 in set 2). There was no significant difference in the morphology, histopathological grade, or TNM (tumour, node, metastasis) stage of the cases by set or by prevalent/incident status. The ECRIC and the North Thames Cancer Registry have active follow-up at years 3 and 5 after diagnosis and then at 5-year intervals. Follow-up information and all-cause mortality are obtained by searching hospital information systems for recent visits. If a patient has not had a recent visit, the patient's general practitioner is contacted to obtain the vital status. Death certificate flagging through the Office of National Statistics also provides the registries with notification of deaths. The lag times with this process are a few weeks for cancer deaths and 2 months to a year for non-cancer deaths. Cause-specific mortality was obtained from part I of the death certificate. Thirteen genes involved in the G1 phase of cell cycle regulation were selected as candidate genes for breast cancer survival. A comprehensive SNP tagging approach was used in which tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) were chosen to capture all known common genetic variation in each gene with an estimated correlation coefficient (r2) of greater than 0.8. In some cases, SNPs that were poorly correlated with other single SNPs could be efficiently tagged with a haplotype defined by multiple SNPs. Correlation between these SNPs and the haplotype of tagSNPs (r2s) was aimed to be greater than 0.8. TagSNPs were identified with the program Tagger. Data from the International HapMap Project and resequencing data from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Environmental Genome Project were used to select tagSNPs. In total, 85 tagSNPs were chosen. Genotyping was carried out using the TaqMan\u00ae platform (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers and FAM- and VIC-labeled probes were supplied directly by Applied Biosystems as Assays-by-Design\u2122. All assays were carried out in 384-well plates. Each plate included negative controls (with no DNA) and positive controls duplicated on a separate quality control plate. Plates were read on the ABI Prism 7900 using Sequence Detection Software (Applied Biosystems). Failed genotypes were not repeated. Assays in which the genotypes of duplicate samples did not show greater than 95% concordance were discarded and replaced with alternative assays with the same tagging properties. Call rates for each assay were over 95%. Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of each tagSNP on survival. The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated by visual inspection of log-log plots as well as tested analytically using Schoenfeld residuals. TagSNPs significantly associated with survival were re-evaluated in a model adjusted for known breast cancer prognostic factors, which included age at diagnosis (<40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, or >60 years), clinical stage (TNM stage 1, 2, 3, or 4), histopathological grade (well differentiated, moderately differentiated, or poorly differentiated), estrogen receptor (ER) status, and treatment. Time at risk began on the date of blood sample receipt and ended on the date of death from any cause or, if death did not occur, on 30 November 2006. This allows for the difference in ascertainment of incident and prevalent cases and provides an unbiased estimate of the relative hazard provided that the proportional hazards assumption is correct. Follow-up was censored at 10 years after diagnosis as follow-up became less reliable for each individual after 10 years. A hazard ratio (HR) was estimated for heterozygous and rare homozygous genotypes relative to the common genotype. Primary tests used were a likelihood ratio test (2 degrees of freedom) for heterogeneity of risk among the three genotypes (common homozygote, heterozygote, and rare homozygote) and a trend test (1 degree of freedom) based on the number of rare alleles carried. All analyses were performed with Intercooled Stata, version 8.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). The characteristics of the SEARCH breast cancer study participants for whom genotyping and vital status data were available are described in Table 1. More than 99% of the cases were Caucasian. There were 3,263 (73%) cases enrolled as incident cases and 1,207 (27%) as prevalent cases. No significant difference in survival hazard was found between the two groups (P = 0.19). During the 25,049 person-years at risk, there were 637 deaths before 10 years of follow-up. Five hundred forty-two of these deaths were coded as breast cancer-specific. The results of the univariate Cox regression analyses for single marker tagSNPs are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and for multimarker tagSNPs in Supplementary Table 2 (Additional File 1). None of the tagSNPs in CCND1, CCND2, CCNE1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK1A, CDKN1B, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, or CDKN2D were significantly associated with all-cause survival. The trend tests for CCND3 rs2479717, CCND3 rs9529, and CDK6 rs2079147 were significant at the 0.05 level (P = 0.001, 0.006, and 0.02, respectively). CCND3 rs2479717 and CCND3 rs9529 are highly correlated with each other (r2 = 0.92). In a forced Cox regression model including both CCND3 rs2479717 and CCND3 rs9529, only CCND3 rs2479717 remained significant (P = 0.029). Therefore, only CCND3 rs2479717 and CDK6 rs2079147 were genotyped in the second set. CCND3 rs2479717 remained significant in the joint analysis (HR per rare allele carried = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001) (Figure 1). Data on tumour grade, TNM stage, and age at diagnosis were available for 80%, 97%, and 100% of the cases, respectively. Only stage and grade remained significantly associated with survival in the multivariate model. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and adjuvant hormone therapy treatment data were available for 4,303 (96.3%) cases. Of these, 1,412 (32.8%) underwent chemotherapy, 3,006 (69.9%) were treated with adjuvant hormone therapy, and 3,099 (72.0%) received radiotherapy. Surgical treatment information was available for 4,194 (93.8%) cases; of these, 3,840 (91.6%) underwent surgery. The risk associated with CCND3 rs2479717 was not significantly attenuated after adjusting for tumour stage, grade, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, adjuvant hormone therapy, and surgery (HR per rare allele carried = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.41; P = 0.003). We repeated the analysis in those recruited within 3 years of diagnosis (3,558 individuals), and there were no differences in the results for both the univariate analysis (HR per rare allele carried = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.46; P = 0.0002) and the multivariate model (HR per rare allele carried = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.42; P = 0.004). ER status was available for 2,624 (58.7%) cases. Of these, 1,975 (75.3%) individuals had an ER-positive tumour. No differences across stage, grade, or ER status are noted across the rs2479717 genotype (Table 2). If ER status is added to the multivariate model, the power of the model is somewhat decreased due to a reduction in sample size, resulting in a slight attenuation of the HR and loss of significance for CCND3 rs2479717 (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.35; P = 0.19). The HR for CCND3 rs2479717 was almost the same for those individuals with an ER-positive tumour (HR per rare allele carried = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.41) and those with an ER-negative tumour (HR per rare allele carried = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.43); the test for interaction was not significant (P = 0.97). Results were consistent for breast cancer-specific mortality (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 found in Additional File 2). Only CCND3 rs2479717 remained significant in the joint analysis (HR per rare allele carried = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.44; P = 0.0004). This HR was not attenuated by stage, grade, and treatment (HR per rare allele carried = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.40; P = 0.01). CCND3 rs2479717 is an a > t intronic alteration approximately 50 bases downstream from exon 3. It lies in a large linkage disequilibrium (LD) block on chromosome 6, which contains seven genes: CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC (Figure 2). To further evaluate the effect of these genes on breast cancer survival, microarray gene expression data for seven breast cancer cohorts were taken from existing literature and public databases (Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress). The publicly available data comprise raw expression data that have been 'normalized'. This usually involves background correction, quantile normalization, and log transformation. The retrieved datasets were further normalized, if necessary, by transforming them onto a common log2 scale and shifting the median of each array to zero. Study characteristics are included in Table 3. In total, the studies included tumour samples from 1,241 individuals. All of the studies contained clinical outcomes; five of the studies had information on all-cause mortality, and two of the studies had disease recurrence as an outcome. Most of the studies had a mix of untreated and treated individuals, with treatment including both chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy. Median age at diagnosis ranged from less than 53 years to 65 years. The majority of tumours were ER-positive and medium grade (Supplementary Table 5 found in Additional File 3). Combined, the datasets provided 9,048 years at risk (median of 7.4 years at risk) and a total of 384 events. To test whether a gene's expression is associated with clinical outcome, we used Cox proportional hazards regression models. In this context, the HR refers to the proportional increase in hazard risk per unit increase on a log2 scale of expression level of the transcript. To attempt to control for study heterogeneity, expression data for each gene were analyzed two ways: a Cox survival model stratified by study (fixed effects) and a random-effects meta-analysis. Elevated expression levels of the BYSL transcript were significantly associated with breast cancer survival in a random-effects model (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.10 to 3.08; P = 0.02) (Figure 3a), but the association did not reach significance in a fixed-effects model (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.38; P = 0.08). Elevated expression levels of the C6orf49 transcript were significantly associated with breast cancer survival in a fixed-effects model (HR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.16; P = 0.002) and in a random-effects model (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.11 to 3.05; P = 0.02) (Figure 3b). Expression levels of CCND3, TRFP, USP49, FRS3, or PGC transcripts were not significantly associated with breast cancer survival (Supplementary Table 6 found in Additional File 3). We have evaluated the association of 85 tagSNPs in 13 cell cycle control genes with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Previous work has shown that expression of these genes is associated with breast cancer prognosis; however, to our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess germline variation in genes involved in controlling the cell cycle and breast cancer survival. This study used a two-stage design, with an initial set of 85 tagSNPs genotyped in 2,270 individuals. The top two SNPs, with a P value of less than 0.05, were genotyped in the second set of patients (n = 2,200). Because a combined analysis with adjustment for multiple testing has been shown to increase power over a replication study, a joint analysis of both sets of data was performed. One SNP, CCND3 rs2479717, showed a significant association with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer (unadjusted P value = 0.0001). This finding remains significant after a conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (P value = 0.0085), and the HR is not significantly attenuated after adjusting for stage, grade, and treatment. There was no evidence of association with survival for polymorphisms in CCND1, CCND2, CCNE1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, and CDKN2D. These findings were based on the analysis of all-cause mortality. This may result in a reduction of statistical power as some deaths will be unrelated to breast cancer. Breast cancer-specific mortality was available from death certificates, and the results were consistent for the breast cancer-specific analysis, with an identical HR for CCND3 rs2479717. It is worth noting that cause of death as coded on a death certificate is also prone to misclassification and subsequent loss of statistical power. Our analyses incorporated prevalent cases. It may be thought that inclusion of prevalent cases may result in a bias of the HR. However, provided that the Cox proportional hazards assumption holds true, the HR estimate is unbiased. For example, there is no significant difference between the HRs for CCND3 rs2479717, TNM stage, or histopathological grade when comparing subjects recruited within 6 months of diagnosis with those recruited more than 6 months after diagnosis (P = 0.69, 0.90, and 0.42, respectively). Furthermore, our repeated analyses, including only those individuals recruited within 3 years of their diagnosis, were identical to our full analysis. CCND3 encodes for cyclin D3, a protein involved in the regulation of the G1/S phase transition. The SNP associated with survival, CCND3 rs2479717, is in an intron and unlikely to have a functional effect. However, a functional effect would not be expected as it was chosen as a tagSNP, not as a functional SNP. Furthermore, a functional variant tagged by this SNP may not even alter the function of CCND3; the SNP lies in a large LD block with several genes that are reasonable candidates for breast cancer survival. PGC encodes for pepsinogen C, a proteolytic enzyme involved in digestion, which is expressed in breast tumours. Higher pepsinogen C expression is associated with well-differentiated and moderately differentiated breast tumours and has been associated with longer overall survival in these patients. BYSL encodes for bystin, a crucial component protein of an adhesion molecule complex that is important for the attachment of the embryo to the uterus. This protein is present in human prostatic carcinoma cells in areas of perineural invasion in an increasing gradient, suggesting a role in perineural adhesion. C6orf49 encodes for overexpressed breast tumour protein, a member of the LIM domain (cysteine-rich double zinc fingers) protein family that is overexpressed in tumours and has a possible role in cancer differentiation. FRS3 encodes for fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 3, a negative regulator in epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. USP49 encodes for ubiquitin-specific protease 49, which is involved in the modification of cellular proteins. Ubiquitin-specific protease 49 is expressed in samples derived from tumour biopsies. TRFP encodes for TATA-binding protein-related protein, which is associated with an RNA polymerase II-SRB complex; this complex may regulate class II genes. To further evaluate this LD block, we examined breast tumour expression of these seven genes using expression microarray data from seven published datasets. Significant associations between increased tumour expression levels of BYSL and C6orf49 transcripts and breast cancer survival emerged. Differences between the microarray datasets, varying outcome information, and incomplete control of confounding by prognostic factors may limit interpretation of these findings; however, we attempted to control for patient and tumour heterogeneity between these studies by performing two analyses: a random-effects and a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Although the results for BYSL are unclear, both analyses showed consistent associations of elevated tumour expression of the C6orf49 transcript with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Our study has found evidence that tagSNP CCND3 rs2479717, which is found in a genomic region that includes CCND3 and six other genes, is associated with survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Although our study began as an evaluation of cell cycle control genes, our significant finding may actually relate to a gene in LD with CCND3 rs2479717 that is not related to cell cycle control. This is supported by our findings that elevated tumour expression of the C6orf49 transcript, one of the genes in LD with rs2479717, is associated with breast cancer survival. If our findings can be confirmed in other studies, further evaluation of this locus to identify the causal variant would be warranted."}, "16277682": {"pmid": "16277682", "pmcid": "PMC1297578", "title": "Segregation of a M404V mutation of the p62/sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) gene with polyostotic Paget's disease of bone in an Italian family", "abstract": "\nMutations of the p62/Sequestosome 1 gene (p62/SQSTM1) account for both sporadic and familial forms of Paget's disease of bone (PDB). We originally described a methionine\u2192valine substitution at codon 404 (M404V) of exon 8, in the ubiquitin protein-binding domain of p62/SQSTM1 gene in an Italian PDB patient. The collection of data from the patient's pedigree provided evidence for a familial form of PDB. Extension of the genetic analysis to other relatives in this family demonstrated segregation of the M404V mutation with the polyostotic PDB phenotype and provided the identification of six asymptomatic gene carriers. DNA for mutational analysis of the exon 8 coding sequence was obtained from 22 subjects, 4 PDB patients and 18 clinically unaffected members. Of the five clinically ascertained affected members of the family, four possessed the M404V mutation and exhibited the polyostotic form of PDB, except one patient with a single X-ray-assessed skeletal localization and one with a polyostotic disease who had died several years before the DNA analysis. By both reconstitution and mutational analysis of the pedigree, six unaffected subjects were shown to bear the M404V mutation, representing potential asymptomatic gene carriers whose circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase were recently assessed as still within the normal range. Taken together, these results support a genotype\u2013phenotype correlation between the M404V mutation in the p62/SQSTM1 gene and a polyostotic form of PDB in this family. The high penetrance of the PDB trait in this family together with the study of the asymptomatic gene carriers will allow us to confirm the proposed genotype\u2013phenotype correlation and to evaluate the potential use of mutational analysis of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in the early detection of relatives at risk for PDB.\n", "fulltext": "Paget's disease of bone (PDB; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) entry no. 602080) is a metabolic bone disease characterized by accelerated bone resorption followed by the deposition of dense, chaotic bone matrix, affecting up to 3% of individuals of Caucasian ancestry above the age of 55 years. Although PDB is genetically heterogeneous, in some familial cases of late onset PDB an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has been reported. Mutations of the p62/sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) gene account for most of the sporadic and familial forms of PDB, and exons 7 and 8, encoding the ubiquitin-binding-associated domain (UBA), host a clustered mutational area. p62 acts as a scaffold protein in signalling pathways downstream of the interleukin-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and nerve growth factor receptors. In a recent paper we described an M404V mutation in the UBA of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in an Italian population of patients affected by PDB. This mutation has also been confirmed in other ethnic groups. For the Italian patient carrying this A\u2192G transition at exon 8, collection of the family history demonstrated a clear inheritance for PDB. DNA analysis for the p62/SQSTM1 gene mutation was performed in all affected familial members and in several unaffected subjects, to evaluate the segregation of the M404V mutation with the PDB phenotype and to detect potentially asymptomatic gene carriers. Through this analysis we identified both a familial form of PDB, in which the M404V mutation segregates with a polyostotic phenotype of the disorder, and several asymptomatic gene carriers. The Local Ethical Committee of the University of Florence approved this study. The PDB female proband (III-1) was clinically evaluated and genetically characterized as a carrier of a novel M404V mutation at exon 8 of the p62/SQSTM1 gene (Fig. 1). Through the family history a familial form of PDB (F01 pedigree, Fig. 1) was ascertained. The four-generation family, originating from central Italy, consists of 37 living subjects (22 females and 15 males; age range 33 to 92 years) and 18 deceased individuals (11 males and 7 females; Fig. 1). Members from generations I to III were farmers born and still living in a rural environment, whereas fourth-generation individuals, although born in the same environment as previous generations, moved to urban life after adolescence. Relevant clinical information on affected and gene-carrier members of the F01 pedigree was collected; they are summarized in Table 1. All available family members were asked to undergo DNA mutational analysis and biochemical assessment after administration of an informed consent form. No information was available on the first (I) generation (subjects I-1, I-1.0 and I-2; Fig. 1). In the second (II) generation (Fig. 1) blood samples for genomic DNA evaluation were obtained from the only living subject (patient II-6), a 92-year-old male, suffering from a benign hyperplasia of the prostate (Table 1). Male subject II-3, the father of a III-6 affected individual (Fig. 1), was referred to as a carrier of multiple bone deformities and pain by living members of the family, strongly suggesting the presence of PDB disease in this individual. Figure 2a contributes to sustaining this hypothesis. The proband III-1, in whom the M404V mutation was first detected, belongs to the third (III) generation (Fig. 1). Patient III-6 died because of an osteogenic sarcoma within or in a Pagetic bone. This patient was diagnosed as being affected by PDB at the age of 62 years because of the presence of bone pain, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and X-rays indicating typical PDB. Bone scintigraphy showed signs of disease in the right pelvis, the right proximal femur and left ribs IV and VIII. Three years after the diagnosis of PDB, bone pain in the right pelvis increased markedly and a bone biopsy showed the presence of an osteogenic sarcoma on the Pagetic bone already metastasized to the lungs. The patient died at 65 years of age after surgical and chemotherapeutic interventions, some years before DNA analysis was performed on the F01 pedigree. The ages of members from the fourth (IV) generation (IV-1, IV-2, IV-3, IV-5, IV-6, IV-13, IV-14, IV-15 and IV-16) ranged from 41 to 53 years. Neither clinical nor biochemical abnormalities suggestive of PDB are currently evident in this younger group (Fig. 1, Table 1). Evaluation of AP, measured by an autoanalyzer, has been performed also in all the individuals undergoing mutational analysis. The upper limit of the reference range is 120 units/l. After administration of an informed consent form, peripheral blood was obtained from 22 subjects: 4 PDB patients (III-1, III-3, III-12 and III-13) and 18 clinically unaffected members (II-6, III-7, III-8, III-9, III-10, III-14, III-18, III-19, III-20, IV-1, IV-2, IV-3, IV-5, IV-6, IV-13, IV-14, IV-15 and IV-16) (Fig. 1, Table 1). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes with the use of a microvolume extraction method, QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Exon 8 of the p62/SQSTM1 gene was amplified by PCR (I-Cycler; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy) using a couple of primers located in the flanking intron: 5'-CAGTGTGGCCTGTGAGGAC-3'/5'-CAGTGAGCCTTGGGTCTCG-3'. For each patient we used 0.1 \u03bcg of DNA, in a final buffer volume of 50 \u03bcl (67 mM Tris-HCl, 16.6 mM (NH4)SO4, 0.01% Tween 20, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM deoxyribonucleotides, each primer at 0.2 \u03bcM and 1 unit of Polytaq (Polymed, Florence, Italy)). Thirty PCR cycles were performed at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, after a first denaturing cycle at 94\u00b0C for 3 min. A final extension cycle of 5 min was performed at 72\u00b0C. PCR products were tested by 2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose-gel electrophoresis, purified with a High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and finally sequenced with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequencing reaction consisted of 25 repeated cycles of denaturation for 10 s at 96\u00b0C, annealing for 5 s at 55\u00b0C and extension for 2 min at 60\u00b0C. The sequencing products were purified with a DyeEx 2.0 Spin Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) to remove the excess dye terminator. A 5 \u03bcl sample of each purified sequence was then resuspended in 15 \u03bcl of formamide and denatured for 2 min at 95\u00b0C. Analysis of the forward and reverse sequences was performed on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Suspicion or diagnosis of PDB was based on description by relatives, evidence of bone deformities and pain strongly suggestive of PDB (II-3 (Fig. 2a), II-8 and II-10) and, when possible, direct evidence of elevated total AP, X-ray scanning and bone scintigraphy (III-1, III-3 (Fig. 2b), III-6, III-12 and III-13; Fig. 1, Table 1). After careful reconstitution of their clinical history, 12 subjects (6 males and 6 females), of which 11 were living, were reported to be the following: clinically ascertained as PDB patients (III-1, III-3 (Fig. 2b), III-6, III-12 and III-13) with increased circulating levels of AP (more than 120 units/l); presumably affected by PDB (II-3 (Fig. 2a), II-8 and II-10); and potentially mutant (II-1, II-2, II-7 and III-5; Table 1). In accordance with previously described criteria, all affected members, clinically ascertained (III-1, III-3 (Fig. 2b), III-6, III-12 and III-13), exhibited polyostotic localization of PDB (III-1, III-3, III-6 and III-13), except patient III-12 (Table 1). In the last of these the monostotic left femur involvement was diagnosed only through standard X-ray examination, so the possibility of underestimation of skeletal involvement cannot be excluded (Table 1). Over all, considering only the clinically ascertained affected subjects (III-1, III-3, III-6, III-12 and III-13), the number of bones involved in this family is 3.8 \u00b1 2.31 (mean \u00b1 SD). Three subjects in the family (II-3 (Fig. 2a), II-8 and II-10) were presumably affected by PDB on the basis of the history related by other members of the family and of the fact that progeny of II-3 and II-8 carried the M404V mutation. In these three cases the description of bone deformities was suggestive of multiple bone localization. Until now none of the unaffected members has exhibited AP levels outside the normal range (that is, more than 120 units/l). All the available ascertained affected PDB individuals from the third generation (III-1, III-3, III-12 and III-13) exhibited the M404V mutation of the p62/SQSTM1 gene (Table 1), confirming the pathogenetic nature of this p62/SQSTM1 gene mutation and suggesting segregation of the mutation with the polyostotic phenotype in this family. Although patient III-6 died as a result of an osteogenic sarcoma on a Pagetic bone several years before the genetic evaluation of F01 pedigree, he probably had the M404V mutation. Through mutational analysis the pedigree was carefully reconstructed, and this allowed us to propose that patients II-1, II-2, II-3, II-7, II-8 and III-5 were also carriers of the M404V mutation. In fact, their PDB-affected children (III-1, III-3, III-6, III-12 and III-13) exhibited the mutation (Table 1). Of the unaffected subjects, II-6, III-7, III-8, III-9, III-10, III-14, III-18, III-19, III-20, IV-2, IV-3, IV-5 and IV-6 (age range from 35 to 92 years) were not carrying the M404V p62/SQSTM1 gene mutation, whereas subjects IV-1, IV-13, IV-14, IV-15 and IV-16 (age range from 41 to 53 years) were carrying the mutation (Table 1). AP levels were still in the normal range (less than 120 units/l) in these gene carriers (Table 1). Several lines of evidence support the role of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in the pathogenesis of PDB, even though the molecular mechanisms that underlie its functional activities are not fully understood. Similarly, little information has been collected about either the potential genotype\u2013phenotype correlation between gene mutations and clinical manifestations of PDB or the role of genetic testing in asymptomatic carriers within affected families. The findings described in this paper are of interest with regard to both issues. The p62/SQSTM1 protein binds non-covalently to ubiquitin, co-localizing with ubiquitinated inclusions in several human diseases characterized by altered protein aggregation. Moreover, the protein mediates several cellular functions including NF\u03baB-dependent signalling and transcriptional activity, which are important for the recruitment and activation of osteoclastic cells. The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the p62-UBA domain has recently been determined, but its functional significance in the p62 protein is still unknown. The study by Ciani and colleagues showed that the M404V mutation is able to modify the secondary structure of the domain and affects its ability to bind to Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chains in vitro. Together with other p62/SQSTM1 gene mutations at the UBA domain, Cavey and colleagues showed that M404V is able to cause the loss of monoubiquitin binding and impair in vitro Lys48-linked polyubiquitin binding, although these effects were reported only when the binding experiments were performed at the physiological temperature of 37\u00b0C. These findings suggest that PDB-related SQSTM1 mutations may confer a higher susceptibility to development of the disease by impairing the binding of the p62 protein to a ubiquitinated target. However, other molecular mechanisms, involving a key ubiquitinated substrate, could be invoked in the attempt to explain the acquisition of the PDB phenotype in individuals with mutations of the p62/SQSTM1 gene. A structural analysis demonstrated in 4 of 70 PDB relatives with British ancestry that an M404V mutation involves residues on the hydrophobic surface patch implicated in ubiquitin binding. Consequently, an M404V mutation affects the ability of a mutant UBA domain to bind polyubiquitin chains. Using this structural information Hocking and colleagues reported that patients with truncating mutations of the p62/SQSTM1 gene exhibited a trend for more extensive PDB than those with mis-sense mutations such as M404V. They concluded that there is no correlation between the ubiquitin-binding properties of different mutant UBA domains and disease occurrence or extension of the same. These findings therefore do not provide a speculative hypothesis for an explanation of the observed genotype\u2013phenotype correlation in the Italian family with PDB described in this paper. The heterozygous segregation of M404V mutation with the PDB phenotype in the F01 pedigree supports the pathogenetic role via a dominant-negative action. Moreover, the evidence of a genotype\u2013phenotype correlation in this family can also include epigenetic mechanisms that, through a common genetic background, can contribute, along with the M404V mutation, to the expression of a polyostotic PDB phenotype in the affected members. Interestingly, the commonly shared rural environment of all the members from generations I to III and, for a shorter period, generation IV of this family, together with the presence of past measles infection in all individuals analysed, could suggest a role for environmental factors in determining the polyostotic expression of the disease in M404V mutant subjects. Clinical follow-up of asymptomatic carriers from generation IV might confirm or negate this observation. Studies on the penetrance of PDB have been performed by several authors, the PDB shows an incomplete clinical expression, meaning that some SQSTM1 gene carriers from affected families do not show clinical evidence of the disease. Moreover, some PDB-affected individuals, from affected families with a known SQSTM1 gene mutation, do not exhibit the mutation. Conversely, individuals older than 55 years of age with a known SQSTM1 mutation from relatives affected with PDB, did not develop PDB. A potential explanation for these findings is the existence of genetic heterogeneity, with possible modifier loci capable of controlling the clinical expression of PDB. For individuals younger than 55 years of age with a known SQSTM1 mutation, originating from relatives affected with PDB, who had not yet developed PDB, the time needed for phenotypic expression of the disease could represent a limiting factor. In general, a lack of expression of the disease in recognized SQSTM1 gene carriers could be explained by a reduced exposure to environmental factors such as paramixovirus infections and/or by the progressive abandonment of the rural environment. An important application of genetic analyses in families is the precocious identification of asymptomatic gene carriers. In this relative the p62/SQSTM1 disease-associated mutation was also present in individuals younger than 50 years of age. So far the asymptomatic gene carriers have not exhibited any abnormality in the circulating levels of AP and have not shown any clinical signs suggestive of PDB. Although bone scanning is commonly recommended in patients with PDB older than 40 years of age, because of the ethical considerations observed in our country, bone scan tests cannot be performed unless AP levels are raised and consequently PDB bone localization cannot be excluded at this stage in asymptomatic mutant carriers. However, considering that a positive individual older than 40 years of age has an up to 80% likelihood of developing the disease by 70 years of age, the extremely high penetrance of PDB in this family clearly indicates the need for an accurate vertical follow-up of the six asymptomatic mutant carriers. This will allow us to confirm the suggested genotype\u2013phenotype correlation in the currently asymptomatic carriers as well, and to assess the role of mutational analysis of the p62/SQSTM1 gene for early detection of the individuals at risk for developing PDB. At present, a positive test for the mutation of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in a patient with PDB does not have any impact on treatment. Finally, one of the affected subjects (III-6) in this family developed an osteosarcoma that caused her death. Pagetoid osteosarcoma is a complication of PDB and is most often observed in severe, long-standing PDB. Two previous reports described a direct lineage in which Pagetoid osteosarcoma developed in affected family members. Although specific genetic mechanisms remain to be elucidated, some authors reported loss of heterozygosity for loci at chromosome 18q21-22 in Pagetoid osteosarcomas as well as in sporadic osteosarcomas. The deleted region was shown to harbour the receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB (RANK, TNFRSF11A) gene identified in a family affected by familial expansile osteolysis (OMIM entry no. 174810), a Paget-like syndrome. Although the RANK gene has not been found to be mutated in PDB-affected individuals, a positive association between a polymorphic variant of this gene and PDB has been reported. NF\u03baB is also the potential molecular target of the mechanism underlying the altered osteoclastogenesis seen in PDB patients carrying mutated sequences in the UBA domain of the p62/SQSTM1 gene. Inactivation of the p62/SQSTM1 gene could activate the RANK\u2013NF\u03baB signalling, as seen in the familial expansile osteolysis syndrome, with impairment of TNF-\u03b1-induced programmed cell death. Such machinery is also crucial for immunity, lymphocyte development, tumorigenesis and cancer chemoresistance; NF\u03baB functions are recognized as relevant to tumour promotion. Even though the presence of the M404V mutation could not be assessed in patient III-6, these hypotheses strongly support the need for further investigation into the possible role of the p62 protein in the occurrence of osteosarcoma, both in PDB-affected patients and in individuals without PDB. This paper describes a genotype\u2013phenotype correlation in PDB cases with a mis-sense mutation in the p62/SQSTM1 gene. These results should be confirmed in other PDB patients of Italian and other ancestries. Moreover, the value of a pre-symptomatic gene test in PDB requires a vertical evaluation in well-characterized relatives, opening new possibilities for the practical application of genetic diagnosis in PDB family members and also in the general population. Finally, the knowledge of the function of p62/SQSTM1 gene mutations should enable us to uncover the pathogenesis of PDB and osteogenic osteosarcoma."}, "15461822": {"pmid": "15461822", "pmcid": "PMC524489", "title": "Vaccine candidates derived from a novel infectious cDNA clone of an American genotype dengue virus type 2", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nA dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2 Tonga/74) isolated from a 1974 epidemic was characterized by mild illness and belongs to the American genotype of DEN-2 viruses. To prepare a vaccine candidate, a previously described 30 nucleotide deletion (\u039430) in the 3' untranslated region of DEN-4 has been engineered into the DEN-2 isolate.\n\n\nMethods\nA full-length cDNA clone was generated from the DEN-2 virus and used to produce recombinant DEN-2 (rDEN-2) and rDEN2\u039430. Viruses were evaluated for replication in SCID mice transplanted with human hepatoma cells (SCID-HuH-7 mice), in mosquitoes, and in rhesus monkeys. Neutralizing antibody induction and protective efficacy were also assessed in rhesus monkeys.\n\n\nResults\nThe rDEN2\u039430 virus was ten-fold reduced in replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice when compared to the parent virus. The rDEN-2 viruses were not infectious for Aedes mosquitoes, but both readily infected Toxorynchites mosquitoes. In rhesus monkeys, rDEN2\u039430 appeared to be slightly attenuated when compared to the parent virus as measured by duration and peak of viremia and neutralizing antibody induction. A derivative of rDEN2\u039430, designated rDEN2\u039430-4995, was generated by incorporation of a point mutation previously identified in the NS3 gene of DEN-4 and was found to be more attenuated than rDEN2\u039430 in SCID-HuH-7 mice.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe rDEN2\u039430 and rDEN2\u039430-4995 viruses can be considered for evaluation in humans and for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine.\n\n", "fulltext": "The increased prevalence of disease caused by the mosquito-borne dengue (DEN) viruses (four serotypes; DEN-1 \u2013 DEN-4) has intensified the effort to generate a vaccine that would both confer protection and be economically feasible for use in countries with limited resources for healthcare. Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock (DHF/DSS) are a severe disease burden for tropical and semitropical countries inhabited by more than 2.5 billion people. Risk factors for the more severe disease, DHF/DSS, include the strain of virus, age and genetic background of the host, and secondary infection by a DEN serotype different from that which caused the primary infection. Increased risk associated with secondary infection by a different DEN serotype is believed to be caused both by increased virus replication resulting from antibody-dependent enhancement and by augmented immune activation induced by the secondary infection. Typically, regions with DHF/DSS have all four DEN serotypes circulating simultaneously, and an effective DEN vaccine must contain a tetravalent formulation that confers protection against each of the four DEN serotypes. Immunity to the DEN viruses is primarily mediated by neutralizing antibodies directed against the envelope (E) glycoprotein, and most vaccine strategies aim to induce antibody against this major protective antigen. Live attenuated tetravalent vaccines appear to be the best vaccine candidates since they are economical to manufacture and they induce long-term immunity with the live attenuated yellow fever virus vaccine serving as a successful model flavivirus vaccine. Several strategies to produce live attenuated tetravalent vaccines are being pursued including attenuation of viruses by conventional passage in tissue culture or introduction of defined attenuating mutations into recombinant DEN viruses. In addition, chimeric dengue viruses are being evaluated that contain the E protein of a DEN virus on a background of either an attenuated DEN virus from a different serotype or a more distantly related, but attenuated, flavivirus. We have previously described attenuated and immunogenic monovalent vaccine candidates for DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4 that were generated by two distinct recombinant methodologies. Using the first methodology, nucleotides 10478\u201310507 were deleted from the 3' UTR (\u039430) of a wild type cDNA clone for DEN-4 to generate a vaccine candidate, rDEN4\u039430, which is safe, attenuated, and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys and humans. Incorporation of the \u039430 mutation into an infectious cDNA clone of DEN-1 wild type virus at a site homologous to that in DEN-4 attenuated DEN-1 for rhesus monkeys and is currently being evaluated in humans. The \u039430 mutation did not confer attenuation upon DEN-3 for reasons that have not been defined. Thus, this approach has yielded live attenuated virus vaccine candidates for both DEN-1 and DEN-4. Using a second methodology, antigenic chimeric viruses have been generated by replacing the membrane protein (M) and E structural genes of rDEN4\u039430 with those from DEN-2 or DEN-3. These antigenic chimeric viruses were attenuated and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys and represent vaccine candidates for DEN-2 and DEN-3. We have also described a set of point mutations that can attenuate wild type rDEN-4 for SCID mice transplanted with human liver cells (SCID-HuH-7) or for rhesus monkeys. Such mutations identified in rDEN-4 could be introduced into conserved sites of cDNA clones for other DEN serotypes to fine-tune the level of attenuation of vaccine candidates. We have found it prudent to pursue several strategies to develop a live attenuated virus vaccine for each dengue serotype recognizing that it has been a challenge to achieve a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Thus, in addition to the antigenic chimeric DEN-2 vaccine candidate described above, a second approach was pursued in the present study that involved the construction of an infectious cDNA clone of a wild type DEN-2 virus isolated in Tonga, and the generation of DEN-2 vaccine candidates by the sequential introduction of defined attenuating mutations into the recombinant version of the DEN-2 Tonga/74 wild type virus. The rDEN2\u039430 vaccine candidate was evaluated for replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice, mosquitoes, and rhesus monkeys. In addition, an attenuating point mutation, previously described in DEN-4, was introduced into the rDEN2\u039430 virus, and this rDEN2\u039430 derivative was characterized in SCID-HuH-7 mice. Vero cells (African green monkey kidney) were propagated in OptiPro SFM (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen). HuH-7 cells (human hepatoma) were maintained in D-MEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM L-glutamine and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). C6/36 cells (Aedes albopictus mosquito cells) were maintained at 32\u00b0C in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) containing Earle's salts and 25 mM HEPES buffer (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). A dengue virus type 2 isolate, Tonga/74, was provided by Dr. Duane Gubler (CDC, Fort Collins, CO). The virus was isolated during a 1974 dengue outbreak in the South Pacific island of Tonga. The virus was isolated by inoculation of patient sera into Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and subsequent passage in C6/36 cells before determination of genomic sequence. Viral RNA was isolated from DEN-2 Tonga/74 wild type virus using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamer primers and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Overlapping PCR fragments of approximately 2000 base pairs were generated using DEN-2 specific primers and Advantage cDNA polymerase (ClonTech, Palo Alto, CA). Both strands of the resulting PCR fragments were sequenced directly on a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using DEN-2 specific primers in BigDye terminator cycle sequencing reactions (Applied Biosystems) and the results were assembled into a consensus sequence. To determine the nucleotide sequence of the genomic 5' and 3' regions, the 5' cap nucleoside of the viral genome was removed with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI), followed by circularization of the genome using RNA ligase (Epicentre Technologies). An RT-PCR fragment spanning the ligation junction was generated and sequenced using DEN-2 primers. For the DEN-2 Tonga/74 consensus sequence, GenBank accession number AY744147 was assigned. cDNA fragments of DEN-2 Tonga/74 were generated by reverse-transcription of the genome as indicated in Figure 1. Each fragment was subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced to verify that it matched the consensus sequence as determined for the virus. This yielded seven cloned cDNA fragments spanning the genome. Cloned fragments were modified as follows: Fragment X, representing the 5' end of the genome was abutted to the SP6 promoter; Fragment L was modified to contain a SpeI restriction site at genomic nucleotide 2353; Fragment R was modified to contain a SpeI restriction site also at genomic nucleotide 2353, and, to stabilize the eventual full-length clone, two additional mutations at nucleotides 2362 \u2013 2364 and 2397 were created to ensure that translation stop codons were present in all reading frames other than that used to synthesize the virus polyprotein; Fragment A was modified at nucleotide 3582 to ablate a naturally occurring SpeI restriction site and at nucleotide 4497 to ablate a naturally occurring KpnI restriction site; Fragment C was modified at nucleotide 9374 to ablate a naturally occurring KpnI restriction site; and Fragment Y, representing the 3' end of the genome was abutted to a KpnI restriction site. All mutations introduced into the cloned cDNA fragments were translationally-silent, thereby preserving the wild-type polyprotein sequence. Each fragment was added incrementally between the AscI and KpnI restriction sites of DEN-4 cDNA clone p4 (GenBank accession number: AY648301) to generate a full-length DEN-2 cDNA clone (p2) with the same vector background successfully used to generate rDEN-4 and rDEN4\u039430 virus. cDNA clone p2 was sequenced to confirm that the virus genome region matched the DEN-2 Tonga/74 consensus amino acid and nucleotide sequence, with the exception of the translationally-silent modifications noted above. The \u039430 mutation which removes nucleotides 10541\u201310570 was introduced into Fragment Y to generate Fragment Y\u039430. To create p2\u039430, the Fragment Y region of p2 was replaced with Fragment Y\u039430 (Figure 1). The genomic region of each full-length cDNA was sequenced as described above and GenBank accessions were assigned as follows (cDNA clone: accession numbers): p2: AY744148, p2\u039430: AY744149. Using site-directed mutagenesis, an attenuating amino acid change characterized in the NS3 gene of DEN-4 (nt 4995\u20137; a.a. 158, Ser\u2192Leu) was introduced into the p2\u039430 cDNA clone. A mutagenic oligonucleotide was designed to change DEN-2 NS3 amino acid 158 from Ser (AGT) to Leu (CTA) and used to construct the cDNA clone, p2\u039430-4995 (accession number: AY744150), which was sequenced for confirmation of nucleotide changes. cDNA clones were linearized with Acc65I (isoschizomer of KpnI which cleaves leaving only a single 3' nucleotide) and were transcribed in vitro using the AmpliCap SP6 Message Maker kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). Purified transcripts were then transfected into Vero or C6/36 cells. Viruses recovered in C6/36 cells were passaged 3 times in Vero cells, and all viruses were biologically cloned by terminal dilution in Vero cells. The genomes of recombinant viruses used to infect rhesus monkeys were completely sequenced as described above to identify adventitious mutations that had accumulated during transfection and biological cloning. Four to six week-old SCID mice (Tac:Icr:Ha(ICR)-Prkdcscid) (Taconic, Germantown, NY) were injected intraperitoneally with 107 HuH-7 cells suspended in 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline. Tumors were detected in the peritoneum, and mice were infected by direct inoculation of the tumor with 104 PFU of virus in 0.05 ml Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). On day 7 post-infection, serum was obtained from cardiac blood and stored at -70\u00b0C. Virus titer in serum samples was determined by plaque assay in Vero cells. The DEN-2 viruses were evaluated in rhesus macaques using established methods. DEN virus sero-negative monkeys were injected subcutaneously with 105 PFU virus diluted in L-15 medium (Invitrogen) or with a mock inoculum. Serum was collected on days 0\u20136, 8, 10, 12 and 28 after inoculation and stored at -70\u00b0C. Virus titer was determined for each serum sample by plaque assay in Vero cells and serum neutralizing antibody titer was determined for serum from days 0 and 28 by plaque reduction neutralization test. On day 28, monkeys were challenged with 105 PFU of DEN-2 Tonga/74, and serum was collected on days 29\u201334, 36, and 56. Virus titer was determined for serum from days 28\u201334 and 36 and serum neutralizing antibody titer was determined for serum from day 56. Replication in Aedes aegypti and Toxorynchites amboinensis mosquitoes was evaluated as previously described. Briefly, A. aegypti were fed blood meals containing serial 10-fold dilutions of virus. After 21 days, viral antigen was detected in head and midgut preparations by immunoflourescence assay using DEN-2-specific hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid and fluorescein isothyocyanate conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and the mosquito infectious dose-50% (MID50) was determined. T. amboinensis were inoculated intrathoracically with a 0.2 ul dose containing serial ten-fold dilutions of virus and incubated for 14 days. Head preparations were made and antigen visualized as described above. A full-length cDNA clone, p2, was constructed that matched the genomic consensus sequence of the American genotype DEN-2 isolate, Tonga/74, with the exception of translationally-silent modifications made to facilitate cloning (Figure 1). The previously described \u039430 deletion mutation was incorporated into the p2 cDNA clone to form p2\u039430. The rDEN-2 virus was recovered in C6/36 and Vero cells, but the presence of the \u039430 mutation limited recovery to only C6/36 cells. After passage in Vero cells, adaptation mutations were identified by sequence analysis as had been described for other DEN viruses. Both rDEN-2 and rDEN2\u039430 viruses accumulated a single nucleotide change in NS4B at nt 7169 encoding a Val\u2192Ala change at amino acid position 115 as has been observed for rDEN-3 (Table 1). The same nucleotide change was previously reported to occur at the homologous site following passage of DEN-4 in Vero cells resulting in a Leu\u2192Ser change (Table 1). Inclusion of the 7169 mutation into the p2\u039430 cDNA permitted recovery in both C6/36 and Vero cells (data not shown). The rDEN2\u039430 virus reached a virus titer of 6.6 log10PFU/ml in Vero cells. As an initial evaluation of replication of the DEN-2 Tonga/74 virus and the rDEN-2 viruses, replication in SCID mice transplanted with HuH-7 human hepatoma cells (SCID-HuH-7 mice) was tested. Wild-type viruses from each DEN serotype have been shown to replicate to approximately 6.0 log10PFU/ml serum in SCID-HuH-7 mice, and an att phenotype in SCID-HuH-7 mice has been shown to be a predictor of reduced replication in rhesus monkeys. The parent DEN-2 Tonga/74 virus replicated efficiently in SCID-HuH-7 mice and reached a mean titer in serum of 5.9 log10PFU/ml (Table 2) similar to that previously observed with the DEN-2 New Guinea C (NGC) prototype strain. The rDEN-2 virus replicated to the same level as the wild-type isolate, while rDEN2\u039430 was 10-fold restricted in replication. This reduction was statistically significant (Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test; P < 0.05), and was similar to that observed for the well-characterized rDEN4\u039430 virus. The DEN-2 viruses were evaluated for infectivity of Aedes aegypti fed on an infectious bloodmeal (oral infectivity only) and for Toxorynchites amboinensis inoculated intrathoracically (Table 3). At the doses tested neither DEN-2, rDEN-2, or rDEN2\u039430 were detected in the midgut or head of A. aegypti mosquitoes which had fed on an infectious bloodmeal 21 days earlier. The inability to infect the midgut led to a lack of infection in the head tissue. This indicates that the DEN-2 Tonga/74 viruses are poorly infectious for A. aegypti mosquitoes by oral infectivity, as has been demonstrated for multiple DEN-2 viruses of the American genotype. In contrast the DEN-2 NGC prototype strain, an Asian genotype member, was highly infectious in A. aegypti mosquitoes when tested previously but it was not included here as a concurrent control. The defect in rDEN-2 infectivity for A. aegypti was further investigated by directly inoculating the same virus stocks intrathoracically into T. amboinensis and measuring the ability of the viruses to infect the head tissues. Both rDEN-2 and rDEN2\u039430 were highly infectious by intrathoracic inoculation (Table 3). The \u039430 mutation did not alter the infectivity of rDEN-2 following intrathoracic inoculation, a property also previously observed for DEN-1, -3 and -4. These results indicate that the lack of infectivity for A. aegypti was likely caused by the inability of the DEN-2 Tonga/74 viruses to establish a midgut infection and that the viruses retained the ability to infect head tissues. The replication (viremia), immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the DEN-2 viruses in monkeys were studied. Monkeys inoculated with the DEN-2 Tonga/74 wild-type isolate were viremic for an average of 4.5 days with a mean peak titer of 2.1 log10PFU/ml (Table 4). Inoculation with rDEN-2 resulted in detectable viremia for 4.0 days with a mean peak titer of 1.9 log10PFU/ml. While the levels of rDEN2\u039430 replication (2.8 days viremia; mean peak titer of 1.7 log10PFU/ml) were lower than DEN-2 and rDEN-2, the differences were not as dramatic as had been observed for rDEN1\u039430 and rDEN4\u039430 when compared to their parent viruses. The level of neutralizing antibodies induced by the rDEN2\u039430 virus was also less than that induced by the wild-type DEN-2 viruses, a finding consistent with the decreased replication exhibited by this vaccine candidate. Therefore, by three quantitative measures, duration and peak titer of viremia and the level of neutralizing antibodies induced, rDEN2\u039430 appeared to be attenuated when compared to DEN-2 Tonga/74. When vaccinated monkeys were challenged with DEN-2 Tonga/74, all monkeys were protected, as indicated by the lack of viremia (Table 4). Based on the limited attenuation conferred upon rDEN-2 by the \u039430 mutation in rhesus monkeys, we sought to construct a further attenuated derivative of rDEN2\u039430. To further attenuate rDEN2\u039430, an att mutation that has been characterized in another DEN serotype was imported into a homologous region in DEN-2. One such mutation, the 4995 mutation in DEN-4 NS3 at amino acid 158 (Ser\u2192Leu), was previously incorporated into the DEN-4 vaccine candidate, rDEN4\u039430, and found to further attenuate the virus for SCID-HuH-7 mice and rhesus monkeys. Site directed mutagenesis was used to introduce a Ser\u2192Leu mutation at amino acid 158 of NS3 in rDEN2\u039430-7169, and the rDEN2\u039430-4995 virus was recovered in C6/36 cells and propagated in Vero cells reaching a virus titer of 6.2 log10PFU/ml (Table 1). Importantly, the resulting Leu codon would require two nucleotide changes to revert to one of the six odons encoding a Ser residue. Replication in the SCID-HuH-7 mouse model was used as an initial assessment of the rDEN2\u039430-4995 virus phenotype. Table 5 includes results from three separate experiments (including those from Table 1) and confirms the approximate 10-fold reduction in replication conferred by the \u039430 mutation upon rDEN-2 replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice. The rDEN2\u039430-4995 virus had a mean peak virus titer of 4.6 log10PFU/ml which was only a modest reduction from that of rDEN2\u039430, 5.2 log10PFU/ml. However, comparison of a large number of samples indicated that the reduction in virus titer conferred by the NS3 4995 mutation upon rDEN2\u039430 was statistically significant (rDEN2\u039430-4995 versus rDEN2\u039430; Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test; P < 0.05). The virus titer of rDEN2\u039430-4995 virus in SCID-HuH-7 mice was over 60-fold reduced from that of the rDEN-2 parent virus. Development of a live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine has been complicated by two major factors. First, monovalent vaccine candidates that exhibit a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity have been difficult to identify. Second, satisfactorily attenuated tetravalent vaccine formulations that induce a broad neutralizing antibody response against each of the four DEN serotypes have been difficult to develop. For these reasons, we have sought to develop multiple vaccine candidates for each DEN serotype to increase the likelihood that a vaccine with a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity will be identified. To produce a live-attenuated DEN-2 vaccine candidate, we previously generated an antigenic chimeric virus, rDEN2/4\u039430, expressing the M and E structural genes of the DEN-2 NGC strain on the attenuated rDEN4\u039430 background. The vaccine candidates described in the present study, rDEN2\u039430 and rDEN2\u039430-4995, could serve as alternates to this antigenic chimeric virus if evaluation of the rDEN2/4\u039430 virus in humans, either as a monovalent vaccine or as a component of a tetravalent vaccine, indicates that it lacks a balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. It was hoped that each of the four components of a tetravalent vaccine, consisting of DEN-1, -2, -3, and -4 wild type viruses, each with the common 30 nucleotide deletion mutation in the 3' UTR, would exhibit a similar level of attenuation in animal models. Unfortunately, the level of attenuation conferred by the \u039430 mutation upon each of the four serotypes has proven to be variable. In rhesus monkeys, the rDEN2\u039430 virus appears to have an intermediate attenuation phenotype in between that of the attenuated rDEN1\u039430 and rDEN4\u039430 and the non-attenuated rDEN3\u039430. Although rDEN2\u039430 was slightly attenuated compared to its DEN-2 parent virus in rhesus monkeys, the reduction in replication was less than that of rDEN1\u039430 and rDEN4\u039430. While the latter two viruses had detectable viremia in only 50% of monkeys, a mean number of viremic days of less than one day, and a mean peak viremia of less than 1.0 log10PFU/ml, the rDEN2\u039430 virus infected 100% of the rhesus monkeys and reached a peak virus titer of 1.7 log10PFU/ml. However, the 10-fold reduction of replication of rDEN4\u039430 and rDEN2\u039430 in SCID-HuH-7 mice, compared to that of their respective wild type parents, was similar. To date, rDEN4\u039430 is the only \u039430 vaccine candidate that has been tested in humans, and it was found to be both safe and immunogenic. If the level of attenuation in SCID-HuH-7 mice serves as a better guide to attenuation in humans, rDEN2\u039430 might be satisfactorily attenuated in humans since its level of attenuation for SCID-HuH-7 mice and that of the rDEN4\u039430 vaccine candidate are comparable. To construct a further attenuated derivative of rDEN2\u039430, the 4995 mutation present in the NS3 gene of DEN-4 at amino acid 158 (Ser\u2192Leu) was introduced into the homologous region of the NS3 protein of rDEN2\u039430. Although the 4995 mutation results in a single amino acid change and thus may be susceptible to reversion, the mutant leucine codon selected for insertion into rDEN2\u039430-4995 would require two nucleotide changes to revert to a serine codon. Introduction of the 4995 mutation into rDEN4\u039430 resulted in a 100-fold greater reduction of replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice. In rDEN2\u039430, its introduction resulted in nearly a 10-fold reduction in virus titer, a smaller but still statistically significant reduction. These results provide a second example of the difficulty in predicting the precise level of attenuation following import of an attenuating mutation into a different DEN serotype. Nevertheless, the rDEN2\u039430-4995 vaccine candidate is more attenuated than its rDEN2\u039430 parent and warrants evaluation in rhesus monkeys and humans. Epidemiologic and molecular pathogenesis studies of DEN-2 strains support the concept that the DEN-2 Tonga/74 virus, from which the vaccine candidates were derived, may naturally have a lower level of virulence than other DEN-2 viruses. If the DEN-2 Tonga/74 parent virus is naturally attenuated to some degree, only a small incremental increase in attenuation might be required to satisfactorily attenuate it for humans. Gubler et al. investigated the 1974 outbreak of DEN-2 infection in the Pacific island of Tonga. In comparison to a subsequent DEN-1 outbreak, the 1974 DEN-2 outbreak was distinguished by mild disease with few hemorrhagic sequelae, low viremia, and an overall slow spread of virus infection. The weak DEN-2 outbreak was proposed to be a result of the circulation of a strain with an inherently low level of virulence. Since the Tonga/74 outbreak, additional evidence has emerged that supports the suggestion that there are at least two circulating lineages of DEN-2 viruses that differ in virulence. The DEN-2 Tonga/74 virus is a member of the DEN-2 American genotype, which as a group appear to possess lower virulence than that of the Asian genotype of DEN-2 viruses. Despite the presence of the American DEN-2 genotype viruses and limited co-circulation of DEN-1 and DEN-3 viruses in the Americas in the 1960s and 1970s, the first major epidemic of DHF/DSS in the Americas occurred only after the introduction of a DEN-2 Asian genotype virus in 1981. It was thought that genetic differences might have contributed to this difference in virulence and evidence to this effect has been forthcoming. Rico-Hesse and colleagues have defined genetic elements within the genome of DEN-2 American genotype viruses which distinguish them from members of the Asian genotype. In addition, using chimeric rDEN-2 American/Asian viruses, introduction of three genetic elements (a point mutation in the E gene, the 5' UTR, and the 3' UTR) of the American genotype was found to confer reduced virus replication in dendritic cells and monocytes upon an Asian genotype rDEN-2. The Tonga/74 virus shares each of these three attenuating genetic determinants specific to the American genotype, which provides a possible explanation for its lower virulence in humans. The rDEN2\u039430 vaccine candidate, whose parent is the DEN-2 Tonga/74 American genotype virus, thus contains naturally occurring and experimentally introduced attenuating mutations. Thus, the small incremental increase in attenuation provided by the \u039430, with or without the 4995 mutation, might prove to satisfactorily attenuate the DEN-2 Tonga/74 for humans. The American genotype DEN-2 viruses exhibit decreased infectivity for Aedes mosquitoes in comparison to Asian DEN-2 viruses. Consistent with these observations, the wild type New Guinea C Asian DEN2 virus was highly infectious for Aedes mosquitoes in our laboratory whereas the Tonga/74 American genotype virus was poorly infectious by the oral route (present study). In fact, the increased prevalence of DEN-2 viruses of the Asian genotype in the Americas has been suggested to be a result of their enhanced transmission. However, the active circulation of American genotype viruses over many decades indicates that mosquito transmission does occur and large epidemics have been associated with viruses of this genotype. At the doses tested, neither the DEN-2 Tonga/74 isolate nor the recombinant viruses were found to infect the midgut or head of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes fed an infectious blood meal. Since rDEN-2 and rDEN2\u039430 viruses were infectious by intrathoracic inoculation of Toxorynchites mosquitoes, the lack of infectivity for A. aegypti was likely caused solely by the inability of the DEN-2 Tonga/74 viruses to establish a midgut infection. Decreased infectivity for Aedes mosquitoes could serve to help limit transmission of the vaccine virus. The live-attenuated DEN-2 virus candidates described here, rDEN2\u039430 and rDEN2\u039430-4995, have several properties desired in a live attenuated virus vaccine for humans. First, both viruses reached a titer over 6.0 log10PFU/ml in Vero cells that would permit economical manufacture. Second, the viruses are derived from the DEN-2 Tonga/74 strain, a member of the American genotype, which has been associated with decreased virulence. Third, rDEN2\u039430 was attenuated for replication in SCID-HuH-7 mice and slightly attenuated for rhesus monkeys while inducing a protective neutralizing antibody response. Fourth, rDEN2\u039430-4995 was more attenuated in SCID-HuH-7 mice than rDEN2\u039430. Fifth, the DEN-2 Tonga/74 strain, like other members of the American genotype, is poorly infectious for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which would help to limit uncontrolled transmission of the vaccine virus."}, "16412238": {"pmid": "16412238", "pmcid": "PMC1368963", "title": "Peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor-\u03b3 deficiency in a Canadian kindred with familial partial lipodystrophy type 3 (FPLD3)", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nFamilial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan) type 3 (FPLD3, Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] 604367) results from heterozygous mutations in PPARG encoding peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3.

FPLD subtype 2 (FPLD2, MIM 151660) results from mutations in nuclear lamin A/C encoded by LMNA (MIM 151330), and FPLD subtype 3 (FPLD3, MIM 604367) results from mutations in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 encoded by PPARG (MIM 601487). The FPLD phenotype is characterized by redistribution of fat stores \u2013 lipoatrophy of extremities and gluteal region often with lipohypertrophy involving the face and in central/visceral adipose stores \u2013 together with clinical metabolic disturbances such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes. Careful phenotypic \u2013 or \"phenomic\" \u2013 analysis suggested that fat redistribution is more extreme in FPLD2 compared to FPLD3, but that metabolic disturbances are greater in FPLD3 compared to FPLD2. Thus, fat loss is probably a key mechanism that contributes to the development of metabolic complications in both FPLD subtypes, but the more severe clinical features in FPLD3 suggest that PPARG mutations may have additional direct effects. Indeed, an independent direct effect of the dominant negative human PPARG P467L mutation \u2013 induction of hypertension \u2013 was recently demonstrated in an animal model. Certain PPARG missense mutations in FPLD3 \u2013 such as V290M and P467L \u2013 appear to act through a dominant negative mechanism, in which the mutant allele product is expressed and then interferes with the function of the product of the wild-type allele, resulting in markedly depressed net receptor activity. In contrast, the heterozygous PPARG missense mutation F388L in FPLD3 does not act through a dominant negative mechanism; it appears simply to have diminished transactivation capacity, with no obvious effect on the wild-type allele product, resulting in effective \"haploinsufficiency\" from depressed but not absent receptor activity. Furthermore, the recently described heterozygous PPARG -14A>G promoter variant in FPLD3 is associated with no coding sequence change, and only a simple reduction in promoter activity, again suggesting that haploinsufficiency but not complete deficiency of PPAR-\u03b3 activity as the basis of disease among affected heterozygotes. We now present a Canadian FPLD3 family with a novel PPARG nonsense mutation whose disease mechanism appears to be haploinsufficiency rather than dominant negative. The study received approval from the University of Western Ontario Ethics Review Panel (protocol 07920E) and all subjects gave informed consent to participate. DNA sequencing initially showed no mutation in LMNA. We amplified and sequenced the 6 exons of PPARG plus >100 nucleotides at each intron-exon boundary, and ~700 bp of the promoter. Rapid, allele-specific genotyping methods were then developed for each mutation. For the Y355X mutation genotype, we amplified the 603 bp fragment containing exon 5 using primers 5' TTC ACT GTG AGT TAG AAA TC and 3' CAA TGC AGA CTA ACA CTA AGG. This was followed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose, gel purification and ddNTP extension (SnaPShot, PE Applied Biosystems, Mississauga, ON) with primer 5' AAG AGC CTG CGA AAG CCT TT, and analysis on a Prism 377 DNA Sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Mississauga, ON). Genomic DNA from 260 healthy Caucasian subjects was studied, permitting 95% power to exclude a mutation frequency \u22651% in the healthy population (two-tailed alpha<0.05). A cDNA encoding full-length human PPAR\u03b31 was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The Y355X mutation was introduced into this clone using the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by changing the tyrosine codon (TAC) to a stop codon TAG. Both the wild-type (WT) and mutant clones were fully sequenced. Initial experiments demonstrated that transfection of the Y355X PPAR\u03b3 clone resulted in the production of a small amount of full-length PPAR\u03b3 protein, presumably generated by inefficient translation termination at the 355X stop codon. To eliminate this contaminating wild-type PPAR\u03b3, which would compromise interpretation of results, a second construct was generated in which all of the PPAR\u03b3 sequences down-stream of the 355X codon were deleted from the plasmid. All of the transcription assays were carried out with this construct. For transcription assays, NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in 96-well plates (5.5 \u00d7 103 cells/well) in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with the either WT or Y355X mutant PPAR\u03b3 expression plasmid, 1 ng of a \u03b2-galactosidase control plasmid and 35 ng of the PPAR-dependent luciferase reporter pFATP-Luc (three copies of the mouse FATP gene PPRE inserted upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter). Cells were transfected for 4 h with Lipofectamine-plus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and then treated with DMSO or the indicated amount of rosiglitazone for 16 h. Luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase activities were measured in cell extracts using the Dual-light assay system (ABI, Foster City, CA) and a 96-well luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Transfections were performed in triplicate. To examine protein expression of PPAR\u03b3, a FLAG epitope tag was added to the N-termini of WT and Y355X cDNAs and both were transferred into the eukaryotic expression vector pTRE-shuttle2 (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). NIH3T3 cells (1.0 \u00d7 106 cells/well of a 6-well plate) were transfected with the indicated amounts of PPAR\u03b3 expression plasmid, and 1 ng of a cyan fluorescent protein-expressing plasmid pECFP-N1 as a control. After 20 h, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in a buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 30 mM NaF and 1 mM Na3VO4. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. Western blots were performed by using monoclonal anti-FLAG-M2-peroxidase (HRP) conjugated antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Subject II-5 (Figure 1). A 45 year-old woman was referred for severe hypertriglyceridemia with relapsing pancreatitis. She had noted muscular legs and lower arms beginning in adolescence. Menarche was at age 12 and periods were regular. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia were diagnosed during her third pregnancy at age 33. Diabetes was treated with oral agents alone until age 40 when insulin was added. Control of both glycemia and hypertriglyceridemia has been difficult, with triglycerides >100 mmol/L at times and recurrent eruptive xanthomata and pancreatitis. A five-month trial of pioglitazone 15 mg daily resulted in a decrease in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from 12.1 to 7.6%, and in triglycerides from 66.4 to 7.3 mmol/L, but this was later discontinued due to fluid retention. She had no history of hypertension. Physical examination revealed normal blood pressure, BMI 30 kg/m2, waist circumference 90 cm, and small eruptive xanthomata over her elbows. Subcutaneous fat was markedly diminished in her arms below the distal humerus and in her buttocks, thighs, and calves, with prominent arm and leg musculature. Facial, neck, suprascapular and abdominal fat distribution was normal. She had no buffalo hump, acanthosis nigricans or phlebectasia. Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged fatty liver and enlarged spleen. Dual X-ray absorptiometry scan revealed total body fat of 19.9% (within the normal female range), but with decreased fat on the limbs, particularly the legs at 14%. Figure 2 shows a computed tomographic scan of the legs of the proband and a normal subject; the proband had a relative paucity of fat. Measurements in fasting plasma included: glucose 14.4 mmol/L; HbA1c 10.1% (normal 4.3\u20136.1%); insulin 26.3 mU/L (normal 5.0\u201320.0); C-peptide 3.69 nmol/L (normal 0.30\u20131.32). Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides were 14.7 and 49.6 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were not determined. Serum alanine transaminase was 21 U/L (normal <50 U/L). APOE genotype was normal (E3/E3). Lipoprotein lipase activity was slightly depressed at 79 nmol/min/ml (normal >90 nmol/min/ml). Triglycerides varied between 9.1 and 59.4 mmol/L despite treatment with fenofibrate 200 mg and salmon oil 6 g daily. Plasma glucose remained high despite taking >2 U/kg insulin daily and metformin 500 mg TID. A five-day trial of octreotide 100 \u03bcg TID to ameliorate abdominal pain reduced plasma C-peptide levels to <1 nmol/L and insulin to the normal range, but did not reduce fasting or postprandial glucose levels and produced abdominal bloating. Genomic DNA sequence analysis of the LIPE gene encoding lipoprotein lipase showed no mutations. Subject III-3 (Figure 1). The 12 year-old daughter of subject II-5 was assessed for combined hyperlipidemia. She was born at 33 weeks' gestation, during a pregnancy that had been complicated by pre-eclampsia, diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. At age 3 months, she was diagnosed with a patent ductus arteriosus with pulmonary branch stenosis and incomplete right bundle branch block. She had poor growth and difficulty feeding as an infant. She was first noted to have elevated triglycerides and cholesterol at age 5 that were treated only with dietary advice. She required several corrective surgeries for strabismus, the most recent at age 12. There was no history of pancreatitis or eruptive xanthomata. Height and weight at age 12 1/2 years were 153 cm (25\u201350th percentile for age and sex) and 45.4 kg (50th percentile for age and sex), respectively. She had a broad forehead with deep-set eyes, triangular facies and a narrow pointed chin. Examination of the chest, heart, and musculoskeletal systems was unremarkable, and there was no acanthosis nigricans or phlebectasia. She had a normal distribution of subcutaneous fat, with no loss of fat over the arms, buttocks, or legs, and no increase in face, neck, suprascapular or abdominal fat. Measurements in fasting plasma revealed: glucose 5.0 mmol/L; insulin 18.2 mU/L (normal 5.0\u201320 mU/L); C-peptide 1.64 nmol/L (normal 0.30\u20131.32 nmol/L); total cholesterol 5.26 mmol/L (normal 3.2\u20134.4 mmol/L for age), triglycerides 1.79 mmol/L (normal 0.4\u20131.3 mmol/L); HDL cholesterol 0.92 mmol/L (normal 1.0\u20131.8 mmol/L); and LDL cholesterol 3.52 (normal 1.6\u20132.8 mmol/L). Subjects II-5 and III-3 were each found to be heterozygous for a nonsense mutation (single nucleotide base change), that predicted a premature termination signal rather than the wild-type (WT) tyrosine at codon 355 (Figure 3). This mutation was absent from 5 non-FPLD3 first-degree relatives of subject II-5 (namely subjects I-2, II-2, II-4, III-1 and III-2). The mutation was absent from the genomes of 260 healthy control subjects. To establish experimental conditions that generated equal amounts of the Y355X mutation, epitope-tagged versions of the WT and mutant PPAR\u03b3 clones were transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Western analysis of extracts from these cells demonstrated that much less Y355X mutant protein was produced from the same amount of transfected DNA suggesting that the mutant receptor was significantly less stable than the wild-type receptor (Figure 4A). Approximately 15 times more Y355X than wild-type DNA was needed to generate equal amounts of the two PPAR\u03b3 proteins. Using these conditions, the transcriptional activity of the Y355X PPAR\u03b3 mutant was assessed by transient transfection of (non-epitope tagged) PPAR\u03b3 expressing plasmids into NIH3T3 cells and measuring luciferase activity from a PPAR responsive reporter. Under these conditions the Y355X mutation did not display any transcriptional activity at any dose of the ligand rosiglitazone (Figure 4B). To determine if the Y355X receptor had dominant-negative activity against WT PPAR\u03b3, a mixing experiment was performed in which WT and mutant receptors were co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells. In the absence of ligand, the transcriptional activity of the combination of 1 ng of WT and 15 ng of Y355X DNA (equal protein amounts) was similar to 1 ng of WT receptor alone (Figure 5A). Likewise, in the presence of a saturating amount of ligand, the presence of an equal amount of Y355X protein did not reduce the activity of co-transfected WT PPAR\u03b3. These results indicate that the Y355X mutation does not have dominant-negative activity against the WT receptor. This was confirmed by further mixing experiments in which an increasing amount of mutant or WT receptor was mixed with a fixed amount of WT PPAR\u03b3 (Figure 5B). While increasing the amount of the wild-type receptor caused a dose dependent increase in transcriptional activity (Figure 5B, open bars), the addition of increasing amounts of Y355X PPAR\u03b3 to a fixed amount of wild-type receptor had no significant effect on transcription (Figure 5B, filled bars). For comparison, the same experiment was conducted with a PPAR\u03b3 mutation (V290M) that has been previously shown to have dominant-negative activity. Increasing amounts of V290M PPAR\u03b3 caused a dose-dependent decrease in wild-type PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity in this assay (Figure 5B, grey bars). Thus, PPAR\u03b3 receptors bearing the Y355X mutation do not possess any dominant-negative activity against the wild-type PPAR\u03b3 receptor The principal novel findings of this study are: 1) identification of a novel human PPARG nonsense mutation, namely Y355X; 2) demonstration that heterozygosity for Y355X is associated with partial lipodystrophy and metabolic disturbances consistent with the FPLD3 phenotype; and 3) evidence that the mechanism underlying the disease association in affected heterozygotes is haploinsufficiency rather than dominant negative interference of the function of the normal allele product. The Y355X mutation caused the complete inactivation of PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity and reduced the stability of the PPAR\u03b3 protein. The Y355X nonsense mutation almost certainly creates haploinsufficiency \u2013 a quantitative deficiency \u2013 for PPAR\u03b3 in affected FPLD3 subjects. PPARG Y355X (present in two FPLD3 subjects) encodes a protein that is truncated by ~30% and shows no transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the Y355X mutant receptor clearly does not display dominant-negative activity against WT receptor in transfection assays. The likelihood that this lack of dominant-negative activity reflects the in vivo situation is supported by the observation that the adult proband with Y355X had a beneficial response to an average pharmacological dose of the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone. Given the specificity of this ligand for PPAR\u03b3, this observation suggests that there is no interference of the normal allele product. The in vitro results also indicate that the Y355X mutation significantly reduces the stability of the receptor, making it likely that cells with one wild-type and one Y355X allele (as occurs in these patients), would contain significantly less mutant receptor compared to the wild-type protein. Together, these findings strongly suggest that the PPARG Y355X mutation acts via a haploinsufficiency mechanism. The findings extend the range of heterozygous PPARG mutations seen in FPLD3. Currently, most heterozygous PPARG mutations (3/6 total heterozygous mutations, namely -14A>G, F388L and Y355X) from most affected subjects (8/12 total FPLD3 subjects), act via a haploinsufficiency mechanism. The PPARG -14A>G mutation within the promoter of the \u03b34 isoform (present in two FPLD3 subjects) was associated with quantitative loss of expression of the allele product, with no qualitative abnormalities of the encoded protein. PPARG F388L (present in four FPLD3 subjects), a transactivation-deficient missense mutation, was expressed at normal levels and had no in vitro dominant negative interference with the function of the normal allele. The combined LOD score for the linkage of these four heterozygous PPARG haploinsufficiency mutations with the FPLD3 phenotype in the three kindreds is 3.0 (maximum at 0% recombination), providing additional human genetic evidence for causation. Only two heterozygous germline PPARG mutations in FPLD3, namely P467L (present in two FPLD3 subjects) and V290M (present in one FPLD3 subject), were shown by convincing in vitro studies to act through a dominant negative mechanism. The PPARG R425C mutation (present only in one FPLD3 subject) has not yet been functionally assessed in vitro. Another nonsense mutation in PPARG, namely A553\u0394AAATfs185, did not show dominant negative interference of the WT allele, and carriers of this mutation did not have FPLD3, but simple insulin resistance, which required double heterozygosity with a truncation mutation in PPP1R3A for clinical expression. Yet another PPARG missense mutation, R115Q, was found in obese subjects without FPLD3; it had defective phosphorylation of serine at position 114 and an apparent gain of function resulting in accelerated differentiation of pre-adipocytes. The PPARG mutations in subjects without FPLD3 indicate the complexity of the relationship between mutations in this gene and clinical phenotypes, such as phenotype differences related to differences in functional impact, and the requirement for interactions with other genes before a phenotype is expressed. The presence of a metabolic phenotype without loss of subcutaneous fat in the pre-pubescent carrier of Y355X suggests either some variation in penetrance of PPARG mutations, or some influence of other genes activated in puberty that may affect the expression of the Y355X mutation. How might a quantitative relative loss-of-function mutation in one PPARG allele contribute to adipose repartitioning and insulin resistance in FPLD3? Quantitative increases in activity as induced by pharmacological PPAR agonism can enhance insulin sensitivity and anabolically influence adipose tissue. But heterozygous PPAR\u03b3-deficient mice in which one allele has been deleted seem to be less insulin resistant than their WT littermates. This suggests that an additional mechanism or stress may be required to produce insulin resistance in human homologues of these animals. A simple quantitative genetic deficiency of PPAR\u03b3 might compromise the ability of heterozygotes to express sufficient PPAR\u03b3, perhaps creating a bottleneck at key stages of adipose differentiation during development and adolescence. In contrast to other direct effects of PPARG mutations on other pathways and targets, a simple reduction in functional activity resulting from the -14A>G, F388L and Y355X mutations may be sufficient to produce a clinical phenotype. Interestingly, both subjects ascertained here were females. Observations from the small numbers of PPAR\u03b3-deficient individuals indicate that females may be more severely affected than males. Similar, between-sex differences in phenotype severity were noted in FPLD2 due to mutant LMNA. But the anecdotal nature of the between-sex differences in phenotypic severity in PPAR\u03b3-deficiency and in partial lipodystrophy precludes speculation regarding potential mechanisms. Ascertainment of additional subjects and families and specific physiological studies are required. In summary, we have found a rare nonsense mutation causing reduced expression of PPAR\u03b3 in a proband with FPLD3. The findings in this Canadian kindred extend the range of PPARG mutations in FPLD3 and especially those that likely operate through a haploinsufficiency mechanism."}, "18385794": {"pmid": "18385794", "pmcid": "PMC2275209", "title": "Identification of novel mutations and sequence variants in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes in patients with anophthalmia/microphthalmia", "abstract": "\n\nPurpose\nMutations in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes have been reported in patients with anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia.

Mutation c.310 G>T (p. Glu104X), found in one patient, was in the region encoding the high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain and resulted in a change from glutamic acid to a stop codon. The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p. Pro184ArgfsX19) in the region encoding the activation domain, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the coding sequence. The shortened protein products may result in the loss of function. In addition, a novel nucleotide substitution c.*557G>A was identified in the 3\u2032-untranslated region in one patient. The relationship between the nucleotide change and the protein function is indeterminate. A known single nucleotide polymorphism (c. *469 C>A, SNP rs11915160) was also detected in 2 of the 34 patients. Screening of CHX10 identified two synonymous sequence variants, c.471 C>T (p.Ser157Ser, rs35435463) and c.579 G>A (p. Gln193Gln, novel SNP), and one non-synonymous sequence variant, c.871 G>A (p.

Loss of SOX2 function results in severe eye malformation. CHX10 was not implicated with microphthalmia/anophthalmia in our patient cohort.\n\n", "fulltext": "Anophthalmia (an absence of eye structures) and/or microphthalmia (an abnormally small eye) are rare disorders with a prevalence of 0.2\u20130.4 per 10,000 births in developed countries. One or both eyes are affected in isolation or as part of other birth defects. The disease exhibits diverse patterns of genetic inheritance, and the severity is variable due to the genetic heterogeneity of the ocular malformation. Mutations in several human genes are associated with anophthalmia and microphthalmia. Among them, mutations in SOX2 appear to account for most cases. SOX2, which is located at chromosome 3q26.3-q27, encodes 317 amino acids that belong to the high-mobility-group (HMG) DNA-binding protein family. Expressed in embryonic stem cells and a wide variety of tissues during early development, SOX2 plays an important role in cell differentiation and early organogenesis. In ocular tissues, the inhibition of SOX2 expression in the developing Xenopus retina has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and allows cells to develop into non-neuronal cell types. Working in concert with PAX6, SOX2 regulates downstream target genes such as the crystalline genes to guide early lens development. Mutations in SOX2 account for approximately 10% of anophthalmia and microphthalmia cases. Previously reported cases of anophthalmia and microphthalmia were associated with SOX2 whole-gene deletions or coding sequence mutations. In this study, a cohort of 34 anophthalmia/microphthalmia patients was screened for mutations in SOX2. Two novel heterozygous mutations and two sequence variants (one novel, one known SNP) were identified in 6 (two siblings) out of 34 patients. This confirms the importance of SOX2 mutation screening in patients with anophthalmia/microphthalmia. In screening unaffected family members, we also found an individual with a pathogenic allele suggesting the novel finding that autosomal dominant SOX2 mutations can be non-penetrant. As part of our large scale screening campaign, mutation analysis of CHX10 was also performed. The homeodomain protein CHX10 has been shown to be essential for ocular development, and autosomal recessive mutations of the gene have been implicated in microphthalmia in both humans and mice. Screening of the same cohort of anophthalmia/microphthalmia patients identified two synonymous sequence variants in exon 3 and one non-synonymous sequence variant in exon 5. This non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in normal controls. We did not find sequence variants in other exons of CHX10, suggesting that CHX10 mutations are less frequent in patients with anophthalmia. To identify existing and potentially novel mutations of SOX2 and CHX10 in a cohort of anophthalmia and microphthalmia patients, we undertook a candidate gene screening approach. We screened 34 affected individuals (two sets of siblings), five unaffected family members, and 80 healthy controls. Patient demographics are summarized in Appendix 1. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subject Research at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and at the Albert Einstein Medical Center. The study also conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects whose blood and DNA samples were used in the analysis. Peripheral blood samples (10\u201320\u00a0ml) were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted using the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Conformation-sensitive-gel-electrophoresis (CSGE) was used for initial SOX2 and CHX10 gene screenings. Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on genomic DNA of affected patients, unaffected relatives, and healthy controls to amplify SOX2 and CHX10 exonic sequences (primer sets are available upon request). An additional 120 base pairs of intronic sequences at both the 5\u2032-end and 3\u2032-end were also included. PCR amplification was performed in a reaction volume of 25\u00a0\u03bcl containing 50 ng of genomic DNA, 200\u00a0\u03bcM dNTP, 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM of each primer pair, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 1X PCR buffer, 1X Q-solution, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A single annealing temperature of 55\u00a0\u00b0C was used for all primers. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel for detection of heteroduplexes and homoduplexes. Patient samples containing heteroduplexes were selected for sequence analysis. Base pair changes in SOX2 and CHX10 were confirmed by sequencing bidirectionally in patient samples. Of the 34 patients (32 independent probands) analyzed, three (two siblings) showed novel mutations in coding sequence and three had two sequence variants in the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of SOX2 (Figure 1 and Table 1). Mutation, c.310 G>T (p. Glu104X), found in one patient, was in the region encoding the HMG DNA-binding domain and resulted in a change from glutamic acid to a stop codon. The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p. Pro184ArgfsX19) in the region encoding the activation domain, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the coding sequence. In addition, a novel nucleotide substitution, c.*557G>A, was identified in the 3\u2032-untranslated region in one patient, and a known single nucleotide polymorphism (c. *469 C>A, SNP rs11915160) was also detected in 2 out of 34 patients (Appendix 1). Patient 40A is an eight-year-old child with bilateral anophthalmia. Clinical features included dilated ventricles with ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement for hydrocephalus, microcephaly, atrophic optic nerves, chiasm, posterior corpus callosum and splenium, and abnormal electroencephalograms with no overt seizures. The patient has short stature and delayed motor and mental development. He has an unusual ataxic gait but is independently mobile with a walker. He has begun to speak in three to four word sentences. The amplified genomic fragments from the patient (40A) showed faster and slower migrating products comparing to that of the wild type observed in samples from the parents (40B and 40C) and normal controls (C1 and C2) with CSGE (Figure 2A). The heteroduplexes suggest a mutation in the fragment. The genomic DNA from this patient was sequenced bidirectionally. Two alleles were identified (Figure 2B), one with a wild type allele and one with a nucleotide substitution at c.310 G>T of the coding sequence, resulting in a nonsense amino acid change (p. Glu104X). The predicted shorter peptide is truncated at the end of the HMG domain, which results in the deletion of the entire COOH-terminal activation domain (Figure 2C). The mutation, located in the HMG domain, is not directly involved in DNA binding based on NMR-spectroscopy structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Both parents were homozygous for the wild type allele. Patient 54A is a nine-year-old child with right anophthalmia and left microphthalmia. Her clinical features included a right middle fossa arachnoid cyst and partial absence of the posterior aspect of the corpus callosum including the splenium. She had mild hydrocephalus and partial complex seizures. Other abnormalities were growth and thyroid hormone deficiency, developmental delays, and a wide-based ataxic gait. She also presented with facial asymmetry with a beaked nose, small widely-spaced teeth, and diastasis recti. The parents were unaffected. CSGE analysis showed three slower migrating product bands in addition to the wild type, indicative of heterozygosity (Figure 3A). The affected sibling of the proband (54H), who was diagnosed with bilateral anophthalmia by ultrasound in utero, had two slower migrating bands and the wild type product. An amniocentesis was performed, and a chromosome study was that of a normal female with a 46XX karyotype. Her birthweight of 8 lbs 15 ounces and length of 52 cm are appropriate for a term infant. Her newborn hearing screening test was normal. An orbital ultrasound shortly after birth revealed the absence of globe structures bilaterally. A head MRI at age of four months showed partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and hypoplasia of the orbits. Minimal ocular tissue was noted in the orbit with visualization of the extraocular muscles and lacrimal glands. The optic nerves were not visualized. The maxillae were hypoplastic. At approximately nine months, she began treatment with thyroid supplementation for hypothyroidism. She is of a low growth percentile with normal growth hormone levels. She had urticaria pigmentosa at 14 months of age. At the age of 16 months, she sat without support, rolled, and babbled with consonants and vowels. She finger feeds and has no feeding difficulties. Her development is delayed but is more advanced than that of her sister, the proband, at the equivalent age. The mother has normal vision and an unremarkable ophthalmologic examination. She has normal motor abilities and intellect. A head MRI scan of the mother was unremarkable. Sequence analysis detected two alleles in the proband, the affected sibling, and the clinically normal mother (54B). One allele was the wild type sequence and the other was a c.549delC (p.Pro184ArgfsX19) in the coding sequence (Figure 3B). The deletion changes the reading frame and results in a premature stop codon 19 amino acids downstream of the deletion site. The mutation is predicted to delete part of the COOH-terminal activation domain and to produce a truncated peptide (Figure 3C). The father (54C) of the proband was homozygous for the wild type allele. Patient 49A is a 17-year-old female with bilateral anophthalmia. Her clinical features include a ventricular-septal defect, which resolved without surgical intervention, and fusion of two primary teeth of the left lower jaw. She is developmentally normal and is currently applying to four-year colleges. The parents were unaffected. A heterozygous sequence variant was identified in this individual in the 3\u2032-UTR by CSGE (Figure 4A). Sequence analysis detected two alleles, one with a wild type sequence and one with a nucleotide substitution, c.*557G>A (Figure 4B). The sequence alteration does not predictably change the SOX2 protein and is not a previously described SNP (dbSNP Build 128). A review of transcription factor databases did not uncover known regulatory elements associated with the nucleotide substitution. DNA was unavailable from additional unaffected family members of the proband. To determine that the above sequence alterations detected in anophthalmia and microphthalmia patients were not single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 80 healthy control individuals were examined by direct sequencing analysis. None of the above sequence alterations were found in the normal control subjects. During this screening, we also detected SNP c.*469 C>A in 2 out of 34 patients. The SNP is a known variant and located at 3\u2032 UTR\u00a0(SNP rs11915160). To evaluate sequence variations in CHX10, the same cohort of patients were screened by CSGE and direct sequencing. The majority of sequence variations were detected in exon 3 (Table 2), and the mutations were all synonymous, c.471 C>T (p.Ser157Ser, rs35435463) and c.579 G>A (p. Gln193Gln, novel SNP). Another sequence variation was found in exon 5, c.871 G>A (p. Asp291Asn, novel SNP), in one affected individual resulting in a non-synonymous polymorphism. Using healthy controls, the same sequence variant was found, suggesting non-causality. The present study identified two novel mutations and two sequence variants (one novel, one known SNP) in SOX2 in 6 (two siblings) out of 34 anophthalmia/microphthalmia/ coloboma patients. The frequency of mutations in SOX2 in anophthalmia and microphthalmia patients is estimated at 10% for this study, which is consistent with previous reports. A mutational analysis of CHX10 of the same cohort of anophthalmia/microphthalmia patients identified two synonymous sequence variants in exon 3 and one non-synonymous sequence variant in exon 5. The non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in normal controls, suggesting it is not causative. Further sequence analysis of other genes associated with anophthalmia and microphthalmia such as PAX6, BCOR, OTX2, SIX6, and CHD7 is ongoing in this study cohort to determine mutation associations. Two mutations, a nonsense mutation and a frameshift mutation, were located in the coding region of SOX2, and both resulted in truncation of the SOX2 protein. The shortened protein product may result in loss of function. In animal studies, homozygous mice for SOX2 null allele are embryonic lethal and heterozygous mice with one null allele are normal compared to that of the wild type. Further reduction of the level of SOX2 expression by deleting a neural cell-specific enhancer on a heterozygous background resulted in reduced viability and neurodegeneration. These observations suggest that the abnormal phenotype may become apparent when SOX2 expression falls below a certain threshold, or loss of function in one allele reduces SOX2 expression below that level. One of the mutations detected in this study was at the 3\u2032 UTR. Although the relationship between the mutation at the 3\u2032-UTR and anophthalmia/ microphthalmia is indeterminate, one possibility is that the nucleotide substitution at c.*557G>A affects SOX2 expression. This is supported by the observation that the 3\u2032UTR of SOX2 contains regulatory elements that enhance its transcriptional activity in embryonic stem cells. Of interest is the transmission of a SOX2 mutation from an unaffected mother to her two daughters in the example of sibling patients 54A and 54H. Gonosomal mosaicism, evidenced by the presence of a mutation in buccal cells but not in white cell-derived DNA, has been reported for SOX2 in an unaffected parent. We were able to identify this mutation in genomic DNA derived from white blood cells in the unaffected mother. This suggests that this mother may not be mosaic in this circumstance. We propose that the anophthalmia phenotype appears to be non-penetrant. Non-penetrant mutations have been reported previously in sonic hedgehog (SHH) and in fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR). This example underscores the importance of testing seemingly unaffected parents once a mutation is discovered in their offspring regardless of their phenotype and points out that some individuals with a SOX2 mutation may be non-penetrant. Our patients with coding region mutations had SOX2 phenotypes consistent with previous studies. All patients with mutations had bilateral anophthalmia and unilateral severe microphthalmia (40A, 49A, 54H) with the exception of patient 54A who had unilateral anophthalmia instead of bilateral anophthalmia. This suggests that SOX2 mutations cause a more severe disruption of normal eye development and that microphthalmia/anophthalmia are of a spectrum of the same disease. The patients with coding sequence mutations (40A, 54A, and 54H) had significant brain abnormalities. Patient 40A showed dilated ventricles and microcephaly. Patient 54A was diagnosed with a right middle fossa arachnoid cyst and partial absence of posterior aspect of corpus callosum including the splenium. Patient 54H, the sibling of patient 54A, had partial agenesis of the corpus callosum. Brain structure changes are also consistent with other studies and are supported by murine models of SOX2 deficiency with neurodegeneration and impaired brain neurogenesis. Hormonal deficiencies and growth retardation are also important phenotypic associations with SOX2 coding sequence changes (patients 40A, 54A, and 54H). Ragge et al. have reported a case of anophthalmia/microphthalmia caused by a frameshift mutation in SOX2 (case 9, c.628delA, p.Met210fs211X). The genetic location of that mutation is similar to the proband 54A and her sibling 54H (c.549delC, p.Pro184ArgfsX19) in this study. The neurological phenotypes in this study, including brain malformations and seizure activity, were also present in their case. Patient 49A with a 3\u2032-UTR mutation had a cardiac ventricular-septal defect with dental anomalies. Different forms of craniofacial and dental defects were also noted in some patients with coding region mutations of SOX2 gene. Patient 54A (Appendix 1) had facial asymmetry and small, widely spaced teeth. One of the patients (case #1) reported by Ragge et al. also showed craniofacial dysmorphisms and widely spaced teeth. The SOX2 UTR mutations appear to be associated with severe eye development but are perhaps less likely to manifest with neurological manifestations. In conclusion, this study confirms that heterozygous loss of function mutations in SOX2 cause anophthalmia and microphthalmia and represent approximately 10% of patients ascertained for anophthalmia and microphthalmia but may also be non-penetrant. Mutations in CHX10 are less frequently found. Genetic screening of other candidate genes and the identification of genetic factors influencing SOX2 expression may help to determine the susceptibility of various disease alleles in the occurrence of this severe form of eye malformation and also help to identify factors that may influence SOX2 expression. Further characterization of genetic interactions among causative genes may also help to further our understanding of the formation of the eye."}, "18310445": {"pmid": "18310445", "pmcid": "PMC2262182", "title": "Bone morphogenetic protein-4 interacts with activin and GnRH to modulate gonadotrophin secretion in L\u03b2T2 gonadotrophs", "abstract": "\nWe have shown previously that, in sheep primary pituitary cells, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP)-4 inhibits FSH\u03b2 mRNA expression and FSH release. In contrast, in mouse L\u03b2T2 gonadotrophs, others have shown a stimulatory effect of BMPs on basal or activin-stimulated FSH\u03b2 promoter-driven transcription. As a species comparison with our previous results, we used L\u03b2T2 cells to investigate the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotrophin mRNA and secretion modulated by activin and GnRH. BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSH production, but enhanced the activin+GnRH-induced stimulation of FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH secretion, without any effect on follistatin mRNA. BMP-4 reduced LH\u03b2 mRNA up-regulation in response to GnRH (\u00b1activin) and decreased GnRH receptor expression, which would favour FSH, rather than LH, synthesis and secretion. In contrast to sheep pituitary gonadotrophs, which express only BMP receptor types IA (BMPRIA) and II (BMPRII), L\u03b2T2 cells also express BMPRIB. Smad1/5 phosphorylation induced by BMP-4, indicating activation of BMP signalling, was the same whether BMP-4 was used alone or combined with activin\u00b1GnRH. We hypothesized that activin and/or GnRH pathways may be modulated by BMP-4, but neither the activin-stimulated phosphorylation of Smad2/3 nor the GnRH-induced ERK1/2 or cAMP response element-binding phosphorylation were modified. However, the GnRH-induced activation of p38 MAPK was decreased by BMP-4. This was associated with increased FSH\u03b2 mRNA levels and FSH secretion, but decreased LH\u03b2 mRNA levels. These results confirm 1. BMPs as important modulators of activin and/or GnRH-stimulated gonadotrophin synthesis and release and 2. important species differences in these effects, which could relate to differences in BMP receptor expression in gonadotrophs.\n", "fulltext": "The gonadotrophins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), are produced by the gonadotroph cells of the anterior pituitary and play important roles in reproductive function. Tight control over the production of these hormones is crucial, particularly in females, to coordinate follicle selection and terminal follicular growth as well as the timing and number of ovulations. Synthesis and release of LH and FSH are regulated by hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and gonadal steroids. Despite these common regulators, divergences in the circulating patterns of LH and FSH are often encountered, suggesting that these regulators act differentially on the production of LH and FSH and/or that other factors are specifically involved in the control of FSH synthesis. While the pulsatile pattern of GnRH release is essential for the activation and secretion of both gonadotrophins, changes in pulse frequency observed during the oestrous cycle differentially affect the LH and FSH production. High frequencies of GnRH pulses are associated with greater LH secretion whereas lower frequencies favour FSH secretion. In addition, the FSH secretion is controlled, independently of LH, by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) superfamily members such as activins and inhibins. Activin, a dimer of two highly related \u03b2-subunits (\u03b2A and/or \u03b2B), stimulates FSH\u03b2 gene expression and FSH release, whereas inhibin, a heterodimer composed of one \u03b1-subunit and one \u03b2-subunit (\u03b2A or \u03b2B), decreases FSH synthesis and release. Activin is secreted by the gonads and within the pituitary, where it acts as an autocrine and/or paracrine regulator of FSH synthesis. Recently, other members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), were shown to modulate preferentially FSH secretion. In ovine pituitary cells, BMP-4 (50\u200ang/ml) and BMP-6 (100\u200ang/ml) inhibited FSH\u03b2 mRNA expression and FSH release. By contrast, in the murine L\u03b2T2 gonadotroph cell line and rat pituitary cells, BMP-6 and BMP-7, at higher concentrations (1\u200a\u03bcg/ml), BMP-2 and BMP-15 (100\u200ang/ml) were able to stimulate basal FSH secretion and FSH\u03b2 promoter activity. This difference of BMP effect between the mouse and the sheep could reflect a dissimilar pattern of BMP receptors on gonadotroph cells driving different signalling pathways. Alternatively, different BMPs could differentially affect FSH synthesis. The TGF\u03b2 superfamily members act through two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II. Activin signals through activin receptor types IIA (ActRIIA) or IIB (ActRIIB) and activin receptor type IB (ActRIB, also known as activin receptor-like kinase 4 or ALK-4). Specific BMP signalling requires BMP receptor type II (BMPRII) and BMP receptor types IA (BMPRIA or ALK-3) or IB (BMPRIB or ALK-6). The ligand-type II receptor complex induces phosphorylation and activation of type I receptors that in turn trans-phosphorylate receptor-activated Smad proteins within the cytoplasm. These then interact with common Smad4, and the resulting complex translocates to the nucleus to affect gene transcription. Activin leads to the specific activation of Smads 2 and 3, whereas BMPs activate Smads 1, 5 and 8. The combinations of activin and BMP ligands and receptors are not unique. For example, ActRIIA and ActRIIB can bind to BMP-6, whereas BMPRII binds specifically to BMP ligands. Regarding type I receptors, ActRIA (also known as ALK-2) has been identified as a type-I receptor for BMPs. To further explore BMP action at the gonadotroph cell level, we have examined the effects of BMP-4 on mouse L\u03b2T2 cell LH and FSH \u03b2-subunit mRNA levels and gonadotrophin release. Considering that activin and GnRH are important modulators of FSH synthesis, it is of interest to determine if BMP-4 interacts with these two factors and to explore the signalling pathways through which BMP-4 exerts its effect. Mouse L\u03b2T2 cells (provided by Dr P Mellon, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA) were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% foetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) on flasks coated with Matrigel (1:29; BD Biosciences Clontech, Cowley, Oxford, UK). For experimental purposes L\u03b2T2 cells were set up as described previously at a density of 2\u00b775\u00d7106/well. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with 0 or 50\u200ang/ml recombinant human activin A (R&D Systems, Abingdon, Oxon, UK) \u00b1a daily 1-h pulse of 10\u200anM GnRH (Bachem, St Helens, Merseyside, UK), in the presence or absence of 50\u200ang/ml recombinant human BMP-4 (R&D Systems) for 3 days. Media were collected daily for measurement of secreted FSH and LH by RIA. On day 4, total RNA was extracted from cells for the measurement of FSH\u03b2, LH\u03b2, GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) and follistatin mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, on day 4, after a final pulse of GnRH, protein extracts were prepared for western blot analysis. RIAs for mouse FSH and LH were performed as previously described, using reagents supplied by Dr A Parlow (NHPP, Harbor-UCLA, Torrance, CA, USA). The minimum detectable concentrations were 1\u200ang/ml and 200\u200apg/ml for FSH and LH respectively. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <10% for both assays. The expression of BMP receptor mRNA in L\u03b2T2 cells was assessed by RT-PCR, using adult mouse pituitary as a positive control. Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent (Sigma\u2013Aldrich Ltd). Aliquots were treated with DNase I using DNA-free (Ambion (Europe) Ltd, Huntingdon, Cambs, UK) and reverse transcribed, using random hexamers, with Taqman Reverse Transcription reagents (PE Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) according to manufacturers protocol. PCR was performed for 35 cycles using ThermoStart Taq DNA polymerase (Abgene, Epsom, Surrey, UK). Primer sequences were as follows: BMPRIA: fwd: CCTGTTGTTATAGGTCCGTT; rev: TCTCCTACTGGAATAAATGC; BMPRIB: fwd: AGATTGGAAAAGGCCGCTATG; rev: GATGTCAACCTCATTTGTGTC; BMPRII: fwd: GAGGACTGGCTTATCTTCAC; rev: AGCTCCTTCTAGCACTTCTG. Predicted product sizes were 194, 473 and 245\u200abp respectively. L\u03b2T2 cells, cultured on Labtek II chamber slides (Fisher Scientific UK, Manchester, UK) were washed with PBS, fixed in Bouin's solution for 5\u200amin, washed and then permeabilized using 10% normal goat serum, 1% BSA in PBS (blocking solution) containing 0\u00b72% Igepal CA-630 for 20\u200amin at room temperature. After washing, cells were blocked for 1\u200ah, then incubated at 4\u200a\u00b0C overnight with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against BMPRIA, BMPRIB or BMPRII, diluted at 1:50. Antibodies were kindly donated by Dr C-H Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). Negative controls were performed with 1:100 goat serum in place of the primary antibody. Slides were washed and then incubated at room temperature for 1\u200ah with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) diluted 1:200. After washing, the slides were mounted using Permafluor fluorescent mounting medium (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and examined using a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Herts, UK). Levels of mRNA for FSH\u03b2, LH\u03b2, GnRH-R and follistatin were measured using Taqman RT-PCR. Primer and probe sequences were designed using Primer Express software and synthesized by PE Biosystems or by Biosource Europe SA (Nivelles, Belgium). FSH\u03b2, LH\u03b2 and GnRH-R primer/probe sequences have been previously reported. The sequences for follistatin were as follows: fwd: GGGCTGGATGGGAAAACCTA; rev: CGGCTGCTCTTTGCATCTG; probe (FAM labelled): CGCAACGAATGTGCACTCCTCAAGG. Ribosomal 18S primers and probe were from a Taqman Ribosomal RNA Control Reagents kit (VIC labelled probe). RNA was prepared, DNase I-treated and reverse transcribed as described above. RNA was added to RT reactions at 10\u200ang/\u03bcl. A PCR mix was prepared, consisting of Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (1\u00d7), gene specific forward and reverse primers (300\u200anM each) and probe (200\u200anM), and ribosomal 18S forward and reverse primers (50\u200anM each) and probe (200\u200anM). This was aliquoted into tubes, then cDNA was added at 1\u200a\u03bcl/25\u200a\u03bcl reaction mix. Aliquots (25\u200a\u03bcl) were transferred to wells in a 96-well PCR plate, with each sample run in duplicate. Plates were sealed with optical adhesive covers and the PCRs run on ABI Prism 7900HT PCR machine using standard conditions. Controls included cDNA prepared with omission of reverse transcriptase. Prior to analysis, a validation assay was performed to demonstrate that amplification of target genes and the reference (18S) were approximately equal. Quantification of specific mRNA levels was performed by the \u0394\u0394Ct method (Bulletin no.2; PE Biosystems). Standard PCRs using each set of primers were run on an agarose gel to confirm amplification of a single product of the correct size. Unless otherwise stated all reagents, equipment and software were from PE Biosystems. To investigate activation of Smads, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), L\u03b2T2 cells were treated as described above except that on day 4, a final pulse of GnRH was given (duration of 1\u200ah for Smad study and 10 or 20\u200amin for ERK1/2, p38 and CREB studies). The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 10\u200amM Tris (pH 7\u00b74), 150\u200amM NaCl, 1\u200amM EDTA, 1\u200amM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0\u00b75% Igepal CA-630, 100\u200amM sodium fluoride, 10\u200amM sodium pyrophosphate, 10\u200amM sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor cocktail. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd). After 5\u200amin at 95\u200a\u00b0C in reducing buffer, proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). For Smad and ERK analysis, membranes were blocked for 1\u200ah at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline, 0\u00b71% Tween (TBST) containing 5% fat-free dry milk and then incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4\u200a\u00b0C. The P-Smad1/5 rabbit monoclonal, P-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) and were all used at 1:1000 dilution. The Smad1/5 and Smad2/3 polyclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY, USA) and were used at 1:500 and 1:1000 dilutions respectively. The P-Smad2/3 antibody was provided by Dr C-H Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) and used at 1:2000 dilutions. After washing in TBST, the membranes were incubated with Amersham ECL peroxidase-labelled anti-rabbit antibody (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK) for 1\u200ah at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using Amersham ECL Plus western blotting detection reagents and exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (both from GE Healthcare UK Ltd). For quantification, the membranes were scanned on a Typhoon 9400 variable-mode imager (GE Healthcare UK Ltd). In each case, the membrane was probed first with the antibody against the phosphorylated protein, then stripped using buffer containing 2% SDS, 62\u00b75\u200amM Tris (pH 6\u00b78), 0\u00b71\u200aM 2-mercaptoethanol for 30\u200amin at 75\u200a\u00b0C. After washing, immunodetection was repeated using antibody against the total protein. For P-p38 and P-CREB analysis, membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (Licor Biosciences UK Ltd, Cambridge, UK) and primary antibodies were diluted in Odyssey buffer diluted 1:1 with PBS, 0\u00b71% Tween 20 (PBST). The primary antibody against the phosphorylated protein was combined with a monoclonal anti-\u03b1-tubulin to act as loading control for quantitation. The P-p38 and P-CREB antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:1000 dilutions and \u03b1-tubulin monoclonal (Sigma) was used at 1:3000 dilutions. After washing in PBST the membranes were incubated with a mixture of goat anti-rabbit IR Dye 680 and goat anti-mouse IR Dye 800CW for 1\u200ah at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected and quantified using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor Biosciences UK Ltd). Results are reported as mean\u00b1s.e.m. from one representative experiment. Experiments were carried out at least three times. Analyses of interactions between BMP-4 and other treatment groups were carried out using two-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni method. Comparisons between treatments on FSH, LH concentrations, FSH\u03b2 and LH\u03b2 mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein intensities were analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. The value of P<0\u00b705 was considered significant. The statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Qualitative RT-PCR analysis of total RNA prepared from mouse L\u03b2T2 gonadotroph cells and adult mouse pituitary was carried out using primers specific for BMPRIA (ALK-3), BMPRIB (ALK-6) and BMPRII. As shown in Fig. 1A, products of the expected size were observed for all three receptor types in both L\u03b2T2 cells and adult mouse pituitary. In negative controls, performed by omitting reverse transcriptase enzyme in RT reactions, no PCR products were detected (not shown). Particularly in L\u03b2T2 cells, the levels of BMPRIB mRNA appeared to be lower than the other two receptor types. Immunostaining using specific antibodies confirmed the presence of expressed protein for all three BMP receptor types in L\u03b2T2 cells when compared with a negative control (Fig. 1B). To determine whether BMP-4 was capable of modifying gonadotrophin production and secretion in L\u03b2T2 gonadotrophs, cells given activin \u00b1a daily 1\u200ah pulse of GnRH for three days were also treated with BMP-4. Secretion profiles for FSH and LH, representing the total protein secreted during day 3 GnRH treatment and the subsequent overnight incubation, and the corresponding day 4 \u03b2-subunit mRNA levels are shown in Fig. 2. As expected, FSH secretion increased (P<0\u00b7001) in response to activin and this effect was increased synergistically (P<0\u00b7001) in the presence of GnRH, although GnRH alone had no effect (Fig. 2A). While BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSH secretion, it increased the release of FSH in response to activin and activin+GnRH (P<0\u00b701 and P<0\u00b7001 respectively). Similarly, the FSH\u03b2 mRNA expression was up-regulated by activin (P<0\u00b705) and this effect was also increased synergistically by GnRH (P<0\u00b7001; Fig. 2B). BMP-4 alone, or in combination with activin or GnRH, had no effect on FSH\u03b2 mRNA, but it further increased activin+GnRH-stimulated mRNA levels (P<0\u00b701). LH release from L\u03b2T2 cells was stimulated by GnRH (P<0. 001) and these levels almost doubled when GnRH was combined with activin (P<0\u00b7001, Fig. 2C). BMP-4 alone or in combination with activin and/or GnRH did not affect LH release. By contrast, while LH\u03b2 mRNA expression also increased in response to GnRH and activin+GnRH (P<0\u00b7001), these levels were reduced (P<0\u00b705) by BMP-4 (Fig. 2D). To investigate the possible underlying mechanisms for the effects of BMP-4 on gonadotrophin production and release in L\u03b2T2 gonadotrophs, GnRH-R and follistatin mRNA levels on day 4 from cells treated as described were measured. As shown in Fig. 3A, activin and GnRH alone produced small increases in GnRH-R mRNA levels, but combined activin+GnRH was required to achieve a significant (P<0\u00b7001) effect. BMP-4 reduced GnRH-R mRNA expression in both the GnRH- and activin+GnRH-treated cells (P<0\u00b701 and P<0\u00b7001 respectively). Follistatin mRNA levels, on the other hand, increased in response to activin and activin+GnRH (P<0\u00b701 and P<0\u00b7001 respectively, Fig. 3B). BMP-4 treatment significantly reduced the activin-stimulated increase in follistatin mRNA (P<0\u00b705), but had no effect on the increase observed in response to activin+GnRH. To determine whether or not the BMP and activin signalling pathways could interact at the Smad activation level, L\u03b2T2 cells cultured in the presence or absence of activin \u00b1a daily 1\u200ah pulse of GnRH for 3 days were also exposed to BMP-4. On day 4, a final 1-h pulse of GnRH was given and proteins extracted for western blot analysis, using antibodies specific for P-Smad1/5 and P-Smad2/3, to look at the BMP and activin signalling pathways respectively. As shown in Fig. 4A, BMP-4, but not activin, induced the appearance of a band at \u223c60\u200akDa, corresponding to the phosphorylated form of Smad1/5. The presence of activin and/or GnRH with BMP-4 did not affect the intensity of this band when compared with BMP-4 treatment alone. By contrast, activin (\u00b1 GnRH) induced activation of Smad2/3 as indicated by increased intensity of band(s) at \u223c55\u201358\u200akDa corresponding to phosphorylated Smad2/3 (Fig. 4B). When cells were treated with both BMP-4 and activin\u00b1GnRH, band intensity did not change compared with activin\u00b1GnRH alone. It should be noted that the results shown here were obtained using an antibody against P-Smad2/3 and that two bands were observed. However, it appeared that the upper band (P-Smad2) was mainly responsible for the increased signal in response to activin\u00b1GnRH and indeed, identical results were obtained using an antibody specific for P-Smad2 (data not shown). As there is evidence that, as well as signalling through the Smad pathways, TGF\u03b2 family members may also utilize other downstream signalling pathways, we examined whether or not BMP-4 activated or influenced the activation of other pathways known to be active in gonadotrophs. The L\u03b2T2 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of activin \u00b1 a daily 1-h pulse of GnRH \u00b1 BMP-4 for 3 days. On day\u20094, a 10- or 20-min pulse of GnRH was given to cells previously exposed to GnRH and proteins extracted for western blot analysis, using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and CREB. As expected, GnRH induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, with the same effect observed in the presence and absence of activin (P<0\u00b7001; Fig. 5A). BMP-4 had no effect on ERK activation. The results shown here were from cells that are given GnRH for 20\u200amin on day 4. After 10-min GnRH supply the same trend was observed, but the result did not reach significance (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5B, p38 MAPK was also activated by GnRH (P<0\u00b701), but in this case activin increased the response observed with GnRH alone (P<0\u00b705). BMP-4 treatment, in the presence of activin+GnRH, reduced phosphorylated p38 levels (P<0\u00b701). In this case, the treatment 10-min GnRH supply gave the optimum result, as after 20\u200amin GnRH levels of phosphorylated p38 were unmeasurable in our detection system. CREB was activated by GnRH alone (P<0\u00b7001; Fig. 5C) and neither activin nor BMP-4 had a significant effect. Again, 20-min GnRH produced the optimum result, although after 10\u200amin a statistically similar effect was observed (data not shown). Earlier studies have identified BMPs as modulators in the regulation of FSH synthesis and release. In rodent primary pituitary cells and the mouse L\u03b2T2 gonadotroph cell line, different BMPs (BMP-15, as well as BMP-6 and -7 at high doses) exert a stimulatory effect on FSH\u03b2 transcription, whereas in ovine primary pituitary cells, BMP-4 and BMP-6 have inhibitory effects on FSH\u03b2 mRNA expression and FSH release. In the present study we report that, in L\u03b2T2 mouse gonadotroph cells, BMP-4 alone had no effect on FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH release, as reported previously for BMP-2, -6 and -7 used at comparable doses. Remarkably, BMP-4 increased both FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH secretion when combined with activin A and GnRH. Recent studies observed synergistic effects on FSH\u03b2 transcription between BMP-2 and activin A in L\u03b2T2 cells. Moreover, our data show for the first time that LH\u03b2 mRNA and LH secretion remained unaffected by BMP-4 treatment but that, interestingly, the up-regulation of LH\u03b2 mRNA in response to GnRH was reduced. Our results underline the opposite actions of BMP-4 on FSH expression in ewe primary pituitary cells and murine homogeneous gonadotroph cells. In ewe pituitary cells BMP-4 and BMP-6 decreased both basal and activin-stimulated FSH\u03b2 mRNA levels and FSH release. The reasons for this differential effect are not clear. They may reflect different specific patterns of BMP receptors between ewe gonadotroph cells and L\u03b2T2 cells leading to activation of different signalling pathways and/or different intra-cellular components. The present results demonstrate that L\u03b2T2 cells express mRNAs encoding the BMP receptors BMPRIA, BMPRIB and BMPRII, confirming data from Lee et al. (2007), in contrast to another study in which only BMPRIA and BMPRII were found (Otsuka & Shimasaki 2002). However, in our study, BMPRIB mRNA does appear to be expressed at lower levels than BMPRIA and BMPRII. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of proteins corresponding to the three types of receptors. In contrast to L\u03b2T2 cells, BMPRIB was not detected in ewe gonadotroph cells. The bioavailability of different receptors could dictate the FSH response to BMPs. Even if BMP-4 is able to bind complexes of BMPRII and BMPRIA or BMPRIB, the two receptors may not be equivalent in activating signalling. Alternatively, receptors other than BMPRIA or IB could be involved. A previous report has shown that BMP-2 acts through BMPRII and ALK-2 in L\u03b2T2 cells. Moreover, ewe primary pituitary cells are composed of different cell types and the target cell type(s) for BMP-4 are not known. Whether BMP-4 acts directly on gonadotroph cells in sheep primary pituitary cells has yet to be determined. The nature of the mechanisms by which BMP-4 interacts with activin and GnRH is still unclear. The classical signalling pathway used by BMPs involves Smads 1, 5 and 8 activated by BMP receptors type II and type I. As demonstrated by the phosphorylation of Smad1/5, BMP-4 activated the BMP pathway in L\u03b2T2 cells. However, BMP-4 alone failed to modify the level of FSH\u03b2 or LH\u03b2 mRNA and gonadotrophin release. It is possible that Smads 1/5 mediate other responses to BMP in L\u03b2T2 cells such as cell proliferation. BMP-4 action required the presence of activin and was amplified when GnRH was added in combination with activin. This action was not accompanied by changes in the level of P-Smad1/5, suggesting that other signalling proteins and/or pathways are involved. A recent study suggested that Smad8 might be the preferred signalling protein in the BMP pathway since overexpression of Smad8, but not Smad1 or 5, enhanced the FSH\u03b2 promoter activity in response to BMP-2. It is possible that BMP-4 may be acting through the modulation of activin and/or GnRH pathway. Previous data have shown that activin transmits its signal through Smad2 and/or Smad3 phosphorylation. While we detected an increase in the phosphorylated forms of Smad2/3 in the presence of activin, the addition of BMP-4\u00b1 GnRH in L\u03b2T2 cell medium did not change the level of P-Smad2/3. Thus, the interaction between BMP-4, activin and GnRH does not modify Smad1/5 or Smad2/3 phosphorylation. It is unclear whether follistatin plays a role in this system, as the effects of BMP-4 on expression of follistatin mRNA were inconsistent. Activin-stimulated mRNA was reduced by BMP-4 treatment, in contrast to activin+GnRH-stimulated mRNA which remained unaffected. In addition, increased follistatin synthesis did not have any effect on Smad2/3 phosphorylation. However, it should be emphasized that the activin and BMP-4 levels used in this study would most likely be sufficient to completely override any possible effects of endogenous follistatin, which may be more relevant in vivo, where levels of endogenous activin and BMPs would be lower. The ability of follistatin to bind BMPs, albeit with a lower affinity than activin (Balemans & Van Hul 2002), suggests it may well be involved in the BMP-mediated regulation of FSH production in vivo. Since there is evidence that BMPs can operate through Smad-independent pathways such as MAPK signalling molecules, changes in levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p38 were measured. As expected, GnRH activated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but this response was not modified by activin, corroborating previous data. The presence of BMP-4 did not affect GnRH-mediated activation of ERK1/2. Previous studies have shown that BMPs can induce the p38 MAPK-dependent pathway. In the current study we observed that the level of GnRH-enhanced p38 activation was increased by activin, confirming a previous report, and this correlated with increased FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH secretion. This p38 activation in response to GnRH+activin was reduced by BMP-4, contrary to the increase in FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH secretion. As GnRH alone induced the p38 activation, but had no effect on FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH secretion, which remained equivalent to those in untreated cells, the exact role of p38 in regulating FSH production is unclear. The BMP-induced reduction in p38 MAPK does, however, correlate with a decrease in LH\u03b2 mRNA expression. GnRH is also known to activate CREB protein in gonadotroph cell lines. Our results confirm that GnRH activates CREB, but CREB phosphorylation was not significantly affected by activin and/or BMP-4. Our current data, therefore, indicate that the classical upstream activin (Smad2/3) or GnRH (ERK, CREB) pathways are not modified in the presence of BMP-4. The p38 MAPK signalling appears to be modulated by BMP-4, but whether this has direct effects on FSH production/secretion remains to be determined. Considering the synergistic effects of BMP-2 and activin on FSH\u03b2 transcription in L\u03b2T2 cells, it has recently been suggested that each ligand employs different, non-overlapping mechanisms to generate their effects. A summation of the independent signalling pathways activated by BMP-4, activin and GnRH could mediate their combined response with an amplified action occurring specifically at the level of the FSH\u03b2 promoter. So far, it is not known if BMP-4 exerts its effect directly on the FSH\u03b2 promoter and detailed analyses will be necessary to localize the site of BMP action. In addition to its effect on FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH release, BMP-4 also regulated LH\u03b2 expression. In the present study, we obtained clear evidence that BMP-4 decreased levels of GnRH and activin-induced LH\u03b2 mRNA. This effect appeared to be mediated, at least partly, by the down-regulation of GnRH-R mRNA. The inhibitory effect of BMP-4 on LH\u03b2 and GnRH-R mRNA levels is contradictory to the stimulatory action of activin. Several studies indicate a correlation between GnRH-R density and a differential gonadotrophin response to GnRH. High levels of GnRH-R are associated with preferential LH\u03b2 gene expression whereas lower levels favour the stimulation of FSH\u03b2 gene expression, suggesting a role for GnRH-R levels in mediating these differential responses. Thus, we propose that BMP-4, partly by inhibiting GnRH-R expression, could induce an inhibition of the LH\u03b2 mRNA level, potentially through p38 MAPK activation, and promote an increase in the level of FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH release. The absence of any effect of BMP-4 on LH release compared with its effect on LH\u03b2 mRNA levels may simply reflect the release of stored LH via the regulated secretory pathway. In conclusion, our results show that BMP-4, activin and GnRH act in a synergistic manner to up-regulate FSH\u03b2 mRNA and FSH release. By contrast, BMP-4 reduces the GnRH and/or activin-induced up-regulation of LH\u03b2 and GnRH receptor mRNA. We demonstrated that the classical upstream BMP signalling molecule(s) are activated in the L\u03b2T2 cells by BMP-4, but other signalling molecules/pathways must be involved in order to obtain the effects on FSH production observed in response to the interaction of BMP-4 with activin/GnRH. Naturally, these results need to be checked in primary cell cultures to determine if the difference in the effects of BMP-4 in the present mouse L\u03b2T2 gonadotroph cell line and our previous studies in sheep primary cells is due to different paracrine or autocrine mechanisms involving an interaction with other pituitary cell types. In contrast to mouse pituitary, BMP-4 mRNA was not detected in L\u03b2T2 cells arguing for a paracrine role. Collectively, the present data reinforce the concept of a role for BMP-4 in the control of FSH and reveal a novel involvement in LH control."}, "18366737": {"pmid": "18366737", "pmcid": "PMC2322961", "title": "The FH mutation database: an online database of fumarate hydratase mutations involved in the MCUL (HLRCC) tumor syndrome and congenital fumarase deficiency", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nFumarate hydratase (HGNC approved gene symbol \u2013 FH), also known as fumarase, is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, involved in fundamental cellular energy production. First described by Zinn et al in 1986, deficiency of FH results in early onset, severe encephalopathy. In 2002, the Multiple Leiomyoma Consortium identified heterozygous germline mutations of FH in patients with multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas, (MCUL: OMIM 150800). In some families renal cell cancer also forms a component of the complex and as such has been described as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC: OMIM 605839). The identification of FH as a tumor suppressor was an unexpected finding and following the identification of subunits of succinate dehydrogenase in 2000 and 2001, was only the second description of the involvement of an enzyme of intermediary metabolism in tumorigenesis.\n\n\nDescription\nThe FH mutation database is a part of the TCA cycle gene mutation database (formerly the succinate dehydrogenase gene mutation database) and is based on the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) system. The variants included in the database were derived from the published literature and annotated to conform to current mutation nomenclature. The FH database applies HGVS nomenclature guidelines, and will assist researchers in applying these guidelines when directly submitting new sequence variants online. Since the first molecular characterization of an FH mutation by Bourgeron et al in 1994, a series of reports of both FH deficiency patients and patients with MCUL/HLRRC have described 107 variants, of which 93 are thought to be pathogenic. The most common type of mutation is missense (57%), followed by frameshifts & nonsense (27%), and diverse deletions, insertions and duplications. Here we introduce an online database detailing all reported FH sequence variants.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe FH mutation database strives to systematically unify all current genetic knowledge of FH variants. We believe that this knowledge will assist clinical geneticists and treating physicians when advising patients and their families, will provide a rapid and convenient resource for research scientists, and may eventually assist in gaining novel insights into FH and its related clinical syndromes.\n\n", "fulltext": "Recently two proteins involved in the tricarboxcylic acid (TCA) cycle have been shown to be tumor suppressors. Fumarate hydratase (FH) (also known as fumarase) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which also plays a role in oxidative phosphorylation, are enzymes involved in fundamental processes of energy production. Deficiencies of FH and SDH(A) generally result in early-onset, severe encephalopathy. The first description of fumarate hydratase deficiency was in 1986 by Zinn et al, followed in 1994 by the first molecular characterization of an FH mutation by Bourgeron et al. In 2002, the Multiple Leiomyoma Consortium identified FH as the tumor suppressor gene responsible for MCUL/HLRCC. The identification of these genes as tumor suppressors was an entirely unexpected finding and demonstrated for the first time the involvement of proteins of intermediary metabolism in tumorigenesis. Mutations have been identified in both the gene encoding fumarate hydratase and three of the four genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase, subunits B, C and D (SDHB, -C and -D), while no cancer-related mutations have yet been reported in SDHA. Germline mutations in FH predispose individuals to multiple cutaneous leiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas and in some families renal cell cancer (HLRCC), whereas mutations in SDH cause hereditary paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas (HPGL). Both of these cancer syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Despite the closely related function of FH and SDH proteins, the tumor spectra in HPGL and HLRCC show little overlap, indicating that although biochemically related, the mitogenic stimulus leading to tumor formation must be cell specific. The principal phenotype of the FH-associated tumor syndrome is skin leiomyoma. These are typically sensitive to cold or abrasion, appear to be more common in women than men, developing between the second and fourth decades as intradermal papules or nodules of up to 20 mm in diameter, with a disseminated or segmental distribution. Germline FH mutations have been identified in the vast majority of patients with multiple skin leiomyomas, and the relatives of probands have often been subsequently diagnosed with skin leiomyomas, suggesting that many more cases are currently going unrecognized. Female FH mutation carriers are also at high risk of early-onset uterine fibroids that frequently require hysterectomy. Certain FH mutations have also been associated with uterine fibroids without skin leiomyomas. Although uterine fibroids are the most common tumors in women during their reproductive years, FH mutations do not appear to play a major role in non-syndromic cases. Although not always present in the FH syndrome, aggressive renal cell carcinomas of two unusual types, type II papillary and collecting duct morphology, also occur in certain families. Both frequently present with metastatic disease before the age of fifty and are associated with high mortality. A single case has also been reported with both papillary and conventional clear cell renal carcinoma, both tumors displaying loss of the wild type FH allele and immunostaining. Recently Merino et al described a distinctive histological feature of these tumors, a characteristically large nucleus with a very prominent inclusion-like orangiophilic or eosinophilic nucleolus, surrounded by a clear halo. Leiomyosarcomas also occur in association with FH mutations but appear to be rare in FH mutation carriers although a few cases, predominantly of Finnish origin, have been described. Other reported pathology associated with FH mutations include cerebral cavernomas and Leydig cell tumors and ovarian mucinous cystadenoma. A number of biochemical studies have shown that FH-deficient cells and tumors accumulate both fumarate and succinate, while SDH-deficient tumors mainly accumulate succinate. Accumulation of these metabolic intermediates may affect other biochemical processes in the cell, and considerable evidence indicates that the inhibition of HIF prolyl hydroxylase leads to the over-expression of the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). HIF1\u03b1 targets, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin (EPO), and glucose transporter1 (GLUT1), show activation on accumulation of TCA metabolites, and contribute to an increase in microvessel density. This phenomenon has been described as \"pseudo-hypoxia\" and shows striking similarities with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. In normoxia, HIF1\u03b1 is hydroxylated at critical proline residues by a HIF prolyl hydroxylase, and targeted for degradation by an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex that includes the VHL protein. In VHL disease, mutations in VHL inhibit this process and lead to the stabilization of HIF1\u03b1. Phenotypically, both HPGL and VHL patients may develop pheochromocytomas, and the clear cell renal carcinomas that are a major feature of VHL disease have recently been reported in a HPGL family. The FH mutation database is based on the recently described Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) system which, under the auspices of the Human Genome Variation Society, is rapidly becoming the standard for gene-specific databases. The LOVD system was designed to be flexible so that it could be easily adapted to the needs of a wide range of locus specific databases. Additional flexibility comes from the platform-independent design and the use of PHP and MySQL open source software. The design is gene-centered and modular, and focuses on the collection and display of DNA sequence variations. The LOVD platform is also easily extendable to include summary clinical data. In addition, all database contents may be downloaded in flat text format and imported into a spreadsheet program for further analysis. The LOVD database software is now in a new version, LOVD2, which has many additional features. Researchers interested in contributing sequence variants to the database will be asked to register, (submitters can access and edit their personal data at any time), after which they can contribute the variant online. During submission researchers are asked to provide those data that are deemed absolutely essential for mutation databases by the Human Genome Organization Mutation Database Initiative. These include a patient ID, an exact molecular description of the variant (DNA-level), and details about the source of the material and detection method used. Newly submitted variants are given a unique identifier, as recommended by Claustres et al. After the curator's approval the new variant is added to the database and all connected web pages are updated instantly. Currently (Jan, 2008) all database content is derived from published, peer-reviewed literature. We anticipate that directly submitted content will become an increasing proportion in the future. As the submitted data are in the form of a submitter deduced mutation description, the curators can only check the feasibility and consistency of the description and not any original data. DNA variation in populations is generally benign and as such should be termed a 'variant' or 'SNP'. The term 'mutation' is reserved for cases were there is a reasonable suspicion that the variant is deleterious. DNA variants submitted to the FH database should be described in accordance with the recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS), update August 2004, and it is strongly recommended that authors consult the most up-to-date nomenclature guidelines, which can be found online at the HGVS website. Unfortunately the mutation nomenclature currently used in the field of FH research is rarely in agreement with HGVS guidelines. Reports contain a variety of annotations, and many are based on the annotation of the cytosolic protein, the function of which is currently poorly defined. One of the aims of the HGVS is to establish a consistent nomenclature across all human genes. The description of FH protein variants based on the cytosolic protein is often accompanied by the use of a truncated transcript to describe cDNA variants. Other authors use the cytosolic protein numbering system, while applying the full-length coding transcript to describe cDNA variants. This results in the loss of the simple approximation of 3 to 1 between the numbering. The HGVS-recommended cDNA numbering starts from the first ATG of the full coding sequence. Protein reference sequences should represent the primary translation product, not a processed mature protein, and thus include any signal peptide sequences Currently many variants are present in the literature under several titles, and the correct identification of intron variants is especially problematic. No reliable overview of known FH variation can be achieved without a consistent nomenclature, which includes the appropriate numbering systems at both the DNA and protein level. We now recommend that all authors implement the recommendations of the HGVS when describing future FH variants. The FH mutation database will accept all variants and if necessary assist in assigning the correct nomenclature. In light of the inconsistency of the recent FH mutation nomenclature, variants have been reassigned, where necessary, and an extra column has been generated clearly stating the originally reported description(s) of the mutation at the protein level, and where equivocal also at the cDNA level. Inclusion of sequence variants in the FH mutation database does not imply that there is convincing evidence for pathogenicity. Please refer to the disclaimer on the website. Within the FH database, all variants that disrupt the reading frame, affect highly conserved residues (conserved by sequence alignment in at least Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or disrupt the consensus donor or acceptor splice sites (GT-AG), and are not found in healthy controls, should be suspected as potentially pathogenic. Non-conserved missense variants and potential splice site mutations that do not disrupt the consensus splice sites, are considered to be SNPs or rare variants of uncertain significance. Ideally, several lines of evidence should support publications which present mutations as \"pathogenic\", including screening DNA from a panel of 50\u2013200 healthy individuals, describing the nature of the amino acid substitution (conservative/non-conservative) and the significance of the position in the protein (evolutionarily conservation or known functional domain). It is important to note whether the mutation has previously been reported, if it has been found in several families, and if it segregates with the disease within the family. Many FH variants have been analysed for effects on enzymatic function, and this data has, in many cases, allowed the classification of missense variants as pathogenic. In addition a SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) analysis of missense FH variants has been included. A high score (above 0.05) indicates that an amino acid is poorly conserved (alignment of 337 Uniprot proteins), indicating caution in assignment of function to the variant. However none of these factors can be seen as definitive and each variant must be considered on its merits. Unfortunately, most mutations are currently reported without this accompanying analysis, and many have been identified in a single case or family. Thus caution should be exercised when attempting to derive clinically relevant information from the database, and users must carefully weigh all the evidence in the database and any additional data. The FH gene is very highly conserved, showing 67% protein identity between humans and S. cerevisiae with the few coding SNPs described in dbSNP present in the HapMap population as very rare alleles (the minor allele being undetected). Thus, current knowledge suggests that most missense changes will be pathogenic. Polymorphisms, including intron variants, synonymous (silent) variants, nonsynonymous missense variants found in a healthy control panel and potential non-consensus splice site mutations but without evidence for transcript rearrangements are included in the database as such unless accompanied by clear evidence of pathogenic potential. An abbreviated description of the FH related syndrome is given under \"disease\". Refer to the database notes for an explanation of these abbreviations. Further information can be found under \"remarks\", including the country of origin of the patient or study, together with other details such as the number of healthy controls tested for the variant, and any other supporting evidence. The FH mutation database describes mutations exon by exon; giving a complete overview of all reported or directly submitted mutations in a single table. This overview permits the swift appraisal of the status of any new variant. The FH mutation database summary page lists general gene and database information and provides access to the tables containing the allelic variant information and several search options (Fig 1). In addition, the complete contents of the public database can be downloaded here and imported into a spreadsheet program for further analysis. The variant tables contain the sequence variants ordered by position, relative to the cDNA reference sequence (Fig 2). Tables describing both unique variants and all reported variants can be selected. Using the sort option in the column heading, variants can be re-ordered as required. An up-to-date and fully referenced overview of FH mutations will be especially useful to clinical geneticists, research scientists, and physicians involved in the care and treatment of patients with HLRCC or congenital fumarase deficiency. The FH database includes (as of Jan, 2008) 107 variants of which 93 are thought to be pathogenic and 14 may be non-functional intron variants. The most common types of mutations at the protein level are missense (57%), frameshifts and nonsense (27%), with the remainder composed of deletions, insertions and duplications (Fig 3). No mutation has yet been identified in exon 1 (often described as exon 0), and few large deletions have been reported but this probably reflects limited effort in this direction to date. The missense mutations are concentrated in several central exons of the gene, particularly 4, 5, 7 and 8. Unsurprisingly the most conserved exon is 7, followed by exon 4. It can also be noticed that the missense mutations of exon 5 cluster in the proximal and distal regions of the exon, which are both highly conserved (Fig 4). That conservation is not always a good predictor of function is seen with Lys467Arg (K424R) missense variant. This amino acid is relatively poorly conserved, present in E. coli, but variable in many other species. The SIFT score is 0.17, indicating that this is a tolerated variant, and should not affect protein function. Other species variants include Asn, Ala, Met, and Glu, all of which are also predicted by SIFT analysis to be tolerated changes. However, Ylisaukko-oja et al recently demonstrated that this variant has less than half the activity of the wt variant. Context may also be important for the function of a variant, a case in point being Glu362Gln (Glu319Gln), the very first FH mutation, described by Bourgeron in 1994. Two siblings with profound fumarase deficiency were found to be homozygous for this mutation, showing only residual fumarase activity of less than 0.5% of controls. The glutamine (Gln) variant residue is the only change predicted by SIFT analysis to be tolerated. It can be speculated that any other change in this highly conserved distal region of exon 7 would have resulted in such a complete loss of fumarase activity as to be incompatible with life. Renal cell cancer (RCC) associated mutations occur throughout the gene with the exception of exons 1 and 6, though there are perhaps fewer RCC-associated mutations in exon 7 than one might expect (Fig 4). The Arg233His (R190H) mutation is the most commonly described FH variant, so it is unsurprising this residue should be mutated in a few cases of RCC. However, arginine 233 is also independently affected, with less common variants (Arg233Cys, Arg233Leu) and all changes have been associated with RCC. This residue resides in the A-site which may be the main catalytically active site. Previously Alam et al speculated that truncating mutations may be over-represented in renal cancer families. Within the current database, truncating and missense mutations are equally represented (11 vs. 11) in renal cell cancer patients (Fig 4). This still represents relatively more truncating mutations associated with RCC than in the overall database, but the current trend seems to indicate that the initial imbalance was an artefact of the limited numbers of variants then known. Whether truncating mutations are more penetrant, leading to more cases of RCC than the missense variants, is currently unclear from the published clinical data. A number of FH missense mutations have been reported to reduce FH activity below that seen for truncating mutations, indicating a dominant negative action. A second study failed to confirm differential activities of truncating and missense mutations on FH enzyme activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines from HLRCC patients. However, Lorenzato et al recently formally demonstrated the dominant negative action of the Arg233His (R190H) mutation. For a more complete functional analysis of FH missense mutations see Alam et al. As described above, patients with mutations of FH display a range of pathologies, the most profound, FH deficiency, related to mutation of both FH alleles. We have previously noted the tendency of FH deficiency-associated mutations to occur later in the gene (Fig 4) and to be less likely to include mutations leading to complete loss of protein function. While several cases of FH deficiency have been reported together with truncating mutations, the other affected allele tended to carry a missense mutation. The only case carrying two profound mutations was reported by Coughlin et al. This patient (F1430) had only 2% residual FH enzyme activity, but did not show the most serious of the known clinical manifestations. Even the mutations in this patient may have been attenuated by the fact that while one allele was affected by a 74 bp deletion in exon 2, the other truncating mutation occurred very late in the protein at the end of exon 10, leading to the loss of the last 10 amino acid residues. These data suggest that some residual enzyme activity is required if an embryo is to develop to term. Here we present an online database of FH gene variants that provides the only complete and up-to-date overview of all reported disease-related mutations. Clearly, considering the geographical distribution of the studies to date, only a fraction of all FH mutations associated with MCUL/HLRCC have yet been identified. While no unequivocal genotype-phenotype correlations associated with certain types of mutations or location in the gene have emerged so far, increasing knowledge of FH mutations may yet provide insight into sub-phenotypes or FH protein function. Importantly, every FH mutation found in an MCUL/HLRCC patient increases confidence in the pathogenic role of that variant, improving the accuracy of clinical genetic counselling. Equally it remains extremely important to test missense variants in sufficient, ethnically matched, healthy controls to aid in identifying SNPs in the coding sequence, which may currently be incorrectly classified. We hope that the FH mutation database, which strives to systematically unify all current genetic knowledge of FH variants, will increase the confidence of clinical geneticists and treating physicians when advising patients and their families, will provide a convenient resource for research scientists, and may eventually assist in gaining novel insights into FH and its related clinical syndromes."}, "18439317": {"pmid": "18439317", "pmcid": "PMC2386444", "title": "Association between promoter -1607 polymorphism of MMP1 and Lumbar Disc Disease in Southern Chinese", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix of the intervertebral disc.

The annual prevalence ranges from 15% to 45%, with a point prevalence averaging 30%. Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) in the lumbar spine or lumbar disc degeneration is a major cause of LBP. Up to now, there is only a limited understanding of DDD, with the underlying pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms remain un-elucidated. Studies suggested that environmental factors such as physical loading, motor vehicle driving, vibration and smoking may have a role. However, there is increasing evidence that DDD is a genetic disorder, with reports of predisposition in association with certain genes, such as Taq I polymorphism of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, polymorphism of metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) gene, mutations in collagen IX genes (COL9A2 and COL9A3), Sp1 polymorphism of collagen I gene (COL1A1), polymorphism of cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP) as well as aggrecan gene polymorphism. The involvement of multiple genes is not uncommon, as aetiology is often multifactorial in common diseases such as DDD. In the process of disc degeneration, degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key event. Collagens are one of the major constituents of the ECM. They make up 20% dry mass of the nucleus pulposus and 60% dry mass of the annulus fibrosis. Approximately 80% of the collagens in the intervertebral disc consist of fibrillar collagen types I and II. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are the family of degradation enzymes that break down the components of the ECM. In particular, MMP1 is a collagenase which cleaves the triple helical part of the fibrillar collagen of types I, II and III, and is proposed to initiate the degradation process. The cleaved fragments have a lower melting temperature than 37\u00b0C, which are then further cleaved by other MMPs. Similarly, MMP1 can cleave aggrecan at the major MMP cleavage sites between the G1 and G2 domains contributing to the breakdown of aggrecan. Expression of MMPs is generally low in normal cells which allows for healthy tissue turnover. On the other hand, the level of MMPs increases substantially under pathological conditions and results in ECM degradation. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for guanine insertion/deletion (G/D) at position -1607 in the promoter region of the MMP1 gene (-1607 polymorphism) results in creation of binding sites for Ets transcription factor family. Upon the interaction of adjacent AP-1 site, the promoter activity and hence the transcription level of MMP1 can be considerably increased. In the present study, the association between this promoter SNP and DDD was investigated in a population-based dataset. We demonstrated significant association with DDD and the deletion of guanine is suggested to be a possible genetic risk factor predisposing to DDD. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained. Individuals of Southern Chinese origin were recruited by open invitation from the general population. All the recruited subjects subsequently underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine and their blood was obtained for DNA extraction and genotyping analysis. The MRI examinations were performed at the Jockey Club MRI Engineering Centre using a 0.2T Profile open MRI system (General Electric Medical System, Milwaukee, WI). Sagittal T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences (TR = 3000 ms, TE = 92 ms, slice thickness = 5 mm) were used to image the lumbar spine with a built-in flexible body coil. Despite the relative low field, previous studies have demonstrated this to be sensitive enough to identify abnormalities associated with DDD. DDD was diagnosed on the basis of signal intensity changes within the nucleus pulposus (NP) of the intervertebral discs (IVDs) of the lumbar spine and graded using the Schneiderman's classification scheme. Grade 0 was used to indicate normal disc with hyperintense signal within the NP, grade 1 for a slight decrease in signal intensity in the NP, grade 2 for a generalized hypointense NP and grade 3 for a hypointense NP with disc space narrowing. All the MRI scans were analyzed and rated by two experienced physicians blinded to the results of the genetic analysis and clinical history. Differences were reviewed by the two raters and settled by consensus. The score for each disc (0\u20133) was then summated to create a DDD score for the whole lumbar spine (0\u201315) as previously described. To define the affection status using DDD score, a score of 0 was used to indicate the absence of disc degeneration, while a score of 2 or above was used to indicate the presence of degeneration. Individuals with DDD score of 1 are considered as borderline degeneration and was the area of the majority of disagreements between the 2 raters and hence those with DDD score of 1 was considered unknown affection status and excluded from analysis. Disc bulge was defined in discs where it has protruded posteriorly beyond a line connecting the posterior margins of the adjacent vertebral bodies. In addition, annular tears and Schmorl's nodes were assessed. Annular tears were defined as areas of high signal intensity within the posterior annulus surrounded by a dark rim. Schmorl's nodes were defined as areas of endplate irregularities in which the darkened rim of the vertebral endplate has indented into the vertebral body. Genomic DNA was isolated from the leukocytes and the quality as well as quantity measured by spectrophotometry. Genotyping was performed using the Sequenom\u00ae platform. The Mass ARRAY AssayDesign software (Sequenom) was used to design amplification and allele-specific extension primers. The extension primer (5'-GTAGTTAAATAATTAGAAAG-3') was designed to hybridize to the amplicon near the SNP site for the extension of a single base or a few bases depending on the genotype of the allele. PCR reactions (Forward primer: 5'-ACGTTGGATGGAACTCACATGTTATGCCAC-3'; Reverse-primer: 5'-ACGTTGGATGCTTCAGTATATCTTGGATTG-3') were set up in 384-well plates at 6 \u03bcL total volume per reaction and the reaction mix contains: 5 ng genomic DNA, 0.3 pmol each of specific forward and reverse primers, 200 \u03bcM of each dNTP, 3.25 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 unit of HotStarTaq polymerase (5U/\u03bcL, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The PCR condition was: 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 20 sec, 56\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 72\u00b0C for 3 min. The treatment of PCR products with alkaline phosphatase and mass extend reactions were all performed according to manufacturer's (Sequenom) protocol. The final base-extension products were desalted using SpectroClean resin (Sequenom), mixed with 3-hydroxypicolinic acid and analyzed using a modified Brucker Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Brucker, Billerica, MA). Association and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium checking were assessed by \u03c72 test and Mann-Whitney U test. Odds ratios and other statistical measures were calculated by SPSS 14.0 software. A total of 691 individuals were genotyped for the study with 266 males and 425 females. In common with previous studies, no significant differences could be detected in disease predisposition between the 2 genders and therefore no gender stratification was carried out. Analysis of the D allele showed an over representation in the case group. The D allele conferred a higher risk (1.4 times) of developing DDD when compared to the G allele (P-value = 0.027, odds ratio = 1.41 with 95% CI = 1.04\u20131.90) (Table 1). Genotypic association on the presence of the D allele was also significantly associated with DDD (P-value = 0.046, odds ratio = 1.50 with 95% CI = 1.01\u20132.24) (Table 2). Because DDD is age related and 2 risk factors, VDR and the COL9A2, have previously been demonstrated to be age-dependent, we also analyzed this MMP1 association to DDD stratified by age group. Using a stratification as in a previous study, no significant association was detected in an under-40-year age group (P-value = 0.5, OR = 1.26 with 95% CI = 0.64\u20132.46). However, in the over-40-year age group, the association was significant (P-value = 0.03, OR = 1.46 with 95% CI = 1.03\u20132.03) (Tables 1 &2). In addition, we assessed the difference in the distribution of the DDD score for the D-allele+ (either DD or DG genotype) and D-allele- (GG genotype) groups by Mann-Whitney U test. It was found that the distribution of the DDD score was significantly different between the D-allele+ and D-allele- groups (p value = 0.028) with D-allele+ group having higher DDD score. Apart from DDD, association was tested on disc bulge, annular tear as well as Schmorl's nodes, no significant association with these phenotypes were found with the MMP1 promoter polymorphism (Table 3). This is the first report of an association of a SNP in the promoter region of MMP1 with DDD. DDD is a complex multifactorial disease. It has been suggested that disc degeneration is highly correlated to age and age stratification was performed in previous studies. Our results indicated that the association of DDD with the SNP is age-dependent, and is associated with subjects over 40 years of age. MMP1 is involved in the cleavage of fibrillar collagens I, II and III. Type I collagen is found extensively within the annulus fibrosus and bony end-plate, while Type II is the predominant collagen in the inner annulus, nucleus pulposus as well as the cartilaginous end-plate. Previous studies in tumor cell lines showed that an over-representation of the G allele of this promoter SNP resulted in increased MMP1 transcriptional activity, hence more aggressive matrix degradation. This was proposed to be a mechanism in cancer progression and was proven in subsequent functional studies which showed that the G allele created additional binding sites for the Ets family of transcription factors. These Ets binding sites (-1607 bp) work cooperatively with a nearby AP-1 site (-1602 bp) to enhance promoter activity by at least 2 folds. With the increased promoter activity and hence transcription level, the presence of the G allele could consider to be risk factor for matrix degradation. Although we found an association with this promoter SNP in MMP1, our result showed the presence of the D allele resulted in an increased risk of DDD, and not the anticipated G allele. Previous in vitro studies have shown that the G allele is associated with higher expression levels of MMP1. Thus, individuals with the D allele with increase risk for DDD could not be explained by increased susceptibility to matrix degradation because there is no over-expression of MMP1. This association may be explained in a number of ways. First, the frequency for D allele is high in different ethnic populations with 62.5% and 56.7% for African and Caucasian respectively (NCBI database), and 36.4% for Southern Chinese. The high frequency of D allele may indicate that the D allele is a common ancestor allele, which might be in linkage disequilibrium with unknown disease-causing polymorphism within the same gene. Secondly, MMP1 is located in a gene cluster on chromosome 11 with other MMP genes (MMP-3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 20 and 26). It is possible that the observed association is the result of linkage disequilibrium between this MMP1 promoter polymorphism and polymorphisms in other nearby MMP genes. Moreover, despite the Ets binding site can cooperate with AP-1 site to enhance transcription of MMP1, this polymorphism has yet to be tested in intervertebral disc tissues, to see whether it affects the transcription level of MMP1. It maybe that gene expression be differentially displayed in a tissue-specific manner. In addition, expressional activity of MMP1 may also be influenced differentially in response to cytokines and growth factors. Even in the case of cancer, allele corresponding to elevated MMP1 activity (expected to have increased susceptibility to cancer and poor prognosis) was unexpectedly found to have favourable prognosis with colorectal cancer and no association with tumor characteristics. Thus further replications of association in other ethnic populations would help substantiate findings in this study. In summary, we have performed a case-control association study to test for association between this promoter SNP (-1607 polymorphism) of MMP1 and DDD. We have demonstrated this promoter polymorphism was significantly associated with increased susceptibility to DDD in our Southern Chinese population, especially in individuals over 40 years of age. Disc bulge, annular tear as well as Schmorl's nodes were not associated with this polymorphism."}, "18470323": {"pmid": "18470323", "pmcid": "PMC2373796", "title": "Anticipation in familial lattice corneal dystrophy type I with R124C mutation in the TGFBI (BIGH3) gene", "abstract": "\n\nPurpose\nTo report the clinical, ophthalmic, and genetic characteristics for lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCDI) in a Chilean family.\n\n\nMethods\nSix affected family members were examined clinically including visual acuity, color cornea photography, applanation tonography, and fundoscopy. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes from six affected and three unaffected members of a family with lattice corneal dystrophy type I. Exon 4 of the transforming growth factor-induced gene (TGFBI) was screened for the most frequent mutation, R124C, in the proband by sequencing.

Lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD) is a distinct clinical entity characterized by the accumulation of amyloid throughout the middle and anterior stroma. Lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCD1, OMIM 122200), also known as Biber-Haab-Dimmer dystrophy, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable clinical expression and a high degree of penetration. Generally, the first clinical symptoms become evident in the first or second decade with the appearance of white-grayish opacities, which involve the superficial stromal layer of the cornea. Thereafter, the lesions tend to become larger, aggregate, and extend deeper and toward the periphery. In 1994, a gene for several corneal dystrophies and the transforming growth factor-induced gene (TGFBI, also known as BIGH3) were mapped to human chromosome 5 (5q31). During the same year, it was also discovered that the protein product of the TGFBI gene is expressed in the cornea. Three years later, Munier et al. reported that these disorders are caused by mutations in TGFBI. Mutations in the same gene also cause granular corneal dystrophies (GCD; reviewed by Kannabiran and Klintworth). TGFBI encodes for a 68 kDa extracellular matrix protein. So far, few mutations have been described in this gene as causative of LCD type I. The mutation list includes R124C, V505D, L518P, V539D, A546D, P551Q, L569R, H572R, and V625D. The mutation C>T at the nucleotide position 417 at codon 124 (R124C) in exon 4 is the most frequent throughout the world. Considering that there are no genetic studies on lattice corneal dystrophy in our country, we determined the clinical, ophthalmic, and genetic characteristics in a Chilean family having this disease. Our results suggest anticipation in the disease. We report for the first time the presence of the TGFBI mutation segregating with lattice corneal dystrophy type I in Chilean patients. The molecular basis of anticipation in LCDI, which is not mediated by trinucleotide repeat expansions in the BIGH3, remains elusive. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Hospital University of Chile and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The pedigree of the four-generation family was delineated (Figure 1). After obtaining informed consent, nine members from three consecutive generations of a Chilean family with lattice corneal dystrophy were enrolled, six affected and three unaffected. The proband was initially examined because of ocular pain and redness. The LCD type I diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical examination. The nine members of the family, affected and not affected, were examined over two years. The family history suggests Spanish origin. An extensive clinical history of participating members of the family was developed and particular attention was paid to the age of onset, initial signs and symptoms, and corneal structure. Clinical examination included best corrected visual acuity according to the best line of Snellen acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, color cornea photography, applanation tonography, and dilated fundus examination. Autorefractometry measurement and keratometry were performed (Topcon RM-A7000, Tokyo, Japan). Stereopsis was quantitatively assessed with the Titmus Fly Stereo Test (Stereo Optical Co., Inc., Chicago, IL). The lesions were considered to be synchronic if the patients perceived the first symptoms in both eyes with a time difference of less than a month. All individuals with corneal commitment were considered clinically affected. Patients were classified in degree of severity according to best-corrected vision (Table 1) and the number of lesions and corneal commitment. The corneal phenotype of all index patients was assessed by slit lamp biomicroscopy examination and reviewed by an investigator ignorant of the genetic status. Although the patients, II-1, III-2 and IV-2, were not examined in this study, their age of onset were obtained from an interview of patient II-1. Blood samples were colleted in tubes containing EDTA and total DNA was prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Exon 4 of the proband was amplified using previously described primers. The resulting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was purified using the Wizard\u00ae Gel purification kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) and sequenced using Big DyeTM sequencing reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA), and automated sequencing was performed by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI3700 (Applied Biosystems). To analyze the same mutation in the nine family members, we designed a new simple and rapid detection method based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP). To carry out the PCR-RFLP analyses, genomic DNA from nine family members was amplified by PCR using the primers BIGH3 F1: 5\u2032-CTT TCC CAC ATG CCT CCT CGT-3\u2032 (forward) and BIGH3 Rmut: 5\u2032-TCT CAG GCC TCA GCT TCT CCC TGC-3\u2032 (reverse). The \u201cT\u201d nucleotide at position 21 in the sequence of the reverse primer was replaced for a \u201cC\u201d to generate the PstI restriction site in the mutated allele. The 221 products were digested using the PstI restriction enzyme for 3 h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Fragments were resolved by electrophoresis in a 4% Nusieve agarose (3:1) gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light. After digestion, the \u201cT\u201d allele consisted of three fragments of 21, 76, and 124 base pairs (bp), and the \u201cC\u201d allele consisted of two fragments of 97 and 124 bp. The four-generation lattice corneal dystrophy type I family studied consisted of nine affected and nine unaffected individuals (Figure 1). Eight relatives of the proband were examined clinically. Five of them were affected by LCD type I (two males and three females) and three were not affected (two males and one female), as shown in the pedigree (Figure 1). The phenotypic features of affected and unaffected family members are summarized in Table 1. The age of onset of patients II-1, III-2, and IV-2 were obtained from an interview of patient II-1, although they were not clinically analyzed in this study. The proband was an eight-year-old boy (IV-5). The presence of LCD type I in three continuous generations indicates an autosomal dominant transmission. All patients clinically studied reported the beginning of lesions in a synchronic way in both eyes except for patient II-2 who noticed the lesion in the second eye one year after the lesion in the first eye. Visual sharpness ranged from 1.0 to 0.13; the worst were in the older generations. All patients had different degrees of astigmatism, with intraocular pressure (IOP) within the normal range (IOP<21) and had normal stereopsis. The proband\u2019s grandfather, at 69 years of age, was examined and diagnosed with LCD. His symptoms initiated with sensitivity to sunlight, episodes of ocular pain, and redness at 42 years of age. Slit-lamp examination revealed irregularity of the epithelial surface with subepithelial and anterior stromal scarring resulting in diffuse clouding of the central cornea (Figure 2A,B). Asymmetric commitment and vascularization of the cornea was observed. He was classified in maximal severity according to best-corrected vision (0.13 for both eyes) and corneal commitment. Typical, fine branching lattice lines could be seen in the peripheral anterior stroma, which was outside the area of central opacification. Central corneal sensation was significantly decreased, and the patient had a history of recurrent corneal erosions in the fourth and fifth decades of life. The symptoms of the proband\u2019s aunt began with episodes of acute ocular pain, redness, and photophobia at 30 years of age. The frequency and severity of these episodes increased coincident with a gradual deterioration of vision in both eyes. At 42 years of age, she was classified in maximal severity according to best-corrected vision (0.28 in the right eye [OD] and 0.13 in the left eye [OS]) and corneal commitment. Slit-lamp examination revealed an irregular epithelial surface with subepithelial and anterior stromal scarring, resulting in diffuse clouding of the central cornea. She showed a network of linear opacities associated with other smaller opaque spots and refractive lattice lines (Figure 2C). No vascularization of the cornea was observed. Central corneal sensation was decreased. The proband\u2019s mother, at 40 years of age, initially presented a mild subepithelial scarring and opacification, which gradually progressed to include elevated subepithelial opacities, fine lattice lines, diffuse \u201cground glass\u201d haze in the anterior stroma, and corneal grafts (Figure 2D,E). Best-corrected vision was 0.5 OD and 0.4 OS. The left cornea contained opacifications from presumed recurrent disease. Fine branching lattice lines could be seen in the peripheral anterior stroma. Although patients IV-3 and IV-4 did not have lesions at time of the exams, they had a history of recurrent corneal erosions in both eyes since the ages of three and four, respectively. The proband had a history of recurrent corneal erosions in both eyes, which began when he was four years old. Slit lamp examination showed the presence of large, typical fine branching lattice lines in the anterior stroma in OD (Figure 2F). A clear area was preserved around the corneal-scleral limbus. Best-corrected vision was 0.5 in the right eye (OD) and 0.67 in the left eye (OS). The average age at onset for affected family members was 18.9\u00b115.7 years old (3\u201342 years old; Table 1). However, the age of the beginning of symptoms has been progressively younger in succeeding generations. Generation II includes two individuals (II-1 and II-3) with the age of onset at 37 and 42 years old, respectively; generation III includes three individuals (III-2, III-5, and III-6) with the age of onset at 17, 28, and 30 years old, respectively; and generation IV includes four individuals (IV-2, IV-3, IV-4, and IV-5) with the age of onset at 5, 3, 4, and 4 years, respectively. Exon 4 of TGFB1 of the proband was analyzed by sequencing (Figure 3). The sequence revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, R124C (417C>T). To discriminate between normal and mutated alleles, we developed a new PCR-RFLP method. The mutation was analyzed in six affected (including the proband) and three healthy family members, revealing an identical heterozygous change in all affected. As expected, the mutation was absent in the unaffected individuals (Figure 4). All affected family members showed phenotypic characteristics corresponding to LCDI. Within the family group, the patients showed a variable commitment that might be explained not only with the course of the variant disease but also with the amount of stromal damage over the years, which apparently increased with age. We report a case with a heterozygous mutation detected by sequencing in exon 4 of TGFBI. This alteration has been reported previously in several ethnic groups. The molecular analysis by the PCR-RFLP method developed here offers an easy, rapid, and accurate diagnosis of patients with R124C. The genealogical information for the family allows us to trace the mutation only as far as the proband\u2019s maternal grandfather who seems to be of Spanish origin. There is no information indicating that the great grandparents had any ophthalmic disorder, which suggests this is a new mutation. We observed a decrease in the age of onset in three succeeding generations in the family of the proband. Analyzing previous reports of LCD1 families, we found one case describing the same point mutations in a family with decreasing age of diagnosis in successive generations similar to ours, although they do not document the age of onset. This could be similarly interpreted as genetic anticipation of the disease. Anticipation has been frequently described for diseases caused by the expansion of unstable triplet repeats, which is not the case with LCD1. Anticipation has been also described for point mutations, insertions, and deletions of a small group of genes including TCOF1, located in 5q32 and mutated in Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS; OMIM 154500); EBP, a gene located in Xp11.22-p11.23 and mutated in X-chromosomal dominant chondrodysplasia syndrome (CHH, OMIM 302960); the transthyretin gene (TTR), located in 18q12.1 and mutated in familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP, OMIM:176300]); and copper\u2013zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a gene located in 21q22.1 and mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, OMIM 105400). In some of these diseases, a genetic explanation of anticipation has been suggested. For example, in the chondrodysplasia syndrome, somatic mosaicism and differences in X chromosome inactivation can explain the phenomenon of anticipation and in amyloid polyneuropathy, the differences in the age of disease onset might be explained by genetic interactions among multiple loci. In our case, genetic anticipation might be explained in at least three ways. One way is the fact that a previous ophthalmic history of the parents and grandparents probably prompted the family to look earlier for medical examination. It is possible that several mild cases of the syndrome, especially when the affected person does not feel impaired, will go undiagnosed until the occurrence of a more severely affected sibling or offspring. Another explanation of anticipation may be the result of the loss of a protective allele or another interacting gene from the affected parent. Thus the protective allele or interacting gene could ameliorate the effect of the mutated allele in the affected parent. Since such protective allele or protective gene could be absent in the offspring, it can not exhibit any protective effect in these subjects. The final possible way may be the gain of a susceptibility allele from the non-affected parent, which could worsen the effect of the mutated allele. If we consider that individuals III-4 and III-7 are not related, the probability of gaining a susceptibility allele simultaneously by individuals IV-3, IV-4, and IV-5 is low. In conclusion, since the mutation at the hot spot nucleotide 417 can be easily, rapidly, and cost-effectively evaluated by PCR sequencing or by PCR-RFLP, identification of this mutation will allow Chilean patients to benefit from a timely and accurate molecular diagnosis of LCD type I. Genetic testing of TGFBI mutations in LCD type I patients will also contribute to improve their clinical classification, management, and eventual genetic counseling. Although the R124C mutation is one of the genetic causes of the disease, different genetic and environmental factors may govern the age of onset."}, "28468941": {"pmid": "28468941", "pmcid": "PMC5415014", "title": "Aberrant caveolin-1\u2013mediated Smad signaling and proliferation identified by analysis of adenine 474 deletion mutation (c.474delA) in patient fibroblasts: a new perspective on the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension", "abstract": "\nA recently identified frameshift mutation in the C-terminus of caveolin-1 is characterized. Human fibroblasts carrying this mutation proliferated twice as rapidly due to SMAD1/5/8 hyperphosphorylation. These results shed new light on the importance of the final 20 amino acids of caveolin-1.\n", "fulltext": "Caveolae are bulb-shaped, 50- to 100-nm plasma membrane invaginations found in many cell types, including adipocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. They serve as signaling hubs and are involved in endocytosis and tension sensing (Parton and del Pozo, 2013). Caveolae can flatten in response to stretching of the plasma membrane and reduce membrane tension (Sinha et\u00a0al., 2011), and caveolae in part also regulate both rapid and long-term dilation of blood vessels in response to increased shear stress (Yu et\u00a0al., 2006). Caveolin and cavin families of proteins are essential for the characteristic shape of caveolae. Deletion of caveolin-1 (Cav1) leads to loss of caveolae (Drab et\u00a0al., 2001), except in cardiac and skeletal muscle, in which caveolin-3 compensates for the loss (Galbiati et\u00a0al., 2001). Another member of this family, caveolin-2, interacts with Cav1 but is not required to generate caveolae (Nassar and Parat, 2015). The cavin family of proteins consists of four members (cavins 1\u20134), which form homo- and hetero-oligomers in the cytoplasm and are recruited to caveolae, where they stabilize caveolin oligomers (Kovtun et\u00a0al., 2015; Nassar and Parat, 2015). Cavin-1 appears to be especially important because it interacts with caveolin-1, and knockout of cavin-1 leads to loss of caveolae (Liu et\u00a0al., 2008). The caveolar coat is believed to contain \u223c150\u2013200 caveolin subunits and 50 cavins, which function cooperatively to establish the caveolae shape (Gambin et\u00a0al., 2014). Cav1 contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic end responsible for oligomerization (amino acids 61\u2013101; Sargiacomo et\u00a0al., 1995) and a scaffolding domain (amino acids 82\u2013101) responsible for interaction with a number of proteins, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase and transforming growth factor \u03b2\u00a0(TGF\u03b2) receptors (Li et\u00a0al., 1995; Boscher and Nabi, 2012). The adjacent stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (102\u2013134) inserts into the plasma membrane (Monier et\u00a0al., 1995). The importance of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (amino acids 135\u2013178) is less clear. This region appears to be required for interactions of Cav1 oligomers and binding of Cav1 to trans-Golgi membranes during posttranslational modification of the protein before export to the plasma membrane (Schlegel and Lisanti, 2000). The C-terminus also contains three palmitoylation sites (cysteines 133, 143, and 156) believed to stabilize Cav1 oligomers (Monier et\u00a0al., 1996) and regulate their membrane association (Bakhshi et\u00a0al., 2013). Several germline and somatic mutations in Cav1 have been identified. A germline homozygous nonsense mutation at position 38 of Cav1 (p.Glu38X) was identified in a patient with Berardinelli\u2013Seip congenital lipodystrophy, which is characterized by the near absence of adipose tissue (Kim et\u00a0al., 2008). Hypertriglyceridemia and partial lipodystrophy affecting the upper part of the body were associated with a heterozygous nonsense mutation at position 134 of Cav1 (p.I134fsdelA-X137; Cao et\u00a0al., 2008). A heterozygous c.474delA frameshift mutation, which alters the final 20 amino acids (p.P158PfsX22), was identified in multiple members of a family with heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; Austin et\u00a0al., 2012). It is unclear how the frameshift c.474delA mutation at the C-terminal of Cav1, which alters only the final 20 amino acids but leaves other domains intact, affects the function of caveolae. Because the molecular basis for the disease has not been studied, here we address the signaling abnormalities associated with this mutation, using dermal fibroblasts from the family carrying the c.474delA mutation (Austin et\u00a0al., 2012). Studying this mutation might provide clues about the pathogenesis of PAH seen in these patients. The model in Figure 1A describes specific Cav1 domains and the site of the c.474delA mutation. The resulting frameshift alters the final C-terminal 20 amino acids of Cav1 (Cav1*, Figure 1B). Genomic sequencing confirmed the presence of Cav1* c.474delA mutation in primary patient fibroblasts from these patients (Figure 1C). All patients were heterozygous for the c.474delA mutation, because the juxtaposition of one wild-type (WT) and one mutated sequence led to a double sequencing signal after the deletion. Transmission electron microscopy showed that Cav1* fibroblasts formed caveolae having a normal size distribution (mean diameter 75.3 \u00b1 0.5 nm in control fibroblasts vs. 76.0 \u00b1 0.7 nm in Cav1* fibroblasts); however, their number in Cav1* fibroblasts was half that in controls (Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure S1). Cav1 mRNA expression was not significantly different between fibroblasts from healthy control subjects and Cav1* patients (Figure 2A). Total Cav1 protein level was investigated using an antibody against the N-terminal in WT Cav1 and Cav1*. We observed no significant change in total Cav1 protein expression in Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 2B, top). An antibody against the C-terminal, which is changed due to the frameshift mutation in Cav1*, detected only nonmutated Cav1. In line with the sequencing data, we observed that the patient fibroblasts were heterozygous for c.474delA mutation, as they contained \u223c50% nonmutated Cav1 expression compared with WT fibroblasts (Figure 2B, middle). Moreover, the expression of cavin-1 was reduced (Figure 2C). Cavin-1 expression correlates with the number of caveolae (Voldstedlund et\u00a0al., 2003; Hill et\u00a0al., 2008); therefore these results are in accordance with reduced caveolae numbers found by electron microscopy. We next studied endocytosis of fluorescently labeled cholera toxin subunit B (CtxB). After an acid wash to remove extracellular CtxB, all cells showed colocalization of Cav1 and CtxB (Figure 3A), with similar uptake of CtxB in WT and Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 3, B and C). Furthermore, extraction of cholesterol using methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) reduced the uptake of CtxB by 50% in both control and Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 3, B and D). Caveolae fuse with early endosomes, and CtxB is subsequently transported to the Golgi apparatus (Pelkmans et\u00a0al., 2004). To discriminate from clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we also looked at the uptake of CtxB in transferrin receptor (CD71)\u2013positive endosomes. We found a similar uptake of CtxB in the Golgi apparatus of both groups (colocalization with the Golgi marker GM130; Supplemental Figure S2, A and B), with almost the entire Golgi network stained by CtxB (Supplemental Figure S2C). In contrast, low levels of endosomal labeling were seen in both groups (Supplemental Figure S2, D and E). As a control, we repeated the foregoing experiments in Cav1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts obtained from Cav1\u2212/\u2212 mice and found that M\u03b2CD treatment of these cells had no significant effect on CtxB uptake (Supplemental Figure S3A). Endosomal uptake was increased in Cav1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts (Supplemental Figure S3B) perhaps as a compensation for the loss of Cav1. These results show that patient Cav1* fibroblasts did not phenocopy Cav1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts. Next, to assess the functional significance of the mutant protein in Cav1* fibroblasts, we used fibroblasts from Cav1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2009) and expressed control human WT Cav1, human Cav1*, or a combination of both to mimic heterozygous patient fibroblasts. Sequencing of constructs after site-specific mutagenesis confirmed the deletion of adenine 474 (Supplemental Figure S4A). As shown in Figure 4A, staining for Cav1 in transfected cells demonstrated that Cav1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts transfected with Cav1* had a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern. In contrast, fibroblasts transfected with WT Cav1 or fibroblasts having 1:1 WT Cav1 and Cav1* showed a punctate staining pattern (Figure 4A) resembling the staining pattern observed in human Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 3A). To assess further the intracellular localization of Cav1* cells, we cotransfected Cav1* and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013targeted DsRed and found that cells expressing only Cav1* showed accumulation of the protein in the ER (Figure 4B), which we did not observe in cells expressing WT Cav1 or WT Cav1 in combination with Cav1* (Supplemental Figure S4B). We also performed experiments using different ratios of WT and mutant Cav1*. We observed a diffuse staining pattern at low levels of WT Cav1 (0\u201325%). However, as the proportion of WT Cav1 increased relative to Cav1*, we observed distinctly more punctate staining (Figure 4C). Moreover, using a Myc-tagged Cav1* construct, we found that Cav1* has a punctate staining pattern in the presence of WT Cav1, suggesting that WT Cav1 rescues the defective diffuse staining phenotype of mutant Cav1* (Figure 4C; see Supplemental Figure S4C for higher-magnification images). Given the apparent colocalization of WT Cav1 and mutant Cav1*, we next addressed whether there was any direct interaction between the two. For this, we generated two plasmids: WT Cav1 labeled with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; Zimnicka et\u00a0al., 2016) and Cav1* labeled with a Myc tag. As shown in Figure 5A, the YFP and Myc tag significantly overlapped, suggesting colocalization of WT and mutant Cav1*. Specificity of the Myc staining was evident by the absence of staining in cells that were only transfected with WT Cav1 (Figure 5A, bottom). Immunoprecipitation of WT Cav1 pulled down a significant amount of Myc-labeled mutant Cav1*, demonstrating that WT and mutant Cav1 indeed interacted (Figure 5B). Cav1 molecules normally form oligomers consisting of 14\u201316 individual proteins (Sargiacomo et\u00a0al., 1995), and we found that oligomerization was not impaired in Cav1* fibroblasts, as the ratio of oligomer/monomer was identical between WT and Cav1* human fibroblasts (Supplemental Figure S5A). We observed a number of functional abnormalities in Cav1* human fibroblasts, with increased proliferation being the most striking. Cav1* fibroblasts proliferated at twofold greater rate than control fibroblasts (Figure 6A). In addition, Cav1* human fibroblasts had a modest increase in collagen3A1 expression (Supplemental Figure S5B) and collagen secretion (Figure 6B). Synthesis of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) was also increased (Figure 6C), suggesting that Cav1* fibroblasts were activated. Because Cav1 is known to suppress fibroblast proliferation (Razani et\u00a0al., 2001a), we next addressed whether Cav1* could also inhibit proliferation. Messenger mRNA levels revealed a similar transfection efficiency of both control Cav1 and Cav1* in Cav1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts (Supplemental Figure S5C). We observed, however, that transfection of WT Cav1 decreased fibroblast proliferation by 50%, whereas transfection with Cav1* had no effect (Figure 6D). Because proliferation was markedly increased in fibroblasts from patients carrying the Cav1* mutation (Figure 6A), we addressed possible mechanisms. Members of the TGF\u03b2 family of receptors interact with Cav1 (Razani et\u00a0al., 2001b). In most cases, signaling through these receptors leads to phosphorylation of mothers against decapentaplegic protein (Smad) 2/3 in response to TGF\u03b2 and activins, whereas Smad1/5/8 is phosphorylated in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP; Horbelt et\u00a0al., 2012). At baseline, we observed marked increases in Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation in Cav1* fibroblasts, whereas Smad2/3 phosphorylation was not altered compared with controls (Figure 7A), consistent with activation of the BMP pathway. Stimulation with TGF\u03b2\u00a0increased Smad2/3 phosphorylation to a similar extent in both cell types (Figure 7B), confirming that signaling downstream of TGF\u03b2 is normal both at baseline and after stimulation. Furthermore, increasing WT Cav1 levels in human Cav1* fibroblasts did not reduce Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation (Figure 7C), arguing against Cav1 haploinsufficiency as an explanation for increased Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. Because phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 occurs through activin receptor\u2013like kinase (ALK) 1/2/3/6 (Goumans et\u00a0al., 2002; Schmierer and Hill, 2007), we next determined whether ALK1/2/3/6 activity was responsible for the hyperproliferation seen in Cav1* fibroblasts. We used LDN193189, an inhibitor of these ALK receptors that blocks Smad1/5/8 activation (Cuny et\u00a0al., 2008). As shown in Figure 8A, LDN193189 significantly reduced proliferation of Cav1* fibroblasts but not WT cells. In contrast, SB431542, an inhibitor of ALK4/5/7 upstream of Smad2/3, equally reduced proliferation rates in both WT and Cav1* fibroblasts (Figure 8B). Our results provide insights into the phenotype of the Cav1 c.474delA mutation of Cav1 at the C-terminus and underlying basis of PAH in these patients. The p.P158PfsX22 frameshift mutation in Cav1 occurred at the final 20 amino acids of the C-terminus, leaving the rest of the protein unaffected, specifically the Cav1 oligomerization domain (residues 61\u2013101), scaffolding domain (82\u2013101), and transmembrane domain (residues 102\u2013134; Li et\u00a0al., 1995). In the ER, 14\u201316 Cav1 proteins oligomerize through their oligomerization domain (residues 61\u2013101; Sargiacomo et\u00a0al., 1995). Subsequently, in the Golgi apparatus, several oligomers interact and combine with cholesterol to form detergent-resistant complexes, after which fully formed caveolae are transported to the plasmalemma (Hayer et\u00a0al., 2010). Oligomerization in the ER is a prerequisite for successful trafficking of Cav1 to the plasma membrane (Ren et\u00a0al., 2004). We observed that the Cav1* patient fibroblasts formed normal-appearing and -sized caveolae, although their overall number was reduced by half. We found, using Cav1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts, that expression of Cav1* alone resulted in the failure of fibroblasts to generate caveolae, and Cav1* was trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum. Supplying WT Cav1 to these cells expressing Cav1* rescued the trafficking defect of Cav1*. We also observed that Cav1* colocalized and interacted with WT Cav1, consistent with the finding that oligomerization appeared normal in human Cav1* fibroblasts. This is likely due to the intact oligomerization domain of Cav1*, which enabled mutant Cav1* to interact normally with WT Cav1. The reason for the reduction in number of caveolae in Cav1* fibroblasts to half of normal values is not clear. One possibility is that the frameshift mutation occurred at the final 20 amino acids of the C-terminus in proximity to palmitoylation sites interfered with formation and stability of caveolae (Schlegel and Lisanti, 2000). We used CtxB to study endocytosis. CtxB binds to ganglioside GM1 on the cell membrane and is internalized by endocytosis. Several pathways for endocytosis, including clathrin-dependent and -independent pathways, have been described. Among the clathrin-independent pathways are endocytosis mediated by caveolae and the recently described pathway clathrin-independent carriers (CLIC)/glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored proteins\u2013enriched early endosomal compartment (GEEC) pathway. Depending on the cell type and number of caveolae, different routes are used for endocytosis. For example, in fibroblasts, the majority of CtxB (\u223c80%) was internalized via a caveolae-dependent pathway; however, cell types with a low level of Cav1 mostly internalized CtxB through the clathrin-dependent pathway. Here we discriminated between clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis by staining for transferrin receptor CD71 (clathrin-mediated endocytosis; Supplemental Figure S2). We found that human WT and Cav1* fibroblasts primarily used a clathrin-independent pathway to internalize CtxB. A further complicating factor is that the CLIC/GEEC pathway plays an important role in the uptake of CtxB in fibroblasts and this pathway is up-regulated in the absence of caveolae. Therefore it is possible that the observed normal CtxB uptake in human Cav1* fibroblasts, despite the reduction in number of caveolae, may be related to compensatory upregulation of the CLIC/GEEC pathway. Another important difference between Cav1* fibroblasts and WT fibroblasts was the twofold greater proliferation rate of Cav1* fibroblasts. Cav1* mutation was responsible for fibroblast hyperproliferation, because transfection of WT human Cav1 but not human Cav1* into mouse Cav1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts reduced fibroblast proliferation. We also investigated the activation of signaling pathways mediating the response. We observed a marked difference between human WT and Cav1* fibroblasts in Smad signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in Cav1* fibroblasts. Ligands from the TGF\u03b2 family (TGF\u03b2, activins, BMPs) induce the association of two type I receptors (ALK1 to ALK7) with two type II receptors (Schmierer and Hill, 2007) and downstream phosphorylation of Smads 1/2/3/5/8 (Schmierer and Hill, 2007). The phosphorylated Smads interact with Smad4 to activate gene transcription (Moustakas et\u00a0al., 2001). Distinct type I receptors phosphorylate different Smads: ALK1/2/3/6 phosphorylate Smads1/5/8, whereas ALK 4/5/7 phosphorylate Smads2/3 (Goumans et\u00a0al., 2002; Schmierer and Hill, 2007). We used LDN193189 to inhibit ALK1/2/3/6 (Cuny et\u00a0al., 2008) and SB431542 to inhibit ALK4/5/7 (Inman et\u00a0al., 2002). Inhibition of ALK1/2/3/6 significantly reduced proliferation of Cav1* fibroblasts compared with control fibroblasts, suggesting that ALK1/2/3/6-mediated Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation was critical in mediating Cav1* fibroblast hyperproliferation. Fibroblast hyperproliferation has been linked to the pathogenesis of PAH (Das et\u00a0al., 2000), and, as our findings suggest, it may also be involved in the pathogenesis of PAH associated with c.474delA mutation of Cav1. In summary, our findings provide the first molecular understanding of the c.474delA Cav1 mutation associated with PAH in patients. This mutation in the C-terminus of Cav1 induced Smad1/5/8 hyperphosphorylation and increased fibroblast proliferation. The results highlight an underappreciated role of the final 20 amino acids in the C-terminus of Cav1 in mediating Smad signaling and fibroblast hyperproliferation. Primary skin fibroblasts from healthy subjects (n = 3) and members of the family carrying the c.474delA mutation in Cav1 (n = 3) were obtained from a punch biopsy as described previously (Austin et\u00a0al., 2012). Written informed consent for all studies was obtained according to protocols approved by the institutional review board at Vanderbilt University. Fibroblasts were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). For studies using mouse fibroblasts, cells were isolated from tail-tip biopsies of newborn Cav1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2009). After trypsinization for 20 min, fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin. Proliferation was quantified by determining the incorporation of the thymidine analogue 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) with the Click-It EdU kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcM EdU for 1 h. Specific ALK-pathway inhibitors LDN193189 (targeting the ALK1/ALK2/ALK3/ALK6 family; Cuny et\u00a0al., 2008) and SB431542 (targeting the ALK4/ALK5/ALK7 family; Inman et\u00a0al., 2002) were obtained from Stemcell Technologies (Vancouver, Canada). These agents were incubated with cells for 24 h before EdU administration. Collagen production was measured using the QuickZyme BioSciences soluble collagen assay kit (Leiden, Netherlands). Fibroblasts (50,000) were grown for 4 d in six-well plates and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and collagen was solubilized by adding 0.5 M acetic acid overnight. Measurements were normalized for total protein content. As positive control, cells were exposed for 4 d to 5 ng/ml recombinant human TGF\u03b21 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For zymography, conditioned medium was loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 1% bovine skin gelatin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Gels were incubated for 48 h and then stained with 1% bromophenol blue; subsequently gels were destained with 1% acetic acid. Total RNA was extracted using the PureLink Micro-to-midi total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed on 500 ng of RNA using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Quantification was performed on a 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using FastStart Universal Sybr Green master mix (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Primer sequences used are shown in Supplemental Table S1. Results were normalized to \u03b22-microglobulin (B2M) and compared with control samples (2-\u0394\u0394Ct method). Human Cav1 was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector, and a c.474delA mutation was introduced using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with specific primers (Supplemental Table S1). To confirm the mutation, Sanger sequencing was performed using 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Figure 3; Life Technologies). Immunoblotting was performed on proteins isolated using RIPA buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Primary antibodies used were against C-terminal Cav1 (Ab32577), N-terminal Cav1 (Ab2910), and Ki67 (Ab16667), all purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and cavin-1 (18892-1-AP; Rosemont, IL). To confirm equal protein loading, blots were stripped in Restore Western Blot stripping buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 10 min and reprobed with anti\u2013\u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ. After background subtraction, ratios were calculated (intensity of caveolin-1 band divided by intensity of corresponding actin band) and normalized to average ratio in the WT group. To assess the ratio of oligomerized Cav1 to free monomer, samples were collected in 2% n-octyl-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside buffer and lysed using sonication before loading on SDS\u2013PAGE gel as previously described (Bakhshi et\u00a0al., 2013). For immunofluorescence stainings, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. Matching fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h and coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold antifade mountant containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). Images were obtained on a LSM710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) using a 63\u00d7/1.4 Oil Plan-Apochromat objective and a 25-mW argon laser. We cloned human Cav1 cDNA into a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing an N-terminal Myc-His tag and introduced the c.474delA mutation using site-specific mutagenesis as described earlier. Wild-type, C-terminal, YFP-tagged caveolin-1 was generated as previously described (Chen et\u00a0al., 2012). HEK293T cells were transfected with both plasmids, and after 3 d, proteins were isolated according to the Crosslink IP kit protocol (Pierce, Rockford, IL). A total of 1000 \u03bcg of proteins was immunoprecipitated using 2 \u03bcg of antibodies against either Myc tag (MA1\u201321316; ThermoFisher Scientific) or GFP/YPF (Ab6556; Abcam). After overnight incubation, proteins were eluted, and an immunoblot against Myc tag was performed. Fibroblasts were transfected with FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 2 \u03bcg of DNA/8 \u03bcl of FuGENE according manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Plasmids used were either pcDNA3vectors containing human Cav1 or p-DsRed2-ER plasmid to fluorescently label endoplasmic reticulum (632409; Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Human WT caveolin-1 cDNA was cloned into the pLJM1 vector (19319; Addgene) using Nhe1 and EcoR1 restriction enzymes (NEB, Ipswich, MA) using the primers listed in the Supplemental Methods. These restriction enzymes also removed the GFP sequence of pLJM1. Plasmids were transfected together with pMD2.G and psPAX2 plasmids (12259 and 12260; Addgene) into HEK 293T cells to allow for lentiviral production. After 2 and 3 d, supernatant was collected, filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter, and concentrated using PEG-it solution (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). For transduction, 4 \u03bcg/ml Polybrene was added to the medium (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). Viral titers were determined on genomic DNA of fibroblasts 3 d after transduction using primers against the viral RRE element and the UCR111 region of human genomic DNA (Supplemental Table S1). The absolute number of infectious units was calculated using a standard provided in the Global UltraRapid Lentiviral Titer Kit (System Biosciences). Fibroblasts were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 5. Endocytosis was assessed using CtxB. Cells were labeled with 7.5 \u03bcg/ml Alexa 594\u2013labeled CtxB for 15 or 30 min at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml BSA. For cholesterol depletion, cells were pretreated with 5 mM M\u03b2CD (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min before adding CtxB. Excess CtxB at cell surface was removed by acid stripping (30 s with 0.2 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 2.5). Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, and stained for Cav1. For quantification of CtxB uptake in the Golgi or endosomes, cells were stained with GM130 or CD71 (both from ThermoFisher Scientific), and images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope using a Plan-Apochromat 63\u00d7/1.40 oil objective. Using ImageJ, the Otsu threshold tool was used to generate a binary image that was used as a mask to select the same region in the CtxB channel. Mean pixel intensity and area were measured for the total cell and the masked region, and percentage uptake in the Golgi was subsequently calculated after subtracting background intensities. Imaging parameters and settings for the generation of binary images were identical for all images. For colocalization analysis, we used Zeiss Zen 2.1 software. Cells were grown on 35-mm dishes, rinsed with prewarmed, serum-free DMEM, and fixed with prewarmed 2.5% glutaraldehyde in DMEM for 30 min. Samples were then washed with PBS, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2\u20137.4) for 1 h, rinsed with the same buffer, and then dehydrated through an ascending series of ethanols (30\u2013100%). Cell layers were infiltrated for 30 min in a 50/50 mixture of 100% ethanol/epoxy resin, followed by 100% epoxy resin\u00a0(LX-112; Ladd Research, Williston, VT), after which they were placed in a 60\u00b0C oven for 2 d. Blocks with monolayer cells were thin-sectioned (70\u201380 nm) using an UCT ultramicrotome (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). Resulting sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Digital images were acquired using a JEOL JEM-1220 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA), equipped with an Erlangshen ES1000W 11 MP charge-coupled device camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). Caveolae number and size were measured using ImageJ. All values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM. Intergroup differences were assessed by unpaired Student\u2019s t test or analysis of variance with post hoc analysis using Tukey\u2019s test when multiple groups were analyzed. Wherever applicable, normality was confirmed with the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Significance is indicated as *** for p < 0.001, ** for p < 0.01, and * for p < 0.05."}, "28068934": {"pmid": "28068934", "pmcid": "PMC5220610", "title": "Concordance between PIK3CA mutations in endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\n\nPIK3CA mutations are expected to be potential therapeutic targets for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

To date, multidisciplinary treatment approaches for esophageal cancer with different histological subtypes including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation have been employed; however, the prognosis of these patients remains poor [2, 3]. For patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the available agents are quite limited. A combination of platinum agents and fluorouracil derivatives is commonly used as first-line chemotherapy, and taxanes are options for second-line chemotherapy [1, 4]. In addition, no molecular-target therapies have been established for the treatment of ESCC. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for ESCC treatment, particularly for patients who are in good physical condition but who are refractory or intolerant to standard therapies. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\u2013Akt\u2013mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a pivotal role in cancer cell proliferation, and mutations in the PIK3CA gene are commonly found in various cancers regardless of histological subtypes. More than 80% of PIK3CA mutations occur in two major regions: the helical domain (exon 9), and the kinase domain (exon 20); moreover, three mutations (E542K, E545K, and H1047R) have been regarded as hotspot mutations. In a phase 1 trial evaluating an mTOR inhibitor, a case with advanced ESCC exhibited a partial response, although the PIK3CA mutation status was unknown. In addition, PIK3CA mutations have been suggested to be a potential predictive biomarker for PI3K\u2013Akt\u2013mTOR inhibitors in a review of early phase clinical trials for the testing of such agents in various solid cancers. In this report, a case with squamous cell head and neck carcinoma, which is genetically similar to ESCC, harboring a PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) demonstrated a partial response to a PI3K\u2013Akt\u2013mTOR inhibitor. The frequency of PIK3CA mutations in ESCC has been reported to range from 2.2 to 21% [9\u201316], whereas mutations in genes in the RAS\u2013RAF pathway are very rare [15, 17, 18]. Accordingly, PIK3CA mutations may be a potential target molecule in ESCC treatment. Previous studies investigating the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in ESCC used available clinical samples obtained from either surgically resected specimens or biopsy specimens [9\u201316]. Clarifying whether PIK3CA mutations from biopsy specimens can be detected in corresponding surgically resected specimens is important for the future clinical development of ESCC treatment. Therefore, the present study examined the frequency of PIK3CA mutations and the concordance between PIK3CA mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy specimens and those detected in corresponding surgically resected specimens in patients with ESCC. Among 352 previously untreated patients with ESCC who underwent a curative-intent transthoracic esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy at the National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Japan, between January 2000 and December 2011, a total of 181 patients were enrolled according to the following selection criteria: (i) pathological T factor of at least T1b, (ii) availability of paired samples of endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens, (iii) patient age of \u226475\u00a0years, (iv) absence of past or concurrent history of cancer, (v) adequate organ function, and (vi) absence of in-hospital death following surgery. Archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of paired endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from the enrolled patients were used for DNA extraction. Thin tissue sections (4\u00a0\u03bcm) cut from an FFPE tissue block were placed on microscopic slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological examination. Five unstained tissue sections (10\u00a0\u03bcm) were also continuously cut from the same tissue block and were placed on a glass slide. The tumor histology was confirmed by a pathologist specializing in gastrointestinal cancer (SF) based on a microscopic examination of the H&E-stained slides. For the endoscopic biopsy specimens, the entire biopsy specimen was manually microdissected after confirming that the ratio of tumor cells to whole cells was >20% on slides stained with H&E. For the surgically resected specimens, a tumor area with a small amount of stromal cells where the ratio of tumor cells to whole cells was >50% on slides stained with H&E was manually microdissected (Fig.\u00a01). DNA extraction was performed using the heat-induced retrieval method, as described previously [19, 20]. PIK3CA mutations were detected using a Luminex (xMAP) technology-based multiplex gene mutation detection kit (GENOSEARCH Mu-PACK; MBL, Nagoya, Japan), which was developed prior to the present study; an optimal concordance between the kit and the conventional direct sequencing method was confirmed previously. A total of five PIK3CA mutations, including codon 542 (E542K), codon 545 (E545K), and codon 546 (E546K) in exon 9 and codon 1047 (H1047R, H1047L) in exon 20, were investigated. The lowest detection limit of the percentage of mutant allele was 5%. The protocol details have been described previously. Next-generation sequencing (NGS, Ion Ampliseq\u2122 Cancer Hotspot Panel v2; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was additionally performed using DNA obtained from the same FFPE block for cases in which the mutation status of the endoscopic biopsy specimen and the surgically resected specimen differed when assessed using the method described above. In cases where NGS was not successfully performed, DNAs were extracted from two separate tumor portions of the same FFPE block as that used in the primary analysis, and PIK3CA mutations in each portion were measured using the kit. The PIK3CA mutation frequency was determined as the proportion of specimens with a PIK3CA mutation among either all the endoscopic biopsy or all the surgically resected specimens. In addition to the mutation frequency, the overall concordance rate, positive concordance rate, negative concordance rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the endoscopic biopsy specimens, compared with the surgically resected specimens as a reference, were evaluated and presented with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). The associations between the PIK3CA mutation status and clinicopathological factors were assessed using the t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables or the Fisher\u2019s exact test for dichotomous variables. All P values were reported as two-sided, with a significance level of 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics 20 (IBM Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The clinicopathological characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown in Table\u00a01. The mean age of the patients was 62.7\u00a0years, with the majority of the patients being male (82.9%). Most of the patients had T2 or T3 disease, but patients with T1b disease (28.2%) and curatively resected T4 disease (2.2%) were included. One hundred twenty-five patients (68.5%) had lymph node metastases, while 56 (31.5%) did not. Eleven patients (6.1%) had non-regional lymph node metastases (M1) but not distant organ metastases and were judged as Stage IV. In total, 362 samples from 181 patients were included in the concordance analysis. The median amount of extracted DNA was 11,268\u00a0ng (interquartile range [IQR]: 6558\u201318,268) for the surgically resected specimens and 2452\u00a0ng (IQR: 1748\u20133352) for the biopsy specimens. For quality control, we checked the absorbance at 260\u00a0nm (A260) and 280\u00a0nm (A280), and the median A260/ A280 scores were 1.91 (IQR: 1.85\u20131.98) and 1.93 (IQR: 1.88\u20131.97) for the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens, respectively. Mutation analyses were successfully performed for both the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in all the cases. Among the endoscopic biopsy specimens, there were 11 cases with PIK3CA mutations: two with E542K, three with E545K, five with H1047R, and one with H1047L. Among the surgically resected specimens, there were 12 cases with PIK3CA mutations: one with E542K, four with E545K, six with H1047R, and one with H1047L. Overall, the PIK3CA mutation frequency based on a positive mutation status for either specimen was 7.2% (13/181, 95% CI: 3.9\u201312.0) (Table\u00a02). Figure\u00a01 shows micrographs of the ESCC case that harbored a PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) in both the biopsy and the surgically resected specimens. DNA was isolated from the entire biopsy specimen and the area marked by the solid line in the surgically resected specimen. No histological findings specific to cases with a PIK3CA mutation were observed in the present study. There were three cases with discordant results between the endoscopic biopsy and the surgically resected specimens. The correlations between clinicopathological factors and the PIK3CA mutation status as detected using DNA extracted from either the endoscopic biopsy or surgically resected specimens are presented in Table\u00a03. No clear differences were observed between the PIK3CA mutation status and the clinicopathological factors that were examined. As shown in Table\u00a04, 168 cases and 10 cases were determined to have a wild-type and a mutant-type, respectively, in both the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens. In contrast, a concordant result was not achieved in the remaining three cases. The overall concordance rate for the PIK3CA mutation status between the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens was 98.3% ([168\u2009+\u200910]/181, 95% CI: 95.2\u201399.7). The positive and negative concordance rates were 83.3% (10/12, 95% CI: 51.6\u201397.9) and 99.4% (168/169, 95% CI: 96.7\u201399.9), respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 90.9% (10/11, 95% CI: 58.7\u201399.8) and 98.8% (168/170, 95% CI: 95.8\u201399.9), respectively. The PIK3CA mutation genotypes in the endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens obtained for the ten cases that exhibited a PIK3CA mutation in both specimen types are compared in Table\u00a05. The concordance of the PIK3CA mutation genotype was 100% (10/10, 95% CI: 74%\u2013100%). The details of the three cases with a discordant PIK3CA mutation status were as follows: two cases had mutation-positive surgical specimens but exhibited a wild-type profile for their biopsy specimens (Case No. 61 and No. 132), while the opposite pattern was observed in one case (Case No. 8; Table\u00a02). We performed NGS for these three cases; however, the DNA amplification was incomplete and the sequencing was not successful in both Case No. 8 and Case No. 61. In Case No. 132, NGS revealed a PIK3CA mutation in H1047R with a mutant allele frequency of 4.5% in the surgically resected specimen; no PIK3CA mutations were detected in the endoscopic biopsy specimen. In Case No. 8 and Case No. 61, PIK3CA mutations were detected in only one portion and were not detected in the other when two separate tumor portions from the same FFPE block were analyzed (Fig.\u00a02). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the concordance of the PIK3CA mutation status between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens using FFPE tissues from patients with ESCC. In the present study, we demonstrated that, although not frequent, a certain proportion of patients with ESCC harbored PIK3CA mutations, and the mutation statuses of the two types of specimens were highly concordant. Among the five hotspot mutations assessed in the present study, E542K, E545K and E546K are located in exon 9, corresponding to the helical domain, and H1047R and H1047L are located in exon 20, corresponding to the kinase domain. The mutations in both of these domains increase the kinase activity of PI3K and activate the PI3K\u2013Akt\u2013mTOR pathway, resulting in the activation of cell signaling and the promotion of cell growth and invasion [23, 24]. The present study showed no significant association between the PIK3CA mutation status and the clinicopathological characteristics of the ESCC cases, suggesting that an examination of the clinicopathological factors prior to genetic analysis might not be capable of predicting the presence of a PIK3CA mutation. In other words, ESCC patients with a PIK3CA mutation constitute a subgroup only in terms of the applicability of a PI3K inhibitor, since emerging evidence suggests that patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer might benefit from treatment with PI3K inhibitors [8, 25]. The high overall concordance rate (98.3%) between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens observed in this study suggests that PIK3CA mutations are homogeneously distributed in the primary tumor in most cases. Although the intratumoral heterogeneity of the PIK3CA mutation status has not yet been investigated for ESCC, the results of our study are in line with the homogeneous distribution of the PIK3CA mutation status in the primary tumor observed in colorectal and breast cancers [26, 27]. In colorectal cancer, the concordance rate of the KRAS mutation status between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens is high, similar to that of the PIK3CA mutation status in ESCC demonstrated in the present study, and endoscopic biopsy specimens are used for the molecular analysis of KRAS mutations to evaluate the clinical indications for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy. These findings suggest that FFPE clinical samples obtained from endoscopic biopsies are applicable to the identification of PIK3CA mutations in ESCC. In contrast, the discordant mutation status between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens that was observed in three cases may be attributable to intratumoral heterogeneity. Because endoscopic biopsy specimens represent a limited and superficial sampling of the primary tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity can be an obstacle to establishing a precise biomarker diagnosis. Obtaining multiple endoscopic biopsy samples from primary tumors may improve the likelihood of detecting a mutation and may minimize potential mutational discordances. The PIK3CA mutation frequency of 7.2% observed in this study is based on Luminex (xMAP) technology targeting five hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene with a detection limit of 5% and is compatible with the COSMIC database published by the Sanger institute (9.5%), and with those of the previous studies ranging from 2.2 to 21% [9\u201316]. The variation in mutation frequency among these studies is thought to be mainly attributable to differences in the methods used to detect PIK3CA mutations as well as differences in the patient cohorts, with factors such as disease stage, prior therapy, and ethnicity playing major roles. The frequency of PIK3CA mutations has been reported to be 2.2%\u20137.7% using direct sequencing, 11.5%\u201321% using pyrosequencing or other high-sensitivity methods, and 4.5%\u20139.0% using NGS [9\u201312, 14\u201316, 29, 30]. The results of the present study were likely influenced by the sensitivity of the mutation testing. Collecting a sufficient number of cancer cells and excluding non-cancerous cells from biopsy specimens is difficult using manual microdissection for DNA extraction because the original size of the biopsy specimens is considerably smaller than that of the surgically resected specimens. One strategy is to use a detection method with a higher sensitivity, thereby reducing the risk of missing a relatively small fraction of cancer cells carrying a PIK3CA mutation. However, the relationship between the proportion of cancer cells with a PIK3CA mutation and biological differences has not yet been reported, and the relationship between the proportion of cancer cells with a PIK3CA mutation and differences in the response to PI3K inhibitors for any cancer type, including ESCC, remains unknown. Importantly, the present study revealed a case in which a PIK3CA mutation was observed in a biopsy specimen, but the wild-type was observed in the surgically resected specimen. This event suggests the existence of another problem in the detection of PIK3CA mutations: that is, heterogeneity. In addition to the sensitivity of mutation testing, tumor heterogeneity is also likely to influence the detection sensitivity. Since the efficacy of agents inhibiting the PI3K\u2013Akt\u2013mTOR pathway has been demonstrated clinically, further investigation of the optimal detection method and its detection limit is needed to ensure that patients who might benefit from such treatment are accurately identified. Recently, phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 clinical trials examining a number of PI3K inhibitors have begun for patients with various types of cancer [31, 32]. Among these agents, the clinical efficacy of buparlisib (BKM120), a pan-PI3K inhibitor, has been demonstrated in breast cancer patients in a phase 3 trial, and the presence of a PIK3CA mutation was shown to predict a response to this agent. Several phase 2 trials examining buparlisib in ESCC patients are also currently ongoing (registration ID: NCT01806649, UMIN000011217). Additional biomarker studies performed during these clinical trials may reveal whether the PIK3CA mutation can be used as a biomarker to predict the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in patients with ESCC. Although heterogeneity in the PIK3CA mutation status between primary tumors and corresponding lymph nodes or distant organ metastases is reportedly rare for colorectal and breast cancers, limited information is available with regard to ESCC. For the development of therapies targeting the PIK3CA mutation in patients with ESCC, the potential for heterogeneity between primary tumors and metastases must be further investigated. The detection of PIK3CA mutations could be used to define a subset of patients who may be potential candidates for treatment with inhibitors of the PI3K\u2013Akt\u2013mTOR pathway. The PIK3CA mutation status was highly concordant between endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in patients with ESCC, suggesting that endoscopic biopsy specimens are clinically applicable for the detection of PIK3CA mutations."}, "26449539": {"pmid": "26449539", "pmcid": "PMC4599789", "title": "The impact of PPAR\u03b1 activation on whole genome gene expression in human precision cut liver slices", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nStudies in mice have shown that PPAR\u03b1 is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in liver and key transcription factor involved in the adaptive response to fasting.

Transcriptomics analysis indicated that 617 genes were upregulated and 665 genes were downregulated by PPAR\u03b1 activation (q value\u2009<\u20090.05). Many genes induced by PPAR\u03b1 activation were involved in lipid metabolism (ACSL5, AGPAT9, FADS1, SLC27A4), xenobiotic metabolism (POR, ABCC2, CYP3A5) or the unfolded protein response, whereas most of the downregulated genes were involved in immune-related pathways. Among the most highly repressed genes upon PPAR\u03b1 activation were several chemokines (e.g. CXCL9-11, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL6), interferon \u03b3-induced genes (e.g. IFITM1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and numerous other immune-related genes (e.g. TLR3, NOS2, and LCN2). Comparative analysis of gene regulation by Wy14643 between human liver slices and primary human hepatocytes showed that down-regulation of gene expression by PPAR\u03b1 is much better captured by liver slices as compared to primary hepatocytes. In particular, PPAR\u03b1 activation markedly suppressed immunity/inflammation-related genes in human liver slices but not in primary hepatocytes. Finally, several putative new target genes of PPAR\u03b1 were identified that were commonly induced by PPAR\u03b1 activation in the two human liver model systems, including TSKU, RHOF, CA12 and VSIG10L.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur paper demonstrates the suitability and superiority of human liver slices over primary hepatocytes for studying the functional role of PPAR\u03b1 in human liver. Our data underscore the major role of PPAR\u03b1 in regulation of hepatic lipid and xenobiotic metabolism in human liver and reveal a marked immuno-suppressive/anti-inflammatory effect of PPAR\u03b1 in human liver slices that may be therapeutically relevant for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-1969-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n", "fulltext": "The Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) represent an important group of receptors involved in mediating the pleiotropic effects of various environmental contaminants, food components, and drugs. PPARs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and induce the expression of numerous genes by functioning as ligand-activated transcription factors. The ligands for PPARs encompass a range of synthetic compounds and endogenous lipids, including various fatty acids and eicosanoids. Three different PPAR subtypes can be distinguished: PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b4, and PPAR\u03b3, each characterized by a distinct tissue expression profile and set of functions [2, 3]. Multiple functions have been assigned to PPAR\u03b4, including roles in inflammation, lipid metabolism and cancer. Due to its ubiquitous expression pattern and diverse cellular actions, no single descriptor appropriately captures the biological function of PPAR\u03b4. The PPAR\u03b3 is known as the key transcriptional regulator that drives adipogenesis, the process by which fat cells differentiate from pre-adipocytes into mature adipose cells. Apart from adipocytes, PPAR\u03b3 is also expressed in a limited number of other cell types where it exerts anti-inflammatory actions and promotes lipid storage. By serving as the molecular target of the insulin-sensitizing drugs pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, PPAR\u03b3 is one of the key receptors in the pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes. PPAR\u03b1 is best known for its role in the liver, where it acts as the master regulator of lipid metabolism, especially during fasting [8\u201310]. Fasting is associated with dramatic changes in lipid handling in the liver, which is coordinated by PPAR\u03b1. Specifically, low and high throughput gene expression analyses have demonstrated that PPAR\u03b1 governs expression of numerous genes involved in nearly every single aspect of lipid metabolism, including fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and formation and breakdown of triglycerides and lipid droplets. Similar to other members of the PPAR family, PPAR\u03b1 is activated by a range of different fatty acids and eicosanoids [12\u201316]. In addition, PPAR\u03b1 serves as receptor for a diverse array of synthetic compounds collectively referred to as peroxisome proliferators. These include phthalates, insecticides, herbicides, surfactants, organic solvents, and hypolipidemic fibrate drugs. Fibrates have been used for several decades mainly for their ability to lower circulating triglycerides. More recently, pharmacological targeting of PPAR\u03b1 has shown promise for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Specifically, the dual PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4 agonist GFT505 was shown to improve liver dysfunction markers, decrease hepatic lipid accumulation, and reduce inflammatory gene expression in liver in several animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Furthermore, GFT505 treatment lowered liver dysfunction markers and improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in human subjects [19, 20]. Most of our insights into the physiological, toxicological and pharmacological role of PPAR\u03b1 has been derived from experiments in animals and in particular from rodent studies. These studies have revealed that PPAR\u03b1 is not only involved in the adaptive response to fasting but also mediates the hepatocarcinogenic effects of peroxisome proliferators. Whether PPAR\u03b1 exerts similar functions in human liver has been the subject of controversy, which has been fueled by the perceived lack of effect of PPAR\u03b1 agonists on peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in humans, as well as due to the presumed low expression of PPAR\u03b1 in human liver. However, more recent studies have partly refuted those notions, showing that a) PPAR\u03b1 expression is similar in mouse and human liver, b) in human hepatocytes PPAR\u03b1 governs the expression of numerous genes in various lipid metabolic pathways, including peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation [25, 26]. Nevertheless, the absence of more complex human model systems has hampered our ability to gain insight into the molecular function of PPAR\u03b1 in human liver, in particular with respect to target gene regulation. To overcome this limitation, we collected precision cut liver slices (PCLS) from human subjects and studied the effect of PPAR\u03b1 activation on gene expression using whole genome expression profiling. In contrast to primary hepatocytes, PCLS mimic the multi-cellularity and structural organization of whole liver and thus represent a superior ex-vivo model system for human liver. So far the use of PCLS for the study of nuclear receptors and specifically PPAR\u03b1 function has been limited [28\u201330]. Here we report the use of PCLS in combination with whole genome gene expression profiling to gain insight into PPAR\u03b1-mediated gene regulation in human liver. In all patients a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass was performed under general anesthesia as treatment for their morbid obesity. Patients were instructed to fasten for solid foods and liquids starting at the night before surgery. During surgery a biopsy of the liver was obtained with the help of ultrasound dissection (UltraCision\u00ae). The biopsy was collected from the liver edge. The majority of the liver biopsies collected (n\u2009=\u200915) were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C. The liver biopsies targeted for slicing (n\u2009=\u20094) were immediately placed in ice-cold oxygenated Belzer UW Cold Storage Solution (Bridge to Life Ltd, Columbia, SC, USA) and quickly transferred to our laboratory for further processing of PCLS. Only macroscopically healthy livers were used for slicing. Biopsies were provided by the biobank of the Rijnstate hospital. Collection of biopsies for research purposes into the biobank was approved by the local institutional review board on behalf of the medical ethics review committee of the Radboud University Medical Centre. All patients signed informed consent for collection of the biopsy prior to surgery. Donor characteristics of the livers used for slicing are shown in Table\u00a01. PCLS were prepared and cultured as described previously. 5\u00a0mm cylindrical liver cores were prepared with a surgical biopsy punch and sectioned to 200\u00a0\u03bcm slices using a Krumdieck tissue slicer (Alabama Research and Development, Munford, AL, USA) filled with carbonated KHB (pH\u00a07.4, supplemented with 25\u00a0mM glucose). Liver slices were incubated in William\u2019s E Medium (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin in 6-well plates at 37\u00a0\u00b0C/5\u00a0% CO2/80\u00a0% O2 under continuous shaking (70\u00a0rpm). Duplicate wells were used per donor with 3 liver slices per well. After 1\u00a0hour the media was replaced with fresh William\u2019s E Medium in the presence or absence of Wy14643 (100\u00a0\u03bcM) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, final concentration 0.1\u00a0%). This concentration was chosen based on the affinity of human PPAR\u03b1 for Wy14643. After 24\u00a0h incubation, liver slices were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for RNA isolation. The treatment of primary human hepatocytes with Wy14643 has been previously described. Briefly, human hepatocytes from six different donors were purchased from Lonza (Verviers, Belgium). Hepatocytes were isolated with two-step collagenase perfusion method. Cell viability was over 80\u00a0%. The cells were incubated for 24\u00a0h in the presence or absence of Wy14643 (50\u00a0\u03bcM) dissolved in DMSO, followed by RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA integrity number was found to be above 7.1 for all samples suggesting that the human liver slices were of good quality. The RNA integrity number is based on a digital electropherogram generated using a Agilent bioanalyzer. It describes the degree of degradation of RNA with level 10 representing completely intact RNA. RNA was reverse transcribed using a iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories BV, Veenendaal, The Netherlands). Real-time PCR was carried out using SensiMiX (Bioline) on a CFX 384 Bio-Rad thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). 36B4 was used as housekeeping gene. Primer sequences used are shown in Table\u00a02. Total RNA was purified with RNeasy Minikit columns (Qiagen) and RNA quality was assessed using RNA 6000 Nano chips on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Purified RNA (100\u00a0ng) was labeled with the Ambion WT expression kit (Invitrogen) and hybridized to an Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST array plate (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization, washing, and scanning were carried out on an Affymetrix GeneTitan platform according to the instruction by the manufacturer. Arrays were normalized using the Robust Multiarray Average method [33, 34]. Probe sets were defined according to Dai et al.. In this method probes are assigned to Entrez IDs as an unique gene identifier. The P-value for the effect of Wy14643 treatment were calculated using an Intensity-Based Moderated T-statistic (IBMT). The q-value was calculated as measure of significance for false discovery rate. The microarray data for the human liver slices were submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE71731). The microarray data for the human primary hepatocytes have been previously submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE17251). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to find enriched gene sets in the induced or suppressed genes. Genes were ranked based on the paired IBMT-statistic and subsequently analyzed for over- or underrepresentation in predefined gene sets derived from Gene Ontology, KEGG, National Cancer Institute, PFAM, Biocarta, Reactome and WikiPathways pathway databases. Only gene sets consisting of more than 15 and fewer than 500 genes were taken into account. Statistical significance of GSEA results was determined using 1000 permutations. First, we determined the relative expression level of PPAR\u03b1 in PCLS in comparison with human liver. After correcting for the housekeeping gene 36B4, mRNA levels of PPAR\u03b1 in human PCLS after 24\u00a0h incubation were about ten-fold lower as compared to snap-frozen human liver biopsies (Fig.\u00a01a). To verify that the human liver slices maintain their ability to respond to PPAR\u03b1 activation, we exposed the PCLS to 100\u00a0\u03bcM Wy14643, isolated total RNA and performed qPCR to determine the expression of a number of well-established PPAR\u03b1 target genes, including PLIN2, VLDLR, ANGPTL4, CPT1A and PDK4 (Fig.\u00a01b). All PPAR\u03b1 target genes analyzed showed significant induction following Wy14643 treatment, indicating the validity of our model to study PPAR\u03b1-mediated gene regulation. To study the effect of PPAR\u03b1 activation on whole genome gene expression, we performed microarray analysis. Wy14643-induced changes in expression of the selected PPAR\u03b1 target genes were very similar between the microarray and qPCR analysis (Fig.\u00a01c). Using a FDR q-value of 0.05 as cut-off (IBMT regularised paired t-test), the expression of 1282 genes (out of 19,654 genes on the array) was found to be significantly altered by Wy14643 treatment, of which 617 genes were upregulated and 665 genes were downregulated. The top 25 of most significantly induced genes, ranked according to statistical significance, are shown in Fig.\u00a02a. The full list is available as Additional file 1. The list includes many well-known PPAR\u03b1 target genes involved in lipid metabolism (e.g. VLDLR, ACADVL, PLIN2, ANGPTL4, CPT1A), as well as many other genes covering a wide variety of biological functions. In addition, the list includes a number of genes with unknown function. Figure\u00a02b shows the top 25 of most significantly repressed genes, many of which are related to immune function and inflammation. The full list of significantly downregulated genes is available as Additional file 2. To gain better insight into the biological function of genes regulated by PPAR\u03b1 activation in human liver slices, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Pathways related to lipid metabolism or directly involving PPAR\u03b1 featured prominently among the gene sets induced by Wy14643 (Fig.\u00a03). Also, several gene sets induced by Wy14643 were related to the unfolded protein response and UPR signaling by IRE1\u03b1 and XBP1. Finally, we observed significant enrichment of genes related to oxidative stress and xenobiotic/drug metabolism. Gene sets downregulated by PPAR\u03b1 activation were all related to immune function and inflammation, illustrating a potent anti-inflammatory/immuno-suppressive action of PPAR\u03b1 in human liver. An important goal of the present work was to test the suitability of liver slices as a model to study PPAR\u03b1 dependent gene regulation and compare it with other available model systems for human liver. To that end, we compared the whole genome expression profiles of human liver slices treated with Wy14643 with the expression profiles of primary human hepatocytes treated with Wy14643. The expression profiles of primary human hepatocytes have been previously published but were re-analyzed. The primary human hepatocytes were treated for the same duration and microarray analysis was performed in the same laboratory on the same microarray platform. The comparative analysis between primary human hepatocytes and human liver slices was performed on a common gene set of 17,351 genes. Using a statistical cut-off of P\u2009<\u20090.001 (IBMT regularised paired t-test) combined with a fold-change cut-off of 1.2, we found 347 genes to be upregulated in human liver slices, as compared to 121 genes in the hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a04a), with an overlap of 47 genes. Remarkably, whereas 401 genes were downregulated by Wy14643 in the liver slices, only 25 genes were downregulated by Wy14643 in the human hepatocytes, with an overlap of only 4 genes. The data indicate that the human liver slices are much more sensitive towards especially downregulation of gene expression by Wy14643 as compared to human hepatocytes. This notion was further supported by correlation analysis in the form of a scatter plot (Fig.\u00a04b). The upper right portion of the scatter plot was well filled (Fig.\u00a04b), reflecting common induction by Wy14643 in PCLS and primary hepatocytes, including well-known PPAR\u03b1 targets such as FABP1, PLIN2, PDK4 and ANGPTL4. In contrast, the lower left portion of the scatter plot was much less filled (Fig.\u00a04b), reflecting little agreement between PCLS and primary hepatocytes with respect to downregulation of gene expression by Wy14643. In fact, many genes were markedly downregulated by Wy14643 in the liver slices but showed no change in expression in the hepatocytes. Nearly all genes conforming to this type of expression were involved in immune-related function, as illustrated by the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Interestingly, a number of genes was explicitly induced by PPAR\u03b1 activation in primary hepatocytes but not in liver slices, including FABP3 as well as CREB3L3, a possible mediator of the stimulatory effects of PPAR\u03b1 on hepatic gene expression. Subsequent analysis by Volcano plot confirmed the overall more pronounced effect of PPAR\u03b1 activation on gene expression in liver slices as compared to primary hepatocytes and also corroborated the relatively minor down-regulation of gene expression by PPAR\u03b1 activation in primary hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a04c). To further investigate this observation, we took the 40 genes most highly induced or repressed by Wy14643 in the liver slices (P\u2009<\u20090.001 and ranked according to fold-change) and studied the response to Wy14643 of the same genes in the primary hepatocytes. Whereas the majority of genes induced by Wy14643 in the liver slices were also induced by Wy14643 in the hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a05a)\u2014as illustrated by the common induction of well-known targets such as FABP1, PLIN2, FADS1 and ANGPTL4\u2014few genes that were downregulated by Wy14643 in liver slices were also consistently downregulated by Wy14643 in primary hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a05b). Also, the magnitude of gene suppression by Wy14643 was generally much less pronounced in primary hepatocytes. Confirming the GSEA results, the majority of the most highly repressed genes were related to immunity and inflammation, including the aforementioned chemokines (CXCL9-11, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL6), interferon \u03b3-induced genes (IFITM1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and other immune-related genes (TLR3, NOS2, and LCN2). To further explore the similarity in gene regulation by Wy14643 between PCLS and primary hepatocytes, we took the enriched genes within the positively or negatively enriched gene sets \u201cIRE1\u03b1 activated chaperones\u201d, \u201cmetabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450\u201d, and \u201cInterferon alpha beta signaling\u201d (Fig.\u00a03), and compared gene expression changes between PCLS and primary hepatocytes. Induction of most genes that are part of \u201cmetabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450\u201d was more pronounced in PCLS than in primary hepatocytes but reasonably well conserved between the two model systems (Fig.\u00a06a). A limited number of genes (i.e. CYP2J2) showed higher fold-inductions in the primary hepatocytes as compared to PCLS. Induction of genes part of \u201cIRE1\u03b1 activated chaperones\u201d was generally less pronounced in comparison with genes part of \u201cmetabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450\u201d, and was relatively weakly conserved between PCLS and primary hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a06b). An exception is ACADVL. However, the inclusion of ACADVL (very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase\u2009=\u2009fatty acid oxidation) within \u201cIRE1\u03b1 activated chaperones\u201d may be questioned. Consistent with the other data showing potent downregulation of immune- and inflammation-related genes by PPAR\u03b1 activation in PCLS but not primary hepatocytes, suppression of genes part of \u201cInterferon alpha beta signaling\u201d was exclusively observed in PCLS (Fig.\u00a06c). Finally, we used the microarray data of the human primary hepatocytes and human PCLS treated with Wy14643 to generate a detailed gene map of known and putative PPAR\u03b1 target genes involved in lipid metabolic pathways (Fig.\u00a07). The map illustrates that regulation of bile acid synthesis and secretion, which is a well-established PPAR\u03b1 target pathway in mouse, was only evident in primary hepatocytes and not in liver slices. Conversely, genes involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation were clearly induced by PPAR\u03b1 activation in human liver slices but not in primary hepatocytes. The main conclusion of our study is that induction of gene expression by PPAR\u03b1 activation is generally well captured and shows significant overlap between human liver slices and primary human hepatocytes, showing consistent upregulation of genes involved in lipid and xenobiotic metabolism in the two model systems. In contrast, downregulation of gene expression by PPAR\u03b1 activation is almost exclusively observed in human liver slices. A previous study comparing mouse primary hepatocytes, mouse liver slices and mouse liver reached a similar conclusion. Overall, our data indicate that human PCLS are a superior model to study PPAR\u03b1-dependent gene regulation and PPAR\u03b1 functions in human liver. As indicated above, PPAR\u03b1 activation caused major downregulation of gene expression in human liver slices but not in primary hepatocytes. A key difference between primary hepatocytes and liver slices is that the primary hepatocyte culture consists of only hepatocytes, whereas the liver slices contain other cell types, including stellate cells and Kupffer cells. A large portion of the downregulated genes and pathways in the liver slices was found to be connected to the immune system. Genes that were highly repressed upon PPAR\u03b1 activation included several chemokines (e.g. CXCL9-11, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL6), interferon \u03b3-induced genes (e.g. IFITM1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and numerous other immune-related genes (e.g. TLR3, NOS2, and LCN2). Downregulation of gene expression is unlikely to be mediated by PPAR\u03b1 present in non-parenchymal cells, as PPAR\u03b1 expression in these cells is very low [30, 39]. Instead we prefer a scenario in which the immuno-suppressive action of PPAR\u03b1 activation in hepatocytes is dependent on (inflammatory) signals emanating from non-parenchymal cells. Indeed, downregulation of inflammatory gene expression in primary hepatocytes and mouse liver by PPAR\u03b1 activation is sensitive to the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli [40, 41]. Previously, we and others already demonstrated that Kupffer cells promote fat storage in hepatocytes by releasing inflammatory signals such as IL-1\u03b2, causing downregulation of PPAR\u03b1 gene expression [42, 43]. Overall, these data suggest that the full scope of functions of PPAR\u03b1 in hepatocytes is critically dependent on the interaction with other liver cell types. It is of interest to note that recently the anti-inflammatory action of PPAR\u03b1 in mouse liver was unequivocally attributed to the ability of PPAR\u03b1 to interact with other transcription factor pathways\u2014a property referred to as transrepression\u2014independent of the DNA-binding ability of PPAR\u03b1, as shown in the context of steatohepatitis. Despite the clear clinical efficacy of fibrates towards lowering of circulating triglycerides, the lack of peroxisome proliferation in human primary hepatocytes following PPAR\u03b1 activation has fed the idea that humans are largely insensitive to peroxisome-proliferator-induced hepatic effects and that the functional role of PPAR\u03b1 in human liver may be limited [45\u201347]. Subsequent whole genome expression profiling studies in primary human hepatocytes have mostly discounted these notions [25, 26]. We found that PPAR\u03b1 is highly expressed in human liver with Ct values ranging from 22 to 26, which is similar to the values observed in mouse liver (data not shown). Importantly, despite the markedly lower expression of PPAR\u03b1 in human PCLS as compared to human liver, activation of PPAR\u03b1 in PCLS caused pronounced upregulation or downregulation of numerous genes, including many known PPAR\u03b1 targets, strongly supporting the functionality of PPAR\u03b1 in human PCLS and giving strong credibility to an important in vivo role of PPAR\u03b1 in human liver. Recently, it was found that human liver PPAR\u03b1 gene expression correlates negatively with the severity of steatohepatitis and with measures of insulin resistance. Furthermore, histological improvement in a follow-up biopsy was associated with increased expression of PPAR\u03b1 and its target genes, suggesting that PPAR\u03b1 is involved in and may be therapeutically targeted for human steatohepatitis. The majority of gene sets enriched among the upregulated genes were related to lipid and xenobiotic metabolism, which are well-established target pathways of PPAR\u03b1. Intriguingly, several highly enriched gene sets were part of the unfolded protein response and IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 signaling, two key factors involved in governing UPR. Currently, there are no published data linking PPAR\u03b1 to IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 signaling and regulation of UPR, though it has been observed that PPAR\u03b1 is involved in regulating proteome maintenance by inducing numerous heat shock proteins. Surprisingly, recently it was demonstrated that IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 signaling leads to activation of PPAR\u03b1 via direct binding of XBP1s to the promoter of PPAR\u03b1, thereby stimulating mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation and ketogenesis. Thus, there appear to be reciprocal interactions between PPAR\u03b1 and UPR. The wider biological framework for regulation of UPR requires further clarification. Our analysis reveals differential regulation of a number of PPAR\u03b1 targets between liver slices and primary hepatocytes. For instance, VNN1 was significantly upregulated by PPAR\u03b1 activation in primary hepatocytes but showed no change in expression in liver slices. Conversely, expression of FADS2 was significantly increased in human liver slices but showed no change in primary hepatocytes. The differential regulation of specific PPAR\u03b1 target genes by Wy14643 between primary hepatocytes and liver slices may be a reflection of the different cellular context in the two models systems, with non-hepatocytes potentially exerting a stimulatory or inhibitory influence on PPAR\u03b1-dependent gene induction. However, it should be realized that for a number of genes the seemingly differential regulation may reflect a quantitative difference rather than a true qualitative difference. For example, SLC25A20 was induced significantly by 1.58-fold in primary hepatocytes as compared to a non-significant 1.34-fold induction in liver slices, barely missing the statistical significance cut-off. Our analysis yielded a number of relatively poorly characterized genes that showed a pronounced and consistent upregulation upon PPAR\u03b1 activation in the two human liver model systems. These include TSKU, RHOF, CA12 and VSIG10L. Interestingly, many genes that were found to be induced by PPAR\u03b1 in early microarray analyses and which did not have an assigned function at the time were later shown to be involved in some aspect of lipid metabolism. Accordingly, it can be hypothesized that the above mentioned genes as well as other poorly characterized genes that are commonly induced by Wy14643 in various liver model systems may be directly or indirectly connected to lipid metabolism. The comparative microarray analysis of the effect of PPAR\u03b1 activation in primary human hepatocytes and human liver slices is somewhat hampered by a number of different factors, including the use of different types of Affymetrix gene chips, different human donors, and an unequal number of biological replicates per group. However, treatments of liver slices and hepatocytes were carried out for the same duration and with the same PPAR\u03b1 agonist. Furthermore, RNA was isolated and labeled via the same technique, hybridizations were performed on the same platform by the same technician, and the microarray data were processed in parallel using the same analysis methods. On a final note, the data collected in this paper were added to a publicly available overview map of known (lipid) metabolic genes upregulated by PPAR\u03b1 in human liver (accessible via: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_alpha), which was generated largely by using published transcriptome datasets. In conclusion, our paper demonstrates the suitability and superiority of PCLS over primary human hepatocytes for studying the functional role of PPAR\u03b1 in human liver. Our data underscore the major role of PPAR\u03b1 in regulation of hepatic lipid and xenobiotic metabolism and reveal a marked immuno-suppressive/anti-inflammatory effect of PPAR\u03b1 in human liver that may be therapeutically relevant for NAFLD. The data add to our growing understanding of the critical role of PPAR\u03b1 in gene regulation in human liver."}, "25277705": {"pmid": "25277705", "pmcid": "PMC4189665", "title": "Leukemia inhibitory factor protects the lung during respiratory syncytial viral infection", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects the lung epithelium where it stimulates the production of numerous host cytokines that are associated with disease burden and acute lung injury.

To evaluate the role of LIF in the airways during RSV infection, animals were treated with neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, which enhanced RSV pathology observed with increased airspace protein content, apoptosis and airway hyperresponsiveness compared to control IgG treatment.\n\n\nConclusions\nRSV infection in the epithelium induces a network of immune factors to counter infection, primarily in a RIG-I dependent manner.

Those infected with RSV, usually infants, the elderly and immunocompromised patients but also healthy adults, develop mild to severe cough and dyspnea. Wheezing and asthma symptoms are observed following severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection. RSV infection occur frequently in the respiratory tract of individuals with an underlying lung disease, such chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A range of inflammatory responses are associated with RSV infection, such as the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, such as GRO\u03b1/CXCL1, IL-1\u03b2, IL1-RA, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8/IL-8, IL-9, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL11, IL-15, IL-18, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, CCL4/MIP-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, CCL5/RANTES, epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), GM-CSF, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). The importance of this cytokine response is underscored by the fact that increased levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL1-RA, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, G-CSF, EGF and HGF are associated with RSV infection severity. Others have found that SNPs in IL-19, IL-20, MUC5AC, TNFRSF1B, C3, CTLA4, CXCL9, IL4R, and IL-7 genes are associated with recurrent wheezing following RSV infections. Although RSV-induced cytokines have been studied extensively, the signaling mechanisms that regulate their expression and whether specific host cytokines contribute to airway injury or inflammation resolution remain incompletely understood. Pathological studies demonstrate that RSV primarily infects airway epithelial cells; therefore it is conceivable that a significant component of immune signaling associated with RSV infections originates from airway epithelial responses. Cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are expressed in these cells in response to microbial stimuli with numerous pathogen recognition receptors playing a major role in cytokine responses. Pathogen recognition receptors, such as TLRs and retinoic acid\u2013inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)-like receptors, induce major signaling cascades following viral stimulation. Indeed, the viral load of RSV correlates with RIG-I mRNA levels. TLR3, \u22127, \u22128 and \u22129 recognize nucleic acid ligands but TLR4 proteins also bind to a major viral antigen of RSV F (fusion) protein. Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) and melanoma differentiation\u2013associated protein-5 (MDA5) equally could be associated with RSV-induced immune responses. Additionally, ligands for nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD)-like receptors (NLR), such as NOD2, enhance TLR-ligand-induced activation and triggering such signaling cascades are plausible means of developing RSV-specific immunity. Therefore, RSV can induce several pathogen recognition receptors resulting in multiple host immune responses. In this study we employed in vitro and in vivo approaches to evaluate the cytokine/chemokine response to RSV infection. Normal human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and A549 cells were utilized to examine 42 cytokine responses following RSV stimuli. Several newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines (leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-\u03b2)) were induced in airways cells in vitro and in mouse lungs during a viral infection in vivo. The influence of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) signaling pathways were examined on RSV-induced cytokine levels in mice and A549 cells. The significance of LIF, an IL-6 cytokine family member, expression during RSV was also determined. LIF is primarily recognized for its ability to preserve the totipotency of embryonic stem cells and is detected in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but recently LIF was described to protect the lung from injury during pneumonia. Utilizing neutralizing anti-LIF IgG, LIF was observed to play a critical role in protecting the lung from injury during RSV infection. Our findings indicate that RSV infection induces a significant host cytokine response associated with viral clearance and airway protection. A human cytokine array was used to simultaneously detect the levels of 36 different cytokines, chemokines, and acute phase proteins in A549 cells treated with mock and RSV for 24\u00a0hours. Protein array analysis identified that a large number of cytokines are released from A549 cells upon RSV stimuli (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The most striking RSV inducible cytokines were IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1/CCL2, MIF, GRO\u03b1/CXCL1, and RANTES/CCL5 (Additional file 1: Figure S1). To complement the cytokine array analysis, multiplex analysis was performed to examine 42 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors released from A549 cells, in addition to human SAE cells. Both SAE and A549 cells released similar cytokines in response to RSV infection (Table\u00a01). In both A549 and SAE cells, RSV significantly induced IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, CXCL1, CCL11, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), G-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, CXCL10, CCL2, MIF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), TNF-\u03b1, VEGF, LIF, CCL27, CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF release into media. Interestingly, SAE cells also released IL-16, IL-18, CXCL9, CCL7 and HGF upon RSV stimulation. A549 cells differed to SAE cells in releasing IL-10, IL-12(p70), GM-CSF, CCL3, CCL4 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) upon RSV stimulation. RSV-inducible cytokines were examined following stimulation with UV-inactivated RSV in A549 cells, to determine if cytokines are induced following viral detection or viral replication. RANTES/CCL5, CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2, CCL27, LIF, MIF, CXCL10, CXCL1, CCL2, IL-6, SCF, IL-7, TNF-\u03b1 and G-CSF were all secreted following stimuli with live RSV only (Figure\u00a01). IL-8 and IFN- \u03b3 was secreted at significantly higher levels from UV-RSV treated cells compared to mock treated cells but at lower levels to live RSV (Figure\u00a01A). Therefore, RSV replication induces a plethora of immune responses in airway epithelial cells. Gene expression and BALF protein levels for MIF, LIF, CCL27, CXCL12/SDF-1\u03b1, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF were examined in wild-type (FVB/NJ) mice 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9\u00a0days post mock, RSV or UV-RSV intranasal challenge (Figure\u00a02), as these cytokines have not been reported in the literature to be RSV inducible. Increased gene expression of MIF, LIF, CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF was observed following 1\u00a0day of RSV challenge (Figure\u00a02A). RSV inducible CCL27 was only observed 5\u00a0days post challenge. UV-inactivated RSV did not alter airway expression of these cytokines (Figure\u00a02A). Multiplex or ELISA was performed to examine BALF protein levels of LIF, CCL27, CXCL12/SDF-1\u03b1, and SCF. Similarly to gene expression profiles, BALF levels of SCF, LIF, CCL27/CTAK and CXCL12/SDF-1\u03b1 were all enhanced in mice exposed to RSV infection compared to mock or UV-RSV treated animals (Figure\u00a02B). These new RSV-inducible targets represent new plausible targets for investigation in the human disease. Nasopharyngeal cells from infants with RSV infection have gene expression differences for MDA-5, RIG-1, TLR-7, and TLR-8. Since RSV infection induces a large repertoire of host cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, several of the major pathogen recognition receptors were profiled in each cell type to determine the potential regulators of the immune response to RSV infection. Therefore, qPCR and immunoblots were performed for p-IRF3(ser396), IRF3, p-TBK1(ser172), TBK-1/NAK, RIG-I, LGP2, MDA5, MAVS, LGP2, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, Trif, MyD88, IRAK1, NOD2 and \u03b2-actin. The remaining TLR genes and other NOD genes (NOD1 and NLXR1) were also profiled in both cell types. A549 and SAE cells became readily infected with RSV 24\u00a0hours after incubation (Figure\u00a03A) and had significant increases in RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, NOD2, Trif, TLR2 and TLR3 gene expression in both cell types (Figure\u00a03B). TLR1, 6 and 10 gene expressions were also enhanced in SAE cells following RSV infection. TLR4 gene expression was increased in A549s cells. Protein profiles were analyzed for several of the receptors with the greatest gene induction with RSV infection, by immunoblots. Increased cellular protein levels of RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, Trif and TLR3 were observed by immunblotting in both A549 and SAE cells (Figure\u00a03C). Utilizing densitometry analysis, no significant changes in NOD2 and TLR2 protein levels were observed in either A549 or SAE cells possibility due to lower induction of gene expression for these targets (Additional file 1: Figure S2). To investigate the activation status of receptors, downstream signaling transduction analysis was performed for the phosphorylation of IRF3, TBK1, degradation of IRAK1 and increased expression of Trif and MyD88. IRF3 and TBK1 underwent phosphorylation following RSV infection, confirming activation of these pathways (Figure\u00a03C and Additional file 1: Figure S2). Equally, increases in Trif and decreased IRAK1 levels were observed after RSV challenge (Figure\u00a03C and Additional file 1: Figure S2), further confirming that several receptors underwent activation. Due to the activation intensity of the RLR, activation of IRF3 and induction of the Trif/TLR3, in vivo studies were undertaken specifically examining the Trif and RLR pathways. Others have reported that RIG-I is essential for host immune defenses against RSV and our in vitro studies suggest that both TLR3 and RLR signaling are highly responsive to RSV. To assess the importance of RSV-induced TLR3 and RLR signaling on cytokine production, wild-type (FVB/NJ), Trif and Mavs KO mice were infected with RSV and cytokines levels were investigated by qPCR on lung tissue and multiplex analysis on BALF. Mavs KO mice were utilized as MAVS links RIG-I and MDA5 to antiviral effectors responses. Mice were exposed to RSV and euthanized days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9\u00a0days after the RSV challenge. Loss of Trif and Mavs expression in mice did not significantly alter loss in body weight following RSV infection compared to wild-type mice (Figure\u00a04A) but loss of Mavs or Trif resulted in a greater viral load in the airway tissue on day 9 following infection compared to wild-type mice (Figure\u00a04B). Cytokine release into the airways was assessed by multiplex analysis 3\u00a0days post RSV challenge and RSV infection yielded a significant release of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1/CCL2, CCL5, CCL3, CCL4, CCL11, LIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, SCF and CXCL1 into the BALF of control mice (Table\u00a02). RSV also increased gene expression of IL-27, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, MIF and SCGF-\u03b2 in the airways of control mice 1-day post RSV challenge (Table\u00a03). Loss of Mavs expression subdued RSV-induced IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN-\u03b3, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL1 release into the airways (Table\u00a02). Mavs KO mice also had significantly reduced IL-22, CXCL9, CXCL10 and MIF gene expression compared to wild-type mice (Table\u00a03). Loss of Trif expression altered the RSV induced release of IL-1\u03b2, IL-5, CXCL12 and IFN-\u03b3 (Table\u00a02) and airway gene expression of MIF, LIF and CXCL12 (Table\u00a02). RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2) and Trif were silenced in A549 cells to establish which RLR signaling was required for RSV inducible host cytokines (See Additional file 1: Figure S3 for RLR and Trif knockdown). Loss of RIG-I expression significantly decreased RSV induced IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12(p70), MCP-1/CCL2, IP-9/CXCL11, IP-10/CXCL10, TNF-\u03b1, MIF, RANTES/CCL5 and SCGF-\u03b2 (Figure\u00a05). Interestingly, SCGF-\u03b2 release was altered following loss of expression of RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 (Figure\u00a05A). CTAK/CCL27 release was only altered following silencing of MDA5 or Trif expression (Figure\u00a05A). Trif expression regulated MIF, LIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure\u00a05). Therefore, these results show that host RIG-I is the primary RLR to regulate RSV-mediated immune responses. Administration of recombinant LIF to the airways has a protective effect in response to LPS treatment, hyperoxia and to bacterial pneumonia. The functional relevance of LIF expression during a RSV infection is unknown. Administration of anti-LIF IgG resulted in RSV-infected animals losing weight faster than control IgG treated littermates (Figure\u00a06A). The total number of immune cells in the BALF was comparable between RSV treated groups (Figure\u00a06B). However, BALF cells in the animals administered anti-LIF IgG were undergoing apoptosis at a greater rate than control IgG animals (Figure\u00a06B). Inhibition of LIF signaling also subdued RSV induced airway hyperresponsiveness, demonstrated by respiratory system resistance (Rn) measurements during a methacholine dose challenge (Figure\u00a06C). Anti-LIF IgG treated mice had significantly higher protein concentration (Figure\u00a06D) in the BALF compared to infected control IgG treated mice, suggesting potentially increased damage and disruption of the epithelial cell barrier. Lung RSV burdens were not significantly affected by LIF blockade seven days following RSV challenge (Figure\u00a06E). Lung cytokine gene expression was determined by qPCR and blocking LIF signaling resulted in enhanced CXCL1, RANTES/CCL5, CXCL10/IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 and MCP-1/CCL2 compared to control IgG treated mice, 7-days post RSV infection (Figure\u00a06F). Altogether, these results suggest that LIF expression suppresses lung cell apoptosis, airway hyperresponsiveness, epithelial cell barrier damage, cytokine production and subsequently airway injury. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first evidence that MIF, LIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF are expressed during an RSV infection and LIF signaling is critical to prevent lung damage. Others and we demonstrate that a spectrum of cytokines is released to counter RSV infection but further analysis is required to determine the role of these immune responses in RSV pathology. The results of this study demonstrate that RLRs and Trif signaling pathways play major roles in the immune response to RSV infection for both inflammation induction and resolution. Interestingly, 34 of the 42 cytokines examined in A549 and SAE cells were released upon RSV stimulation. This study highlights the robust epithelial responses to RSV infection, characterizes two major signaling cascade needed to counter viral infectivity and identified the role of LIF signaling during an RSV infection. Many of the RSV-inducible cytokines described in this study have already been described in clinical samples, in vitro epithelial cell culture or in animals models, such as elevated MIG/CXCL9 levels in BALB/c mice inoculated with RSV. Importantly, increases in media or mouse BALF IL1-RA, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, CCL4/ MIP-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and CCL5/RANTES following RSV infection reflects similar observations from clinical studies. To our knowledge, we are the first to identify that RSV infection in epithelial cells and mice can induce MIF, LIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF expression and secretions. This is an important finding as each new target can potentially play a different role in RSV clearance. MIF activates lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages and plays a key role in several host immune cell responses. CTAK/CCL27 is a cytokine associated with T cell activation and migration and is elevated in severe tuberculosis cases. Recombinant protein SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 does not prevent RSV infection of Hep2 cells but SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is strongly chemotactic for lymphocytes and contributes to pulmonary fibrosis. The potential role of SCGF-\u03b2 in RSV infections is not as straightforward to elucidate but SCGF-\u03b2 can support growth of primitive hematopoietic cells and can promotes proliferation of erythroid or myeloid progenitors. SCF and its soluble receptor c-kit correlate with asthma severity. This study identified an important role for LIF in RSV infection. Therefore, identifying these new RSV inducible targets in clinical samples and their role in viral clearance may provide important insights into host responses to RSV infection. Other investigators have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of LIF expression in other models of lung injury, as it protects against lung injury. Recombinant LIF reduces cytokine expression and alters alveolar neutrophil numbers. Lif KO animals have increased expression of CXCL1, GM-CSF, RANTES/CCL5 and MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 early during an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model and reduced CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL10 at a later stage of the disease. In this study neutralizing LIF signaling enhanced CXCL1, RANTES/CCL5, CXCL10/IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 and MCP-1/CCL2 at day 7 of an RSV infection. Therefore LIF expression has the potential to regulate key factors in the immune system. Targeted overexpression of LIF in mouse airway epithelial cells significantly protects the airways during hyperoxia, with improved survival and decreased pulmonary edema. Other IL-6 family members (IL-6 and IL-11) have similar functions, which suggest that IL-6 family cytokines may collectively protect lungs from injury. LIF is a prominent STAT3-activating cytokine that facilitates tissue protection during pneumonia and plays a similar airway protective role during RSV infection. The significance of LIF expression and STAT3 activation in RSV infection represents an intriguing area for further study. LIF has been shown to regulate apoptosis with some investigators suggesting LIF acts as a pro-apoptotic mediator while others have demonstrated LIF to have anti-apoptotic potential. In this study increased apoptotic BAL cells were observed in animals administered anti-LIF IgG prior to RSV infection. Enhanced Fas, Fap, Il24, and Tnfsf15 expression is observed following LIF depletion in animals with bacterial pneumonia, which could contribute to the increased apoptosis observed here. Whether this induction of apoptosis contributes to the pathology observed in this study is unknown and requires further investigation. Epithelial damage correlates with airway hyperreactivity in asthma patients and the increased protein levels in the BALF of animals treated with anti-LIF IgG prior to RSV infection could also contribute to the enhanced airway resistance observed in these animals. LIF enhances the maintenance of stem cells, which may directly impact lung tissue regeneration and repair, similar to IL-6 activation of STAT3. These data reveal the vast biological processes of LIF signaling during RSV infection. Whether the other cytokines identified in this study also play such major roles on disease pathology needs to be addressed. Our study also reveals that Trif and RLR signaling regulate a significant proportion of the cytokines induced by RSV infection, with LIF expression sensitive to Trif activation. Prior to undertaking this study, several pathogen recognition receptors were associated with regulating the immune response against RSV infection, with RIG-I, TLR7 and TLR3 known to affect numerous cytokine responses. Several investigators characterized the RIG-I-like family proteins as critical for the detection of RSV, using human cell lines and knockout mice. RIG-I principally recognizes dsRNA; however Sendai virus defective interfering RNA and the genomic \u201cpanhandle\u201d structure of influenza virus activate RLR signaling. These \u201cpanhandle\u201d structures allow negative-strand RNA viral genomes to achieve partially double-stranded RNA, which may allow RSV to induce RLRs. Our study observed early cytokine responses following RSV infection and identified a pronounced RIG-I response, which could be lost over time following NS1 or NS2 binding to RIG-I/MDA5 as reported by others. Also, RSV induction of TLR3 is regulated by RIG-I-dependent IFN-\u03b2 secretions from infected epithelial cells, which is mediated by both IFN response-stimulated element (ISRE) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) sites in its proximal promoter. Therefore there are multiple levels of RLRs regulation in RSV infections that can both trigger RLRs responses or subsequently adapt to block RLR-mediated signaling. Recently, several investigators have utilized well-defined primary cell culture techniques to investigate viral-host interactions, which may be a closer representation of human RSV infections compared to the approach we employed here. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are not secreted by RSV-infected well-defined bronchial epithelial cells, suggesting that there could be major signaling differences in well-defined primary cell culture techniques and monolayers. However, our overall findings suggest that utilizing cell monolayers in combination with mouse models is an acceptable approach as our cytokine profile are comparable to that observed in the human disease state. In addition, our study has exposed new RSV inducible host immune response cytokines. Since we only explored epithelial cell responses in vitro, our in vivo parallel approach also validates our monolayer results and suggests that the epithelium is a significant source of initial immune responses following RSV infection. Our studies demonstrate that RSV exposure stimulates a cascade of early immune response in epithelial cells and a large number of these responses act in an RLR/Trif dependent manner. These findings also identified new cytokines that are triggered by RSV lung infection, with LIF signaling critical for the protection of the lung from injury during RSV infection. Profiling the loss and gain of the other identified cytokines (MIF, CTAK/CCL27, SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF) over the course of an RSV infection may help to decipher the relevancy of these cytokines in viral clearance and lung integrity, and represents important questions to be addressed by future studies. Human RSV strain A2 (ATCC, Manassas, VA; #VR-1540) was infected at a multiplicity of 0.1 into Hep2 cells. The virus was allowed to grow for 5\u00a0days at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The infected Hep2 monolayers were collected and the virus was released by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2500 \u00d7 g for 5\u00a0minutes at 4\u00b0C. Virus was collected by centrifuging the supernatant for 2\u00a0hours at 22000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C. Virus were suspended in culture media and snap frozen and maintained at \u221280\u00b0C. Infectious virus titers were determined on Hep2 cells by performing serial dilution of the RSV stocks and counting infected cells stained for indirect immunofluorescence with an RSV F-specific monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Additionally, plaque assays were performed as previously described on Hep2 cells using methyl cellulose overlay media and staining with 0.5\u00a0mg/ml thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma Aldrich) solution for 3\u00a0hours at 37\u00b0C. Non-infected cells were processed in the same manner as RSV infected cells and the resulting sample collection was used as a mock control. For experiments examining the effects of non-infectious RSV (UV-RSV), RSV preparations were UV-inactivated. Monolayers of human SAE cells (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) from healthy subjects and A549 cells were cultured under submerged conditions. SAE cells were used for experiments at passages 3\u20136 and at a confluency of approximately 70%. Cells were treated with RSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3 for 24\u00a0hours. Immunoreactivity assays were performed on SAE and A549 cells with polyclonal anti-RSV (Abcam; ab20745) antibodies. Cells were also treated with mock control, as described above. Additionally, A549 cells SAE cells were transfected by administering siRNA for MDA5, RIG-I, LGP2, Trif or control siRNA (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD). Trif (Ticam1) and Mavs knockout (KO) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred on to a FVB/NJ background at least 6 generations. All mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility at Mount Sinai Roosevelt Hospital. 8-week-old mice were used at the initiation point for all experiments and each experimental parameter had 10 animals/group. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine. Animals were intranasally administered 1\u00d7106 PFU RSV or mock. Animals were euthanized on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 post RSV or mock administering. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and tissues were collected for cytokine analysis. FVB/NJ mice were IP injected with 100\u00a0\u03bcg of normal goat IgG (R&D Systems) or a neutralizing goat polyclonal IgG targeting murine LIF (R&D Systems) 2\u00a0hours prior to RSV administration. Lung viral titer and RSV N copy number were determined as previously described. BALF cells were analyzed for apoptosis utilizing the LIVE/DEAD cell viability assay from Life Technologies on the Guava easyCyte flow cytometer from Millipore. All animal experiments were performed with approval from Mount Sinai Roosevelt\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval. Mouse IL-4, IL-6, IL-18, IL-22, IL-23, IL-27, CXCL1/KC, CXCL9, CXCL10/IP-10, CXCL11, MIF, TGF-\u03b2, CCL2, LIF, CXCL12, CCL27, SCGF-\u03b2, SCF, MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5 and MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 gene expression was performed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using Taqman probes (Life technologies/Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). 42 human and 26 mouse cytokines were examined in human cell media and mouse BALF, respectively, using beads assays (Bio-Rad Magnetic Cytokine Bead Panels, groups 1 and 2) with the BioRad Bio-Plex 200 system (BioRad, Hercules, CA). ELISAs were utilized to determine mouse CXCL12 (R&D systems), CCL27, SCGF-\u03b2 and SCF (Abcam) BALF levels. Cells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, centrifuged at 13,000 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0minutes and supernatants collected. Immunoblots were conducted to determine levels of p-IRF3(ser396), IRF3, p-TBK1/NAK(Ser172), TBK1/NAK, RIG-I, MDA5, LGP2, TLR2, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, Trif, MyD88, IRAK1, NOD2 and actin (all antibodies from Cell Signaling Technologies). TLRs, NOD1, NOD2, NXLR1, RIG-I, MDA5, Trif and actin expressions were determined by qPCR using Taqman probes (Life technologies/Applied Biosystems). Airway responses to methacholine (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) were assessed with the Scireq Flexivent system (Scireq, Montreal, QC, Canada) 1-week post RSV challenge and IP injection of control IgG or anti-LIF IgG. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (10\u00a0mg/kg) and paralysis was induced with 1\u00a0mg/kg pancuronium bromide IP (Sigma). The linear single-compartment model was used to assess total respiratory system resistance (Rn). Methacholine dose responses were determined. For statistical analysis, data from 10 animals or multiple separate cell experiments were pooled. Data are expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.E.M. Differences between groups of mice over time were compared by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Individual differences between groups were tested by multiple comparison and analysis using the Bonferroni post-test. Pairs of groups were compared by Student\u2019s t test (two tailed). p values for significance were set at 0.05. All analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Software (Version 5 for Mac OS X)."}, "21070631": {"pmid": "21070631", "pmcid": "PMC2994840", "title": "The dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase -1021C/T polymorphism is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in the Epistasis Project", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nThe loss of noradrenergic neurones of the locus coeruleus is a major feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

We also found an interaction between the presence of DBH -1021T and the -889TT genotype (rs1800587) of IL1A: synergy factor = 1.9 (1.2-3.1, 0.005). All these results were consistent between North Europe and North Spain.\n\n\nConclusions\nExtensive, previous evidence (reviewed here) indicates an important role for noradrenaline in the control of inflammation in the brain. Thus, the -1021T allele with presumed low activity may be associated with misregulation of inflammation, which could contribute to the onset of AD. We suggest that such misregulation is the predominant mechanism of the association we report here.\n\n", "fulltext": "The loss of noradrenergic neurones of the locus coeruleus is a striking feature of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). A gradual, moderate loss is found with ageing in healthy people, but a more dramatic loss is seen in AD. A meta-analysis showed similarly high losses of noradrenergic neurones (24 studies) as of cholinergic neurones (33 studies), with losses four times greater than those of dopaminergic cells in AD. Noradrenergic neurones project from the brainstem to innervate wide areas of the forebrain. Levels of noradrenaline (NA, norepinephrine) in target regions have also sometimes been reported lowered in ageing, e.g. in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. They have generally been found to be further reduced in AD, e.g. in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen and neocortex, although not in one small study. Both the loss of noradrenergic neurones and that of NA in target regions have been correlated with the severity of the disease. Changes in the noradrenergic system in AD are reviewed in Hermann et al 2004. Dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyses the conversion of dopamine to NA. Its activity is also reduced in postmortem hippocampus and neocortex in AD, without correlating with the loss of noradrenergic neurones. Variation in DBH activity both in serum and in CSF has been reported to be over 80% heritable. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), -1021C/T (rs1611115), has been identified as the main predictor of DBH activity in plasma. It is responsible for ~30% to ~50% of the considerable variation in such activity between people, as replicated in several different populations. The -1021T allele contributes to greatly lowered DBH activity through codominant inheritance. In view therefore of the chronic inflammation seen in the AD brain and of the anti-inflammatory role of NA, Mateo et al 2006 investigated interactions between the -1021T allele and SNPs of the regulatory regions of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, IL1A and IL6. They reported interactions between DBH -1021TT and both IL1A -889T (rs1800587) and IL6 -174GG (rs1800795). In the Epistasis Project, we recently confirmed reported interactions between the inflammation-related cytokine genes, IL6 and IL10, that contribute to the development of AD. We therefore now decided also to examine the interactions between DBH and both IL1A and IL6 in the Epistasis Project, with 1757 cases of AD and 6294 controls. In view of the age and sex differences that have been reported in brain inflammation in the elderly, and of the relevant influence of sex steroids, we also examined possible interactions of DBH with age and sex. We found an association of the low-activity DBH -1021T allele with the risk of AD. The Epistasis Project aims primarily to replicate interactions that have been reported to affect the risk of AD. Sample-sets were drawn from narrow geographical regions with relatively homogeneous, Caucasian populations, by seven AD research groups: Bonn, Bristol, Nottingham, OPTIMA (Oxford), Oviedo, Rotterdam and Santander. Sample characteristics by geographical region are given in Additional file 1: Table S1. All AD cases were diagnosed \"definite\" or \"probable\" by CERAD or NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. AD cases were sporadic, i.e. possible autosomal dominant cases were excluded, based on family history. The median ages (interquartile ranges) of AD cases were 79.0 (73.0-85.2) and of controls were 76.9 (71.3-83.0). Fuller details of our sample-sets are given elsewhere. Ethical approval was obtained by each of the participating groups (Additional file 1: Table S2). Blood samples were taken after written informed consent had been obtained from the subjects or their representatives. Genotyping for the six centres other than Rotterdam (below) was performed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, using the iPLEX Gold assay (Sequenom Inc.). Whole genome amplified DNA was used for 82% of samples; genomic DNA was used for the 18% of samples that were not suitable for whole genome amplification. A Sequenom iPLEX, designed for quality control purposes, was used to assess genotype concordance between genomic and whole genome amplified DNA for 168 individuals. Assays for all SNPs were designed using the eXTEND suite and MassARRAY Assay Design software version 3.1 (Sequenom Inc.). Samples were amplified in multiplexed PCR reactions before allele specific extension. Allelic discrimination was obtained by analysis with a MassARRAY Analyzer Compact mass spectrometer. Genotypes were automatically assigned and manually confirmed using MassArray TyperAnalyzer software version 4.0 (Sequenom Inc.). Gender markers were included in all iPLEX assays as a quality control metric for confirmation of plate/sample identity. Genotyping of DBH intron 10 A/G (rs1611131) and IL6 intron 2 A/G (rs2069837) was carried out using KASPar technology by KBioscience http://www.kbioscience.co.uk. No SNPs were imputed. Genotyping in the Rotterdam cohort was done on Version 3 Illumina-Infinium-II HumanHap550 SNP array (Illumina, San Diego, USA) and additionally, SNPs were imputed using MACH software http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/ with HapMap CEU Release 22 as a reference. The reliability of imputation was estimated for each imputed SNP with the ratio of expected and observed dosage variance (O/E ratio). Only samples with high-quality extracted DNA were genotyped; 5974 were available with good quality genotyping data; 5502 of these had reliable phenotypes. For this study, DBH exon 3 Ala197Thr (rs5320), IL1A exon 5 Ala114Ser (rs17561) and IL6 intron 2 A/G (rs2069837) were genotyped, and the other SNPs (Table 1) were imputed. We assessed associations with logistic regression models, controlling for age, gender, study centre and the \u03b54 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE\u03b54), using R Version 2.10.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The adjusted synergy factors were derived from the interaction terms in those models. Since both -1021TT and -1021TC are associated with reduced plasma DBH activity, although the former more so than the latter, we combined the two genotypes in all analyses, i.e. using a model that assumes that the -1021T allele is dominant. For reasons of power, it is usual to use minor-allele-dominant models in interaction analyses, even where a codominant model might produce a better fit. This is the almost invariable practice with the APOE\u03b54 allele. Heterogeneity among centres was controlled thus. We first fitted a model including random effect terms by centre, which accounts for correlated (clustered) observations within populations while avoiding estimating extra parameters in the regression models. We then fitted centre as a fixed effect term with six contrasts. We compared the goodness of fit of both approaches using Akaike's Information Criterion, which penalises the model's likelihood by a function of the number of parameters in the model. We found that the model with fixed effect terms by centre was preferable and used it to control for different frequencies between populations. Overdispersion was controlled by fitting generalized linear models with a quasi-binomial family with logit link. Where the overall synergy factor was significant at p < 0.05, the seven individual centres and the two geographical regions, North Europe and North Spain, were also examined. In view of the genetic differences found between North and South Europe in previous studies and in the Epistasis Project (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S1, and), we included separate analyses for North Europe and North Spain. North Europe here comprises Bonn, Bristol, Nottingham, Oxford and Rotterdam; North Spain comprises Oviedo and Santander. Power calculations were based on the observed synergy factor values. A Cox proportional hazards model, with a frailty term to account for centre differences, controlling also for sex and APOE4, was fitted to see whether the DBH -1021T allele was associated with the onset age of AD, after confirming the assumption of proportional hazards. Comparisons of allelic frequencies between North Spain and North Europe were by Fisher's exact test. Linkage disequilibrium data were estimated using the R genetics library http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/genetics/index.html. All tests of significance and power calculations were two-sided. Table 1 shows the allelic frequencies and patterns of linkage disequilibrium of the eight studied SNPs in controls. There were differences between North Europe and North Spain in allelic frequencies of five SNPs. IL1A -889C/T and exon 5 Ala114Ser were in almost 100% linkage disequilibrium. Genotype distributions of the eight SNPs in AD and controls from each of the seven centres are shown in Additional file 1: Table S3; allelic frequencies by country are given in Additional file 1: Table S4. Hardy-Weinberg analysis was performed for both cases and controls, both in the Rotterdam samples and in the samples from the other six centres, which were genotyped by the Sanger Institute. In three of these 32 analyses, the samples were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, compared with two as would be expected by chance. Those three sample-sets were all AD cases from the six centres: IL1A -889C/T (p = 0.03) and intron 6 A/C (p = 0.004), and IL6 -174G/C (p = 0.02). Since another SNP, Arg535Cys in exon 11 of DBH (rs6271), has also been reported to influence plasma DBH activity, although much less so than -1021C/T, we performed preliminary analysis of that SNP on data from six centres, i.e. excluding Rotterdam. DBH -1021TT+TC versus CC was associated with AD overall: odds ratio = 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.4, p = 0.005). There were interactions with sex and age (Table 2). The interaction with sex was significant overall and in North Europe, while that with age was significant overall and in North Spain. In view of those interactions, we stratified our analyses by age and by sex. Those stratified analyses established that the observed association of DBH -1021TT+TC with AD in the population was due to an association nearly restricted to men < 75 years old: odds ratio = 2.2 (1.4-3.3, 0.0004) (Table 3). Similar results were obtained in North Europe and North Spain (Table 4). The DBH -1021T allele was not associated with onset age of AD. We found an interaction between DBH -1021TT+TC and IL1A -889TT (Table 5): synergy factor = 1.9 (1.2-3.1, 0.005). This interaction was consistent between North Europe and North Spain. We also found a possible interaction between DBH -1021TT+TC and IL6 -174GG (Table 5), but only in North Europe: synergy factor = 1.5 (1.07-2.0, 0.02) (Table 5). We also analysed the results for DBH -1021TT+TC and IL1A -889TT when stratified by each other (Table 6). Those analyses showed that each risk factor was only associated with AD in the presence of the other factor. There were no main effects of any of these SNPs. The overall odds ratio for 197Ala homozygotes (versus carriers of one or two copies of Thr) was 1.01 (0.8-1.25, 0.9) and for intron 10 AA (versus AG+GG) was 0.97 (0.85-1.1, 0.7). However, the interaction of 197Ala homozygotes with sex was slightly stronger than that of -1021TT+TC, but only in Northern Europeans: synergy factor = 2.3 (1.4-3.9, 0.001). The only apparently significant result for intron 10 AA was an interaction with age, only in Northern Spanish, very similar to that of -1021TT+TC: synergy factor = 2.1 (1.1-3.95, 0.025). The only apparently significant result in the preliminary analysis of Arg535Cys was probably due to chance (data not shown). We have shown a clear association between the presence of the DBH -1021T allele and AD (Table 4): odds ratio for -1021TT+TC versus CC = 1.2 (1.06-1.4, 0.005), controlling for centre, age, sex and APOE \u03b54 genotype. This association was nearly restricted to men < 75 years old: 2.2 (1.4-3.3, 0.0004). The interactions with sex and age were both significant (p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively, Table 2). Table 3 shows that the effect of age was consistent between men and women and the effect of gender was consistent between the two age groups. All these results were consistent between North Europe and North Spain (Tables 2 &4). We therefore believe these associations to be real. However, large numbers will be needed to replicate these interactions (see the power estimates in Tables 2 &5). We also found a probable interaction between the presence of DBH -1021T and IL1A -889TT (Table 5), thus partially replicating Mateo et al 2006, who reported an interaction between DBH -1021TT and IL1A -889T. The synergy factors were consistent between North Europe and North Spain (Table 5). Also, each risk factor, i.e. DBH -1021T and IL1A -889TT, was only associated with AD risk in the presence of the interacting factor (Table 6), thus indicating epistasis. However, although the results were consistent in the three largest sample-sets, Rotterdam, Santander and OPTIMA, models for the smaller sample-sets proved unreliable. Thus we can only describe this interaction as probable, not definite. The IL1A -889TT genotype has been found to increase transcriptional activity in assays of promoter function. Meta-analyses have shown heterogeneity between studies, but a possible, weak association of the -889T allele with AD: odds ratio = 1.07 (0.99-1.16) (23 Sept 2010, 29 sample-sets: http://www.alzgene.org/). We also found a possible interaction between DBH -1021T and IL6 -174GG, partially replicating that between DBH -1021TT and IL6 -174GG reported by Mateo et al. However, in this case the interaction was only seen in North Europe and the results were inconsistent between the two European regions (Table 5) and between the seven centres. Thus, this apparent interaction may not be real. The only apparently significant results for the other two DBH SNPs studied in our full dataset, exon 3 Ala197Thr (rs5320) and intron 10 A/G (rs1611131), were somewhat inconsistent, precluding any firm conclusions. The -1021T allele has consistently been associated with strikingly reduced plasma DBH activity. The allele partially disrupts consensus transcriptional motifs for n-MYC and MEF-2. When DBH promoter/reporters were cotransfected with n-MYC or MEF-2, the allele affected the response. The allele is thus functional and, although we cannot assume that it has the same effect in the brain as in the plasma, we may plausibly speculate that it does also have some influence on DBH activity in the brain. DBH catalyses the conversion of dopamine to NA. The -1021C/T SNP may therefore affect levels of both catecholamines. However, although reduced levels of NA are seen in AD brain, raised levels of dopamine have generally not been found. We will therefore base the discussion below on the hypothesis that the association of the -1021T allele with AD risk is mainly due to an effect on NA levels in the brain. One likely result of changed DBH activity is misregulation of inflammation in the brain. The mechanisms that control inflammation in the brain differ from those in the periphery; an important part of the former control system is the noradrenergic network (reviewed in). The anti-inflammatory role of NA has been shown in cultured cells and rodent brains (reviewed in). Raised levels of NA reduced activation of astrocytes and microglia, and lowered expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Noradrenergic depletion increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and activation of astrocytes and microglia, and impaired microglial phagocytosis of \u03b2-amyloid. Astrocytes are considered major targets of noradrenaline in the brain (reviewed in), through their \u03b22-adrenoceptors, which activate the cyclic AMP pathway, which may lead to the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). These receptors down-regulate expression of pro-inflammatory genes (PPAR\u03b3:; PPAR\u03b4:). The importance of the cyclic AMP pathway in AD was underlined by the recent identification of the cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein as the transcription factor of most relevance to networks of AD-related genes. The inhibition of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor \u03baB, by its endogenous inhibitor, I\u03baB, may also mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of NA. However, the anti-inflammatory role of NA remains controversial and it may even have pro-inflammatory actions in certain conditions. Nevertheless, the predominant evidence suggests a mainly anti-inflammatory, regulatory role of NA in the brain. This role is weakened in ageing and seriously disrupted in AD. Thus, elderly non-demented carriers of the DBH -1021T allele with presumed low activity may be more vulnerable to low-grade inflammation in the brain. This effect has been reported to be stronger in elderly men < 80 years old, consistent with our results. In cell cultures and rodent brains, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been reported: to be induced by NA in astrocytes and neurones; to exert certain neuroprotective actions (reviewed in); and to promote synaptic plasticity and contribute to learning and memory (reviewed in). BDNF levels have been found to be decreased in the postmortem hippocampus and neocortex in AD. A large recent meta-analysis of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism found that the Met allele was associated with AD in women, but not men. Noradrenergic neurones also produce and secrete other neuromodulators and neurotrophins (reviewed in). These neurones also have roles in glial energy metabolism and the maintenance of the microvasculature and of the blood-brain barrier. NA has actions against oxidative stress and against excitotoxicity. Downstream of NA, the cyclic AMP pathway has neuroprotective and antioxidant actions in neuronal cultures. NA protects against the neurotoxicity of \u03b2-amyloid (reviewed in). However, potentially pathogenic contributions of NA to AD have also been reported. Our results support an association of the functional DBH -1021T allele with increased risk of AD in men < 75 years. Any of the above neuroprotective effects of NA (reviewed in) may influence that risk and that association. However, there is considerable evidence for the role of NA in the control of inflammation in the brain (reviewed in). In view therefore also of the likely interaction between DBH and the pro-inflammatory gene, IL1A, we suggest that the predominant, although not sole, mechanism of the above association with AD is misregulation of inflammation in the brain. There is substantial evidence that inflammation is an early, pre-clinical factor in the development of AD (reviewed in). We have previously proposed that inflammation is not only a reaction to the pathology of AD, but contributes to its onset. Our present results support that view."}, "29183288": {"pmid": "29183288", "pmcid": "PMC5706166", "title": "Arginase 1 deletion in myeloid cells affects the inflammatory response in allergic asthma, but not lung mechanics, in female mice", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\n(Over-)expression of arginase may limit local availability of arginine for nitric oxide synthesis.

Development of allergic asthma starts upon binding of inhaled allergens to their complementary IgEs, which activates IgE receptor-bearing mast cells and basophils. These cells, in turn, activate an inflammatory cascade that causes lung infiltration with eosinophils, neutrophils, alternatively activated (M2) macrophages and (TH2) lymphocytes. The inflammatory response is typically accompanied by mucus production, mucosal edema, and smooth-muscle hyperresponsiveness, which all contribute to the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) upon exposure to e.g. histamine and methacholine [1, 2]. Repeated episodes of allergic inflammation eventually lead to fibrosis and wall thickening in large and small airways (\u201cairway remodeling\u201d). Adult women suffer more often and more severely from asthma than men do (for a recent review, see:). Female (BALB/c) mice develop a more severe airway inflammation with more myeloid dendritic cells, effector T cells, alternatively activated macrophages, eosinophils, and higher concentrations of IgE and cytokines than male mice in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma models [4\u20136]. Male (C57BL/6) [7, 8] and progesterone-treated female mice, on the other hand, develop stronger AHR due to the relaxing effect of estrogens on airway smooth muscle [8, 10, 11]. Taken together, these data reveal a sex difference in mice with respect to the respiratory and immune responses to allergens (for a recent review, see). Depending on the pro-inflammatory agent, alveolar macrophages can develop into classically activated (M1) macrophages, alternatively activated M2) macrophages, and intermediate forms. Alternatively activated lung macrophages appear to be major players in the development of airway inflammation of OVA-sensitized and -challenged (OVA/OVA) mice, and are more prevalent in female than in male mice. The arginase1 (Arg1) gene is highly expressed in the cytoplasm of M2 macrophages [13, 15]. Accordingly, OVA-induced Arg1 expression is present in cells with the morphological characteristics of macrophages [16, 17]. The prominence of ARG1-containing macrophages underlies the hypothesis that arginine availability plays a key role in the development and presentation of asthma [18\u201320]. Arginase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) share, and compete for the substrate L-arginine. Since NO relaxes the smooth-muscle cells of the bronchi and blood vessels, insufficient NO production may underlie AHR. A high concentration of NO, however, promotes inflammation, mucosal swelling, and mucus secretion in the lung [21, 22]. Although the NOS enzymes have a ~500-fold higher affinity for arginine than arginase, the Vmax of arginase is ~1000-fold higher than that of NOS, which makes regional substrate depletion of arginine possible [21, 23]. Inhibition of arginine uptake into macrophages by ablation of the arginine transporter Cat2 and excess cationic proteins, such as eosinophil-derived major basic protein (MBP), also inhibits NO production, whereas pharmacological inhibition of arginase activity attenuates AHR, Arg1 expression, cell number in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and expression of the inflammatory markers IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and NOS2 [26\u201329], and induces NO-mediated smooth-muscle relaxation. Furthermore, supplementation of arginine mitigates the inflammatory airway response, increases arginase expression and activity, and elevates NOx levels [31, 32]. These findings suggest that arginase-mediated differences in substrate availability for NO synthesis may determine the clinical presentation of allergic asthma. In an earlier study, we reported that Arg1 ablation in macrophages improved peripheral lung function and decreased mRNA expression of arginine-metabolizing and -transporting genes in OVA/OVA-treated male C57Bl/6 mice, but had no effect on airway inflammation. In a similar study with Arg1 fl/fl /Tie2Cre tg/\u2212 mice, in which Arg1 exons 7 and 8 instead of exon 4 were flanked by loxP sites, Barron et al. also reported the lack of an effect of Arg1 elimination in myeloid cells on allergic lung inflammation, but found no effect on peripheral lung mechanics. However, these authors did not differentiate between male and female mice. In the present study, we examined the role of ARG1 on lung function and inflammation in OVA/OVA-treated female Arg1 fl/fl /Tie2Cre tg/\u2212 mice. We report that Arg1 ablation in the lung of female C57Bl/6 mice did not protect peripheral lung mechanics, as in male mice, but did cause a smaller increase in the expression of L-arginine-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. All animal experiments were approved by the Committee for Animal Care and Use of Maastricht University (DEC2005-146). The generation of the transgenic mice was described before. In brief: exon 4 of the mouse Arg1 gene was flanked with loxP sites and offspring were genotyped with primers Arg1-F1 and Arg1-R1 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). To ablate the floxed Arg1 allele (Arg1 fl) specifically in macrophages, Arg1 fl/fl mice were crossed with either LysM-Cre or Tie2-Cre mice. The resulting Arg fl/fl /LysM-Cre tg/\u2212 (Arg1-KOLysM) mice and their Arg fl/fl /LysM-Cre \u2212/\u2212 littermates (Arg1-Con) or Arg fl/fl /Tie2-Cre tg/\u2212 (Arg1- KOTie2) mice and Arg fl/fl /Tie2-Cre \u2212/\u2212 littermates (Arg1-Con) were analyzed for the presence of the LysM-Cre or Tie2-Cre transgene by PCR using primer pairs LysM-F and LysM-R or Tie2-F and Tie2-R, respectively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). The Cre-excised Arg1 allele (298\u00a0bp) was detected with the primers Arg1-F2 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1) and Arg1-R1. Mice were kept with 2-3 animals per filter-top cage with wood shavings as bedding on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with standard chow and water ad libitum. Mice were checked daily for their well being by dedicated personnel of the animal facility. Antigen sensitization and challenge have been described before. In brief, ten-week old female mice were injected intraperitoneally on days 0 and 14 with 10 \u03bcg of ovalbumin (OVA), grade V (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) in the presence of 1\u00a0mg/mL of alum adjuvant (Imject Alum\u00ae, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). On days 21-27, mice were exposed daily for 30\u00a0min to 1% (w/v) aerosolized OVA in PBS. Lung function was assessed 12\u00a0h after the last challenge. Groups, each containing 2-3 Arg1-Con or Arg1-KO mice pretreated with PBS or OVA (in total 7-8 mice per genotype and treatment), were tested at 3-4 different occasions to correct for any \u201csession\u201d effects. Assessment of methacholine responsiveness was carried out as previously described. Briefly, 7-8 mice per genotype and treatment were anesthetized with 80\u00a0mg/kg sodium pentobarbital and an additional 40\u00a0mg/kg 30\u00a0min later. An 18-gauge blunt needle was inserted into the trachea and connected to a mechanical small-animal ventilator (FlexiVent, Scireq, Montreal, Canada). Mice were ventilated at 200 breaths/min with a delivered tidal volume of 0.25\u00a0mL against a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3\u00a0cm H2O applied by a water trap. Lungs were challenged by delivering successively 0, 3.1, 12.5 and 50\u00a0mg/mL aerosolized methacholine (Sigma) in PBS through the tracheal cannula using an ultrasonic nebulizer during 10 deep inhalations with a tidal volume of 0.8\u00a0mL. Following each methacholine challenge, the input impedance (Zrs) of the respiratory system was measured. Parameters measured were: RN, the Newtonian airflow resistance, mostly in the conducting pulmonary airways; H, \u201ctissue elastance\u201d, or the elastic energy stored in tissues; G, \u201ctissue resistance\u201d, or viscous dissipation of energy in respiratory tissues and airflow heterogeneity. After each experiment, blood was collected from the inferior caval vein of 7-8 mice per group in heparin-coated tubes, centrifuged 3\u00a0min at 5000*g, snap-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C as described previously. Plasma OVA-specific IgE levels were determined by ELISA (MD Biosciences, M036005, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland). For the determination of plasma amino acids, 50\u00a0\u03bcL of plasma was added to 4\u00a0mg sulfosalicylic acid, vortexed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until use. Plasma amino-acid concentrations were measured as described. Following euthanasia, the left lung was filled with 10% buffered formalin (Klinipath, Deventer, The Netherlands) for 10\u00a0min at a pressure of 20\u00a0cm H2O and submersed overnight in 4% formaldehyde at room temperature prior to paraffin embedding. The right lung was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized in a liquid-nitrogen-chilled mortar, and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C as described previously. Immunostaining was performed as described previously. In brief, paraffin-embedded tissue was cut into 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E), reticulin, or Sirius red. Epitope retrieval was carried out by heating the slides for 5\u00a0min in 10\u00a0mM sodium citrate (pH\u00a06 at room temperature (RT)) at 95\u00a0\u00b0C and cooling to RT for 30\u00a0min. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with peroxidase block (DAKO, S2001, Enschede, the Netherlands) for 10\u00a0min at RT. Non-specific antibody binding was blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 30\u00a0min. After washing in PBS, slides were incubated with anti-ARG1 (Amsterdam Liver Center, AMS40.11.13), anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO; DAKO), or anti-major basic protein (MBP; kindly provided by Dr. James Lee, MT14.3.7, Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, AZ, USA) as described. After washing, sections were incubated with a 1:200 diluted biotinylated rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody (DAKO) for 45\u00a0min at RT, washed, incubated with streptavidin/HRP (Vector) for 30\u00a0min at RT, and developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) for 10\u00a0min. Sections stained for ARG1 were incubated with an AP-labeled secondary antibody (DAKO) for 45\u00a0min, developed with nitroblue-tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche, Almere, The Netherlands) dissolved in 50\u00a0mM MgSO4, 100\u00a0mM Tris\u00b7HCl (pH\u00a09.5) for 30\u00a0min, and cover-slipped with an aqueous mounting medium (DAKO). To facilitate quantification, the immunostained slides were not counterstained. Lung inflammation was assessed on H&E-stained sections. MBP and MPO images were digitized with the Pannoramic slide scanner 250 (3DHistech, Budapest, Hungary), and counted using the Pannoramic viewer software application. Color deconvolution was adjusted to detect diaminobenzidine-stained cells. Only cells with a diameter between 10 and 15\u00a0\u03bcm were included. Arginase-positive cells were counted manually in three different locations (peribronchiolar, perivenous and in the intervening parenchyma). The density of the counted cells was expressed per mm2 tissue. Tissue powder was homogenized in PBS, pH\u00a07.6, in the presence of a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche). Cytokines (CCL11 (eotaxin-1), IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3) were quantified using a Luminex \u00ae xMAP\u00ae multiplex platform, combined with a customized Milliplex\u2122 mouse chemokine/cytokine panel from Millipore\u2122, as described previously. RNA purification and quantification was performed as described previously. In brief, tissue powder was homogenized in Tri reagent (Sigma) with the Mini Bead-Beater (Biospec products, Bartlesville, OK, USA). To remove genomic DNA, RNA was precipitated with 2\u00a0M LiCl for at least 30\u00a0min at \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C. RNA integrity was checked by denaturing gel electrophoresis. RNA concentration was determined with a NanoDrop-ND-1000 spectrophotometer at 260\u00a0nm (Isogen Life Sciences, Wilmington, DE, USA). 400\u00a0ng of total RNA was transcribed using a first-strand synthesis kit (Roche). Quantitative PCR was performed in a Lightcycler 480 (Roche), using Lightcycler 480\u00ae SYBRgreen mastermix (Roche) and the following settings: denaturation: 30\u00a0s at 95\u00a0\u00b0C; annealing 30\u00a0s at 60\u00a0\u00b0C; elongation 30\u00a0s at 72\u00a0\u00b0C; 45\u00a0cycles; and a final elongation step for 5\u00a0min at 72\u00a0\u00b0C. If reverse transcriptase was omitted, no product was formed. Primary fluorescence data were quantified as described and expressed relative to that of 18S rRNA. Primer sequences are given in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously. In brief, tissue powder was homogenized in RIPA buffer (25\u00a0mM Tris\u00b7HCl (pH\u00a07.6), 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, containing Complete\u00ae cocktail (Roche). Protein concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic-acid assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Twenty-five \u03bcg protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes, using a wet transfer system (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal loading of lanes was confirmed by Ponceau S staining, followed by a wash-step with TBS (50\u00a0mM Tris, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, pH\u00a07.6) and blocking of non-specific binding with 5% skimmed milk in TBS/0.5% Tween-2. Rabbit anti-ARG1 antibody (1:200), followed by an HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody (DAKO) was used to visualize ARG1. Signal was developed with the Super Signal West Pico Substrate (Pierce) and quantified in a Fuji systems darkbox (Fuji Film Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). Groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test for PBS/OVA- versus OVA/OVA-treated, and Arg1-Con versus Arg1-KOTie2 mice, as described previously. If this nonparametric test indicated a difference, a multiple comparison of the groups was carried out. Values were considered as statistically significant if P\u2009<\u20090.05, and as indicating a trend if P\u2009<\u20090.10. The bivariate two-tailed Pearson correlation coefficients between each of the lung-function parameters, mRNA and protein concentrations, histology quantification data and plasma amino-acid concentrations were determined after combining the data from the comparable PBS/OVA and OVA/OVA groups. In the Tables, P-values of the resulting correlation coefficients were color-coded, with red indicating a P\u2009<\u20090.001, orange 0.01\u2009>\u2009P\u2009>\u20090.001, and yellow 0.05\u2009>\u2009P\u2009>\u20090.01. Arg1-KOLysM mice, Arg1- KOTie2 mice, and their Arg1-Con littermates were either sensitized-and-challenged with ovalbumin (OVA/OVA), or mock-sensitized and then challenged with ovalbumin (PBS/OVA). As expected, we found no ARG1-positive cells in the lungs of PBS/OVA-treated mice, whereas the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice contained many ARG1-positive cells (Fig.\u00a01a). ARG1-positive cells were completely absent from the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2, whereas the number of ARG1-positive cells was reduced, but not eliminated, in the lungs of similarly treated Arg1-KOLysM mice. Of note, we observed no appreciable ARG1 in the endothelial cells in PBS/OVA (Fig.\u00a01a) or OVA/OVA-treated lung blood vessels (Fig.\u00a01d). Furthermore, we did not observe any ARG1 protein or mRNA expression in the lungs of mice undergoing the PBS/OVA protocol, whereas a robust induction of ARG1 protein and mRNA expression was found in the lungs of Arg1-Con mice exposed to the OVA/OVA protocol (black columns in Figs.\u00a01b and 2). Pulmonary Arg1 mRNA and protein concentration in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice were reduced to 5\u2009\u00b1\u20092% and 2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2%, respectively, and in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOLysM mice to 20\u2009\u00b1\u20098% and 19\u2009\u00b1\u200910%, respectively, of that found in similarly treated Arg1-Con littermates (Figs.\u00a01b and 2, white columns). We also counted ARG1-positive cells surrounding bronchioles and arteries, and in parenchyma of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con and Arg1-KO Tie2 mice, and found no ARG1-positive cells in lung tissue of Arg1-KO Tie2 mice (Fig.\u00a01c). From this finding, we conclude that the floxed 4th exon of Arg1 was accessible to the Cre enzyme and that the reduction in Arg1 expression was near complete in female Arg1-KOTie2 mice (reduction to ~2%), whereas residual Arg1 expression was present in female Arg1-KOLysM mice (reduction to ~20%). Since Arg1-KOLysM mice showed an incomplete elimination of Arg1 expression and an intermediate phenotype, we limit the description of our study to Arg1-KOTie2 mice and their Arg1-Con littermates. We investigated to what extent ablation of Arg1 in the lung caused changes in the expression of arginine-metabolizing enzymes and arginine transporters. Figure\u00a02 shows that the pulmonary mRNA abundance of Arg1, Arg2, Nos2, Slc7a1, Slc7a2 and Slc7a7 was induced by the OVA/OVA protocol compared to the PBS/OVA protocol. More importantly, the induction was consistently lower in Arg1-KOTie2 than in Arg1-Con female mice subjected to the OVA/OVA protocol. As a result, OVA/OVA treatment no longer induced the expression of Arg2, Nos2, Slc7a1, Slc7a2, and Slc7a7 in Arg1-KOTie2 mice. These data clearly show that effective ablation of Arg1 expression in macrophages suppressed the induction of arginine-metabolizing enzymes and arginine transporters in the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated female mice. OVA/OVA treatment of female Arg1-Con mice caused a significant drop in the concentration of circulating arginine levels relative to their PBS/OVA-treated littermates (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2). The decline was not seen in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice, implying an effect of ARG1. In both Arg1-KOTie2 and Arg1-Con mice, OVA/OVA treatment also caused an increase in the plasma concentration of ornithine and a decline in that of glycine relative to the corresponding PBS/OVA-treated mice (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S2). As a result, the arginine bioavailability index (the ratio of arginine and ornithine plus lysine concentrations) decreased non-significantly to ~71% (P\u2009=\u20090.369) in OVA/OVA-treated Arg-Con, but remained unchanged in Arg1-KOTie2 mice. To address the question whether Arg1 ablation in the lung affects respiratory mechanics, we measured methacholine responsiveness in PBS/OVA- and OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice and their Arg1-Con littermates (Fig.\u00a03). Compared to PBS/OVA treatment, OVA/OVA treatment increased airway resistance (RN), tissue elastance (H), and tissue resistance (G) in female Arg1-Con and Arg1-KOTie2 mice, without an effect of Arg1 depletion. Collectively, these findings show that Arg1 ablation in the lung did not affect AHR in female mice. We investigated whether Arg1 ablation in the lung affected the expression of asthma-associated cytokines (Fig.\u00a04). OVA/OVA treatment increased the abundance of Il13, Il4, Il5, Ccl2, Ccl11 (Eotaxin-1), and Il10 mRNAs in Arg1-Con mice as expected, while the expression of Tnfa and Ifng remained unchanged. Furthermore, OVA/OVA treatment of Arg1-Con mice increased gene expression of respiratory epithelium-specific Muc5ac and Clca3. OVA/OVA-treated female Arg1-KOTie2 mice differed from their OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con littermates by showing a significantly lower expression of the Il13, Il4, Ccl2, Ccl11, Ifng, Muc5ac, and Clca3 mRNAs. These findings imply a direct relation between Arg1 elimination in the lung and the decreased expression of inflammatory genes in the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated mice. To determine whether Arg1 ablation in the lung had an effect on the protein concentration of pulmonary cytokines and chemokines, we measured IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, CCL11, TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 protein in extracts of whole-lung homogenates (Fig.\u00a05). Compared to PBS/OVA-treated female mice, OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con and Arg1-KOTie2 mice had increased concentrations of IL-5, CCL11 and TNF\u03b1 in their lungs, whereas the concentration of IL-4, IL-13, and IFN\u03b3 was unchanged. IL-10 was lower in OVA/OVA- than in PBS/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice and higher in OVA/OVA- treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice than in similarly treated Arg1-Con mice. Apart from IL-10, no differences in cytokine and chemokine protein concentration were found between OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con and Arg1-KOTie2 mice. We investigated whether the production of ovalbumin-specific IgE antibodies was affected by the ablation of Arg1. OVA-specific IgE was not detectable in plasma of PBS/OVA-treated mice. OVA-specific IgE levels in OVA/OVA-treated female Arg1-KOTie2 mice were reduced to ~50% of that in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice, but due to the high variance in plasma IgE concentrations this difference did not reach statistical significance (P\u2009=\u20090.14). We investigated the effect of Arg1 ablation on the OVA/OVA-induced inflammatory response in lung tissue (Fig.\u00a06). H&E-stained sections of lung tissue did not reveal any inflammatory cells in PBS/OVA-treated mice (Fig.\u00a06A). This finding was confirmed by staining the same lungs for the presence of eosinophils and neutrophils using MBP and MPO as markers, respectively (Fig.\u00a06A). As expected, many inflammatory cells were present in the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated mice, but their number was not different between female Arg1-KOTie2 mice and their Arg1-Con littermates (Fig.\u00a06B). To investigate whether there was a difference in lung remodeling between female Arg1-KOTie2 mice and their Arg1-Con littermates, we stained slides for reticulin and collagen (Sirius red), but did not detect differences either (Fig.\u00a07). To investigate whether the presence or absence of ARG1 activity affected the adaptive responses to OVA-induced asthma in a quantitatively similar way, we also investigated to what extent changes in lung-function parameters, mRNA and protein concentrations, histology quantitation and plasma amino-acid concentrations correlated in either Arg1-Con or Arg1-KOTie2 mice (Fig.\u00a08). Strikingly, lung-function parameters and mRNA concentrations in Arg1-Con females strongly corresponded within, but hardly between both categories. Noticeable exceptions were a correlation between the response of lung-function parameters H and G and the expression of Il4 mRNA, and the near absence of a correlation between the response of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Tnfa and especially Ifng, and all other mRNAs measured. Female Arg1-KOTie2 differed from Arg1-Con mice (Fig.\u00a08) by a pronounced decrease in the tightness of the correspondence between the adaptive responses that were mounted. Striking examples were the loss of correspondence between the response of H and G, and Il4 mRNA expression, and the loss of correspondence of the expression of the mRNAs of arginine transporters Slc7a7 and Slc7a1, and that of all other mRNAs. Tie2Cre-dependent deletion of Arg1 expression in myeloid cells prevented the expression of ARG1 in lung inflammatory cells of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice. Compared to female OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice, Arg1-KOTie2 mice had lower OVA-specific IgE levels and a lower expression of arginine-metabolizing or -transporting genes (Arg2, Nos2, Slc7a1, Slc7a2, and Slc7a7), of cyto- and chemokine genes (Il4, Il13, Il5, Ccl11, Ccl2, and Ifng), and of epithelial marker genes (Muc5ac and Clc3a), but Arg1 deficiency did not affect airway resistance (RN), tissue elastance (H), or tissue resistance (G). Furthermore, the tightness of the correspondence between the adaptive responses that were mounted in OVA/OVA-treated female mice were strongly reduced if these mice were unable to express Arg1 in their alveolar macrophages. Tie2Cre mice excise loxP-flanked DNA in both endothelial and early hematopoietic progenitor cells [36, 38]. As in male mice and in other studies [34, 36, 39, 40], Tie2Cre-mediated excision of Arg1 resulted in a near-complete deletion of Arg1 mRNA and protein expression in macrophages. A near-complete Arg1 excision was also observed in peritoneal macrophages of Arg1-KOTie2 mice. Importantly, we did not observe ARG1 protein in the endothelium of the pulmonary blood vessels of PBS/OVA- or OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice (Fig.\u00a01a,d), even after prolonged incubation with the alkaline-phosphatase substrate (up to 90\u00a0min). In support of this finding, most other studies found no or only minimal arginase1 protein in lung epithelium and smooth muscle [42\u201344], also after inducing allergic inflammation [45\u201347]. Based on these findings, we conclude that Arg1-KOTie2 mice can be used for the ablation of Arg1 in macrophages of allergically inflamed lungs. The near 100% efficacy of Tie2Cre-mediated excision of loxP-flanked Arg1 fl sequences contrasts with the 70-80% efficacy LysMCre-mediated Arg1 fl excision found in the present study and in our earlier study in male Arg1-KO mice. Other studies [35, 48\u201350] also report LysMCre-mediated target excision in only 50-80% of the target cells. Since the 20% remaining expression of Arg1 in the lungs of OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KOLysM mediated an intermediate phenotype between OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con and Arg1-KOTie2Cre mice, we limited our description of the effects of pulmonary Arg1 deficiency on allergic asthma to Arg1-KOTie2Cre mice. Lung mechanics were measured using the forced-oscillation technique, which yields data on airway resistance (RN) in the large airways, and on tissue elastance (H) and resistance (G) that reflect the function of the peripheral parts of the lung [51, 52]. Arg1-KOTie2 and Arg1-Con mice did not differ in any of these parameters with or without OVA/OVA treatment. This finding in female mice contrasts with our earlier observation in male mice, in which Arg1 deficiency in macrophages improved the peripheral lung mechanics parameters H and G. Since the experiments in male and female mice were carried out concurrently with mice from the same litters, the difference cannot be attributed to a session effect. However, the present finding does agree with studies in which deficiency of Arg1 in macrophages was mediated by bone-marrow transfer of constitutively Arg1-deficient stem cells or Tie2Cre-mediated elimination of Arg1 exons 7 and 8. Both studies tested, in addition to the OVA/OVA protocol, allergic inflammation in response to Aspergillus fumigatus and Schistosoma mansoni eggs in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, but did not state whether the lung function tests were carried out in male and/or female mice. The lack of an effect of Arg1 deficiency on lung mechanics is in line with a smaller increase in the expression of arginine-metabolizing and -transporting genes upon OVA/OVA treatment (Fig.\u00a02). Administration of pharmacological arginase inhibitors reduced AHR of allergen-induced asthma in both male and female mice. Whereas arginase inhibitors reduced lung inflammation in male mice [28, 29], they enhanced inflammation in female mice. Because we observed no effect on AHR and a reduced inflammatory response in Arg1-deficient lungs, the effects of systemic inhibition of arginase-1 and -2 activities apparently differ from those of a deletion of Arg1 from macrophages. Arginine analogues may exert additional effects, as NOS2 depletion or inhibition did not affect AHR, but that of NOS1- and \u22123 did [30, 54, 55]. The circulating concentration of L-arginine (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S2) was ~17% lower in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con mice than in similarly treated Arg1-KOTie2 mice, showing that Arg1 expression in hematopoietic tissue had an impact on plasma arginine. Because the concentration of plasma ornithine increased and that of citrulline was unchanged, the plasma [Arg]/([Orn]\u2009+\u2009[Cit]) index decreased, in agreement with a recent report in female BALB/c mice. Scott et al. attributed an important role to lung arginase in the increase of plasma ornithine, but we observed a similar increase in plasma ornithine in mice with and without arginase1 in their lungs. Furthermore, we did not find an increase in plasma ornithine or a decrease in the arginine availability index in OVA/OVA-treated male Arg1-Con and Arg1-KO mice, even though methacholine responsiveness was decreased by Arg1 deletion in male mice. The plasma [Arg]/([Orn]\u2009+\u2009[Lys]) index, which may reflect the availability of basic amino acids, only declined in OVA/OVA-treated female Arg1-KO mice. The question, therefore, is whether plasma arginine concentration or any plasma arginine availability index is important for respiratory function. Barron et al. suggested that the enormous perfusion of the lung, which equals the cardiac output, assures that the supply of arginine from plasma to tissue cells is hardly impaired by local arginase activity. In addition, we have recently shown that citrulline rather than arginine is the more efficient extracellular source for intracellular arginine. OVA/OVA treatment of Arg1-KO mice resulted in a similar degree of lung infiltration with inflammatory cells as seen in Arg1-Con littermates, but Il13, Il4, Il5, Ccl2, Ccl11, Ifng, Muc5ac, and Clca3 were expressed to a lesser extent in Arg1-KO Tie2 than in Arg1-Con mice. Such a coordinated transcriptional response of genes probably reflects the activity of one or more common regulatory genes or proteins. However, as far as measured, changes in mRNA abundance of the chemo- and cytokines were not reflected in the corresponding protein concentrations in lung tissue (Fig.\u00a08). This finding can be explained by the fact that cyto- and chemokines are secreted proteins, but inefficient translation of the mRNAs in Arg1-KO mice can also contribute, because posttranscriptional regulation of expression is a well-known feature of cyto- and chemokines. In OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con males, we did observe a reasonable correspondence between mRNA and protein levels in 4 out of 8 combinations measured, but this correspondence disappeared in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-KO male mice. The decline in circulating arginine concentration in OVA/OVA-treated males was similar to that observed in females. Low circulating arginine concentrations are known to affect translation by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In a parallel study, we investigated the effects of Arg1 ablation in the lung of genetically identical, similarly treated male mice. Since the biology of female mice is underreported and since females are more often affected by allergic asthma than males [4\u20136, 60], we compared the adaptive responses of Arg1-Con mice in both sexes (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S3). The OVA-specific IgE concentration was ~3-fold higher in plasma of OVA/OVA-treated female than male mice. The sex difference in IgE accumulation is well-established. Arg1 deficiency did not reduce the induction of plasma IgE concentration in males, but tended to reduce it by ~2-fold in females. However, this reduction in plasma IgE did not modify the inflammatory response in OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-deficient lungs. OVA/OVA-treated BALB/c female mice further have higher lung concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 protein [4, 6, 61] than male BALB/c mice, but we observed similar IL-4, IL-13, IL10, CCL11, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3 concentrations in OVA/OVA-treated male and female C57BL/6 mice. It is well-recognized that C57BL/6 and BALB/C mice differ in their response to OVA/OVA treatment [62, 63]. OVA/OVA-treated Arg1-Con females accumulated ~3-fold more Arg1 mRNA than similarly treated males, without showing different numbers of arginase1-positive macrophages in the lung. As far as we are aware, a sex difference in macrophage Arg1 mRNA and protein expression in OVA/OVA-treated mice has not yet been reported. Furthermore, the expression of Il4, Il13 and, to a lesser extent, Il5 was affected by Arg1 deletion in female mice only, suggesting a sex difference in the expression of M2 cytokines in OVA/OVA-treated mice. In Coxsackie virus-induced myocarditis, the ~4-fold higher Arg1 expression in macrophages of female over male mice was attributed to skewing of the macrophage polarization towards an M2 phenotype in females, and towards an M1 phenotype in males. Depending on the inducing agent, alveolar macrophages can also develop an M1, M2, or even an intermediate phenotype. These sex difference may arise because female steroid hormones promote alternative activation of macrophages, whereas testosterone inhibits the M2 phenotype [65, 66]. We also studied whether there were sex differences in the coordination of the responses to OVA/OVA treatment (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S1). Adaptive changes in methacholine responsiveness and mRNA expression (except the M1-macrophage markers Ifng and, to a lesser extent, Tnfa) correlated more strongly within their category in females than in males, whereas, as already discussed, IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, CCL11, and TNF\u03b1 protein concentrations correlated better with the corresponding mRNA concentrations and with lung function parameters H and G in males. These data imply that the respiratory responses to OVA/OVA treatment were less integrated with the inflammatory responses in female than in male mice. Complete ablation of Arg1 in the lung does not affect methacholine responsiveness or the invasion of inflammatory cells, but does change the gene-expression profile of these cells in OVA/OVA-treated female mice. Since the asthmatic responses in mice and humans show similar sex-related differences, and since ablation of Arg1 did improve peripheral lung function in male mice only, we hypothesize that treatment of asthma by modulating arginase activity in the lung will primarily benefit male patients."}, "19536134": {"pmid": "19536134", "pmcid": "PMC2699391", "title": "TAK1 is an essential regulator of BMP signalling in cartilage", "abstract": "\nTGF\u03b2 activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the MAPKKK family, controls diverse functions ranging from innate and adaptive immune system activation to vascular development and apoptosis. To analyse the in vivo function of TAK1 in cartilage, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of Tak1 driven by the collagen 2 promoter. Tak1col2 mice displayed severe chondrodysplasia with runting, impaired formation of secondary centres of ossification, and joint abnormalities including elbow dislocation and tarsal fusion. This phenotype resembled that of bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)1 and Gdf5-deficient mice. BMPR signalling was markedly impaired in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes as evidenced by reduced expression of known BMP target genes as well as reduced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinases. TAK1 mediates Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence in a mammalian system that TAK1 is required for BMP signalling and functions as an upstream activating kinase for Smad1/5/8 in addition to its known role in regulating MAP kinase pathways. Our experiments reveal an essential role for TAK1 in the morphogenesis, growth, and maintenance of cartilage.\n", "fulltext": "During endochondral ossification, mesenchymal stem cells undergo a highly organized differentiation program during which they condense and differentiate into chondrocytes, forming the template for bone formation (Kronenberg, 2003; Yoon and Lyons, 2004). Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) were originally isolated as proteins that promote ectopic cartilage and bone formation. Further studies have confirmed the role of BMPs in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during cartilage and bone formation and revealed additional functions in other developmental processes (Yoon and Lyons, 2004). For example, BMP-2 and BMP-4 are essential for the induction of ventral mesoderm formation during early mouse development. BMP family members transduce signals through heteromeric complexes of type II and type I transmembrane serine/threoine kinase receptors. Type II receptor ligation initiates the recruitment of type I receptors to form heteromeric receptor complexes that are then transphosphorylated. The type I receptors in turn initiate Smad signalling by phosphorylating the receptor-regulated Smads, R-Smad1/5/8. Once phosphorylated, R-Smads associate with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Massague, 1998). In addition to the Smad-dependent pathway, BMPs can also activate TGF\u03b2 activated kinase 1 (TAK1) leading to MKK3/6-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation. However, the mechanism by which TAK1 regulates BMP signalling in chondrocytes is largely unknown (Derynck and Zhang, 2003). TAK1, a member of the MAPKKK family, was originally identified as a key regulator of MAPK kinase activation in TGF\u03b2 and BMP signalling pathways. In Xenopus development, TAK1 mediates mesoderm induction and patterning downstream of BMP ligands. Mutations in the mouse Tak1 gene causes defects in the developing intraembryoinc vasculature and yolk sac, phenotypes similar to those caused by loss of function mutations in SMAD5, suggesting that TAK1 may be important for Smad activation downstream of BMP stimulation. However, no biochemical or in vivo functional data currently exist to support this hypothesis. Because of the early lethality of mice with a germline deletion of Tak1, cellular studies in these mice were limited to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). TAK1-deficient MEFs displayed normal activation of canonical Smads after TGF\u03b2 stimulation, despite displaying a block in NF-\u03baB and JNK activation by microbial products in the innate immune system. TAK1 also has critical functions in the regulation of adaptive immunity where it is required for antigen receptor signalling in both T cells and B cells through its regulation of NF-\u03baB and JNK activation. In addition to its role in the immune system, TAK1 functions as a key regulator of vascular development and keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and mediates survival of hematopoietic cells and hepatocytes through its regulation of NF-\u03baB and JNK activation. Given earlier studies suggesting a role for TAK1 in signalling downstream of both the BMP and TGF\u03b2 signalling pathways and the importance of these pathways for chondrocyte biology, we decided to generate mice with cartilage-specific deletion of the Tak1 gene to address the physiological roles of mammalian TAK1 in cartilage. Deletion of Tak1 in chondrocytes resulted in a dramatic runting phenotype with chondrodysplasia and joint abnormalities similar to that seen in mice deficient in BMP signalling. Biochemical analysis of TAK1-deficient chondrocytes confirmed a defect in BMP signalling that unexpectedly resulted in impaired Smad1/5/8 activation in addition to defective p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinase signalling. We provide the first evidence that TAK1 is required for the normal development and preservation of cartilage. As the expression pattern for TAK1 in cartilage is unknown, we stained for TAK1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on coronal tibial sections from a postnatal day 20 (p20) mouse (Figure 1). TAK1 staining was largely restricted to prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes. Hypertrophic chondrocytes from both the terminal growth plate and the area surrounding the secondary centre of ossification showed positive staining. Additionally, TAK1 expression in E16.5 embryos was examined. TAK1 is widely expressed in multiple embryonic cartilage tissues, including the chondroepiphyses of the long bones, the laryngeal and tracheal cartilage, and the developing frontal bone (Supplementary Figure S1). To determine the role of TAK1 in cartilage development, we generated mice lacking Tak1 in cartilage by intercrossing a Tak1 floxed-allele strain of mice with a type II collagen-cre deleter strain. IHC for TAK1 expression confirmed deletion specifically in chondrocytes, with staining absent in both the terminal growth plate and the hypertrophic chondrocytes surrounding the secondary centre of ossification (Figure 1). Animals homozygous for the floxed allele expressing the cre transgene (hereafter referred to as Tak1col2 mice) displayed severe postnatal growth retardation culminating in death by 2\u20133 weeks of age (Figure 2A). As shown in Alizarin red S/Alcian blue stained skeletal preps of p20 mice, Tak1col2 mice showed proportional shortening of the long bones of the limbs, a \u2018doming' of the cranium, malocclusion, and kyphosis of the thoracic spine (Figure 2A). Tak1col2 postnatal day 0 (p0) offspring showed a modest reduction in the length of long bones and disorganization of proliferating chondrocyte columns in the growth plate (Supplementary Figure S2A and B). Animals heterozygous for the floxed allele expressing the cre transgene showed no appreciable phenotype at any age (data not shown). Histologic analysis of coronal sections of Tak1col2 tibias confirmed a marked reduction in overall size (Figure 2B). Additionally, the formation of secondary ossification centres was delayed, with Tak1col2 mice showing only minimal vascular invasion and calcification within the secondary centre of ossification. Notably, Tak1col2 chondrocytes surrounding the secondary ossification centre progressed normally through the hypertrophic stage of differentiation (Figure 2B, arrow). To determine whether the runting observed in Tak1col2 mice is the result of a delay in endochondral ossification of long bones, we performed in situ hybridization for osteopontin on femurs from E16.5 embryos to highlight the ossified portion of the bone (Supplementary Figure S2C). As Tak1col2 embryos displayed a similar extent of ossification, it is unlikely that the runting phenotype observed postnatally is the result of defects in the early stages of endochondral ossification. The long bones of E18.5 embryos were similarly of comparable length to wild-type controls (data not shown). Finally, in situ hybridization of Collagen X\u03b1 (ColX) was performed to determine the effects of TAK1 deletion on chondrocyte maturation (Figure 2C). Although p20 mice displayed a moderate reduction in the size of the prehypertrophic/hypertrophic zone of ColX-positive chondrocytes, E16.5 and E18.5 embryos were found to display normal growth plate architecture. Taken together, these data indicate that the runting phenotype observed in Tak1col2 mice has an onset sometime between E18.5 and birth. The overall reduction in the size of the Tak1col2 chondroepiphysis could be due to increased chondrocyte apoptosis or decreased chondrocyte proliferation. To determine the relative contributions of each, Tak1col2 chondroepiphyses were stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an index of cell proliferation and by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) as a marker for apoptotic cells (Figure 2D). Tak1col2 chondroepiphyses displayed both a decrease in chondrocyte proliferation in the prehypertrophic/proliferating zone of the growth plate and an increase in the apoptosis of terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes, indicating that both mechanisms contribute to the decrease in the size of the chondroepiphysis. Radiographs revealed dislocation of the elbow and a corresponding lateral deviation of the forearm in Tak1col2 mice (Figure 2E, upper panels). The penetrance of this phenotype was \u223c80% by two weeks of age. Alizarin red/alcian blue stained skeletal preparations of the elbow showed a similar disruption of the elbow architecture with the formation of ectopic calcifications in the joint space (Figure 2E, lower panels). Tissue sections taken parallel to the long axis of the forelimb showed that this phenotype corresponds with an overgrowth of the articular cartilage on the distal humerus facing the radius (Figure 2F, upper panels). The proximal end of the radius has expanded extensively around the protruding articular cartilage of the humerus to the point of displacing the normal articulation between the ulna and the distal humerus. To determine whether the elbow phenotype observed postnatally represents a developmental defect in joint formation, we examined the elbow joint of E14.5 embryos (Figure 2F, lower panels). The distal humerus and the proximal radius were present as a single continuous skeletal element in Tak1col2 embryos, whereas control embryos showed a clear cavitation of the joint and a separation of the two skeletal elements. Cavitation of the joint between the humerus and the ulna occurred normally (data not shown). Considering that histologic analysis of the p20 elbow joint shows the presence of a joint space between the distal humerus and proximal radius, this indicates that Tak1col2 mice display a delay in cavitation of the humero-radial joint space. In addition, as shown in the high-power views of skeletal preparations (Figure 2G), the phalanges of the hindlimbs show a marked medial deviation and the tarsals show a failure to separate during development, the cuboid, lateral cuneiform, intermediate cuneiform, navicular, and calcaneus all forming a continuous skeletal element. Although the tarsals of the littermate control mouse show complete ossification by 20 days of age, the fused tarsal element of Tak1col2 mice shows incomplete ossification with a layer of Alcian blue positive cartilage surrounding the ossified centre. In contrast, the hip, shoulder, and temperomandibular joints showed no signs of developmental abnormalities (data not shown). Thus, Tak1col2 mice show both impaired growth of skeletal elements and defects in the elbow and tarsal joints. In this respect, they resemble a mixture of the tarsal and elbow abnormalities observed in GDF5-deficient mice and the long bone abnormalities present in mice lacking BMP 2/4/7. Overall phenotypic similarities between Tak1col2 mice and mice with specific deletions of multiple BMP receptor subunits in chondrocytes suggested a role for TAK1 in BMP signalling pathways. To address this possibility directly, we performed immunostaining analysis for the phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 (BMP-responsive Smads) in the proximal tibia of Tak1fl/fl and Tak1col2 mice. Phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/8 were significantly reduced in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of Tak1col2 mice (Figure 3A). Similarly, immunoblotting analysis of primary chondrocytes showed decreased basal levels of phosphorylated Smad 1/5/8 in TAK1-deficent chondrocytes derived from p0 Tak1col2 mice, as compared with littermate control chondrocytes (Figure 3B). However, Tak1 deletion did not affect the ex vivo basal phosphorylation levels of Smad2, and levels of Smad1 and Bmpr1A protein in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes were comparable to wt chondrocytes (Figure 3B). Hence, Tak1 deletion results in reduced levels of activated Smad1/5/8 in vivo implying that TAK1 may regulate BMP-responsive Smad activation (Smad1/5/8), but not TGF\u03b2-responsive Smad activation (Smad2). In addition, TAK1 appears to regulate Smad phosphorylation rather than altering expression of BMP signalling components. P38 is also known to be phosphorylated downstream of BMP stimulation; however, we were unable to determine phospho-p38 levels in cartilage in vivo by IHC, despite multiple attempts. As BMP signalling was reduced in both in vivo and ex vivo measurements of phosphorylated signalling intermediates in Tak1col2 mice, we examined expression levels of known BMP target genes in vivo. Indian hedgehog (IHH) is a key regulator of bone formation that coordinates both chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation and osteoblast differentiation (Kronenberg, 2003). Mice in which chondrocytes are genetically unable to respond to BMPs show decreased expression of IHH in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, and this is proposed as a major contributor to the limb growth retardation seen in these mice. We tested whether a similar reduction in IHH might contribute to the runting seen in Tak1col2 mice (Figure 3C, left panels). In situ hybridization of the proximal tibia with IHH probes showed a moderate decrease of IHH transcript levels in the hypertropic chondrocytes of Tak1col2 mice. To show that this reduction in IHH transcript levels resulted in a functional decrease in IHH signalling in vivo, we also performed in situ hybridization to quantify levels of the IHH target gene, patched (Figure 3C, left panels). Patched expression was reduced in both prehypertrophic chondrocytes and in the bone collar. The reduction in patched expression even outside of cartilage strongly suggests that TAK1 functions upstream of IHH expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes and not in signal transduction downstream of IHH. To confirm a functional defect in BMP signalling in vivo, we performed in situ hybridization to measure the transcript levels of Id1, a known BMP target gene in multiple systems (Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002). ID1 expression was almost completely ablated in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of Tak1col2 mice, whereas expression of type X collagen (ColX), the major extracelluar matrix marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes, was little affected by Tak1 deletion, showing only a modest reduction in the overall size of the hypertrophic zone (Figure 3C, right panels). These findings suggest that TAK1 is indispensable for the in vivo response to BMPs in the terminal growth plate. BMP signalling through Smad1/5/8 is required for the induction of several canonical BMP target genes, including Id1, Msx1, and Noggin. We analysed the induction of these BMP target genes in primary TAK1-deficient chondrocytes by using a quantitative RT\u2013PCR assay (Figure 4A). After activation by BMP2/7, wt but not TAK1-deficient chondrocytes showed an appreciable induction in levels of Id1, Msx1, and Noggin transcripts consistent with a role for TAK1 in mediating BMP-induced gene expression in chondrocytes. To facilitate further biochemical analysis, we immortalized primary chondrocytes derived from Tak1fl/fl and Tak1col2 newborn offspring by stably transfecting them with the SV40 large T antigen. Immunoblotting for TAK1 confirmed a significant reduction in TAK1 expression in Tak1col2 relative to Tak1fl/fl chondrocytes (Supplementary Figure S3A). As deletion of Tak1 by col2-cre is not 100% efficient and chondrocytes were maintained as bulk cultures rather than colonies to avoid clonal artifacts, residual TAK1 expression is present in Tak1col2 chondrocyte cultures. We tested the requirement for TAK1 in BMP or TGF\u03b2 signalling by measuring BMP/TGF\u03b2-dependent promoter activation. Cells were transfected with BMP or TGF\u03b2-responsive luciferase reporters and stimulated with BMP2/7 or TGF\u03b2 (Figure 4B and C). Tak1fl/fl chondrocytes showed approximately two-fold induction in luciferase reporter activity in response to BMP2/7, whereas Tak1col2 chondrocytes showed no response. Similarly, overexpression of a catalytically inactive TAK1 mutant (\u0394N/K63W; hereafter CI) blocked gene induction in wt chondrocytes in response to BMP2/7 (Figure 4B, right panel). TGF\u03b2-induced luciferase reporter activity was not affected by Tak1 deletion, suggesting that, in chondrocytes, TAK1 is important for BMP but not TGF\u03b2 signalling (Figure 4C). It has been reported that BMP signalling is mediated by two distinct pathways: the canonical Smad pathway and the TAK1-p38 MAP kinase pathway (Derynck and Zhang, 2003). We examined the activation of these two arms of BMP signalling in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for phospho-Smad1/5/8 and phospho-p38 (Figure 4D). In the absence of TAK1, Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation was moderately decreased, and a small, but reproducible decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated Smad proteins was detected. However, Tak1 deletion did not affect total Smad1 protein levels, implying that TAK1 regulates Smad phosphorylation rather than altering expression of Smad1/5/8 (Supplementary Figure S3C). Tak1col2 chondrocytes exhibited impaired activation of p38, Erk1/2, and Jnk1/2 MAP kinases in response to BMP2/7, implying that TAK1 may function as a key regulator of BMP-mediated MAP kinase activation (Figure 4D and E). Immunofluorescence staining for phospho-Smad1/5/8 after BMP2/7 stimulation showed that phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 was still able to translocate to the nucleus in the absence of TAK1, though the total levels of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 were decreased (Supplementary Figure S3D). Next, we examined TGF\u03b2-induced activation of the canonical Smad and MAP kinase pathway in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes by immunoblotting for phospho-Smad2 and phospho-p38 (Figure 4F). Tak1col2 cells exhibited a significant decrease in TGF\u03b2-induced p38 phosphorylation, whereas Smad2 phosphorylation occurred normally. This is consistent with earlier studies showing a requirement for TAK1 in the MAP kinase but not the canonical Smad pathway downstream of TGF\u03b2. Taken together, these results suggest that TAK1 is important for the activation of both the canonical Smad (Smad1/5/8) and MAP kinase pathways downstream of BMP2/7, whereas downstream of TGF\u03b2, TAK1 is important for the activation of p38 MAP kinase but not Smad2. The decreased levels of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation in Tak1col2 chondrocytes might be explained by a requirement for TAK1 in the association of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) complex with phosphorylated Smad1/5/8. However, immunoprecipitation analysis showed that in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes, the interaction between BMPR1A and phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 occurs normally, 5\u201315 min postinduction with BMP2/7 (Supplementary Figure S3E). Thus, Tak1 deletion does not affect the stability of the interaction between the BMPR complex and phosphorylated Smad proteins. To test whether TAK1 interacts with Smad proteins, HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged Smad proteins along with HA-tagged TAK1 (Supplementary Figure S4A). When overexpressed, Smad1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 all interact with TAK1, although the Smad4 association was weak. To test for direct interactions between TAK1 and BMP-responsive Smad proteins, we performed a Flag pull down analysis with Flag-tagged Smad proteins and in vitro translated, 35S-labelled TAK1 (Figure 5A, upper panel). Under these conditions, TAK1 interacted directly with Smad1, 5, and 8 and this likely occurs through the conserved MH2 domain of Smad proteins as shown in an earlier study. The TAK1 domain located between aa 200 and 300 is required for binding to Smad1 (Supplementary Figure S4B). This was confirmed by a GST pull down assay with GST-Smad1 and in vitro translated, 35S-labelled TAK1 (Figure 5A, lower panel). Importantly, analysis of endogenous TAK1 and Smad1 showed an association 5\u201315 min after stimulation with BMP2/7, kinetics similar to the rate of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation indicating that TAK1 interacts with BMP-responsive Smad proteins in chondrocytes in an inducible manner (Figure 5B). In contrast, catalytically inactive TAK1 did not associate with Smad 1/5/8 although it did interact with TAB1, a known TAK1-binding protein (Supplementary Figure S4C and D). These results indicate that the kinase activity of TAK1 is necessary for its interactions with Smad proteins. As TAK1 interacts directly with Smad proteins after BMP stimulation, we tested whether TAK1 is able to induce phosphorylation of Smad proteins. In vitro kinase assays using HA-TAK1 immunoprecipitates from HEK293 cells transfected with HA-tagged constitutively active TAK1 (\u0394N) or catalytically inactive TAK1 (CI; \u0394N/K63W) were incubated with recombinant GST, GST-Smad1, -Smad2, or -Mkk6 (Figure 5C). As expected, GST-Mkk6, a known TAK1 substrate, was phosphorylated by HA-TAK1 (\u0394N), but not HA-TAK1 (CI). Notably, GST-Smad1 and -Smad2 were also both phosphorylated by HA-TAK1 (\u0394N) but not HA-TAK1 (CI), indicating that TAK1 can phosphorylate Smad proteins. Given that TAK1 can bind and phosphorylate both Smad1 and Smad2, it may be important for Smad phosphorylation in both BMP and TGF\u03b2 signalling pathways. To test this hypothesis, we analysed TAK1-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1 and 2 after BMP and TGF\u03b2 stimulation using in vitro kinase assays (Figure 5D). Surprisingly, little GST-Smad2 phosphorylation was detected in response to TGF\u03b2, whereas GST-Smad1 was strongly phosphorylated with peak activity 15 min postinduction by BMP2/7. However, GST-Mkk6 was equivalently phosphorylated after stimulation with either TGF\u03b2 or BMP2/7, indicating that TAK1 is similarly activated downstream of TGF\u03b2 and BMP2/7 signalling (Figure 5E). Thus, differences in the intrinsic activation status of TAK1 are unlikely to account for the selective phorphorylation of Smad1 and not Smad2 by endogenous TAK1. This may explain why the Tak1col2 mice bear a much greater resemblance to mice with defects in BMP but not TGF\u03b2 signalling in chondrocytes. Coomassie blue staining showed a slight mobility shift of the isolated Smad1 protein when co-expressed with TAK1, implying that TAK1 induces posttranslational modification of Smad1 (Figure 6A). To identify the TAK1-mediated phosphorylation sites in Smad1, we performed mass spectrometry analysis. HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-Smad1 together with either vector control or constitutively active TAK1 (\u0394N), and immunoprecipitated using Flag-conjugated agarose. As Smad1 interacts with TAK1 through its MH2 domain, phosphopeptide analysis initially focused on this region (Figure 6A, lower panel). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that, when co-expressed with TAK1, Smad1 is phosphorylated at C-terminal serines (S463 and S465), the same phosphorylation sites targeted by the BMP type I receptor kinase (Tables I and II). This is consistent with the immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 (S463/S465, S426/S428) showing that Flag-Smad1 is phosphorylated at C-terminal serines in the presence of HA-TAK1 (\u0394N) (Figure 6B). BMPR1 was not detectable in co-immunoprecipitations with HA-TAK1 (\u0394N), making it unlikely that the S463/S465 phosphorylation observed was mediated by BMPR1 that co-purified with HA-TAK1 (Supplementary Figure S4E). TAK1-induced phosphorylation at C-terminal serines was weaker than phosphorylation by constitutively active BMPR1B (Q203D), implying that BMPR1B is able to phosphorylate Smad1 at C-terminal serines more efficiently than TAK1 (Figure 6B). To test the ability of TAK1 to induce Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serines, we generated recombinant GST-Smad1 containing the SSVS to AAVA mutation, which is a poor substrate for the BMP type I receptor kinase. Mutation of the S463/S465 site to AAVA led to a moderate decrease in TAK1 (\u0394N)-induced phosphorylation, although it significantly decreased BMPR1B (Q203D)-induced phosphorylation (Figure 6C and D). This is consistent with immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 (S463/S465, S426/S428) showing that the phosphorylation level of Smad1 at S463/S465 was moderately decreased in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes in response to BMP2/7 (Figure 4D). Similarly, the AAVA mutated Smad1 only showed a partial reduction in the level of phosphorylation by the endogenous TAK1 complex immunoprecipitated from the wt chondrocyte line after BMP stimulation (Figure 6D). Thus, these results strongly suggest that TAK1 may phosphorylate Smad1 at sites in addition to S463/S465. To test the absolute requirement for TAK1 kinase activity in BMP signalling, TAK1-deficient chondrocytes were reconstituted with exogenous TAK1 using a lentiviral system (Figure 7). Tak1col2 chondrocytes were infected with either wt or CI TAK1 lentiviruses and selected in puromycin-containing medium. As expected, TAK1 (WT)-expressing cells exhibited an increase in Smad1/5/8 and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in response to BMP2/7. In contrast, exogenous expression of catalytically inactive TAK1 (CI) failed to restore Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation (Figure 7A). The functional response to BMP2/7 in Tak1col2 chondrocytes could also be reconstituted by TAK1 expression. Exogenous expression of TAK1 (WT) significantly increased ID1 expression after BMP2/7 stimulation of Tak1col2 chondrocytes (Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002), whereas little induction of ID1 was detected in vector or TAK1 (CI)-expressing cells (Figure 7B). Therefore, TAK1 activates both the canonical Smad and the p38 MAP kinase pathways through its kinase activity, and this activity is important for the transcriptional response to BMP2/7. TAK1, a MAP3K kinase family member, was originally identified as a key mediator of the p38 MAPK kinase pathway that was activated downstream of both TGF\u03b2 and BMP4. However, with the exception of a study in Xenopus demonstrating that TAK1 mediates ventral mesoderm induction and patterning downstream of BMPs, the in vivo role of TAK1 in BMP signalling remained unexplored. The involvement of BMPs in growth, patterning, and maintenance of cartilage made this organ system an attractive in vivo model to explore. Early embryonic lethality in germline TAK1-deficient mice precluded genetic studies of mammalian TAK1 in skeletal biology. We took advantage of an earlier generated strain of mice with a conditional deletion of Tak1 to generate mice lacking Tak1 selectively in chondrocytes. TAK1 deficiency in chondrocytes caused a severe chondrodysplasia with runting, elbow dislocation, cartilage overgrowth, and tarsal fusion, abnormalities that are variously present in mice lacking BMPR1B, GDF5, or multiple BMP ligands. The observation that the Tak1 phenotype represents a mixture of BMP-associated phenotypes indicates that TAK1 serves an essential function downstream of multiple BMP family members. Signal transduction downstream of BMPs can be considered as a dichotomy between the activation of MAP kinase pathways and the canonical Smads (Derynck and Zhang, 2003; Yoon and Lyons, 2004). Earlier, TAK1 was largely considered as a proximal activator of the MAP kinase arm of signalling, without a clear role in Smad activation. However, the reduction in both Smad and p38/Jnk/Erk MAP kinase responses in Tak1col2 chondrocytes indicates that TAK1 has an important but distinct function in both signalling arms downstream of BMP2/7. The Tak1col2 phenotype is not identical to that of any single member of the BMP signalling pathway. The degree of runting and the delay in secondary ossification centre formation in Tak1col2 mice resemble that seen in mice with a conditional deletion of Smad4 in chondrocytes. Additionally, the magnitude of IHH downregulation in Tak1col2 hypertrophic chondrocytes is similar to that observed in both Smad4 and BMPR1A conditional knockout mice. Hence, these aspects of the Tak1col2 phenotype may be due to dysregulation of Smad signalling downstream of BMPs. However, mice with a conditional deletion of Smad4 in chondrocytes do not display elbow dislocation or fusion of the tarsal bones. These features are reminiscent of the defects seen in BMPR1B and GDF5 knockout mice, suggesting that the GDF5 to BMPR1B signalling module that maintains the integrity of the elbow joint also uses TAK1 as a necessary signalling intermediate. The penetrance of the elbow dislocation phenotype in TAK1-deficient mice is higher (\u223c80% by 2 weeks of age) than that observed in BMPR1B-deficient mice (23%). Combined with the earlier onset of the dislocation phenotype in TAK1-deficient mice, this finding suggests that BMPR1B may have partial functional redundancy with another receptor subunit acting upstream of TAK1. This receptor subunit is highly likely to be BMPR1A, but the severe cartilage defects in mice lacking both BMPR1A/B in cartilage make analysis of this redundancy difficult in vivo. This similarity between GDF5 and Tak1col2 phenotypes is further supported by the finding of tarsal bone fusion. However, mice with a spontaneous loss-of-function mutation in GDF5 show only a slight shortening of the long bones, implicating other BMP family members upstream of TAK1. Additionally, although GDF5 mutant mice do have fusion of the tarsal bones, they do not display the marked medial deviation of the hindlimb phalanges seen in Tak1col2 mice, indicating that this deviation is not simply secondary to ankle bone malformation. As these aspects of the phenotype (elbow dislocation, tarsal fusion) are present in GDF5 and BMPR1B but not Smad4-deficent mice, they may be MAP kinase dependent. However, the role of the MAP kinase pathway in postnatal cartilage growth and development has not been explored as thoroughly in vivo as the role of the Smad pathway, making it difficult to examine the contribution of MAP kinase signalling to the Tak1col2 phenotype. The TAK1 phenotype is notable for the absence of specific features of mice genetically unable to respond to TGF\u03b2 in chondrocytes. In particular, mice with a deletion of TGF\u03b2R2 in chondrocytes display abnormalities in the axial skeleton, including bifurcation of the xiphoid process, abnormal morphogenesis of the C1, C2 vertebrae, and malformation of the vertebral transverse processes, which are not present in Tak1col2 mice. In our study, analysis of primary and transformed chondrocytes revealed that TAK1 is able to phosphorylate Smad proteins in response to BMP2/7 but not TGF\u03b2. However, Smad1 (a BMP-responsive Smad) and Smad2 (a TGF\u03b2-responsive Smad) can both be phosphorylated by overexpressed, constitutively active TAK1, indicating that TAK1 has an equivalent intrinsic ability to phosphorylate both substrates. Additionally, phosphorylation of MKK6 by TAK1 is similar after BMP2/7 and TGF\u03b2 stimulation, indicating that the activation of TAK1 kinase is similar downstream of each ligand. Recently, it has been reported that the activated TGF\u03b2 receptor 1 recruits TRAF6 to the receptor complex and subsequently induces ubiquitination of TRAF6 and promotes TRAF6 interaction with TAK1, thereby resulting in activation of p38/JNK MAP kinases. However, the mechanism of TAK1-mediated p38 MAP kinase activation downstream of BMP signalling has not been explored. Given these observations, the most likely explanation for the selective involvement of TAK1 in Smad phosphorylation downstream of BMP but not TGF\u03b2 stimulation is that another component of the TGF\u03b2 receptor complex acts to block TAK1 access to Smad2. For such a mechanism to be effective, the active fraction of TAK1 must be sequestered at the TGF\u03b2 receptor complex. Likewise, either the BMP receptor complex is permissive for TAK1 and Smad1/5/8 interactions or TAK1 is released from the receptor complex to phosphorylate Smad1/5/8 in the cytosol. The finding that phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/8 at C-terminal serines were reduced both in vivo and in vitro in response to BMP stimulation suggested an unexpected role for TAK1 in regulating the activity of BMP-responsive Smads. As the immunoprecipitated TAK1 protein was able to phosphorylate Smad1 protein in in vitro kinase assays, we undertook a systematic analysis of Smad1 phosphorylation using a mass spectrometry approach (Figure 6A; Tables I and II). This analysis showed that phosphorylation of Smad1 at the C-terminal serines S463/S465 was increased by co-expression of constitutively active TAK1. Mutation of this site confirmed this finding, showing an approximately 40% reduction in TAK1-mediated phosphorylation. Additionally, our in vivo and in vitro data show that S463/S465 phosphorylation was moderately decreased in both hypertrophic chondrocytes and the Tak1col2 chondrocyte line after BMP2/7 stimulation (Figures 3A, B and 4D). As S463/S465 phosphorylation is critical for Smad1 activity, a reduction in S463/S465 phosphorylation would explain the reduction in BMP signalling observed both in vivo and in vitro in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes. This implies that TAK1 may have a function in amplification of the signal from the BMP receptor by increasing phosphorylation at the same S463/S465 site targeted by the BMPR1 kinase activity. The partial reduction in Smad1 phosphorylation observed in S463/S465 mutated Smad1 (AAVA Smad1) indicates that additional sites are phosphorylated by TAK1 (Figure 6C and E). Further, the absence of detectable phosphorylation sites in the MH1 and MH2 domain by the phosphopeptide analysis suggests that these additional sites might lie inside the linker region. Unfortunately, the lack of Trypsin and Lys-C cleavable sites precluded finding phosphorylation site in this region. It has been reported that the Smad1 linker region contains four MAPK phosphorylation sites and two Gsk3\u03b2 sites and MAPK and Gsk3\u03b2 phosphorylation of the linker region restricts Smad1 activity by recruiting the ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, leading to degradation of Smad1. As phosphorylation of these sites is important for the regulation of FGF/BMP pathway crosstalk, it will be interesting to test the possibility that TAK1 is involved in the regulation of BMP signalling by FGF through its phosphorylation of those linker phosphorylation sites. However, the critical role of TAK1 in BMP signalling precludes an analysis of this crosstalk until a component of the MAPK cascade downstream of TAK1-mediated BMP signalling is identified. Analysis of the associations among TAK1, BMPR1A, and the adaptor proteins XIAP and TAB1 suggests a mechanism for TAK1 recruitment to the BMP receptor complex. In BMP signalling pathways, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) functions as an adapter protein that connects the BMPR complex with the TAB1\u2013TAK1 complex through its association with TAB1 and BMPR1A. Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that BMPR1A binds to XIAP, XIAP in turn mediates the interaction between BMPR1A and TAB1, and TAB1 mediates the interaction between XIAP and TAK1 (Supplementary Figure S5A\u2013C). As the interaction of BMPR1A with XIAP occurs normally in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes, TAK1 functions downstream of the BMPR\u2013XIAP complex (Supplementary Figure S5D). Hence, we propose a model wherein BMPR1A is connected to the TAK1 complex (TAK1\u2013TAB1) through XIAP, and TAK1 mediates canonical Smad and p38 MAP kinase activation downstream of BMP signalling (Figure 7C). On BMP stimulation, the activated BMPRI recruits Smad 1/5/8 directly, and the TAK1 complex (TAK1\u2013TAB1) is recruited to the receptor by the adaptor XIAP. R-Smads can be phosphoryated by the type I BMPR and TAK1 at either S463/465 (Smad1/5) or S426/428 (Smad8). Activated R-Smads, in turn, bind to Smad4, translocate into the nucleus, and mediate BMP-responsive gene expression (i.e. IHH, ID1, Noggin, and Msx1). Alternatively, the TAK1 complex can activate the MKK3/6-p38 MAP kinase pathway. Our results do not exclude the possibility that TAK1 may participate in the regulation of other BMP signalling intermediates and other signalling pathways. Indeed, in TAK1-deficient chondrocytes, a decreased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was detected in response to TGF\u03b2, and phosphorylation of JNK and ERK MAP kinases and I\u03baB\u03b1 was also decreased after BMP stimulation (Figure 4D and F and data not shown). HEK 293 cells (human kidney embryonic cells) were purchased from ATCC and cultured in DMEM medium (Cellgro) containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Primary and immortalized chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM-F12 medium (Cellgro) containing 2% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, Na-Selenate and transferrin. Plasmids for HA-ALK3, Myc-XIAP and HA-TAK1 (WT, \u0394N, and \u0394N/K63W), SV40 large T Ag, Myc-tagged TAK1 mutants, and GST-Smad1, 2, 3, and 4 were the gifts of Drs Hiroshi Shibuya, Kunihiro Matsumoto, Jun Ninomiya-Tsuji, Nobuyuki Tanaka, Xia-fan Wang, Ki-young Lee, and Zhijie Chang, respectively. Plasmid for LPCX-BMPR1B (Q203D) was purchased from Addgene. GST-Smad1 (AAVA) and TAK1 (WT and \u0394N/K63W) cDNAs were PCR amplified and cloned into pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia) and pHASE/PGK-PURO lentiviral vector, respectively. Antibodies used were anti-TAK1 (Millipore); anti-HA, anti-c-Myc, and anti-BMPR-1A (Santa Cruz); anti-Smad2, anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8, anti-phospho-Smad2 (S465/467), and anti-phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling); anti-Smad1 (Invitrogen); anti-Flag (M2, Sigma); anti-Smad4 (Abcam); anti-XIAP (Stressgen); and anti-GAPDH (Affinity Bioreagents). Cells were treated with rhBMP2/7 and mTGF\u03b2 (R&D Systems) as indicated. To minimize interference of XIAP detection by the heavy and light chains of the immunoprecipitating BMPR1A antibody, mouse Trueblot ULTRA kit (eBioscience) was used for interaction analysis of BMPR1A with XIAP (Supplementary Figure S5E). Tak1fl/fl mice were intercrossed with the earlier described Col2-cre deleter strain to generate Tak1fl/fl. Col2-cre mice. As Tak1fl/fl. Col2-cre mice do not survive beyond 3 weeks of age, the line was maintained as an intercross of Tak1fl/+. Col2-cre and Tak1fl/fl mice. Animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were handled according to protocols approved by the institution's subcommittee on animal care (IACUC). Chondroepiphyses were dissected from the long bones of day 1 newborn pups from the intercross of Tak1fl/+. Col2-cre and Tak1fl/fl mice. They were washed with PBS and incubated with 2 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche) for 2\u20134 h at 37\u00b0C. The cell suspension was plated in six-well plates containing DMEM-F12 supplemented with 2% FBS. Tak1fl/fl. Col2-cre chondrocytes were identified by immunoblotting with TAK1 antibody and PCR genotyping using tail DNA. To immortalize primary chondrocytes, cells were stably transfected with linearized SV40 Large T antigen plasmid using Effectene trasnfection reagent (Qiagen). The mineralization pattern of the skeleton was analysed at 20 days after birth using the method of McLeod (McLeod, 1980). Briefly, mice were killed by CO2 narcosis, skinned, eviscerated, and fixed in 95% ethanol. Then skeletons were stained by Alizarin red S/Alcian blue and sequentially cleared in 1% potassium hydroxide. For histological analyses, paraffin sections of bones were produced from E18.5, p0, and p20 mice. Limb tissues were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. They were then decalcified by daily changes of 15% tetrasodium EDTA until soft and pliable. Tissues were dehydrated by passage through an ethanol series, cleared twice in xylene, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. For morphological analyses, tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. For in situ hybridization, probe plasmids of Collagen X, IHH, and ID1 were kindly provided by Drs Bjorn Olsen, Beate Lanske, and Kuni Tsuji, respectively. DIG labelled probes were prepared using the DIG labelling kit (Roche) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, probes were purified by washing over a Ultrafree-MC filter column (Millipore). Tissue sections were prewarmed at 55\u00b0C and deparaffinized and rehydrated by passage through xylene and 100, 95, and 70% ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by 15 min incubation in 3% hydrogen peroxide. Samples were treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml proteinase K for 15 min, 4% PFA for 5 min, and 0.25% acetic acid for 15 min before being dehydrated by passage through increasing concentrations of ethanol. Probe was added to the hybridization solution (50% formamide, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.5, 200 \u03bcg/ml tRNA, 1 \u00d7 Denhardt's, 10% Dextran sulphate, 600 mM NaCl, 0.25% SDS, 1 mM EDTA) and the solution prewarmed to 85\u00b0C before incubation with the tissue sections overnight. After incubation, sections were washed with standard sodium citrate buffer and treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml RNaseA in TNE buffer (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). DIG-labelled probe was then detected by immunostaining with anti-DIG-POD and streptadvidin-horseradish peroxidase. For IHC, paraffin tissue sections were de-waxed and endogenous peroxidase quenched as in preparation for in situ hybridization. For anti-TAK1 staining, sections were then incubated with hyaluronidase. For anti-phospho-Smad1/5/8 staining, sections were heated in a pressure cooker. Sections were blocked with 3% goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X 100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with antibodies specific for TAK1 or phospho-Smad1/5/8 at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were then treated with TSA-biotin (Perkin Elmer) and streptavidin-HRP as per manufacturer's instructions, and HRP visualized with DAB (2,2\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride). HEK293 cells grown on three 10 cm petri dishes were transiently transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) with Flag-Smad1 together with either vector or HA-TAK1 (\u0394N). Flag-Smad1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag conjugated agarose overnight at 4\u00b0C, eluted by Flag peptide, separated by SDS\u2013PAGE, and stained with coomassie blue. Gel band containing Flag-Smad1 was excised and subjected to in-gel reduction and alkalyation followed by Lys-C or trypsin digestion. Digested peptides were extracted from the gel and analysed by liquid chromatography MS/MS (LC-MS/MS). Peptides were separated across a 37-min gradient ranging from 4 to 27% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in a microcapillary (125 \u03bcm \u00d7 18 cm) column packed with C18 reverse-phase material (Magic C18AQ, 5 \u03bcm particles, 200 \u00c5 pore size, Michrom Bioresources) and on-line analysed on The LTQ Orbitrap XLTM hybrid FTMS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each cycle, one full MS scan acquired on the Orbitrap at high mass resolution was followed by 10 MS/MS spectra on the linear ion trap XL from the 10 most abundant ions. MS/MS spectra were searched using the Sequest algorithm against Smad1 protein with dynamic modification of methionine oxidation and serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation. All peptide matches were filtered based on mass deviation, tryptic state, XCorr, and dCn and confirmed by manual validation. Immortalized chondrocytes grown on 12-well plates were transiently transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) with the BMP (Tlx2-lux) or TGF\u03b2-dependent reporter construct (3TP-luc) together with the Renilla luciferase vector (Promega). Total DNA concentration in each experiment was maintained by adding the appropriate control vector to the DNA mixture. At 24 h after transfection, cells were serum starved for 12 h before treatment with BMP2/7 or TGF\u03b2. After 24 h, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). For in vitro kinase assays, immortalized chondrocytes grown on 10 cm petri dishes were serum starved for 12 h before treatment with either BMP2/7 (100 ng/ml) or TGF\u03b2 (2 ng/ml) and then lysed in TNT lysis buffer (1% triton X-100, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, protease inhibitors). Alternatively, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with vector, HA-tagged TAK1 (\u0394N or CI). Protein levels in each lysate were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and then normalized among the samples. Protein from lysates was immunoprecipitated using either anti-TAK1 antibody or Rabbit IgG and protein A-sepharose or anti-HA conjugated agarose overnight at 4\u00b0C and precipitates were incubated for 15 min at 30\u00b0C in kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM NaF, 2 mM-glycerophosphate, 1 mM DTT, 10 \u03bcM ATP) containing appropriate GST-fused Smad proteins and 10 \u03bcCi of [\u03b332P]ATP (PerkinElmer). The substrates were then precipitated using glutathione-agarose (Novagen), resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography."}, "28148288": {"pmid": "28148288", "pmcid": "PMC5288940", "title": "Metalloprotease-disintegrin ADAM12 actively promotes the stem cell-like phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nADAM12 is upregulated in human breast cancers and is a predictor of chemoresistance in estrogen receptor-negative tumors. ADAM12 is induced during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a feature associated with claudin-low breast tumors, which are enriched in cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. It is currently unknown whether ADAM12 plays an active role in promoting the CSC phenotype in breast cancer cells.\n\n\nMethods\nADAM12 expression was downregulated in representative claudin-low breast cancer cell lines, SUM159PT and Hs578T, using siRNA transfection or inducible shRNA expression. Cell characteristics commonly associated with the CSC phenotype in vitro (cell migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, mammosphere formation, ALDH activity, and expression of the CD44 and CD24 cell surface markers) and in vivo (tumor formation in mice using limiting dilution transplantation assays) were evaluated. RNA sequencing was performed to identify global gene expression changes after ADAM12 knockdown.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that sorted SUM159PT cell populations with high ADAM12 levels had elevated expression of CSC markers and an increased ability to form mammospheres. ADAM12 knockdown reduced cell migration and invasion, decreased anoikis resistance, and compromised mammosphere formation. ADAM12 knockdown also diminished ALDEFLUOR+ and CD44hi/CD24-/lo CSC-enriched populations in vitro and reduced tumorigenesis in mice in vivo. RNA sequencing identified a significant overlap between ADAM12- and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-regulated genes. Consequently, ADAM12 knockdown lowered the basal activation level of EGFR, and this effect was abolished by batimastat, a metalloproteinase inhibitor. Furthermore, incubation of cells with exogenously added EGF prevented the downregulation of CD44hi/CD24-/lo cell population by ADAM12 knockdown.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results indicate that ADAM12 actively supports the CSC phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer cells via modulation of the EGFR pathway.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12943-017-0599-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n", "fulltext": "Members of the ADAM family of cell surface metalloproteases catalyze cell context-dependent cleavage of transmembrane receptors, growth factor precursors, or adhesion molecules [1, 2]. ADAM substrates include many cancer-related proteins, such as Notch receptors and their ligands, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands [4, 5], interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its receptors, E-cadherin, and CD44. Because ADAMs are often aberrantly expressed or misregulated in human cancers, they may contribute to tumor progression, metastasis, or therapy resistance [10\u201312]. Among twelve catalytically active human ADAMs, ADAM12 possesses unique characteristics that make it an attractive candidate for future use as a target or a biomarker in breast cancer. ADAM12 expression is strongly elevated in most human breast cancers compared to normal mammary epithelium [13, 14]. ADAM12 mRNA is alternatively spliced, and high levels of ADAM12 transcript variant 1 (encoding the transmembrane protein isoform ADAM12-L) are associated with poor prognosis and decreased metastasis-free survival times in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple-negative) early stage breast cancers without systemic treatment, but not in HER2-positive or ER-positive tumors [15, 16]. ADAM12-L expression is induced during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in mammary epithelial cells and appears to be upregulated in the claudin-low intrinsic subtype of breast cancer, which harbors molecular signatures of EMT. Claudin-low tumors represent ~5-10% of all breast cancers, are often triple-negative and poorly differentiated, and have elevated activities of EGFR, proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase Src, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways [19\u201321]. Importantly, the gene expression signatures of claudin-low tumors show a significant similarity to the signature of CD44hi/CD24-/lo mammosphere-forming cells [20, 22], suggesting an enrichment in cancer stem cell (CSC)-like or tumor-initiating cell features. Breast CSCs are thought to be largely responsible for tumor maintenance, treatment resistance, and disease recurrence [23\u201325]. Our previous analysis of two clinical datasets showed that elevated expression of ADAM12 mRNA is predictive of resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative breast cancer, independent of age, tumor size, grade, and the lymph node status. These observations raise a possibility that ADAM12 may serve as a marker or a therapeutic target in CSCs in ER-negative or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The goal of the current study was to assess a possible contribution of ADAM12 to the CSC phenotype of claudin-low TNBC cells. By comparing the properties of sorted cell populations with high versus medium expression of ADAM12, and by analyzing the effect of ADAM12 knockdown on cell migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, mammosphere formation, known CSC markers, tumor formation after xenotransplantation in mice in vivo, and global gene expression, we have determined that ADAM12 actively supports the CSC phenotype of claudin-low TNBC cells. This function of ADAM12 appears to be mediated by sustained, ligand-dependent activation of EGFR. Thus, we have identified ADAM12 as an important modifier of the EGFR pathway in claudin-low TNBC and a potential target in CSC-directed therapies. SMARTpool ADAM12 siRNA (M-005118-01, target sequences 5\u2019-GCAAAGAACTGATCATAAA-3\u2019, 5\u2019-GATGAGAGATGCTAAATGT-3\u2019, 5\u2019-GCAGCAAGGAGGCCGGATT-3\u2019, and 5\u2019-GTCAGGATGTGGACGGCTA-3\u2019), ADAM12 siRNA#1 (D-005118-01, target sequence 5\u2019-GCAAAGAACTGATCATAAA-3\u2019), ADAM12 siRNA#2 (D-005118-02, target sequence 5\u2019-GATGAGAGATGCTAAATGT-3\u2019), and DharmaFECT1 transfection reagent were from GE Dharmacon. These siRNAs targeted transcript variant 1 (NCBI Ref. Seq. NM_003474) and transcript variant 2 (NCBI Ref. Seq. NM_021641) of ADAM12, encoding ADAM12-L and ADAM12-S protein isoforms, respectively. As a negative control, siGENOME non-targeting siRNA pool (D-001206-13) or ON-TARGETplus non-targeting siRNA pool (D-001810-10, GE Dharmacon) was used. RT2 Profiler arrays were from Qiagen, erlotinib was from Cell Signaling Technology, batimastat was from EMD Millipore, bFGF, B27, and human recombinant EGF were from Life Technologies. Antibodies used for flow cytometry were: PE-conjugated anti-CD24 (clone ML5) and IgG2a\u03ba isotype control (clone G155-178, both from BD Biosciences), APC-conjugated anti-CD44 (clone IM7) and IgG2b\u03ba isotype control (clone eB149/10H5, both from Affymetrix eBioscience), anti-ADAM12 (clone 632525) and IgG1 isotype control (clone 11711, both from R&D Systems). APC- or AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. For Western blotting, the following antibodies were used: rabbit monoclonal anti-pY1068 EGFR (clone D7A5) and anti-total EGFR (clone D38B1), both from Cell Signaling Technology, and rabbit polyclonal anti-ADAM12 antibody (Ab#3394) raised against the cytoplasmic tail of human ADAM12. SUM149PT, SUM159PT, and SUM1315MO2 cell lines were purchased from Asterand, BT549, Hs578T, and MCF-7 cells were from ATCC, and HEK293T cells were from Thermo Scientific. SUM102PT and SUM225CWN cells were gifts from Dr. Fariba Behbod (University of Kansas Medical Center). All cell lines were authenticated by the original suppliers using the short tandem repeat (STR) analysis and have been passaged for fewer than 6\u00a0months after culture initiation from an early passage number. Tumor source and pathological features of tumors used to derive breast cancer cell lines used in this study are summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1 [19, 26\u201329]. SUM149PT, SUM159PT, and SUM225CWN cells were cultured in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10\u00a0mM HEPES, 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin, and 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone. SUM1315MO2 cells were cultured in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 10\u00a0mM HEPES, 10\u00a0ng/ml EGF, and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin. SUM102PT cells were maintained in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium containing 5% FBS, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone, and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin. BT549 cells were cultured in RMPI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1\u00a0mM pyruvate, and 0.8\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin. Hs578T and MCF-7 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 6\u00a0mM glutamine, and 1\u00a0mM pyruvate. Cells were maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C under humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. shRNA targeting human ADAM12 and control shRNA inserts were excised from GIPZ ADAM12 shRNA lentiviral vector (V2LHS_11814; the mature antisense sequence: 5\u2019-TTGACATTGACGATTCAGG-3\u2019) or non-silencing control shRNA construct (RHS4346; GE Dharmacon), respectively, and were cloned into pInducer10 vector (Addgene, plasmid 44011) at the XhoI and MluI sites. The ADAM12 shRNA construct targeted both transcript variant 1 and 2 of ADAM12. Lentiviruses were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with pInducer10-shADAM12/shControl, pMD2.G, and psPAX2 (Addgene, plasmids 12259 and 12260, respectively) using Mirus TransIT transfection reagent (Mirus). Conditioned media containing viral particles were harvested 48\u00a0h after transfection, supplemented with 5 \u03bcg/ml polybrene (Sigma), and added onto SUM159PT cells at ~20% confluence. Selection of stably transduced cells started 48\u00a0h after infection using 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml puromycin and continued for 10\u00a0days. ALDEFLUOR assay: SUM159PT cells and Hs578T cells were transfected with SMARTpool ADAM12 siRNAs or non-targeting siRNAs. Three days after transfection, 106 cells were suspended in 1\u00a0ml ALDEFLUOR assay buffer and 5\u00a0\u03bcl ALDEFLUOR reagent (STEMCELL) was added. Then, 0.5\u00a0ml cells were immediately transferred to a new tube containing 10\u00a0\u03bcl ALDH inhibitor diethylamino-benzaldehyde (DEAB, negative control). Both DEAB-treated and untreated cells were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 45\u00a0min, centrifuged, resuspended, and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD24 and CD44 staining: Three days after transfection, cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD24 and APC-conjugated anti-CD44 antibodies, or their respective isotype antibody controls, and analyzed by flow cytometry. ADAM12 staining: Cells were incubated with anti-ADAM12 antibody or mouse IgG1 isotype control antibody, washed and incubated with APC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Cells were analyzed with a BD FACSCalibur cytometer or a LSR Fortessa X20 instrument. All data were analyzed with FCS Express 4 (DeNovo Software). For cell sorting, single cell suspensions stained with anti-ADAM12 antibody and with AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody were sorted on Bio-Rad S3 cell sorter into ADAM12hi population (~1.5% of cells with the highest expression of ADAM12) and ADAM12med population (medium expression of ADAM12). SUM159PT shADAM12 and shControl cells were treated with or without 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml doxycycline for 4\u00a0days. Transwell migration assay was then performed, as described. Migrated cells underneath the inserts were analyzed by light microscopy using 10x magnification and photographed. The numbers of migrated cells were counted in five random fields for each insert. For invasion assays, growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning, 200\u00a0\u03bcl at 6.3\u00a0mg/ml) was layered into wells of a 24-well plate and allowed to solidify at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Cells were pre-treated for 4\u00a0days with or without 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml doxycycline, detached, and diluted to 2.5x104 cells/ml. Cells (10\u00a0\u03bcl) were mixed with 190\u00a0\u03bcl diluted Matrigel, placed onto the Matrigel base layer, and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After the cell layer solidified, 500\u00a0\u03bcl of complete growth medium supplemented with 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml doxycycline was placed on top and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0days. Cells were visualized on a Nikon inverted microscope at 4x magnification and photographed. Cells were treated without or with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml doxycycline for 4\u00a0days, detached with 0.25% trypsin/5\u00a0mM EDTA in DPBS, and diluted to 1x106 cells/ml. Single cell suspension was passaged through a cell strainer and then diluted to 5x103 cells/ml with mammosphere medium containing MEMB, 20\u00a0ng/ml hEGF, 20\u00a0ng/ml bFGF, 4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml heparin, 1xB27, and 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin. Cells were mixed with 3% methylcellulose (R&D Systems) at a 2:1 ratio and seeded into wells of 24-well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning) at 1x103 cells/well. After 7\u00a0days, six randomly selected areas from each well were analyzed by inverted light microscopy using a 4x objective and photographed. Numbers of spheres in each image were quantified using ImageJ. ADAM12hi and ADAM12med sorted cells were seeded into 96-well plates (100 cells/well) and incubated for 5\u00a0days in growth medium. Cell growth was measured using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega); at least 5 wells per cell type were measured for each time point. Growth rate and doubling times were calculated using GraphPad Prism. For cell death assays, 1x103 cells treated without or with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml doxycycline for 4\u00a0days were suspended in mammosphere medium containing 1% methylcellulose and seeded into wells of a 24-well ultra-low attachment plate. Cells were pelleted at 0, 12, 24, and 48\u00a0h post-plating, washed twice, lysed at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, and frozen at -20\u00a0\u00b0C. Cell Death ELISA kit (Roche) was used to detect fragmented mono- and oligo-nucleosomes in lysates preserved at different time points. Immunoblotting was performed as described [16, 18], with some modifications. Lysis buffer was supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (50\u00a0mM NaF, 2\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 10\u00a0mM Na4P2O7). Total cell lysates were directly analyzed by Western blotting or incubated with concanavalin A agarose (Sigma; 50\u00a0\u03bcl resin per 1\u00a0ml cell lysate) for 2\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C to enrich for glycoproteins. The resin was washed three times and glycoproteins were eluted with 3X SDS gel loading buffer. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by signal detection using SuperSignal West Pico or West Femto chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) and Azure c500 digital imaging system. Band intensities were quantified using the ImageJ analysis software. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and was subjected to on-column digestion with deoxyribonuclease I. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen) or the qScript Flex cDNA kit (Quanta BioSciences) and oligo(dT) primers. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on a BioRad CFX96 instrument. At the conclusion of each run, a melt curve analysis was performed to ensure that a single product had been synthesized. The relative expression of each gene, normalized to actin, was calculated using the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method. Primer sequences are provided in Additional file 1: Table S7. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kansas State University. Non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) female mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. One week prior to injection, mice were randomized to either control or doxycycline diet (2\u00a0g/kg, Bio-Serv) and they remained on this diet throughout the experiment. shControl and shADAM12 SUM159PT cells were pre-treated for 4\u00a0days with or without 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml doxycycline. Cells were detached and serially diluted in 1% BSA/DPBS; each dilution was combined with an equal volume of ice-cold growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Cells (100\u00a0\u03bcl) were injected subcutaneously in the 4th inguinal mammary glands of 8-week old female NOD-SCID mice under isoflurane sedation. Mice were monitored for tumor development twice per week using a caliper. Tumor volumes were determined using the formula: volume\u2009=\u20091/2\u2009\u00d7\u2009length\u2009\u00d7\u2009width2. Total RNA was isolated from shControl and shADAM12 SUM159PT cells\u2009\u00b1\u2009doxycycline (n\u2009=\u20093 for each condition) using the Qiagen RNeasy purification kit and on-column DNase I digestion according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. The RNA was sent to the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility for quality assessment using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and library preparation. An NGS library was generated for each RNA sample using the Illumina TruSeq Library Prep kit. The libraries were analyzed at the University of Kansas Medical Center Genome Sequencing Facility on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 100\u00a0bp single reads. All sequence analysis was performed using the CLC Genomics Workbench version 8.0 (CLC Bio). The reads were trimmed based on the quality score with a limit of 0.05 and ambiguous nucleotides were trimmed from the ends with 2 set as the maximum number of ambiguities allowed. Additionally, sequences shorter than 15\u00a0nt or longer than 1000\u00a0nt were eliminated. Mapping to the human genome (hg19) was performed using the RNA-Seq Analysis tool and the following settings: map to gene regions only, mismatch cost\u2009=\u20092, insertion and deletion costs\u2009=\u20092, length and similarity fractions\u2009=\u20090.8, and maximum number of hits for a read\u2009=\u20091. The expression value was calculated as Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKM). The RPKM values were statistically analyzed using the Empirical analysis of Digital Gene Expression tool (EDGE) and FDR corrected P-values were calculated. Genes that were significantly changed by ADAM12 knockdown were further evaluated by QIAGEN\u2019s Ingenuity\u00ae Pathway Analysis (IPA\u00ae) using the Canonical Pathways and Upstream Regulator features. RNA sequencing data have been deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and are available at the accession number SRP077683. Expression levels of ADAM12 (transcript variant 1, NM_003474) in 295 breast tumors from the NKI dataset were retrieved from the Computational Cancer Biology website at The Netherlands Cancer Institute (http://ccb.nki.nl/data/) as ratios of fluorescence intensities to the intensity of a reference pool. Tumors were assigned to individual subtypes of breast cancer according to ref.. Expression data for ADAM12 in 508 breast invasive carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (Nature 2012 dataset) were accessed via the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/) [34, 35]. Since cBioPortal contains only gene-level data and it does not contain probe-level data, ADAM12 expression values obtained through cBioPortal represent merged data for different ADAM12 splice variants. P-values for a t-test of ADAM12 expression in each TNBC subtype versus all other TNBC subtypes were retrieved from ref.. The list of genes whose expression was most highly correlated with the expression of the ADAM12 gene was acquired from the TCGA (Nature 2012 dataset) via the cBioPortal using the mRNA co-expression feature. Overlaps between ADAM12-correlated genes and gene sets from the MSigDB collection were computed using the GSEA website (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/annotate.jsp). Genes (n\u2009=\u200945) significantly changed after ADAM12 knockdown in SUM159PT cells (Fig.\u00a05b and Additional file 1: Table S5) were used to construct an ADAM12 gene expression signature. Genes (355 different genes corresponding to 493 individual transcripts) significantly upregulated or downregulated in CD44hi/CD24-/lo subpopulations of primary breast cancer cells and in cancer mammospheres were used to calculate the CSC signature scores. Expression values for these CSC-related genes in 51 different breast cancer cell lines were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), using accession number GSE69017. The top 250 genes whose expression was most significantly changed upon stable expression of EGFR in MCF7 cells were used to calculate EGFR-responsive gene signature scores. Expression values for these EGFR-regulated genes were retrieved from GEO, using accession number GSE3542. The expression values for ADAM12-, CSC-, and EGFR-related genes in breast invasive carcinomas were extracted from TCGA (Cell 2015 dataset) via the cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/). The signature scores were then calculated for all tumors for which gene expression values were available (a total of 421 tumors) as:s=\u2211iwixi/\u2211iwiwhere w is the weight +1 or \u20131, depending on whether the gene was upregulated or downregulated in the signature, and x is the normalized gene expression level. The effect of ADAM12 expression on relapse-free survival rates of breast cancer patients was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter (http://kmplot.com/analysis/). This online tool uses manually curated database containing gene expression data and relapse free and overall survival information downloaded from GEO, the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA), and TCGA. The parameters were set as follows: Affymetrix probeset: 202952_s_at (as this probeset is specific for ADAM12 transcript variant 1, encoding ADAM12-L); Auto select best cutoff: On; Use array quality control: Remove redundant samples, Exclude outlier arrays; Check proportional hazards assumption: On; Restrict analysis to subtypes: All, or ER-negative (derive ER status from gene expression data: On), PR-negative, HER2-negative, or Mesenchymal stem-like; Restrict analysis to selected cohorts: none; Database release: 2017; Datasets: all. By analyzing gene expression profiles of 337 breast tumors from the University of North Carolina database, we previously noted that ADAM12 mRNA levels (transcript variant 1 encoding ADAM12-L protein isoform, but not transcript variant 2 encoding ADAM12-S) were significantly elevated in the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer. Here, we extended our observations to two other tumor gene expression repositories: the Netherlands Cancer Institute database (NKI, 295 breast cancers) and The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA, 508 breast cancers). In the NKI database, ADAM12 mRNA levels (transcript variant 1) were more frequently upregulated in claudin-low (CL) tumors compared to basal (B), luminal A/B (LumA/B), HER2-enriched (HER2+), or normal-like (NL) cancers (Additional file 2: Figure S1a). Similarly, ADAM12 mRNA expression levels in the TCGA database (retrieved as merged values for different splice variants) were significantly higher in claudin-low tumors than in other tumor subtypes (Additional file 2: Figure S1b). Furthermore, among different subtypes of TNBCs, ADAM12 mRNA levels (transcript variant 1) were previously found significantly elevated (P\u2009=\u20095.19E-08) in the mesenchymal stem-like (MSL) subtype compared to the mesenchymal (M), basal-like 1 (BL1), basal-like 2 (BL2), immunomodulatory (IM), or luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtypes (Additional file 1: Table S2). Notably, the MSL subtype shares many features with the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, including high expression of EMT- and CSC-related genes. Investigation of the top 40 genes which are most closely correlated with ADAM12 expression in breast invasive carcinomas from the TCGA database (Additional file 1: Table S3) revealed a very significant enrichment (P\u2009=\u20097.43E-50) in the EMT hallmark signature from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis/Molecular Signature Database (GSEA/MSigDB, ref.) (Additional file 1: Table S4). These findings corroborate a recent report, in which ADAM12 mRNA expression was correlated with EMT markers N-cadherin, vimentin, and TGF\u03b2, but not E-cadherin, in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines and in 79 breast cancer biopsies. Here, we examined ADAM12 protein levels in several cell lines representing different intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer: claudin-low cell lines Hs578T, SUM1315MO2, BT549, and SUM159PT, basal cell lines SUM102PT and SUM149PT, and luminal cell lines MCF-7 and SUM225CWN. Cell surface levels of ADAM12-L were evaluated by flow cytometry after staining of live cells with an antibody specific for the extracellular domain of ADAM12-L (Fig.\u00a01a). Also, total cellular levels of\u00a0ADAM12-L, after partial purification on concanavalin A agarose, were detected by Western blotting using an antibody specific for the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12-L (Fig.\u00a01b). The specificity of ADAM12 bands was confirmed after ADAM12 knockdown using an inducible shRNA construct (see below). In accordance with ADAM12 mRNA expression data [17, 42], ADAM12-L protein (from now on referred to as ADAM12) was most abundantly expressed in claudin-low cell lines. Since the gene expression signatures of claudin-low tumors and claudin-low cell lines show a significant similarity to the signature of CSCs [20, 22], we examined the relationship between ADAM12 mRNA expression and the CSC signature scores in a panel of 51 breast cancer cell lines from Neve at al.. The CSC scores were calculated based on the genes whose expression was most significantly changed in CD44hi/CD24-/lo populations and in mammosphere-forming cells, as reported by Creighton et al. and described in Methods. As shown in Fig.\u00a01c, there was a significant positive correlation between CSC scores and ADAM12 mRNA levels (P\u2009=\u20091.4E-07). One of the characteristic features associated with the CSC phenotype is the resistance to anoikis, an apoptotic cell death upon matrix detachment. When SUM159PT cells were grown as mammospheres in ultra-low attachment plates in serum-free medium, ADAM12 was more abundant in mammospheres than in attached cells grown as monolayers (Fig.\u00a01d, see also). Since mammosphere-forming cells are largely anoikis-resistant, this result suggested that ADAM12 expression might be upregulated in breast CSCs. Another characteristic feature of CSCs is their resistance to chemotherapy. It was shown previously that overexpression of ADAM12 in MCF10A cells, a non-transformed human breast epithelial cell line, increased cell resistance to cisplatin. Here, we asked whether cells with high endogenous expression of ADAM12 would preferentially survive treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent. To this end, non-confluent adherent cultures of SUM159PT cells were treated for 6\u00a0days with 10 nM paclitaxel, which induced death in ~90% of cells. The surviving ~10% of cells were subsequently incubated for 6 additional days in the absence of paclitaxel, during which they resumed proliferation (a \u201crecovery phase\u201d). In DMSO-treated cultures, ~1.5% of cells expressed ADAM12 at the level that was equal to or exceeded an arbitrarily defined \u201chigh\u201d expression level (ADAM12hi), whereas in paclitaxel-treated cultures, the percentage of ADAM12hi cells was increased ~3-fold (Fig.\u00a01e and Additional file 3: Figure S2). This result indicated that cells with high expression of ADAM12 might be more chemoresistant than cells with lower ADAM12 expression, as it appears that they preferentially survived paclitaxel treatment. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we next isolated two subpopulations of SUM159PT cells: ADAM12hi representing ~1.5% of cells with the highest cell surface expression of ADAM12, and ADAM12med representing cells with medium ADAM12 expression levels (Additional file 4: Figure S3). ADAM12hi cells grew slower than ADAM12med cells under standard 2D conditions in complete growth medium (doubling time 19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\u00a0h versus 14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u00a0h, P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Additional file 5: Figure S4a). However, ADAM12hi cells formed more primary and secondary mammospheres than ADAM12med cells (Additional file 5: Figure S4b). ADAM12hi cells also expressed higher levels of several CSC markers, mesenchymal markers, and cancer drug resistance genes than ADAM12med cells (Additional file 5: Figure S4c-e, respectively). These results indicated that, in SUM159PT cells, a subpopulation characterized by high endogenous expression levels of ADAM12 was enriched in features commonly attributed to CSCs. To examine whether ADAM12 plays an active role in supporting the CSC phenotype, we first examined the effect of ADAM12 knockdown on cell migration, invasion, and mammosphere formation using a doxycycline-inducible shRNA system. ADAM12 shRNA (shADAM12) or control shRNA (shControl) cloned into pInducer10 vector (Additional file 6: Figure S5a) was stably transduced into SUM159PT cells. Treatment with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml doxycycline for 4\u00a0days significantly decreased the level of ADAM12 mRNA (Additional file 6: Figure S5b) and protein (Additional file 6: Figure S5c, d) in SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells, but not in SUM159PT_shControl cells. ADAM12 knockdown did not have a significant effect on cell proliferation or survival rates (results not shown). In the Transwell migration assay, SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells treated with doxycycline were less motile than untreated cells (Fig.\u00a02a). In three-dimensional Matrigel cultures, doxycycline-treated SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells were less invasive than shADAM12 cells incubated without doxycycline (Fig.\u00a02b). Doxycycline treatment did not have a significant effect on the migration or invasion of SUM159PT_shControl cells (Fig.\u00a02a, b). Furthermore, induction of ADAM12 knockdown decreased the ability of SUM159PT cells to survive under detachment conditions. Using an apoptosis assay based on measuring DNA fragmentation by ELISA, we observed an increased amount of cell death in doxycycline-treated detached SUM159PT_shADAM12, but not in SUM159PT_shControl cells (Fig.\u00a02c). Accordingly, the number of mammospheres formed by doxycycline-treated SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells was lower than the number of mammospheres formed by untreated SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells or by SUM159PT_shControl cells (Fig.\u00a02d). Thus, ADAM12 knockdown decreased the migration, invasion, anoikis-resistance, and mammosphere-forming potential of SUM159PT cells. Breast CSCs are characterized by high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and have CD44hi/ CD24-/lo cell surface marker profile [23, 43]. To evaluate the effect of ADAM12 knockdown on ALDH (measured as ALDEFLUOR+ cells), CD44, and CD24 expression, we used flow cytometry-based assays. To minimize possible inaccuracies that might be introduced during compensation protocols (required to correct for spectral overlaps between different fluorochromes and a strong fluorescence signal of red fluorescent protein (RFP), which was co-expressed with shRNAs from the pInducer10 vector), we used siRNA transfection to knockdown ADAM12. First, SUM159PT cells were transfected with a pool of four siRNAs targeting ADAM12, all of which had different ADAM12-targeting sequences than shADAM12. Downregulation of ADAM12 at the cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometry (Additional file 7: Figure S6a). The amount of ALDEFLUOR+ cells was decreased ~3-fold in siADAM12-transfected SUM159PT cells compared to siControl-transfected cells (Fig.\u00a03a-c). A similar effect of ADAM12 knockdown was observed in Hs578T cells, in which the number of ALDEFLUOR+ cells was diminished ~2-fold upon siADAM12 transfection (Fig.\u00a03d). An efficient ADAM12 knockdown in siADAM12-transfected Hs578T cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (Additional file 7: Figure S6b). ADAM12 knockdown using pooled siRNAs resulted in a significant reduction of the CSC-containing CD44hi/CD24-/lo population and expansion of the non-CSC CD44hi/CD24+ population in SUM159PT cells (Fig.\u00a03e, f) and Hs578T cells (Fig.\u00a03g). Increased expression of CD24 (and thus an expansion of the non-CSC population) was also observed in shADAM12-expressing SUM159PT cells treated with doxycycline, but not in shControl-expressing SUM159PT cells upon the same treatment (Additional file 8: Figure S7a and b, respectively). To examine the role of ADAM12 in tumor initiation in vivo, we performed limiting dilution transplantation experiments. SUM159PT_shADAM12 or SUM159PT_shControl cells, pre-treated with doxycycline or vehicle, were injected into NOD-SCID mice as a 10-fold dilution series from 1x104 to 1x102 cells per mammary gland. Mice injected with doxycycline-treated cells were maintained on a\u00a0doxycycline-containing diet for continuous expression of shRNA. Mice injected with vehicle-treated cells were maintained on\u00a0a doxycycline-free diet. After monitoring mice for 21\u00a0days for tumor formation, the frequency of CSCs among SUM159PT_ shADAM12 cells without or with doxycycline treatment was estimated as ~1/6,808 and ~1/18,399 cells, respectively, using the ELDA algorithm (P-value of the difference between groups 0.156; Fig.\u00a04a). Among SUM159PT_shControl cells, without or with doxycycline treatment, the frequency of CSCs was estimated as ~1/8,447 and ~1/4,885 cells, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.359; Fig.\u00a04a). The difference in CSC frequencies between shADAM12 and shControl cells in doxycycline-treated mice was statistically significant (P\u2009=\u20090.042, Fig.\u00a04a). In another approach, 1x105 cells were injected into mouse mammary glands, and tumor growth rates were monitored for up to 38\u00a0days. Tumors formed by SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells in doxycycline-treated mice were significantly smaller than tumors detected in untreated mice (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a04b, c). There was no statistical difference between the growth rates of tumors formed by SUM159PT_shControl cells in doxycycline-treated and untreated mice (Fig.\u00a04d, e). Collectively, these results suggested that ADAM12 knockdown decreased both tumor initiation and tumor growth in mice in vivo. To gain insight into global gene expression networks regulated by ADAM12 in breast cancer cells, we performed RNA sequencing of SUM159PT_shADAM12 and SUM159PT_shControl cells, before and after doxycycline treatment. We used two types of comparisons to identify ADAM12-regulated genes (Fig.\u00a05a). First, using a cut-off for | fold change| >1.2 and False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted P <0.05, we identified 340 genes that were differentially expressed in SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells with versus without doxycycline treatment and 96 genes that were significantly altered in SUM159PT_shControl cells by doxycycline treatment. Eighty-six genes that were common to these two gene lists were removed from further analysis because their expression was, presumably, affected by doxycycline. Second, we identified 175 genes that were differentially expressed between SUM159PT_shADAM12 versus SUM159PT_shControl cells, in the presence of doxycycline and 100 genes that were differentially expressed in these cells in the absence of doxycycline. Seventy-three genes that were present in both gene sets were removed from further analysis because they presumably represented intrinsic variations between SUM159PT_shADAM12 and SUM159PT_shControl cells. Finally, by combining these two analyses, we generated a high confidence list of 45 genes that were consistently changed in both comparisons and showed the same direction of change (Fig.\u00a05a). Among these, 25 genes were downregulated and 20 genes were upregulated in response to ADAM12 knockdown (Fig.\u00a05b, Additional file 1: Table S5). An ADAM12 gene expression signature score derived from the expression levels of these 45 genes was significantly correlated with ADAM12 expression in breast tumors from the TCGA database (P\u2009=\u20092.6E-14, Fig.\u00a05c). Remarkably, there was also a significant positive correlation between the ADAM12 score and the CSC score in the same tumor dataset (P\u2009=\u20092.1E-15, Fig.\u00a05d). We computed overlaps of the 45 genes altered after ADAM12 knockdown with gene sets from GSEA/MSigDB (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb). We noted that genes downregulated after ADAM12 knockdown significantly overlapped with genes transiently induced by EGF (CD55, IER3, ITGA2, MCL1, SERPINE1, ZFP36L1; P\u2009=\u20091.95E-09), and genes constituting HRAS oncogenic signature (CD55, EREG, IER3, ITGA2, MCL1; P\u2009=\u20092.75E-07) (Additional file 1: Table S6). To further determine which canonical signaling pathways might have been over-represented among ADAM12-regulated genes, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, http://www.ingenuity.com). Canonical pathways analysis identified \u201cSignaling by Rho Family GTPases\u201d as the only pathway that was significantly enriched (P\u2009=\u20091.25E-04) among genes altered in response to ADAM12 knockdown and had a non-zero (negative) z-score (Additional file 9: Figure S8), indicating that this pathway might have been downregulated after ADAM12 knockdown. To better understand gene expression changes observed in response to ADAM12 knockdown, we applied the IPA Upstream Regulator analysis. The goal of the IPA Upstream Regulator analysis is to identify a cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators that can explain the observed gene expression changes in a user\u2019s dataset. This approach indicated that there was a statistically significant overlap between genes altered after ADAM12 knockdown and the genes regulated by LPS, SP1, EGFR, MTOR, SMARCA4 and NEDD9 transcriptional regulators (Fig.\u00a05e). Among those, an overlap between ADAM12-modulated genes and genes changed in response to EGFR inhibition was the most significant (P\u2009=\u20093.97E-09). Our investigation of genes changed in response to ADAM12 knockdown in SUM159PT cells using GSEA/MSigDB and IPA gene sets consistently pointed to alterations in the EGFR pathway. Therefore, we tested a hypothesis that ADAM12 supports the CSC phenotype via modulation of the EGFR pathway. First, we examined the effect of erlotinib, a specific inhibitor of EGFR, on SUM159PT cells. Treatment of SUM159PT cells with 1\u00a0\u03bcM erlotinib inhibited the basal phosphorylation level of EGFR at Y1068, one of the major phosphorylation sites in response to ligand-mediated EGFR activation (Fig.\u00a05f). Importantly, erlotinib elicited a similar effect on the CD44hi/CD24-/lo cell population as ADAM12 knockdown did (Fig.\u00a05g, h), suggesting that ADAM12 knockdown might have indeed resulted in inhibition of EGFR signaling. Next, we examined the effect of ADAM12 knockdown on the basal activation level of EGFR. We observed that incubation of SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells, but not SUM159PT_shControl cells, with doxycycline, or transfection of SUM159PT cells with pooled ADAM12 siRNAs decreased the level of EGFR phosphorylation at Y1068 by ~40% and ~55%, respectively (Fig.\u00a06a). Similar results were obtained for Hs578T cells, although the effects were somewhat more modest than in SUM159PT cells (Fig.\u00a06b). Thus, ADAM12 is a positive regulator of EGFR in both cell lines. Activation of EGFR at the basal level and its susceptibility to inhibition by erlotinib suggested the presence of EGF-like ligands in culture medium. These ligands might have been endogenously expressed by cells and released from the cell surface by ADAM12 and, possibly, other ADAM proteases. Alternatively, low concentrations of EGF-like growth factors might be present in the serum used to supplement culture media. To discriminate between these two possibilities, cells were incubated for 24\u00a0h with batimastat (BB-94), a metalloprotease inhibitor, in serum-free medium or in complete medium containing serum. Regardless of the presence or absence of serum, treatment with BB-94 decreased the phosphorylation level of EGFR by 70-80% (Fig.\u00a06c). These results indicated that the basal activation of EGFR was achieved through interactions with endogenous EGF-like ligands that were released from cells via ADAM-mediated cleavage and that were acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner. To further determine whether ADAM12 played a role in EGFR activation in response to endogenous ligands, we examined the effect of BB-94 or exogenously added EGF on EGFR phosphorylation in cells transfected with control or ADAM12 siRNAs. In these experiments, we used two individual siRNAs from the pool of four siRNAs targeting ADAM12, which diminished cell surface expression of ADAM12 with the highest potency, namely siADAM12#1 and #2, (Additional file 7: Figure S6c). These two individual siRNAs reduced the level of pEGFR_Y1068 by ~50% (Fig.\u00a06d), as seen before with shRNA or pooled siRNAs. Importantly, the effects of siADAM12 #1 and siADAM12 #2 on pEGFR_Y1068 were significantly reduced or eliminated when cells were further incubated with 10\u00a0\u03bcM BB-94 or 20\u00a0ng/ml of EGF (Fig.\u00a06d). These results supported a model in which ADAM12 sustained the basal level of activation of EGFR by mediating the release of endogenous EGF-like ligands. Since claudin-low tumors have elevated activities of the EGFR pathway, we next asked whether reduced activation of EGFR in ADAM12-deficent cells might directly impact the expression of genes associated with claudin-low tumors and cell lines. Indeed, we observed that the expression of several claudin-low-enriched transcripts, ALDH1A1, IL8, SERPINE1, VCAM1, and CD44, was decreased in doxycycline-treated SUM159PT_shADAM12 cells versus SUM159PT_shControl cells (Fig.\u00a06e). These results underscore the role of ADAM12 in promoting the claudin-low phenotype, which is associated with the CSC features. To determine whether modulation of the EGFR pathway by ADAM12 is prerequisite for the\u00a0ADAM12-mediated effect on CSC features, cells were transfected with siADAM12, treated for two days with exogenous EGF, and the cell surface expression of CD44/CD24 markers was evaluated by flow cytometry. Importantly, while EGF increased the pool of CD44hi/CD24-/lo cells, as expected, ADAM12 knockdown did not have any effect on CD44 or CD24 expression in the presence of EGF (Fig.\u00a07a). These results suggested that downregulation of EGFR activation by ADAM12 knockdown was required for a reduction of CSC-containing CD44hi/CD24-/lo cell population. We further explored the relationships between ADAM12 expression and the EGFR-responsive gene signature scores in 421 tumors from the TCGA database. The EGFR scores were calculated based on the gene expression profiling of MCF-7 breast cancer cells overexpressing EGFR. We observed positive correlations between ADAM12 and the EGFR score (P\u2009=\u20093.2E-13, Fig.\u00a07b). Importantly, ADAM12 expression itself was not significantly changed by manipulations of EGFR in MCF-7 cells. Based on our results, we propose a model where ADAM12 contributes to the activation of EGFR by releasing EGF-like ligands from the cell surface, and ultimately to the expansion of CSC populations. As the EGFR signaling pathway is frequently activated in TNBC, ADAM12-mediated increase of EGFR activity should be the most relevant in this type of cancer. Our model is further supported by the fact that high expression of the ADAM12 gene correlates with poor prognosis in 196 patients with TNBC and, most importantly, in 59 patients with the MSL subtype of TNBC, but not in a general breast cancer patient population (Fig.\u00a07c, assessed by the Kaplan-Meier Plotter online tool, ref.). The EGFR pathway activation has been frequently observed in claudin-low TNBCs and cell lines bearing CSC-like features, and several reports indicated that EGFR is a positive regulator of CSCs. For example, stimulation of the EGFR pathway promoted mammosphere formation by normal breast stem cells and by ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-derived epithelial cells. Recently, it has been reported that cetuximab, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, reduced mammosphere formation and CSC populations in breast cancer cells in vitro and potentiated the effect of Ixabepilone, a new generation microtubule-stabilizing agent, in treating orthotopic TNBC xenografts. Furthermore, in A431 epidermoid cancer cells, treatment with cetuximab upregulated the expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and occludin, downregulated the epithelial transcriptional repressors Zeb, Snail, and Slug, and reduced the CD44hi/CD24-/lo phenotype. EGFR activation also promoted acquisition of CSC properties in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [51, 52] and in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, pointing to a more general function of EGFR in CSC biology. The postulated mechanisms by which EGFR promotes the CSC features in TNBC cells include the activation of MEK/ERK signaling, the STAT3 pathway, and/or autophagy. For example, blocking ERK activation in claudin-low cell lines by MEK inhibitors or by forced expression of DUSP4, dual specificity phosphatase-4 that is a negative regulator of ERK, has been shown to reduce the CD44hi/CD24-/lo populations in vitro and to diminish tumor initiating populations in vivo. STAT3, which is another downstream effector of EGFR, has been recently reported to be preferentially activated in tumor-initiating cells/CSCs in claudin-low breast cancer, raising a possibility that it might, at least partially, mediate the downstream effects of EGFR on CSC properties of claudin-low cells. EGFR is activated by soluble ligands that are synthesized as transmembrane precursors and need to be released from the cell surface by ADAM proteases [5, 55]. In many cell types and tissues, ADAM17 or ADAM10 act as dedicated and robust EGFR ligand \u201csheddases\u201d [1, 10]. Likewise, it has been postulated that ADAM17 is the main ADAM responsible for EGFR ligand cleavage and activation of EGFR in breast cancer [56\u201358]. However, other ADAMs, including ADAM12, may mediate the release of soluble EGFR ligands as well. For example, ADAM12 was shown to act as a sheddase for heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) during cardiac hypertrophy and under hypoxia in head and neck, lung, and pancreatic cancer cells, leading to the formation of invadopodia and increasing cancer cell invasion. Whether ADAM12 activates EGFR in breast cancer cells and, in particular, whether ADAM12-mediated EGFR activation promotes the acquisition of the breast CSC phenotype, has not been sufficiently explored. In this report, we have identified ADAM12 as a modifier of the EGFR activation in claudin-low TNBC. In existing microarray datasets, ADAM12 mRNA levels were the highest in claudin-low and MSL TNBCs, and they strongly correlated with the EMT hallmark gene signature. Among breast cancer cell lines, claudin-low cells expressed the highest levels of ADAM12. Down-regulation of ADAM12 decreased the basal activation levels of EGFR, diminished the expression of claudin-low transcripts, reduced the CSC phenotype in vitro, and decreased the tumorigenic potential of engrafted cells in mice in vivo. In addition, ADAM12 mRNA expression was strongly correlated with the EGFR activation score in 421 breast invasive cancers. Our previous analysis of two clinical datasets showed that high expression of ADAM12 was predictive of resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-negative breast cancer. This is fully consistent with ADAM12 being an EMT- and CSC-related gene, as both EMT and CSCs contribute to drug resistance [61, 62]. Finally, in a dataset of 196 TNBCs and 59 MSL TNBCs analyzed here, and previously in 53 TNBC patients without systemic treatment [15, 16], high ADAM12 expression was associated with decreased metastasis-free survival times. Current treatments of TNBC rely mainly on chemotherapy, as there are no targeted therapies specifically approved for this type of breast cancer. EGFR is expressed in 60-70% of TNBCs [64, 65], raising an early hope for EGFR-targeted therapies in TNBC. Two completed clinical trials investigated the therapeutic potential of cetuximab, as a single agent or in addition to cisplatin chemotherapy, in unselected TNBC patients with metastatic disease [66, 67]. While the results have been disappointing and there was no significant effect on progression-free or overall patient survival, it is becoming clear that EGFR expression alone does not necessarily indicate tumor cell dependence on EGFR signaling and further molecular stratifications and patient selections are needed in future trials [63, 68, 69]. We propose that ADAM12 may be an important biomarker in identifying TNBCs with over-activation of the EGFR pathway and may help select patients that would better respond to EGFR inhibitors. In addition, further detailed studies of ADAM12-mediated regulation of the EGFR pathway should establish whether ADAM12 itself may be a suitable target for CSC-like populations in claudin-low TNBC. ADAM12 supports the CSC phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer cells via modulation of the EGFR activation. Therefore, ADAM12 may be an important biomarker in identifying TNBCs that might respond to EGFR inhibition."}, "22051099": {"pmid": "22051099", "pmcid": "PMC3229460", "title": "Variation in the CXCR1 gene (IL8RA) is not associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nThe chemokine receptor 1 CXCR-1 (or IL8R-alpha) is a specific receptor for the interleukin 8 (IL-8), which is chemoattractant for neutrophils and has an important role in the inflammatory response.

Initially identified as a chemoattractant for neutrophils, IL-8 has been demonstrated to have pro-inflammatory effects including stimulation of neutrophil degranulation. Cellular activities of IL-8 are mediated by CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 (IL8R-beta), which maintain 78% of amino acid similarity and are encoded by two single-copy genes that are located on chromosome 2q34-35. However, CXCR-1 is more specific for IL-8 in comparison with CXCR-2. The involvement of IL-8, CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 has been extensively investigated in different diseases such as pyelonephritis, hepatitis B, rapid disease progression of HIV-1+, lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, bronchiectasis, systemic sclerosis and lung cancer. Some of these studies have reported positive associations between the diseases and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CXCR1 gene. Indeed, a significant association was demonstrated between the 860G > C (S276T) SNP in the CXCR1 gene with decreased lung cancer risk. Haplotypes formed by SNPs in the CXCR1 and CXCR2 genes where also previously identified. The 860G > C (S276T) SNP in CXCR1 gene was identified by comparison of multiple sequences deposited in the GenBank/EMBL data banks. These authors named this polymorphism differently: +2607 (position 6334 of sequence accession number [GenBank: L19592.1]) in exon 2, and +827 (starting from the initiation of the ATG codon in exon 2 of [GenBank: L19592.1]), respectively. The variant position 860G > C is based on the [NCBI: NM000634.2] exon 2 initiations, however it is important to be clear that all these different positions at the CXCR1 gene refer to the same polymorphism (G > C), which results in a conservative amino acid substitution from serine to threonine at the 276 amino acid residue of the CXCR-1 (or IL8R-alpha) protein. Here, we preferred to use the reference sequence number [refSNP ID: rs2234671] in NCBI's Entrez system (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP). Predominantly in the last decade, many candidate-gene investigations have been conducted in order to find genetic risk factors associated with chronic periodontitis (CP). Epidemiological studies indicate that CP is an important cause of teeth loss in adults, since 5% to 15% of any population suffers from this disease. CP is a multifactorial disease, initiated by bacterial infection which can progress to the damage and destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth. The host response is influenced by both environmental (e.g. smoking, oral hygiene) and genetic factors. Some studies have demonstrated association between polymorphisms in genes of the immune system and CP, such as Interleukin 2 (IL2), IL4, IL6 and IL10. Recently, we have reported association between haplotypes in the IL8 and in the CXCR2 genes with CP. Because those previous findings and the biological relationship of the CXCR-1 with the IL-8 and the CXCR-2 we have hypothesized whether a SNP in the CXCR1 gene would also influence the host susceptibility to CP. In this regard, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of the rs2234671 SNP in the CXCR1 gene in a Brazilian population with chronic periodontitis. In total, 395 individuals in good general health and having similar socioeconomic status were recruited from the patient pool of the School of Dentistry at Araraquara, S\u00e3o Paulo State University - UNESP between November 2004 and May 2007. The study was approved by the Committee for Ethical Affairs of the S\u00e3o Paulo State University (Protocol number 57/04). To verify statistical power of our sample, we used the G*POWER 3 software with the following parameters: logistic regression; two tail, odds ratio = 1.56, \u03b1 error probability = 0.05. Detailed clinical criteria for include patients in this study are described in Viana et al.. Briefly, the following clinical signs and parameters were assessed at six sites around each tooth: probing pocket depth (PPD) (measured as distance from the free gingival margin to the base of the pocket), clinical attachment loss (CAL) (as the distance from the cement-enamel junction to the base of the periodontal pocket) and bleeding on probing (BOP) (registered as present or absent). These measurements were performed in millimeters using a periodontal probe with Williams markings. All fully erupted teeth, except third molars and retained roots, were examined. The diagnosis of subjects was established on the basis of clinical criteria proposed by the 1999 International World Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions. The subjects were categorized into two groups: controls (n = 191), subjects exhibiting no sites with CAL and PPD \u2265 3 mm and no BOP; and CP (n = 200), subjects exhibiting one or more sites with CAL and PPD \u2265 3 mm and BOP. Information on smoking status was obtained using a self-reported questionnaire, and subjects were classified as a \"smoker\" or \"nonsmoker\" according to Kornman et al.. DNA was obtained from buccal epithelial cells, extracted with sequential phenolchloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) solution and precipitated with a salt ethanol solution. The SNP was identified using the sequence-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction method (SSP-PCR) according to Renzoni et al.. The PCR products were electrophoresed (100 V, 120 min) in 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining. The chi-squared test was used to determine whether the groups were composed of patients with the same proportion of males and females and whether they had similar smoking habits. Onset age distribution between the two groups was evaluated by Students't-test. Those statistical analyses, as well as deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, were performed using BioEstat software version 5.0 (UFPA, MCT, CNPq, Bel\u00e9m, PA, Brazil). In addition, a forward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis was used for estimating the relationships between the SNP rs2234671 in the CXCR1gene and periodontal disease susceptibility and the other covariates. This multivariate logistic regression modeling was executed using the R statistical package (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05. The power calculations showed that the sample size of 395 individuals demonstrated a power of 93%. Therefore, the number of subjects enrolled in this study is large enough to detect association with an acceptable level of confidence. The population investigated here was composed mainly of female subjects (59.7%) and nonsmokers (84.8%) and the mean age of the individuals was 39.49 years (Table 1). The minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0.087, and the genotype distribution of the rs2234671 SNP in the CXCR1 gene was consistent with the assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the control (p = 0.1719) and CP groups (p = 0.2777). Significant associations between age and periodontitis were observed by univariate analysis, mainly considering the ORs for age groups 30-39 to the 50-59. We consider that besides the 60-69 and > 70 age groups showed significant OR values they were uncommon and demonstrated a wide range of CI. Significant association was also found between smoking status and periodontitis (OR = 3.8). Therefore, age and smoking status were considered confounding factors. Even though gender was not found to be associated with periodontitis, we included it in the confounding factors in the multivariate analysis, to adjust for any small confounding effects. To more accurately evaluate the strength of any association and to eliminate the distortion caused by confounding effects, multivariate analysis was performed. The multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that neither genotypes nor alleles were associated with periodontitis, even after adjusting for covariates, including age, gender and smoking status (Table 2). Therefore, this polymorphism could not be considered a genetic risk for CP in the studied Brazilian population. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the rs2234671 SNP in the CXCR1 gene was investigated regarding the CP. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are mainly useful in studies of human population genetics and candidate-gene studies for disease association. This makes possible the development of the susceptibility profile concept for specific diseases, like the risk of Alzheimer's, which has been considered to be substantially influenced by a total of ten genetic polymorphisms of inflammation-related molecules. If the high-susceptibility profile for CP be determined, genetically susceptible subjects would be identified earlier and therapeutic intervention strategies could be envisaged aiming prevention of disease establishment. However, many studies with different populations would be needed to reach a high-risk profile for periodontal disease. Another important point to be considered in studying genetic variations is about the functionality of a polymorphism. Considering that the rs2234671 SNP causes a conservative amino acid substitution (S276T) in the third extracellular loop of the CXCR-1 protein, one can suppose whether this event would influence the ligand/binding interaction of the chemokine receptor. This speculation was raised by Liu and colleagues, which found four SNPs (including the rs2234671) in human populations, that were not found in nonhuman primate species when the gene sequences were compared. The authors concluded that there is an accelerated CXCR-1 protein evolution in the human lineage. However, more studies are necessary in order to clarify whether this SNP is functional, and whether it would be under selective pressure aiming to improve innate immunity. Relevant factors known to influence the pathogenesis of periodontitis were assessed by multivariate analysis. Regarding age, there is evidence that both the prevalence and severity of periodontitis increase with increasing age. This can be explained by the cumulative effect of prolonged exposure to other risk factors. There is a multitude of studies (more than 325) that have shown a relationship between smoking and periodontitis. In the present study, smoking was found as a risk factor for periodontitis (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.97-7.33). Interestingly, Tonetti et al. reported that cigarette smoking is associated with two- to threefold increases in the odds of developing periodontitis. Also similar with our results, Tomar & Asma found that current smokers were about four times as likely to have periodontitis than persons who never smoked, after adjusting for covariates such as age, gender and education. Some studies have shown that smokers had significantly worse clinical symptoms of periodontitis than non-smokers. We did not take into account ancestry in our study because we only obtained the skin color information. Although Brazilian population is admixtured, the skin color is not related with ancestry according to Pena et al., Parra et al. and Pimenta et al.. In regards to our hypothesis whether the rs2234671 SNP in the CXCR1 gene would be associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis, the obtained results showing a lack of association permit us to conclude that this SNP was not useful as a genetic risk factor for CP in the studied Brazilian population.

Chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) is a potent attractant protein for monocytes, therefore being previously denominated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). The biological effects of CCL2 are mediated via interactions with its receptor, chemokine C-C motif receptor 2 (CCR2). CCR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor and has also been designated as CD192, CC-CKR-2; CKR2; CMKBR2; MCP-1-R. Upon binding to CCR2, CCL2 regulates the migration and infiltration of monocytes, T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells to regions of inflammation. Studies using CCL2 and CCR2 knockout mice have shown that this ligand-receptor complex is involved in mononuclear cell infiltration at sites of inflammation. In the CNS of several different species including humans, CCR2 expression has been demonstrated in endothelial cells, astrocytes, microglia and neurons. In addition, CCL2 and CCR2 expressing cells are observed in multiple brain regions including the hippocampus and the expression patterns of CCR2 are altered in human neuropathological conditions. These conditions include: multiple sclerosis, HIV encephalopathy, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Thus, CCL2 and CCR2 are expressed by several cell types throughout the CNS and this expression is altered in conditions of neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation occurs after seizures and may contribute to a pro-epileptogenic neural system. This is especially true in the hippocampus, where inflammation has been shown to contribute to neuroplastic changes that may have detrimental consequences. However, alterations to the expression patterns of CCL2 and CCR2 have not been examined following status epilepticus (SE) in a rat experimental model. Such data could contribute greatly to our understanding of this component of the neuroinflammatory response following an initial precipitating injury such as SE. Thus, this study investigated whether CCL2 or CCR2 expression is altered in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced SE. The results show that both CCR2 and CCL2 are increased in the hippocampus following seizures. In addition, it was observed that seizures result in neuroplastic changes to the cell numbers and types that express CCR2. All experimental procedures were approved by the IACUC of the Texas A&M University Health Science Center and the Scott & White Hospital. Animals were housed 2 per cage and maintained in a 12 hour light-dark cycle (06:00-18:00) with food and water provided ad libitum. Adult Sprague Dawley rats (230-235 g) were treated with methyl-scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.; Sigma) 30 min before pilocarpine hydrochloride i.p. injection (320 mg/kg; Sigma). Animal behavior was observed and the onset of SE was considered when animals exhibited a Racine class 3 seizure, that lasted more than 5 minutes and progressed to uncontrollable stage 5 seizures. Ninety minutes after SE onset diazepam i.p. (10 mg/kg; Sigma) was administrated to stop seizures. Only animals that presented at least stage 5 seizures based on Racine's scale were included in the SE group (n = 10). Control rats (n = 10) received the same treatment but were injected with saline instead of pilocarpine. Five days after seizure induction rats were sacrificed for analysis. For immunohistochemical analysis, animals (n = 4 per group) were deeply anesthetized with Euthasol (pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium; 175 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. The brains were removed, postfixed for 24 hours and cryoprotected in sucrose solution. Forty \u03bcm thick sections were cut using a cryostat (Microm HM 505 E) and were processed for immunohistochemistry with anti- CCR2 (rabbit anti-CCR2, 1:200; Abcam). The antibody specificity was verified by omitting the primary CCR2 antibody and also by blocking of CCR2 antibody with the CCR2 peptide (Abcam) that was used as an immunogen for the antibody production. In order to decipher the cell types that express CCR2, double-labeling immunohistochemistry was performed using the following antibodies combined with CCR2 staining: neuronal nuclei protein (mouse anti-NeuN, 1:1000; Chemicon) that stains neurons; microtubule-associated protein 2 (mouse anti-MAP-2, 1:1000; Millipore), a neuron-specific microtubule protein; glial fibrillary acidic protein (mouse anti-GFAP-Cy3, 1:500; Sigma), a marker of astrocytes; ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (goat anti-Iba1, 1:500; Abcam) that stains macrophage/microglia and a marker of endothelial cells (mouse anti-ICAM-1, 1:200, R&D Systems). Tissue processing for immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described. Briefly, sections were incubated in 0.5% H2O2 for 30 min and 1% H2O2 for 1 hr, followed by PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) rinsing. Nonspecific staining was blocked by incubating the tissue for 1 hr in 3% normal goat serum (Vector Labs), in PBS. Sections were next incubated in primary antibodies, in PBS with 3% normal goat serum and 0.05% Tween-20, rotating for 48 hr, at 4\u00b0C. Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated with secondary fluorescent antibodies (Alexa 488 and 555, 1:200; Millipore), rotating at RT for 90 min. The tissue was next rinsed in PBS baths. It should be noted that the anti-GFAP (Sigma) is conjugated to CY3, thus no secondary antibody was used. It should also be noted that for the anti-Iba1 reaction, normal horse serum (3%; Vector Labs) was used instead of normal goat serum. Brain sections were then mounted onto glass slides and coverslips were applied with hard set mounting medium with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Labs), to allow nuclear visualization. All immuno-labeling was verified using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview 1000). The sequential scanning feature was used to ensure that cross-excitation did not occur. The 3-D confocal images were processed and analyzed with FV10-ASW (version 1.7a) software. To confirm double-labeling of CCR2 with NeuN and GFAP, quantitative co-localization analyses were employed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient, overlap coefficient and co-localization coefficients M1 and M2. Pearson's correlation coefficient is used to describe the correlation of the intensity variation between channels. Overlap coefficient indicates the intersecting volume of the signals. The co-localization coefficients M1 and M2 indicate the contribution of one color channel in the co-localized area. In this study M1 represent a contribution of CCR2, while M2 show a contribution of NeuN or GFAP. In order to generate the co-localization coefficients the regions of interest of each image were selected and the average of the result of each slice that composed the final image was used. Once staining was verified using the confocal microscope, the number of cells expressing CCR2 was estimated using the optical dissector method. Analysis was performed in different hippocampal regions using a microscope (Nikon Eclipse MU) with a motorized stage connected to a computer running the Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience). Briefly, the dentate gyrus, and hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3 were examined in 5 sections per rat. For the dentate gyrus tracing, molecular and granular layers were delineated together and are referred as ML/GCL in the text. Preliminary population estimates were performed. Based on these population estimates, a counting frame of 100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm was distributed in a randomly positioned lattice of 200 \u00d7 200 \u03bcm. CCR2 positive (CCR2+) cells were counted using as criteria staining in defined round cell bodies. Cellular processes were not considered for stereological counting. In addition to CCR2-labeled cells, the number of CCR2/NeuN double-labeled cells was also counted within the same counting frame. Results were statistically analyzed using a t-test and are presented as density of cells/mm3 \u00b1 SEM. The 3-D images of microglia cells stained with Iba1 and CCR2 + cells were captured as described in the section \"Confocal images\". Using the Olympus FV10-ASW (version 1.7a) software, the CCR2+ cell body and the cell body of the closest Iba1+ cell were traced using the Free Area tool. Using the Line tool, a line was traced between the closest drawn borders of the two cell bodies. The Measurement command calculated the length of the line traced indicating the distance between the CCR2+ cell and microglia in \u03bcm. Results were statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test and are presented as mean distance (\u03bcm) \u00b1 SEM. Animals (n = 6 per group) were deeply anesthetized and then decapitated. The brain was quickly removed from the skull and the hippocampus and cerebellum were dissected and immediately frozen in methylbutane in dry ice. CCL2 tissue levels were assayed against a standard curve provided by the Milliplex MAP kit (Millipore) and was performed per manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 25 \u03bcl of standard, control or a tissue homogenate sample was added to 25 \u03bcl assay buffer. To this solution, 25 \u03bcl of beads were added and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 4\u00b0C. The beads were washed twice with wash buffer and incubated with 25 \u03bcl of detection antibody at RT for 2 hrs, followed by the addition of 25 \u03bcl of Streptavidin-Phycoerythrin compound and allowed to incubate 30 min at RT. The beads were then washed twice with wash buffer and incubated with 150 \u03bcl of Sheath Fluid for 5 min at RT. The fluorescence intensity was measured on the Luminex machine (Millipore, 100 \u03bcl, 50 beads per bead set) and the analyte concentration was determined using the BioRad software (BioPlex Manager version 5.0). The assay was run in triplicate to confirm the results. The tissue concentration of CCL2 was normalized to the total protein concentration and presented as pg/\u03bcg of total protein \u00b1 SEM. In normal adult rats, the CCR2 immunohistochemical analysis revealed a sparse distribution of cells expressing CCR2 in the hippocampus. In rats that experienced SE, although still sparse, there were significantly more cells labeled with CCR2 (Figure 1). These cells were characterized mainly by punctate staining of cell bodies with limited staining over proximal processes. In addition to increased cell body staining in SE rats, CCR2 labeling was observed in isolated processes that appeared to have either a neuronal or glial phenotype (Figure 1). This pattern of staining was most robust in the dentate gyrus and CA1 region of the hippocampus. Control rats exhibited similar cell body staining, but rarely presented isolated stained processes. Any visible staining was eliminated when the primary antibody was omitted or was conjugated with the CCR2 peptide (data not shown). Quantitative stereological analysis showed that rats with SE have a significantly increased expression of CCR2 in hippocampal CA1 compared with control rats (p = 0.003, t-test; Figure 1). Results from the cytokine assay also showed a significant increase (p = 0.001) in the expression of CCL2 in the hippocampus of SE rats compared with control animals (Figure 1). There was no change in the CCL2 expression in the cerebellum (Figure 1). This region was used as a control area because it is not greatly affected relative to limbic structures by pilocarpine-induced seizures. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry revealed CCR2+ cells that co-label for NeuN-labeled neurons (Figure 2). The CCR2 staining appeared punctiform and predominantly localized to the surface of the neuron cell body. Since NeuN primarily stains the nucleus of the neuron and to a lesser extent labels the peripheral cytoplasm and proximal processes, the co-localization coefficients were not very robust in these double-labeled preparations (Table 1). Stereological quantification revealed a significant increase in the density of CCR2/NeuN double-labeled cells in CA1 of SE rats (p = 0.029, Figure 3). Further analyses showed that almost all (> 99%) CCR2-expressing cells were double-labeled with NeuN in the molecular and granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus and CA1 region of the hippocampus in control animals. Alternatively, in SE rats, this percentage significantly decreased to approximately 80% of CCR2-labeled cells that co-label with NeuN (p = 0.029; Figure 3). Additional qualitative examination of the neuronal population expressing CCR2 showed a sub-population of MAP-2 labeled cell bodies that also expressed CCR2 (Figure 4). However, MAP-2 labeled neuronal processes were rarely found to double-label with CCR2 (Figure 4). In addition to the neuronal localization of CCR2, the SE rats had a population of non-neuronal processes labeled for CCR2. These processes were primarily observed in hippocampal area CA1, as well as in the dentate gyrus. Such a robust labeling was not observed in the control rats. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry with anti-GFAP demonstrated that the majority of these CCR2-labeled processes from SE rats were astrocytic (Figure 5). These double-labeled astrocytic processes often appeared hypertrophied (Figure 5). In the dentate gyrus, some of the CCR2-labeled astrocytic processes were the radial glial processes that extend through the granule cell layer and this pattern of labeling was more pronounced in the SE rats. In addition, a relatively robust population of CCR2-labeled astrocytic processes were orientated into the hilus (Figure 5). Such processes were not observed in the control group. The high co-localization coefficients presented in Table 1 confirm the extent of CCR2 and GFAP double-labeling in CA1 and dentate gyrus of SE rats. Double-labeling with the microglial cell marker Iba1 and CCR2 did not reveal CCR2/Iba-1 double labeling in either the control or SE rats (data not shown). A significant difference was found in the relationship of the proximity between microglial cells and CCR2-labeled cells following SE, such that the microglial cells are more closely apposed to the CCR2-labeled cells. In fact, in some cases, microglial cells appeared to be engulfing the CCR2+ cells (Figure 6). On the other hand, in control animals, there were less microglial cells and these cells did not exhibit an activated morphology that was seen in SE rats. The decrease in the distance between CCR2+ cell and the closest microglia cell was significant in CA1, CA3, hilus, and in the ML/GCL of the dentate gyrus in SE rats when compared with control rats (p \u2264 0.001 in all regions; Figure 6). In addition to the neuronal and glial characterization of CCR2 expressing cells, the double immunohistochemistry for CCR2 and ICAM-1, showed that a small population of CCR2-labeled cells were double-labeled for the endothelial cell marker ICAM-1 in SE rats (Figure 7). Additionally, in the SE rats, CCR2+ cells were more frequently observed juxtaposed with endothelial cells, in the perivascular regions, relative to controls (Figure 7). The results of the present study show that CCR2 and CCL2 are increased in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced seizures. These data also demonstrate that seizures result in selective changes to the cell types that express CCR2. Analysis of the cell types expressing CCR2 shows that SE rats had an increased density of NeuN-labeled neurons expressing CCR2, compared to control rats. However, the fraction of CCR2-labeled cells that double-labeled for NeuN in control rats was almost 100%, compared to about 80% in SE rats. Therefore, in addition to the increased neuronal CCR2 expression, other cell types are induced to express CCR2 following seizures. It seems that GFAP-labeled astrocytes, more specifically their processes, are a major source of increased CCR2 labeling in the hippocampus following SE. This data is consistent with reports of CCR2 expression by astrocytes in other conditions of neuroinflammation. It is important to note that CCR2 labeling in astrocytic processes was not considered for stereological cell counts and the additional CCR2-labeled cell bodies did not appear to be astrocytes. Therefore, other cell types might contribute to increased cellular expression of CCR2 after seizures. Although no Iba1/CCR2 co-labeling was observed, it is possible that these cells might express CCR2 at different timepoints after injury. Increased expression of CCL2 in this study is consistent with data from humans, showing elevated levels of CCL2 in tissue from patients with intractable epilepsy. Functionally, increased CCL2 and CCR2 expression in the hippocampus might be a mechanism to activate and recruit inflammatory cells to this injured site after seizures. It is known that that CCL2 binds to CCR2 on brain endothelial cells and contributes to increased brain endothelial permeability. This increased permeability promotes the recruitment of inflammatory cells, such as monocytes and leukocytes at sites of inflammation. Following pilocarpine-induced SE, it was shown that CCR2 is expressed by some endothelial and perivascular cells. These cells partially account for the non-neuronal increase in cellular expression of CCR2 after SE. The close relationship between activated microglia and CCR2-labeled cells in SE animals suggest that the chemokine-receptor interaction might influence the glial reactivity. Since CCR2-labeled cell bodies presented neuronal morphology it is possible that the microglial activity may be related with neuronal damage following SE. Through activation of CCR2, the chemokine CCL2 is able to direct the movement of astrocytes. The fact that CCR2 expression by astrocytes was robustly observed in CA1 and the dentate gyrus following SE, is consistent with the idea that these regions are typically damaged after prolonged seizures. The data showing CCR2 expression by hypertrophied astrocytes in the dentate gyrus following seizures is of particular interest because previous studies have shown astrocyte and microglial activation in the dentate gyrus at the same 5 day timepoint following pilocarpine-induced seizures. In addition, previous studies have shown that after SE, hilar basal dendrites from immature neurons aberrantly grow along an ectopic glial scaffold into the hilus. The astrocytic processes that contribute to the ectopic glial scaffold were observed to be in a similar location as the CCR2-labeled astrocytic processes in this study. It is pertinent to note that the hilar basal dendrites that grow along these astrocytic processes are integrated into an aberrant circuit that may facilitate seizure activity. Thus, astrocytic CCR2 may be involved in mediating neuroplastic changes to newly generated neurons and their associated astrocytes following seizures. Consistent with the notion that CCR2 may play a role in adult neurogenesis are the data showing neural progenitor cells in the adult brain that express CCR2. It is thought that this expression is involved in directing migration of neuronal progenitor cells to sites of neuroinflammation. Interestingly, ectopic migration of newborn neurons into the hilus is another seizure-induced neuroplastic change that contributes to a hyper-excitable circuitry. Thus, it is plausible that increased CCL2 and CCR2 expression in the dentate gyrus are involved in pro-epileptogenic, neurogenic alterations. Future experiments using knockout mice and/or pharmacological manipulations will be needed to test this hypothesis. In conclusion, this study shows increased expression of CCL2 and CCR2 in the hippocampus following seizures. The results also demonstrate that CCR2 is preferentially increased in neurons and astrocytic processes after SE. In light of the existing literature suggesting an inflammatory role in epileptogenesis, the data suggest that this chemokine-receptor interaction might be involved in the epileptogenic progression. Future studies should examine the effect of manipulating this chemokine/receptor complex and its effect on seizures."}, "26115410": {"pmid": "26115410", "pmcid": "PMC4749078", "title": "Mechanisms Underlying Latent Disease Risk Associated with Early-Life Arsenic Exposure: Current Research Trends and Scientific Gaps", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nMillions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in their drinking water.

One of the largest threats to human health worldwide, particularly in rural and developing areas, is the presence of high levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in drinking water. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that the levels of iAs in drinking water should not exceed 10 ppb (WHO 2011), > 100 million people worldwide are believed to be exposed to levels in drinking water that exceed this limit (Uddin and Huda 2011). Much of this exposure is attributable to the use of iAs-contaminated groundwater as a source of drinking water. Although groundwater may be contaminated with iAs due to anthropogenic activities, it is most often contaminated due to geological leaching. Rural areas and developing countries are often particularly impacted based on their reliance on groundwater as a source of drinking water. In terms of affected populations, the impact of this exposure is perhaps most evident in areas of Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh and India. For instance, it has been estimated that 35\u201377 million of the 125 million inhabitants of Bangladesh may have been exposed to iAs levels in drinking water that exceed the WHO standard. In addition to the situation in Southeast Asia, it is becoming increasingly clear that iAs contamination of groundwater and surface waters is a worldwide problem. Inorganic As concentrations in groundwater have been detected around the globe at levels that greatly exceed the WHO standard, suggesting many more populations may be at risk. Although countries such as the United States have adopted the WHO standard for limiting iAs exposure via municipally supplied water, many people in these countries, perhaps numbering in the millions, may still be exposed to relatively high levels of iAs via use of unregulated private wells supplied with groundwater. Exposure for populations who generally have more moderate iAs exposure from drinking water than Southeast Asian populations also may occur through the consumption of certain foods such as rice and rice products [Cottingham et al. 2013; Davis et al. 2012; European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 2009]. This is of particular concern to vulnerable subpopulations such as infants and young children who have increased susceptibility to toxicants and may consume relatively large proportions of rice-containing products compared with adults. Numerous and varied health effects are attributed to iAs exposure in human populations, such as adverse pregnancy/birth outcomes, increased morbidity and mortality in infants and children, cognitive impairments in children, and the development of noncommunicable diseases in adults including cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and various cancers. The carcinogenic impacts of chronic iAs exposure are among the best-characterized and most intensely studied effects of iAs. These effects have been reported at a wide variety of iAs concentrations including relatively low concentrations observed in the United States. Inorganic As is classified as a known human carcinogen that targets multiple organs including the skin, lung, urinary bladder, and liver (International Agency for Research on Cancer 2012; National Research Council 2001). Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that link iAs exposure to disease has proven to be a daunting task given the complexity of disease states and multiplicity of factors that likely influence disease development. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the development of iAs-associated cancers, including the generation of oxidative stress, interference with DNA repair, alterations in cellular signaling, and alterations to the genome and epigenome. No single mechanism has emerged as a key event, and it is likely that iAs exerts carcinogenic effects via multiple mechanisms. In the present commentary we summarize the current state of knowledge of the relationship between early-life iAs exposure and altered disease risk. In particular, we highlight research needs that would best elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking early-life exposure to iAs and cancer development later in life. Epigenetic reprogramming has been a major research focus in this area, and we highlight this as well as two additional and likely interacting mechanisms that may contribute to carcinogenic effects associated with early-life iAs exposure, namely the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and perturbed immune function. In both exposed human populations and experimental animals, exposure to iAs during critical developmental periods has been shown to be sufficient to alter the risk of developing adverse health effects much later in life. For instance, iAs has been shown to cause delayed carcinogenic effects in several strains of mice when they are exposed briefly during the prenatal period. This effect was first observed in C3H mice, in which offspring born to pregnant females exposed briefly to high doses of sodium arsenite [NaAs2O3; iAs(III)] in drinking water [42.5 or 85 ppm arsenic during gestational days (GD) 8\u201318] resulted in increased incidence and/or multiplicity of tumors in multiple organs in both female and male adult offspring. Sex-specific effects were observed, including a pronounced dose\u2013response effect in the incidence and multiplicity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a major form of cancer associated with chronic iAs exposure in humans, in male offspring. Exposure to iAs(III) prenatally as described above followed by postnatal application of tumor-promoting agents was also found to produce cancers, tumors, and/or proliferative lesions in some organs, and to have initiating effects in other organs in several strains of mice. Prenatal iAs exposure is also associated with accelerated/exacerbated atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein A-knockout (ApoE\u2013/\u2013) mice, a mouse strain used to study atherosclerotic disease. In this model, male offspring born to pregnant ApoE\u2013/\u2013 mice administered 85 ppm iAs(III) from GD8 to birth (GD20) is associated with evidence of increased atherosclerotic disease in male offspring 10 and 16 weeks after birth compared to controls. Other effects have also been reported at significantly lower doses, such as cognitive impairments in adult C57B16/J mice that were born to dams exposed to 100 \u03bcg/L iAs in drinking water from 1 week before conception until birth. In epidemiologic studies with an ecological design, a defined period of iAs exposure in northern Chile revealed several similarities to the mouse studies cited above, namely that early-life exposure to iAs was associated with a variety of latent health impacts, some of which are sex dependent. For instance, young adults (age 30\u201349 years) who experienced prenatal and/or childhood exposure via high levels of iAs in municipally supplied drinking water (average level, 860 \u03bcg/L) in the Antofagasta region of northern Chile between 1958 and 1970 had increased mortality from both cancerous and noncancerous effects, including chronic renal disease, chronic lung disease, acute myocardial infarction, and cancers of the urinary bladder, larynx, kidney, lung, and liver. Although ecologic studies may be limited by a lack of individual exposure and outcome data, these findings have been supported by a case\u2013control study in the same part of Chile with individual data linking the early life exposures with increased cancer risk in adults. Taken together, these results highlight the sensitivity of early-life periods to the effects of iAs, notably at very high levels of exposure, and a major research focus in recent years has been to understand the molecular alterations that link exposure during these periods to delayed effects, particularly cancers, later in life. As discussed in more detail below, analyses of tissue from target organs in C3H and ApoE\u2013/\u2013 mice that were prenatally exposed to iAs indicated that this altered disease susceptibility was associated with persistent changes in the expression and epigenetic landscape of genes implicated in disease development. These observations are consistent with theories that suggest permanent alterations or \u201creprogramming\u201d of the epigenome is a critical link between toxicant exposure in early life and altered disease risk later in life (Bollati and Baccarelli 2010; Jirtle and Skinner 2007). The epigenome, widely considered to include DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and microRNAs (miRNAs), plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression; therefore, epigenetic reprogramming by toxicants may alter the susceptibility to adverse health outcomes by causing persistent changes in expression patterns of genes involved in disease development. Epigenetic reprogramming has been a major focus of research efforts that have set out to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the link between early-life iAs exposure and altered disease risk. Epigenetic reprogramming/alterations in gene expression. There are several indications in transplacental exposure models that iAs may alter disease risk in adulthood via epigenetic reprograming and altered gene expression. For instance, liver tissue isolated from newborn male mice exposed to hepatocarcinogenic doses of iAs in utero had alterations in GC-rich regions throughout the genome and altered expression of genes implicated in liver tumorigenesis. The expression profiles of similar disease-associated genes were also observed in HCCs and peritumorous tissue in transplacentally exposed adult male mice. Of particular interest was the increased expression of estrogen receptor alpha (Er-\u03b1), which was concurrent with hypomethylation of several regions of DNA in the Er-\u03b1 promoter. This is of potential significance because there is often an inverse relationship between promoter methylation status and transcriptional competency. In the ApoE\u2013/\u2013 atherosclerosis model, brief prenatal exposure to 49 ppm iAs(III) in maternal drinking water was shown to alter the transcriptional profiles in the livers of male mice that were evident at postnatal day (PND) 1 and PND 70; interestingly, the altered mRNA and miRNA profiles differed between these two time points, which is consistent with reprogramming of gene expression profiles in the liver. Although the mouse transplacental carcinogenesis models support an associative relationship between alterations in DNA methylation and the altered expression of key genes, it is unknown whether this relationship is causal, and the mechanisms that underlie the altered DNA methylation patterns are unknown. The molecular events that cause the reprogramming of gene expression in the mouse atherosclerosis model are also unknown and must be explored. In addition, the impact of other epigenetic alterations in the developmental origins of iAs-based disease has been relatively unexplored in animal models. One study revealed an association in C57B16/J mice between transplacental exposure to 100 \u03bcg/L iAs in maternal drinking water, alterations in global H3K9 acetylation patterns, and cognitive impairments in adulthood, which is of potential significance because changes in histone acetylation patterns have been reported in cognitive insufficiencies. These studies also highlight that epigenetic alterations may be a mechanism by which iAs may cause a variety of adverse health effects throughout the lifetime of an individual, many of which are likely unrecognized. Chronic respiratory symptoms have been reported to be increased in children following early-life exposure to iAs in Bangladesh, although without evidence of reduced lung function. A recent study reported that early-life exposure to iAs was associated with reduced lung function in children. The results of these studies need to be confirmed, but they underscore that long latency periods are not necessarily associated with all adverse health effects associated with early-life iAs exposure. A major area of focus in recent years has been the examination of alterations in gene expression and epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and miRNAs, that are associated with early-life iAs exposure in humans. Many of these analyses have focused on alterations observed in cord blood leukocytes. Related to prenatal iAs exposure and transcriptional change, a transcriptomics approach identified 447 iAs-responsive genes in cord blood leukocytes in newborns from Thailand (n = 32; range of maternal toenail arsenic levels in unexposed subjects, 0.10\u20130.38 \u03bcg/g; or exposed subjects, 0.50\u201368.63 \u03bcg/g). Most of these genes had increased expression levels associated with iAs exposure and were enriched for roles in immune and inflammatory response, stress response, and cancer/tumorigenesis. Related to epigenetic regulation of the transcriptional response, in Mexican newborns (n = 40; range of iAs in maternal drinking water = < 1 to 236 \u03bcg/L), 12 miRNAs and 334 mRNAs were identified that were correlated with arsenic levels of total urinary arsenic in maternal urine (range of U-tAs, 6.2\u2013319.7 \u03bcg/L). Functional analyses indicated the modulated miRNAs are known to be regulators of cellular responses such as inflammation and diseases with known links to iAs exposure including cancer and diabetes mellitus. Nine of the modulated miRNAs were predicted to regulate the expression levels of approximately 20% of the U-tAs-associated mRNAs, providing an indication that miRNAs regulate, at least to some extent, the transcriptional response to prenatal iAs exposure. Several analyses have examined iAs-associated perturbations of cord blood proteins. For instance, the level of several proinflammatory cytokines in the cord blood of Bangladeshi newborns (n = 130; median U-tAs = 66 \u03bcg/L), namely interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interferon gamma (INF-\u03b3), had U-shaped curves across quartiles of maternal U-tAs at gestational week 30 (GW30). Using a proteomic strategy, Bailey et al. (2014) identified a total of 111 maternal U-tAs\u2013associated cord blood proteins in Mexican newborns (n = 50; range of U-tAs, 6.2\u2013319.7 \u03bcg/L). These proteins were enriched in functions related to immune/inflammatory response and cellular development/proliferation, and the majority were predicted to be regulated by TNF, a protein that is implicated in the development of several adverse health effects associated with iAs exposure. Most newborns had a positive association between the levels of proteins and U-tAs, which was consistent with a proinflammatory response. However, this relationship was inverted in some newborns, underscoring an interindividual response to prenatal iAs exposure that may impact susceptibility to adverse health outcomes. The basis for these interindividual differences remains unknown but may be related to iAs metabolism. These studies reveal that at the mRNA, miRNA, and protein levels, genes with similar functions such as immune response are altered in the cord blood of prenatally exposed newborns across several populations. As discussed below, alterations in immune function are implicated in a variety of adverse health impacts associated with early-life iAs exposure. Still, a precise mechanistic relationship between these alterations and adverse health impacts remains unknown. Furthermore, although leukocytes have roles in immune function, the relevance of altered gene expression profiles in leukocytes to the development/susceptibility of adverse effects in other target tissues is unclear. Studies that have examined epigenetic effects associated with early-life iAs exposure have focused on changes in DNA methylation at both the gene-specific level and global level. Gene-specific changes may be significant because they impart functional changes in gene expression levels. Global changes in methylation status of the genome may also be important because such changes may be associated with genetic instability. More recent studies have used genome-wide approaches to identify associations between iAs exposure and the methylation status of individual CpG sites, the primary target of DNA methylation in humans. Sex-dependent relationships have been observed between the global DNA methylation status of cord blood leukocytes of Bangladeshi newborns (n = 101; range of iAs in maternal drinking water, 0.01\u201366.1 \u03bcg/L), and prenatal iAs exposure, in which this relationship was positive in newborn males and negative in newborn females. In Thailand (n = 71; range of iAs in maternal drinking water, 0.18\u20138.38 \u03bcg/L), the methylation status of long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1) elements was used as an indicator of changes in global DNA methylation levels. No associations between LINE-1 methylation and indicators of prenatal iAs exposure were observed, but this study did identify a positive relationship between in utero arsenic exposure and DNA methylation of the tumor protein 53 (TP53) promoter. In iAs-exposed mother\u2013child pairs in Bangladesh (n = 113; range of iAs in maternal drinking water, < 1 to 230 \u03bcg/L), the relationship between iAs exposure and DNA methylation patterns of LINE-1 and the TP53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A/p16) promoters were examined in maternal and umbilical cord leukocytes. Similar DNA methylation patterns were observed in mothers and newborns, which included a positive association between maternal U-tAs and LINE-1 methylation and some CpG sites within the p16 promoter. Evidence of a nonlinear dose\u2013response relationship was also observed, as the most effects were observed in the middle tertiles of exposure. These results raise the possibility that epigenetic effects may be observed at relatively moderate levels of exposure, and that dose\u2013response relationships may be complex, thus underscoring the need for follow-up studies. Several genome-wide analyses have identified changes in cord blood DNA methylation profiles associated with prenatal iAs exposure. One study identified changes observed in New Hampshire newborns exposed to relatively low levels of iAs in utero (average iAs in maternal drinking water, 1.2 \u03bcg/L; average U-tAs, 4.1 \u03bcg/L). Several DNA regions were identified in which there was a relationship between DNA methylation levels and maternal U-tAs, but no overall change in the global DNA methylation status was observed. Most of these differentially methylated regions were found to be within CpG islands, the CpG-rich areas of euchromatin known to epigenetically regulate gene expression. In Bangladesh (n = 127; median maternal U-tAs at GW30, 89 \u03bcg/L), an inverse correlation was observed between maternal U-tAs and the DNA methylation status of cord blood CpG sites predominantly in boys, and pathway-level analyses of differentially methylated genes revealed an overrepresentation of functions associated with cancer development in boys compared with girls. Another genome-wide analysis of cord blood of prenatally exposed Bangladeshi newborns identified differential methylation within CpG regions of cord blood leukocytes in relationship to prenatal arsenic exposure. Importantly, this analysis identified a positive association of DNA methylation of CpG regions within 71 genes and levels with iAs in maternal drinking water after adjusting for U-tAs\u2013associated shifts in leukocyte populations, thus highlighting that alterations in DNA methylation profiles must be corrected for shifts in leukocyte populations that may occur due to iAs exposure. To date, one genome-wide study has investigated the relationship between changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in prenatally exposed newborns. In this Mexican population (n = 38; arsenic in maternal drinking water, 1\u2013236 \u03bcg/L; mean U-tAs, 73.87 \u03bcg/L), the methylation status of CpG sites from 2,919 genes isolated from newborn cord blood was found to be associated with prenatal iAs exposure. DNA methylation changes within the first exon and within 200 bp of the transcription start site yielded the most significant association with gene expression profiles. In addition, a set of 7 target genes including growth-associated and diabetes-associated genes such as the imprinted gene KCNQ1 (potassium voltage\u2013gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1) were differentially methylated, differentially expressed, and associated with birth outcomes/measures in relationship to prenatal arsenic exposure. This research identified a commonality at the sequence level of the differentially methylated genes related to transcriptional factor binding. This transcription factor occupancy was proposed as a basis for gene-specific DNA methylation patterning that could underlie responses to iAs and other environmental contaminants. Taken together, these studies reveal several important findings: that iAs-associated alterations in DNA methylation patterns are observed across populations that are exposed to varying levels of iAs, and that complex dose\u2013response relationships have been observed. Effects may be sex-dependent and mother\u2013child pairs have similar alteration patterns, which may have relevance to sex-dependent and interindividual susceptibility to iAs-associated disease. The relevance of these alterations to long-term disease susceptibility and, to a large extent, changes in gene expression patterns at the mRNA or protein level remains unknown and must be explored. As with gene expression patterns, the relevance of changes in DNA methylation patterns in blood leukocytes to disease risk in various target organs is also unknown. Cancer stem cells. In vitro and in vivo evidence has indicated that the emergence of CSCs after prenatal iAs exposure may play important roles in the development of some iAs-associated cancers, including those associated with prenatal iAs exposure. CSCs have altered stem cell (SC) functions but retain some characteristics that are key for their survival and later development into cancers such as self-renewal, quiescence, ability to differentiate, and conditional mortality. In the iAs-exposed fetus, CSCs are believed to arise from normal SCs or slightly differentiated SC progeny and remain quiescent in target organs until ultimately transforming into malignant cells. Interestingly, evidence suggests that CSC overabundance is a characteristic not of all carcinogens but of at least some iAs-associated cancers; for instance, the malignant transformation of the prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 by iAs exposure in vitro resulted in an overabundance of CSCs compared with RWPE-1 cells transformed by cadmium or N-methyl-N-nitrosurea. Arsenic-transformed malignant epithelial cells have also been shown to \u201crecruit\u201d normal SCs into a CSC phenotype, which may help explain the CSC overabundance often observed in iAs-induced tumors and iAs-transformed cell lines. The triggers that end the quiescent state to produce cancers are unknown but may include the effects of continued exposure to iAs during the postnatal period or postnatal exposure to other chemicals. For instance, an overabundance of CSCs was observed in the highly aggressive squamous-cell carcinomas (SSCs) that developed in Tg.AC mice after prenatally exposure to carcinogenic doses (42.5 and 85 ppm) of iAs(III) followed by postnatal application of 2 \u03bcg/0.1 mL acetone 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate to the skin for 36 weeks. There is evidence that aberrant gene expression is a key, early event in the development of CSCs. For instance, the fetal skin of Tg.AC mice that were prenatally exposed to iAs demonstrated increased expression of several genes associated with SC/carcinogenesis functions including the oncogene v-Ha-ras, a cell surface marker of keratinocyte SCs and cancer skin cells (CD34), and a gene involved in keratinocyte SC renewal, namely ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1). Similar to results observed in fetal skin, an examination of the highly aggressive SCCs that developed in Tg.AC mice after prenatal arsenic exposure and postnatal TPA exposure also revealed high expression of v-Ha-ras and the CSC markers CD34 and Rac compared with tumors that arose after TPA treatment alone. A comparison of the tumors arising from these two treatment groups showed increased expression levels of the pro-growth gene Cd1 and decreased expression of tumor suppressor p16 in the aggressive SCCs in the iAs arsenic/TPA group. These data demonstrate a relationship between gene expression and the acquisition of malignant phenotype. The mechanisms that link iAs exposure and changes in gene expression patterns of these key genes in CSCs remain understudied and must be addressed. No alterations were shown in the DNA methylation status of the v-Ha-ras promoter concurrent with increased v-Ha-ras expression, even though v-Ha-ras expression has been shown to be controlled by promoter DNA methylation status in Tg.AC mice. These results underscore that both epigenetic and non-epigenetic regulatory mechanisms must be explored as potential mechanisms of iAs-induced changes in gene expression, and that it must be taken into account that experimental outcomes depend on a variety of factors including differences in experimental design and methods used. Immunomodulatory effects. There is considerable evidence from in vitro studies, a range of animal models, and chronically/prenatally exposed human populations that iAs has various immunomodulatory effects. Interestingly, the effects of iAs on the immune system are complex and seemingly divergent as they include evidence of both immunosuppression and inflammation, and markers of both effects have been observed simultaneously in exposed populations. At the molecular level, there are several indications that the immune system is a major target of iAs toxicity as immune response is a predominant function associated with perturbed mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins in the cord blood of iAs-exposed newborns from Mexico or Thailand. As discussed below, the immunosuppressive and proinflammatory effects may contribute not only to long-term health effects of iAs such as cancers but to adverse short-term health effects associated with early-life iAs exposure as well. Immunosuppression is a significant health concern because of the major roles of the immune system in functions such as healing wounds and providing defense against microbial infections and cancers. Indicators of immunosuppression that have been observed in prenatally exposed infants in Bangladesh include higher mortality, reduced thymic indices, reduced T-cell function, and higher morbidity rates from pneumonia and diarrhea. There is evidence that more moderate levels of prenatal exposure can also affect immune response, as prenatal iAs exposure was associated with total number of infections requiring physician visit/prescription medication in infants in New Hampshire. It is currently unknown whether immunosuppressive effects associated with prenatal iAs exposure persist into later life. If these effects are sustained, they will likely increase the susceptibility to infections and chronic diseases including cancers that have been associated with iAs exposure. There are also indicators of proinflammatory effects in prenatally exposed infants such as the increased expression of proinflammatory genes at the mRNA and protein levels in newborn cord blood, evidence of oxidative damage in the placenta, and increased expression of proinflammatory proteins in the placenta such as IL1-\u03b2, TNF, and IFN-\u03b3. As a potent producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), iAs can stimulate proinflammatory effects that not only cause macromolecule damage but also activate ROS-sensitive signaling pathways implicated in disease development such as those that involve mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB). Of note, inflammation is associated with several diseases associated with iAs exposure including adverse birth/pregnancy outcomes, and a sustained inflammatory state is implicated in the development of several chronic diseases associated with iAs exposure including cancers, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and liver fibrosis. Therefore, it is likely that susceptibility to early- and later-life disease development may be linked in part to the complex impacts of prenatal iAs exposure on the immune system. Studies in both animal models and human populations have revealed that exposure to iAs during key developmental periods is associated with the development of latent health effects including cancers. Because of the latent nature of many of the effects of iAs exposure, the actual extent of the impact of such exposure is likely underestimated. Although the research relating early-life exposure to iAs and the development of long-term health effects continues to advance, many knowledge gaps remain. Detailed molecular analyses in animal models that employ gene knockouts or chemical inhibition of targeted pathways are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms linking iAs exposure and adverse health effects. In addition, relationships must be identified between early-life iAs exposure, molecular alterations, and short-term and long-term health impacts. In many cases, it is unknown whether molecular alterations associated with iAs exposure are persistent. Thus future research should help to differentiate between adaptive versus adverse alterations and may establish biomarkers of exposure and disease susceptibility. It is also clear that some disease-specific mechanisms such as CSCs exist, but that others such as epigenetic reprogramming and alterations in immune function may contribute to the development of numerous adverse health impacts. Studies must also continue to examine effects observed across a wide range of iAs exposure levels in different populations across the globe, which will help inform dose\u2013response relationships, sex-dependent impacts, and cofactors contributing to disease susceptibility. Taken together, the studies described here underscore that there are likely multiple mechanisms that contribute to the development of latent diseases associated with early-life iAs exposure."}, "27930654": {"pmid": "27930654", "pmcid": "PMC5145144", "title": "Whole-Organism Developmental Expression Profiling Identifies RAB-28 as a Novel Ciliary GTPase Associated with the BBSome and Intraflagellar Transport", "abstract": "\nPrimary cilia are specialised sensory and developmental signalling devices extending from the surface of most eukaryotic cells. Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs. Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161 (FAM161A orthologue), CCDC-104 (CCDC104), and RPI-1 (RP1/RP1L1), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. Whereas inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil RAB28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL4/IFT27, as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.\n", "fulltext": "The cilium is a conserved organelle, inferred to have existed in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) and now present in most extant protists, as well as all multicellular animals. Motile cilia generate cell movement or fluid flow, whereas non-motile (primary) cilia have evolved as specialised \u2018antennae\u2019 that capture extracellular sensory cues and orchestrate extrinsic signal transduction pathways linked to development (e.g., Sonic hedgehog). Cilium dysfunction in humans is associated with a growing number of so-called ciliopathies that affect virtually all physiological and developmental functions. For example, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) includes retinal degeneration, cystic kidneys, obesity and skeletal anomalies (polydactyly) as primary ailments. Cilia are subdivided into distinct subcompartments, each with unique structural and functional features, as well as molecular compositions. The canonical cilium of 9 doublet microtubules (MTs) extends from a mother centriole-derived basal body, which connects via distal appendages (transition fibers) to the plasma membrane. The proximal-most 0.2\u20131.0 \u03bcm of the axoneme, called the transition zone, functions in early ciliogenesis, and together with basal body structures provides a permeability barrier that separates the ciliary cytosol and membrane from the cell body [6\u20138]. Additional subregions include the inversin and distal tip compartments, as well as the ciliary pocket, which is a depression of the periciliary membrane where the basal body is rooted. Many ciliopathy proteins and associated complexes localise to particular ciliary subcompartments, where they conduct subdomain-specific functions. Cilia rely on various intracellular transport systems to sort and deliver the protein cargo required for cilium formation, maintenance and function. The best understood is intraflagellar transport (IFT), which consists of large macro-molecular assemblies that move bidirectionally between the ciliary base and tip, driven by kinesin-2 anterograde (base to tip) and IFT-dynein retrograde (tip to base) motors [11\u201313]. Associated with the motors\u2014and essential for IFT\u2014are the IFT-A and IFT-B complexes, which likely serve as cargo adaptors. The IFT-associated BBS complex (BBSome) also tethers ciliary cargo and regulates the coupling of IFT-A and IFT-B complexes. Also important are membrane trafficking pathways that regulate vesicle formation and transport between post-Golgi sorting stations and the periciliary membrane, as well as endocytic retrieval and recycling events at the periciliary membrane and within the ciliary pocket [15\u201319]. Various IFT and ciliary membrane trafficking regulators have been identified, including small GTPases of the RAB, ARF and ARL families, that function during early cilium formation as well as transport events post-ciliogenesis. Given the multifaceted roles of cilia, together with its prevalent disease association, there have been major efforts to identify the \u2018ciliome\u2019, or complete molecular parts list of cilia, using a wide range of cell types and organisms [22\u201324]. Approaches have included comparative genomics of ciliated versus non-ciliated species, identification of binding sites for the ciliogenic transcription factors DAF-19/RFX or FOXJ1 [26\u201331], expression analyses involving microarray, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and RNA-Seq [25,28,32\u201337], as well as proteomics [38\u201341]. Data from such studies are compiled in the online ciliary database, Cildb. Whilst the studies have contributed immensely to understanding cilia biology, each approach has limitations and additional ciliary components almost certainly remain unidentified. C. elegans represents a powerful genetic model for investigating cilium formation and function. Hermaphrodite worms possess 60 ciliated cells (of 960 total), all of which are sensory neurons. The non-motile sensory cilia extend from the dendritic tips and many are contained within bilateral chemo- and thermo-sensory cuticular organs, supported by glial cell (sheath and socket) processes that establish environmentally exposed channels [42\u201344]. C. elegans cilium morphologies range from the canonical rod-like to forked, multi-branched and membrane-expanded structures. Worm cilia also possess ultrastructural features conserved in vertebrate/mammalian cilia; for example, amphid (head) and phasmid (tail) channel cilia possess long A-tubule extensions that establish a proximal axonemal region or \u2018middle segment\u2019 of 9 outer doublet MTs and a \u2018distal segment\u2019 of 9 outer singlet MTs. Because many ciliary genes and pathways are conserved in nematodes, and complete loss of cilia is non-lethal, C. elegans has been a leading metazoan model for discovering new ciliary genes and uncovering new insight into ciliary transport, function and disease mechanisms. In this study, we identified a unique expression profile for ciliary genes using a series of RNA-Seq libraries generated specifically to improve annotation of the transcriptome [45\u201347]. We confirmed that our clustering analysis identifies known ciliary proteins, including several not previously studied in C. elegans, and uncovers novel conserved ciliary proteins. One of these proteins is RAB-28, which is expressed exclusively in ciliated cells, where it associates with the periciliary membrane and behaves as an IFT cargo via BBSome- and nucleotide binding-dependent mechanisms. Overexpression of predicted active or inactive forms of RAB-28 leads to variant-specific ciliary and cell non-autonomous sensory pore morphogenesis defects. Together, our work provides a novel approach to finding new ciliary proteins, and uncovers a functional association between the BBSome, IFT and the orthologue of the cone-rod dystrophy protein, RAB28. To provide a complementary approach to ciliary gene discovery, we took advantage of the temporally-invariant birth of all C. elegans cells and tissues, including ciliated neurons, during development (Fig 1A). Nearly all of the 60 ciliated neuronal cell types in C. elegans hermaphrodites are born within a discrete embryonic time period 300\u2013450 minutes post-fertilisation, with cilium formation occurring very shortly thereafter (Fig 1A). We hypothesised that ciliogenesis genes are highly expressed during this time period and therefore distinguishable from genes required for general neuronal formation and development, which are expressed during a broader time window (Fig 1A). Using an available whole-organism developmental series of RNA-seq libraries from C. elegans [45\u201347], we confirmed this hypothesis: many well-characterised cilia genes are highly expressed in the early embryo, display peak expression in the late embryo and first larval stage, and show greatly reduced expression during subsequent developmental stages (Fig 1B). Next we sought to identify novel ciliary/ciliogenic genes displaying a similar cilia-related expression pattern. Using a set of 41 well-characterised ciliary component genes as \u201cbaits\u201d, representing the cilia-related gene expression profile during development (sheet 1 in S1 Table), we queried our ciliary transcriptome to identify other gene \u201cpreys\u201d with similar expression profiles across the RNA-Seq libraries (Fig 1B and sheet 2 in S1 Table). Hierarchical clustering of genes based on temporal expression reveals a tight cluster of 34 of the bait genes with 151 prey genes (cluster 1), many of which are uncharacterised (S1 Fig and sheet 3 in S1 Table). We also filtered the gene list to only include those with human orthologues. To validate our dataset, we determined if filtered cluster 1 is enriched for genes with >12 hits in the ciliary database Cildb (sheets 3 and 4 in S1 Table). We found that conserved Cildb-represented genes are significantly enriched (84.5 fold) in filtered cluster 1 compared to the entire genome (p<0.0001, chi-squared test; sheet 4 in S1 Table). We further compared the cluster 1 gene set to two previous expression studies and see significant overlap between lists (p<0.0001; sheet 4 in S1 Table). Because our genes were identified by shared temporal gene expression, we reasoned that they may share common promoter regulatory elements beyond the previously identified X-box motif and so we performed a motif discovery analysis on the conserved genes in cluster 1 (sheet 3 in S1 Table). Not surprisingly, we find several motifs that are significantly enriched, including matches to the GAGA factor binding site (S2 Fig). As might be expected, the 14-bp X-box was not identified by the motif elucidation program despite its enrichment in our dataset (sheet 4 in S1 Table), likely due to the number of degenerate bases in its consensus sequence and because the program identifies motifs only up to 8-bp long [26\u201328,51]. None of the elements we identified have been previously associated with cilia gene expression. We observed that chemoreceptors (G protein-coupled receptors or GPCRs), many of which are known to be cilium-localised, are largely absent from our ciliary dataset (sheet 3 in S1 Table). We hypothesised that such genes might be transcribed post-ciliogenesis. Using a statistical predictive modelling strategy similar to that used above, we identified 80 genes sharing the expression profile of srg-36, a cilium-localised dauer pheromone receptor required for entry into the dauer larval diapause life stage (Fig 1C and sheet 5 in S1 Table). Of the 80 genes, 27 are serpentine transmembrane receptors, representing a significant 7-fold enrichment over all such genes in the genome (p<0.0001, chi-squared test). Analysis of the upstream regulatory regions revealed that 25 of the 28 chemoreceptor genes (including srg-36) possess an E-box regulatory element (S3 Fig). This suggests that their similar temporal expression profiles stem from regulation by the same, or similar, transcription factors such as the E-box-binding Basic Helix-Loop-Helix bHLH transcription factor. Interestingly, 4 of the predicted serpentine receptors, including srg-36, are known to be expressed in ciliated sensory neurons. We note that the rise and fall of chemosensory/GPCR gene expression trails that of the cilia-related genes (Fig 1C), indicating that these two expression profiles of related developmental processes are temporally discrete. To confirm that our predictive expression profiling model identifies novel ciliary proteins in C. elegans, we used GFP reporters to investigate the cell and tissue expression patterns, and subcellular protein localisations, of seven previously uncharacterised C. elegans proteins from filtered cluster 1, namely FAM-161 (Y38H6C.14), CCDC-104 (Y108G3Al.3), RPI-1 (W07G1.5), RAB-28 (Y11D7A.4), CCDC-149 (F29G6.2), MAPH-9 (C34D4.1) and YAP-1 (F13E6.4). These were chosen because at the onset of this study there was little or no published evidence of ciliary associations for most of these proteins in any system. Specifically, we made transcriptional \u2018promoter fusion\u2019 reporters (endogenous gene promoter fused to GFP) for CCDC-104, CCDC-149 and RAB-28, and translational \u2018protein fusion\u2019 reporters (endogenous gene promoter + genomic exon/intron or cDNA sequence fused to GFP) for all 7 candidates. The only exception was the YAP-1 translational reporter, where the bbs-8 gene promoter active only in ciliated cells was used because of the widespread expression of YAP-1 in multiple tissues and cell types. We also made a second RAB-28 translational reporter driven by the bbs-8 gene promoter. All reporters employing the endogenous gene promoter show enriched or almost exclusive expression within ciliated cells (S4A Fig), thus validating the predictions from our coexpression profiling. Specifically, maph-9, rpi-1, ccdc-104, rab-28, and fam-161 are exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons, with ccdc-149 expressed in most ciliated neurons as well as pharyngeal neurons, touch receptor neurons, and motor neurons as previously reported (Figs 2 and S4A). Furthermore, the translational reporters reveal that all 7 proteins localise at the base of, or within, cilia (Fig 2 and Fig 3A). FAM-161::GFP signals are found at the ciliary base and within the proximal part of the ciliary axoneme, including the transition zone (TZ) (Fig 2). This localisation is similar to that of the mammalian protein implicated in retinitis pigmentosa, and is consistent with the suggested role of FAM161b in cargo delivery to photoreceptor outer segments (cilia). Both GFP reporters for RAB-28 (driven by bbs-8 gene or endogenous promoter), the orthologue of the small ciliary GTPase RAB28 linked to human autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy [62\u201364], localise along the entire cilium. (Fig 2 and Fig 3A). Ciliary axoneme localisations are also observed for the GFP-tagged RPI-1, MAPH-9, YAP-1 and CCDC-104 translational reporters; in contrast, CCDC-149::GFP is absent from the ciliary axoneme, although a pool of signal is evident at the ciliary base (Fig 2). The ciliary localisation of CCDC-104::GFP is consistent with the mammalian ciliary base and axonemal localisations reported for the ARL3 interacting protein, CCDC104/BARTL1. We also found that RPI-1::GFP appears to localise to ciliary and cytoplasmic microtubules, similar to its mammalian orthologue (RP1) implicated in retinitis pigmentosa (Fig 2). Our finding of ciliary localisations for YAP-1, MAPH-9 and CCDC-149 are the first in any cellular system or organism, and is consistent with a known ciliogenesis role for mammalian YAP, and cilia-related phenotypes in MAP9 (MAPH9 orthologue)-disrupted zebrafish and dachshunds [67\u201370]. YAP is regulated by the ciliary protein NPHP4, and MAP9 is phosphorylated by the cilia-disassembly/centrosomal kinase PLK1. We also examined genes excluded from filtered cluster 1 due to a reported lack of predicted human orthologues (according to the Ortholist database;). Highly ranked in unfiltered cluster 1 is an uncharacterised gene with an X-box promoter element, tza-3, which we demonstrate is expressed exclusively in ciliated neurons, and encodes a ciliary TZ protein (S4B Fig). Whilst TZA-3 is not conserved, the TZ localisation of this predicted transmembrane protein depends on the highly conserved core TZ scaffolding protein MKS-5 and \u201cMKS module\u201d components MKSR-1 and MKSR-2, but not the \u201cNPHP module\u201d protein NPHP-4 (S4B Fig). These findings are consistent with TZA-3 associating with the MKS module, which plays a role in ciliary gating [6\u20138]. Thus, our expression profiling approach identifies non-conserved ciliary proteins in addition to conserved ciliary proteins. Of the novel C. elegans ciliary proteins we identified, we sought to characterise RAB-28 further for the following reasons: (1) human RAB28 is associated with a possible ciliopathy (cone-rod dystrophy), (2) many small GTPases play essential roles in ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane trafficking pathways, and (3) aside from reports of RAB28 localising at the basal body or the cilium, there is a complete absence of molecular studies on this evolutionarily conserved protein that support a functional and mechanistic link to cilia. We further investigated the ciliary localisation of GFP::RAB-28 using time-lapse imaging and found that this GTPase undergoes continuous, bidirectional, IFT-like movement along ciliary axonemes (S1 Movie). In contrast, the additional non-ciliary GFP::RAB-28 signals present throughout the neurons are diffuse, with no processive movement detected. In C. elegans amphid and phasmid cilia, anterograde IFT is driven by two kinesin-2 motors (kinesin-II and OSM-3) to yield distinct anterograde rates along the middle and distal segments. Kymograph analysis of phasmid (tail) cilia confirm that ciliary GFP::RAB-28 moves at IFT-associated velocities, displaying characteristic average anterograde rates of ~0.7 \u03bcm/sec (middle segment; proximal part of axoneme) and ~1.2 \u03bcm/sec (distal segment; distal part of axoneme), and retrograde rates of ~1.4 \u03bcm/sec (along entire cilium length) (Fig 3A and 3B and S1 Movie). To examine if this ciliary trafficking is truly associated with IFT, we examined GFP::RAB-28 in worms with disrupted CHE-11 (IFT140), which is a component of IFT-A essential for IFT. Although GFP::RAB-28 is observed within the truncated cilia of che-11 mutants, we could not detect processive movement of the GFP signals, indicating that the trafficking behaviour of RAB-28 within cilia is bona fide IFT (Fig 3A and S1 Movie). In contrast to observations for other IFT-associated proteins in IFT deficient-worms, GFP::RAB-28 does not abnormally accumulate at the ciliary base or tip, or along the axoneme of these animals (Fig 3A). This lack of accumulation, despite the active transport defect, suggests that our GFP::RAB-28 reporter also freely diffuses within (and between) the ciliary and dendritic compartments, in addition to undergoing IFT. We confirmed this hypothesis using a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay in wild type and che-11 mutant worms, which show that GFP::RAB-28 is highly mobile, displaying very rapid exchange kinetics between ciliary and dendritic pools (Fig 3C). Thus, in addition to active transport via IFT, GFP::RAB-28 undergoes IFT-independent free diffusion, which explains why this reporter does not abnormally accumulate within che-11 mutant cilia. To determine if RAB-28 is required for IFT, we examined ciliary structure, function and protein transport in worms containing a deletion (gk1040) in rab-28. The gk1040 mutation removes the GTP-binding switch II domain and the farnesylated C-terminal CAAX motif (S5A Fig), both of which are critical for RAB protein function; thus, gk1040 is likely a severe loss-of-function or null allele. We outcrossed the gk1040 background at least 3 times with wild type worms to remove background mutations unlinked to gk1040. We find that ciliated amphid and phasmid sensory neurons in rab-28 mutant worms display a normal dye filling response, which suggests that ciliary structures are intact (short cilia usually abrogate dye uptake due to lack of environmental exposure) (S5B Fig). Localisation of an IFT protein, OSM-6 (IFT52 orthologue), throughout normal-length cilia confirms this finding (S5C Fig). In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses reveal that ciliary ultrastructures appear normal in rab-28 mutants (S5D Fig). Furthermore, these worms are normal for cilia-related sensory behaviours (S5E Fig), as well as cilium-dependent carbon dioxide avoidance and development (body size) (S5F Fig) [78\u201380]. Finally, the localisation (and movement) of BBSome (BBS-5), IFT-A/B and various ciliary membrane proteins is also grossly normal in rab-28 mutants (S5G Fig). Thus, unlike the disruption of IFT proteins, loss of RAB-28 does not affect ciliary structure, transport, or function, at least for those proteins and cilia that were analysed. We conclude, therefore, that RAB-28 behaves more like an IFT cargo, or peripherally-associated component of IFT complexes, rather than a central component of the machinery required for bidirectional movement (IFT). Next, we assessed the requirements of GDP and GTP nucleotide binding for RAB-28 localisation and transport. We made GFP-tagged constructs containing T49N or Q95L mutations in RAB-28, which are predicted to trap the GTPase in GDP (inactive) or GTP (active)-locked states, respectively. These constructs were injected into wild type worms at the same concentration (5 ng/\u03bcl) as the GFP::RAB-28(WT) construct described above (Fig 3), and all appear to be expressed at similar levels. Like the RAB-28(WT) reporter, RAB-28(T49N) (hereafter termed RAB-28(GDP)) displays diffuse localisation throughout the entire neuron, including the cilium and its associated periciliary membrane compartment (PCMC) (Fig 4A). However, unlike wild type RAB-28, RAB-28(GDP) fails to undergo detectable IFT, indicating a highly reduced ability to associate with IFT trains (Fig 4A and S1 Movie). In contrast, the localisation of the RAB-28(Q95L) (hereafter termed RAB-28(GTP)) is highly enriched at the PCMC compared with the rest of the cell, forming a \u2018tunnel-like\u2019 localisation indicative of association with the periciliary membrane (Fig 4A). RAB-28(GTP) also undergoes clearly detectable IFT, albeit at an apparently reduced frequency compared to the wild type reporter (Fig 4A and S1 Movie). Notably, the localisation and IFT behaviour of all three GFP::RAB-28 reporters (WT, GDP-locked, GTP-locked) is not altered when expressed in the rab-28(gk1040) null background (S6 Fig), indicating that endogenous RAB-28 does not affect the distribution and transport behaviour of the RAB-28 markers. Furthermore, transgenic worms expressing GFP::RAB-28(GTP) at a very low level (injected at 0.5 ng/\u03bcl; oqEx304) is exclusively localised at the periciliary membrane and undergoes IFT (S7 Fig and S2 Movie), thus confirming our observations with the higher expressing marker, and indicating that the periciliary membrane is the primary site of activated RAB-28 function in nematode sensory neurons (Fig 4A). Taken together, these data show that GTP binding targets RAB-28 to the periciliary membrane and facilitates its association with IFT trains. These observations for C. elegans RAB-28 are reminiscent of those for mammalian RAB8, whose ciliary targeting also depends on GDP-GTP exchange, via a mechanism involving RABIN8 (RAB8 guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and BBSome functions at the base of cilia [82\u201384]. We therefore examined the localisation and transport behaviour of all three GFP-tagged RAB-28 reporters (WT, GDP-locked and GTP-locked) in a likely null allele (nx77) of a C. elegans BBSome gene orthologue, bbs-8. The bbs-8(nx77) mutation does not alter the ciliary targeting and distributions of RAB-28(WT) and RAB-28(GDP) compared to a wild type background (Fig 4B). In contrast, BBS-8 loss has a striking effect on both of our RAB-28(GTP) reporters, preventing their accumulation at periciliary membranes (Fig 4B and S7 Fig). Furthermore, the IFT movement of RAB-28(WT) and RAB-28(GTP) is abolished in bbs-8 mutant cilia (Fig 4B and S1 Movie). From these data, we conclude that the IFT-associated BBSome is required for targeting activated RAB-28 (GTP-locked) to periciliary membranes and loading onto IFT trains. The differences in localisation and IFT behaviour between the constitutively inactive (GDP-locked) and active (GTP-locked) forms of RAB-28 prompted us to investigate cilium structure and function in worms overexpressing these small GTPase variants. Assessment of dye-filling reveals reduced levels of dye uptake in the amphid neurons of wild type worms expressing RAB-28(GTP), compared to normal dye-filling for wild type worms expressing RAB-28(WT) or RAB-28(GDP) (Fig 5A). Similar dye-filling results were obtained when these variants were expressed in rab-28(gk1040) worms, although worms expressing RAB-28(GDP) may display a very weakly penetrant phenotypic defect (S8A Fig). Despite the distinct dye-filling phenotypes, worms expressing RAB-28(GTP) or RAB-28(GDP) both show a reduced roaming behaviour (Fig 5B), suggestive of cilia-related sensory abnormalities. To investigate the structural basis of these defects, we examined amphid pore ultrastructure in wild type (N2) worms expressing GFP-tagged RAB-28(GTP) or RAB-28(GDP). Somewhat surprisingly, despite the dye uptake phenotype, RAB-28(GTP)-expressing amphid channel cilia are of normal length and morphology, with intact middle and distal segments, as well as TZ compartments (Fig 5C). However, an increased number of ciliary axonemes possess B-tubule seam breaks (\u2018unzipped\u2019 microtubules), indicative of incomplete protofilament formation (S8B Fig). A more striking phenotype is that the proximal region of the sheath cell-defined amphid channel is greatly enlarged, and the ciliary axonemes are less tightly bundled (Fig 5C). Also, the channels of RAB-28(GTP) expressing worms display reduced electron densities, potentially indicating abnormally low concentrations of matrix material, which is thought to be secreted by the sheath cell (Fig 5C). In contrast, although the amphid channel in RAB-28(GDP)-expressing worms is not expanded, these worms exhibit a number of abnormally large dense matrix-filled vesicles (MFVs) in the sheath, in that portion of the cell surrounding the channel (Fig 5C). Such electron dense vesicles are not found in the channel region of the amphid sheath cell of wild type (N2), rab-8(gk1040) or RAB-28(GTP) overexpressing worms (Fig 5C), indicating this phenotype is specific to RAB-28(GDP) overexpression. A second phenotype unique to RAB-28(GDP)-expressing worms is that one channel axoneme is missing from the amphid pore, and instead lies adjacent to the channel, embedded in the sheath (Fig 5C). Together, these findings indicate that overexpression of constitutively active or inactive RAB-28 cause variant-specific defects in the amphid sheath (enlarged channel; dense MFV accumulation) and ciliated cells (dye-filling defect; misplaced amphid channel axoneme), although shared phenotypes are also observed (roaming defect). The sheath cell phenotypes likely represent a cell non-autonomous function because our transcriptional reporter for RAB-28 (GFP under the control of the rab-28 promoter) is not expressed in the sheath cell (S9 Fig). Thus, we conclude from these overexpression data that RAB-28 serves ciliated cell autonomous and sheath cell non-autonomous roles in sensory pore formation and function. In this study, we identified a specific C. elegans ciliary gene expression profile using a set of RNA-Seq libraries, originally produced to annotate the transcriptome, that together provide a temporal landscape of whole-organism gene expression [45\u201347]. A major advantage of C. elegans as a model for ciliary biology is that ciliogenesis occurs during a temporally discrete window of embryonic development (Fig 1), making it well suited for this type of temporal gene expression analysis. The expression profile for known cilia genes peaks at the onset of ciliogenesis and decreases post-ciliogenesis, likely to levels adequate to maintain cilium structure. Using this pattern, we uncover new ciliary associations for several conserved, but poorly characterised proteins, including the orthologues of YAP, MAP9 and CCDC149. The ciliary localisation of MAPH-9 (microtubule-associated protein 9) is consistent with a known functional association between MAP9 and the centrosomal regulatory kinase PLK1, the centrosomal localisation and suggested ciliary functions for MAP9 in zebrafish, and a role for MAP9 as a modifier of retinal degeneration in Dachshunds. YAP also has previous links to cilia, including a role in ciliogenesis as well as being regulated by the ciliary gate protein, NPHP4. Although we do not understand the exact ciliary functions of MAP9 and YAP, their suggested roles in other contexts include regulation of ciliary microtubules (MAP9) and cilium-based signalling (YAP) [67\u201372]. Since 64 of the 185 genes in our predicted list of ciliary genes (cluster 1) possess known ciliary associations, we are confident that additional cilia-related components can be uncovered from this dataset. One of the highest ranked hits in our candidate list of ciliary genes is RAB-28, a small GTPase whose human counterpart is linked to autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy and vision impairment. Although recent studies show that mammalian RAB28 is localised to the mammalian photoreceptor basal body and cilium, its role in photoreceptors and in other tissues and organisms remains unknown. Here, we show that C. elegans RAB-28 is specifically expressed in ciliated sensory neurons, and undergoes IFT. RAB-28 IFT association depends on its GTPase activity; whereas the GDP-locked inactive form localises diffusely with little or no observable IFT, the GTP-locked active form concentrates almost exclusively at the periciliary membrane and undergoes IFT. Moreover, the periciliary membrane association and IFT behaviour of active RAB-28 depends on the BBSome, which functions as an IFT cargo-adaptor. We conclude that C. elegans BBSome complexes recruit activated RAB-28 to the periciliary membrane, and regulate docking to IFT trains (Fig 6). Our findings also demonstrate that RAB-28 is probably not a \u2018core\u2019 component of the BBSome or IFT particles, since ciliary structures, as well as BBSome and IFT-subcomplex A/B protein localisations, are unaffected in rab-28 mutant worms. Instead, RAB-28 may associate with these complexes as part of a \u2018peripheral\u2019 submodule, performing auxiliary functions unrelated to ciliogenesis, such as those described for metazoan IFT27 (Rab-like 4; RABL4), ARL6 (BBS3) and RAB8, whose ciliary targeting or removal also depend on GTP binding and the BBSome (ARL6, RAB8) [86\u201389]. Consistent with a non-essential global requirement for ciliogenesis, IFT and BBSome integrity, patients carrying predicted strong loss-of-function or possibly null alleles in RAB28 do not present with wider ciliopathy symptoms beyond cone-rod dystrophy. Another revealing observation from our work is that overexpression of constitutively active (GTP-locked) or inactive (GDP-locked) RAB-28 cause variant-specific defects in the non-ciliated amphid sheath cell that supports the ciliated endings of amphid neurons. Specifically, RAB-28(GTP) overexpression causes an enlargement of the sheath cell-defined portion of the amphid sensory pore, whereas RAB-28(GDP) overexpression causes the accumulation of abnormally dense matrix-filled vesicles (MFVs) in the sheath cell. The RAB-28 variant constructs, as well as the RAB-28(WT) construct, are expressed at similar levels, using the same promoter sequence; thus, the observed variant-specific phenotypes are not likely due to differences in expression level, but instead are linked to the nucleotide bound state of RAB-28. Most interestingly, the abnormal sheath cell phenotypes appear to reflect a cell-non autonomous effect because RAB-28 is expressed in ciliated sensory neurons, and not in the amphid sheath cell (S9 Fig). In C. elegans, the amphid channel is fashioned from glial cell (sheath and socket) processes which extend to the nose tip in close proximity to the dendritic processes of the ciliated sensory neurons. The proximal part of the channel forms from a hole in the sheath process which the channel cilia fully penetrate, whereas the distal part of the channel derives from a doughnut-shaped ending of the socket process that fuses with the cuticle and the underlying sheath (Fig 5C). The formation and function of neurons and glia in the amphid pore appear tightly linked, with channel morphogenesis thought to depend on signals from both cell types. It is also suggested that amphid channel size is regulated via a balance of \u2018exocytic\u2019 membrane delivery via MFVs (increases channel size) and \u2018endocytic\u2019 membrane retrieval (reduces channel size) at the sheath cell plasma membrane. By integrating this model with our findings, we hypothesise that constitutively active RAB-28 may enhance MFV delivery to the sheath cell membrane, leading to an enlarged channel, whereas constitutively inactive RAB-28 blocks MFV delivery and results in abnormally dense MFVs in the sheath. One prediction of this model is that expression of constitutively inactive RAB-28 would reduce amphid channel size, and consistent with this idea, one channel axoneme fails to enter the amphid pore of RAB-28(GDP) expressing worms. How RAB-28 expressed in ciliated amphid neurons might control morphogenesis events in the supporting non-ciliated sheath cell is unclear. One scenario is that RAB-28 regulates extracellular release of neuronal factors purported to signal to the sheath cell during channel morphogenesis in the embryo [42\u201344] (Fig 6). In support of this notion, activated RAB-28 is almost exclusively concentrated at the periciliary membrane, which is the site of ectosome release in certain nematode sensory neurons; also, RAB-28 expression is elevated in nematode ectosome-releasing cells. Future work will be required to investigate possible roles for RAB-28 in cilia-related ectosome release, and to identify sheath cell morphogenic factors released by the ciliated neurons. A surprising observation is that sensory pore structure and function appears grossly normal in the rab-28 deletion mutant, which is likely a null allele. This indicates that other genes or pathways can compensate for rab-28 loss-of-function, but that the phenotypic effects of the overexpressed dominant active and inactive RAB-28 variants are more severe and cannot be as easily compensated. One possibility is that the cilium structure, and cilium-dependent behavioural phenotypes in worms overexpressing RAB-28(GTP) and/or RAB-28(GDP) derive from excessive activation of downstream effectors or possibly aberrant sequestration of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) or GDP-GTP exchange proteins (GEFs) common to RAB-28 and other ciliary GTPases. To fully decipher the mechanistic basis of the RAB-28 gain vs loss of function phenotypes, and the physiological relevance of our findings, future efforts should include an examination of worms expressing RAB-28 variants expressed at endogenous or near-endogenous levels and the identification of currently unknown regulators of RAB-28 (GEF and GAP proteins). Given the close sequence similarity between RAB28 and IFT27, and some of their common functional properties discussed below, we suggest that these two RAB GTPases may have similar or partially overlapping ciliary functions. RAB28 is conserved across metazoans and many ciliated protists (S10 Fig), and inferred to be one of 23 founding RAB family members present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Phylogenetically, RAB28 is most closely related to IFT27 (RABL4), which likely also existed in LECA and is dispersed throughout the eukaryotic lineage (S10 Fig). Like the majority of ciliary and IFT components, both RAB28 and IFT27 are restricted to organisms that have cilia (S10 Fig). Interestingly, although RAB28 and IFT27 are present in most metazoans and many protists (e.g., Chlamydomonas and Trypanosoma have both), neither protein appears to be present in Drosophila and IFT27 is missing from C. elegans (S10 Fig). RAB28 and IFT27 appear to share overlapping functional properties. As we show for nematode RAB-28, Trypanosome and mammalian IFT27 associate with IFT in a GTP-dependent manner. Also, cilium formation is unaffected in mammalian cells with null mutations in IFT27 (similar to C. elegans rab-28 mutants), although disruption of IFT27 in protists results in short flagella. In addition, mutations in IFT27 cause BBS, displaying a broad spectrum of ciliopathy phenotypes, including the cardinal retinal degeneration phenotype observed in RAB28 patients. Furthermore, both small GTPases are functionally associated with the BBSome, albeit in different ways. The localisation and IFT motility of nematode RAB-28 is BBSome-dependent, but not vice versa (i.e., BBS-5 localisation is normal in rab-28 mutants), whereas mammalian IFT27 regulates BBSome assembly and removal from the cilium. When taken together, the above observations could suggest that in vertebrates RAB28 and IFT27 function at distinct steps of a common pathway, potentially \u2018upstream\u2019 (IFT27) and \u2018downstream\u2019 (RAB-28) of the BBSome. Since IFT27 and the BBSome remove proteins from cilia, RAB28 may perform a similar function by facilitating the BBSome-mediated removal of a more-restricted set of cargo. In further support of a common, yet tissue-specific, transport role for related ciliary GTPases such as IFT27 and RAB28, it is noteworthy that disruption of the short ARL6/BBS3 isoform in mice and zebrafish results in broad spectrum BBS-related phenotypes, whereas disruption of the long isoform causes a retina-specific phenotype. Transition zone-localised RPGRIP1 and RPGRIP1L represent additional examples of very closely related ciliopathy proteins linked to a broad tissue pathogenesis (RPGRIP1L), versus a retinal-specific disease (RPGRIP1) [101\u2013104]. Finally, whereas IFT27 is known to regulate the ciliary localisation of sonic hedgehog proteins, the identity of RAB28-associated cargoes is currently unknown. Interestingly, RAB28 itself may be a cargo of the prenyl-binding protein PDE6D (cGMP phosphodiesterase delta subunit) which immunoprecipitates RAB28; in agreement with this possibility, loss of PDE6D in the mouse phenocopies the photoreceptor degeneration of RAB28 patients. In light of our worm data, it is possible that PDE6D delta functions with the BBSome, either together or at distinct parts of a transport pathway, to target RAB28 to ciliary membranes. Our study describes a novel method for identifying genes with ciliary functions that complements other studies (bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics) aimed at deciphering a complete \u2018ciliome\u2019. From our list of candidates, we uncover several novel, evolutionarily-conserved cilium-associated proteins. Our in-depth analysis of RAB-28 in C. elegans reveals it to be a novel IFT- and BBSome-associated protein with cell autonomous and non-autonomous roles in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of cilia, and of the sensory neuron-supporting cells. Further analyses of mammalian RAB28 are required to reveal its functional similarities and differences with IFT27, and possible functional associations with PDE6D and ARL6, to help explain its seemingly specific function in ciliary photoreceptors, and thus specific association with cone-rod dystrophy. We curated a list of 41 C. elegans genes with established roles in ciliary function and used these to search for genes with correlated expression. These \u201cbait\u201d genes included: R148.1, F38G1.1, Y75B8A.12, F20D12.3, Y41G9A.1, R01H10.6, C54G7.4, C27A7.4, R31.3, C48B6.8, F32A6.2, C27H5.7, T28F3.6, Y37E3.5, F59C6.7, F19H8.3, ZC84.2, F35D2.4, H01G02.2, B0240.3, ZK520.3, C02H7.1, ZK418.3, K08D12.2, F23B2.4, Y105E8A.5, F46F6.4, K07G5.3, F33H1.1, F02D8.3, K03E6.4, C38D4.8, T26C12.4, T27B1.1, Y110A7A.20, F53A9.4, M04C9.5, C30B5.9, C09G5.8, R13H4.1 and F54C1.5. We used expression data derived from RNA-seq for seven developmental stages (EE = early embryo, LE = late embryo, L1 = mid-L1 larvae, L2 = mid-L2 larvae, L3 = mid-L3 larvae, L4 = mid-L4 larvae and YA = young adult) obtained from [45\u201347]. As the expression values were relative to individual isoforms, we first computed an average RPKM (reads per kilobase per million) value for each gene across all isoforms. Using these 41 genes, we next computed the pairwise Pearson correlation of each gene against all 20,363 C. elegans genes in the data set across all libraries and estimated a P value for each test. As we were interested in capturing genes with expression correlates to any of these known ciliary genes, we retained the smallest P value from these 41 tests for subsequent calculations. To avoid circularity, we retained the second-smallest P value for correlation tests involving one of the bait genes. In addition to direct correlation, we sought to identify genes exhibiting a developmental expression pattern similar to known ciliary genes. We observed that all ciliary genes exhibit at least a 10-fold reduction in expression level (relative to their peak expression level) in the latter three developmental stages. A total of 5960 genes showed this expression trend. Following the identification of those genes exhibiting strongly correlated expression to any of the known ciliary genes, this set was further clustered to search for sub-groupings of genes with strongly coordinated expression. The distance between individual genes was calculated using the \u2018dist\u2019 function in R and hierarchical clustering was performed using single, average and complete linkage. S1 Fig shows a heat map representation of the expression for each of the candidate ciliary genes with the dendrogram derived from clustering using complete linkage and cluster 1 at the top. Using the method described above, we used srg-36 as a bait to identify co-expressed genes. We found 80 genes (p < 0.001), including 27 other predicted chemoreceptors. The 1000 bp upstream from the start codon of all 28 chemoreceptors (including the bait srg-36) were entered into the program MEME, which found a consensus that matches the published E-box sequence. Separately, the 1000 bp upstream of all the conserved cluster 1 were entered into the MEME suite program DREME, which found several potential transcription factor binding sites. We used the MEME suite program TomTom to compare identified sites to known sites. Identified promoter elements were compared to consensus splice and trans-splice sites and any that matched were subsequently removed. All nematode strains were maintained and cultured at 20\u00b0C on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with OP50 Escherichia coli using standard techniques. Standard genetic crossing techniques were used to introduce transgenes into genetic backgrounds. The rab-28(gk1040) mksr-1(ok2092), mksr-2(tm2452), mks-5(tm3100), mks-3(tm2547), mks-6(gk674), and nphp-4(tm925) mutations were followed using genotyping PCR (primer sequences available upon request).

After incubation, worms were recovered on seeded nematode growth medium plates for a further 30 min and then mounted on slides. Epifluorescence wide-field imaging under the red filter was used to image DiI uptake into the ciliated amphid and phasmid cells. For the roaming (foraging) assay, single worms were placed for 18 hours onto seeded NGM plates and track coverage assessed using a grid reference. For the osmotic avoidance assay, 5\u20136 worms were placed within a ring of 8M glycerol (Sigma) supplemented with Bromophenol Blue (Alfa Aesar) on unseeded NGM plates and observed for 10 min. Worms that crossed the barrier were removed from the assay. Chemotaxis attraction assays (towards isoamyl alcohol) were performed as previously reported, with a chemotaxis index calculated at 30\u2009min and 60\u2009min. All constructs were generated by PCR fusion. For the transcriptional (promoter) Prab-28::gfp construct, gfp amplified from pPD95.67 was fused to an 432-bp fragment of the 5\u2019UTR of rab-28 that included the first 14 bp of exon 1 (start codon thymine mutated to guanine). For the transcriptional reporters for Pccdc-104 and Pccdc-149, gfp amplified from pPD95.77 was fused to 1997 and 395 bp, respectively, of the 5\u2019UTR for each gene. For the translational (promoter + protein) fam-161, rpi-1, maph-9, ccdc-149 and tza-3 reporters, the entire genomic sequence (exons and introns) were fused to gfp including promoter sequences of 1373 bp, 2317 bp, 973 bp, 395 bp and 457 bp, respectively. For the translational reporter for rab-28 and yap-1 in Fig 2, 341 bp of the bbs-8 promoter followed by gfp were fused to the genomic sequence including 3\u2019 UTR for each gene. For the ccdc-104 translational reporter, 1997 bp of the bbs-8 promoter followed by gfp were fused to the ccdc-104 cDNA and 3\u2019 UTR. For the translational Prab-28::gfp::rab-28 reporter (Figs 3 and 4), the entire genomic sequence and 970-bp of the 3\u2019UTR of rab-28 was first fused 5\u2019 to a gfp fragment, amplified from pPD95.77. The resulting gfp::rab-28 amplicon was subsequently fused to a 422-bp fragment consisting of the 5\u2019UTR (promoter) sequence of rab-28. To make the Prab-28::gfp::rab-28(GDP) and Prab-28::gfp::rab-28(GTP) constructs, primers incorporating the corresponding T49N and Q95L mutations were first used to amplify 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 fragments of the rab-28 genomic sequence, and these were fused by PCR to establish the rab-28(T49N) and rab-28(Q95L) amplicons. These amplicons were subsequently fused to a Prab-28::gfp fragment, generated by fusing the rab-28 promoter sequence (see above) to gfp amplified from pPD95.77. Transgenic worms expressing the above constructs were generated by gonadal transformation of N2 hermaphrodites via microinjection and subsequent screening for transgenic progeny. rab-28 constructs were injected at a concentration of either 5 ng/\u03bcl (all translational constructs except oqEx304 which was injected at 0.5 ng/\u03bcl) or 50 ng/\u03bcl (transcriptional constructs), together with a coelomocyte (Punc-122::gfp) or pRF4 (rol-6(su1006)) co-injection marker at 50\u2013100 ng/\u03bcl. Strains in Fig 2 and S4B Fig were anaesthetised with 10 mM levamisole in M9 buffer, mounted on slides with 8% agarose pads, and observed by epifluorescence or spinning-disc (WaveFX; Quorum Technologies) confocal microscopy performed on an Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 with a Hamamatsu 9100 EMCCD camera. Image capture and visualisation were performed on Volocity (PerkinElmer). All other worms were immobilised with 40mM tetramisole (Sigma no. L9756) or microbeads (Polysciences no. 00876\u201315) and mounted on 4% or 10% agarose pads. Epifluorescence images were taken on an upright Leica DM5000B and confocal images on an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with a Yokogawa spinning-disc unit (Andor Revolution). Images were acquired using a charge-coupled device camera (iXon+EM-CCD, Andor Technology) and analysed using Image J software. For IFT assays, time-lapse (multi tiff) movies of IFT along phasmid cilia were taken at 200 ms exposure and 4 fps. Separated anterograde and retrograde kymographs were generated from multi tiff files using Icy image analysis software (http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/) and rates determined using ImageJ. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays were performed using the above confocal microscope with an attached FRAPPA unit (Andor Technology). Samples were bleached using a single pulse of the 488nm laser at 100% with a dwell time of 100 \u03bcs. Images were recorded immediately post-bleach and continuously thereafter. Fluorescence intensities measured with image J software following a recently described protocol. Values were normalised to pre-bleach values and corrected for signal intensity loss during image acquisition. Young adult worms were fixed, sectioned and imaged as previously reported."}, "26270232": {"pmid": "26270232", "pmcid": "PMC4559820", "title": "Serum levels of chemokines CCL4 and CCL5 in cirrhotic patients indicate the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma", "abstract": "\n\nBackground:\nMost hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are diagnosed at an advanced stage.

HCC is the sixth most prevalent cancer and the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HCC are of great concern. Fine-needle biopsy or other investigations such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or digital subtraction angiography were used as the gold standard diagnosis in HCC. The prognosis at early stages relies on tumour status, liver function and the applied treatment. Tumour status is defined by so-called BCLC Classification. Early HCC diagnosis is essential, as only in early stages (BCLC A) the tumour is curable by resection, LTx or ablation therapy. Patients with small solitary tumours (single lesion <5\u2009cm) and very well preserved liver function are the best candidates for liver resection or transplantation. LTx is most beneficial for individuals who are poor candidates for resection due to cirrhosis as the underlying disease. Screening of the serum tumour marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and imaging with ultrasound (US) every 6 months in patients with liver cirrhosis have been recommended to detect HCC at earlier stages amenable to effective treatment strategies. Serum AFP is the most widely used marker for HCC. However, its sensitivity and specificity for HCC is poor and varies with the cutoff value, ethnicity of the patient, etiology of liver disease and tumour stage. The sensitivity of AFP decreases from 52% to 25% when tumour diameter is >3 and <3\u2009cm, respectively. Besides AFP, AFP lectin fraction 3 (AFP-L3) and DCP are widely used clinically as serum tumour markers of HCC. These serum biomarkers (AFP, DCP and AFP-L3) are not accurate enough for the early diagnosis of HCC. Association of immune parameters such as apoptosis markers CK18 (M65) and CK18 fragment (M30), chemokines CCR2, CXCR2, CXCR4, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL15, CCL17, CCL22, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL12, CXCL14, Chromogranin A and high-mobility-group-protein B1 (HMGB1) with cirrhosis and HCC have been studied previously in patients with end-stage liver diseases. Development of new reliable serological biomarkers for early stages of HCC is needed to improve clinical diagnosis and outcomes. Furthermore, the marker should be sensitive, easily measurable, reproducible and minimally invasive. Our aim in the present study is to assess the diagnostic value of cell death markers HMGB1, M65 and M30, growth factors TPO, GCSF, FGF basic and VEGF and inflammatory chemokines CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1), CCL4 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta), CCL5 (RANTES) and CXCL5 (epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating peptide-78) and IL-8 (CXCL8) for early detection of HCC in cirrhotic patients. The following parameters were measured in 139 cirrhotic patients (aged 52.0\u00b111.2 years, 32 female, 61 cirrhotic HCC+ and 78 cirrhotic HCC\u2212) who underwent deceased donor LTx between January 2008 and April 2011. HCC diagnosis was confirmed by pathological reports. Original liver diseases were chronic viral hepatitis C and/or B in 40 patients, alcohol abuse in 41, congenital or autoimmune disease, including cryptogenic cirrhosis, biliary disease, metabolic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis and amyloidosis, in 58 patients. Preoperative and demographic parameters, including age, gender, severity of liver diseases (determined by MELD score), bilirubin, INR, albumin, viral infection statuses such as CMV, HBV and HCV IgG, retransplantation, serum levels of CRP and neopterin as inflammatory markers and serum levels of cell death markers M65 and M30, TPO, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 CXCL5 and CXCL8 (IL-8), were analysed. We examined the association between HCC with mentioned parameters. Thirty-nine healthy volunteers (HCs) served as controls to establish references for studied parameters such as cytokines and chemokines. Controls were free of infectious and other inflammatory illnesses. The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee. Serum separator tubes were centrifuged at 4000\u2009r.p.m. for 15\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Serum was collected after the blood clotting process. Serum was snap frozen within 2\u2009h, after the blood was drawn and stored at \u221230\u2009\u00b0C until testing. All serum samples were thawed only once before testing. Cell apoptotic marker (M30; CK18 fragment), growth factors thrombopoietin (TPO) and chemokines C-X-C motif ligand 5 (ENA-78, CXCL5), C-C motif ligand 2 (MCP-1, CCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a, CCL3), macrophage inflammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b, CCL4) and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES, CCL5) were measured by ELISA using the Quantikine Kits (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Categorical and continuous variables were analysed using chi square, Fisher exact and Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests. Continuous variables were modelled stratifying by median. Correlation between variables was analysed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The most sensitive cutoff values were calculated by receiver operating curve (ROC) curve analysis. Univariable and multivariable forward stepwise logistic regression analyses were applied and identified the greatest association of parameters with HCC. All statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). After Bonferroni correction, P values \u2a7d0.05 were defined as statistically significant. Serum levels of M30, TPO, GCSF, FGF basic and VEGF, CXCL5, IL-8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 were similar among patients with virus-, alcohol- or congenital/autoimmune-induced cirrhosis (data not shown). Serum levels of HMGB1 (3.2\u00b16.7\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 3.7\u00b12.7: P=0.006), TPO (208\u00b1237\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 505\u00b1106: P<0.0001), VEGF (35\u00b149\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 87\u00b152: P<0.0001), CCL2 (194\u00b1533\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 179\u00b171: P=0.0001), CCL3 (33\u00b1280\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 70\u00b1199: P=0.002), CCL5 (2.7\u00b15.2\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 11\u00b111: P<0.0001) and CXCL5 (167\u00b1238\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 766\u00b1540: P<0.0001) were lower, whereas serum CRP (20.0\u00b124.7\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 vs 3.5\u00b16.1: P<0.0001), neopterin (49.2\u00b169.1 nmol\u2009l\u22121 vs 6.4\u00b13.2: P<0.0001), IL-6 (74.0\u00b1435\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 0.0\u00b10.0: P<0.0001), IL-8 (40.5\u00b187.3\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 11.5\u00b126.1: P=0.014), M65 (2349\u00b11127\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 358\u00b1111: P<0.0001) and M30 (1195\u00b1839\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 185\u00b1133: P<0.0001) were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients than in 39 healthy controls (16 females, age: mean\u00b1s.d. 39.6\u00b110.0 years). The results suggest a decreased chemokine expression and an increased rate of apoptosis and inflammation in cirrhotic patients. Serum levels of GCSF (P=0.08) and FGF basic (P=0.11) were similar in patients and healthy controls. HCC patients with cirrhosis were older, had more HCV+ and lower MELD score (11.8\u00b15.0 vs 22.4\u00b18.6: P<0.001), CRP (15.8\u00b121.8\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 vs 22.9\u00b126.1: P=0.009) and neopterin (22.2\u00b121.0 nmol\u2009l\u22121 vs 58.1\u00b176.8: P<0.001) than cirrhotic patients without HCC\u2212 (Table 1). AFP test was carried out in 102 cirrhotic patients; 23 of 49 HCC+ and 9 of 53 HCC\u2212 patients had positive results (P<0.0001). Serum levels of TPO (226\u00b1210\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 163\u00b1247: P<0.001) and chemokines CCL4 (170\u00b1378\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 vs 101\u00b1483: P<0.0001), CCL5 (3.6\u00b15.5 vs 2.0\u00b14.5 ng\u2009ml\u22121: P<0.0001) and CXCL5 (230\u00b1301 vs 118\u00b1159\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121: P<0.001) were higher, whereas surprisingly CCL2 (129\u00b1192\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 (median=80) vs 245\u00b1689 (median=111): P=0.008) was lower in HCC+ than in HCC\u2212 cirrhotic patients (Table 2 and Figure 1). Interestingly, the apoptosis marker M30 (P=0.60), M65 (P=0.92), GCSF (P=0.66), VEGF (P=0.51) and FGF basic (P=0.28) were similar in the two patient groups. The results indicate high expression of particular chemokines in HCC patients compared with cirrhotic patients without HCC. To calculate sensitivities, specificities and cutoff values, we preformed ROC analysis for significant parameters. The best cutoff values were 170\u2009pg, 66\u2009pg, 0.86\u2009ng and 84\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 for TPO, CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL5, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 69, 67, 59 and 70% for TPO, 66, 74, 67 and 73% for CCL4, 71, 68, 62 and 74% for CCL5 and 71, 63, 59 and 72% for CXCL5, respectively (Figure 2). AFP had a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 89%, a PPV of 79% and a NPV of 64%. Univariate regression analyses showed that AFP\u2a7e20 IU (Odds ratio (OR)=5.10, CI 1.71\u201315.21: P=0.003), TPO\u2a7e170\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 OR=3.74, CI 1.84\u20137.60: P<0.001), CCL4\u2a7e66\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 (OR=4.10, CI 2.00\u20138.36: P=0.0001), CXCL5\u2a7e84\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 (OR=4.00, CI 1.97\u20138.27: P=0.0001) and CCL5\u2a7e0.86 ng\u2009ml\u22121 (OR=4.42, CI 2.16\u20139.06: P<0.0001) in cirrhotic patients are diagnostic markers of HCC. Multivariate forward stepwise regression analysis of significant parameters showed that, among the studied parameters, serum CCL4\u2a7e66\u2009pg\u2009ml\u22121 (OR=6.24, CI 2.55\u201315.23: P<0.0001), CCL5\u2a7e0.86\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 (OR=3.63, CI 1.48\u20138.88: P=0.004) and AFP\u2a7e20 IU (OR=5.69, CI 1.58\u201320.37: P=0.004) have the best association with HCC. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to calculate correlation between significant variables. HCC conversely correlated with MELD score (r=\u22120.382: P<0.0001), serum CRP (r=\u22120.213: P=0.009), neopterin (r=\u22120.353: P<0.001) and IL-6 (r=\u22120.356: P<0.0001) and positively with age (r=0.401: P<0.0001), TPO (r=0.316: P<0.001), CCL4 (r=0.366: P<0.0001), CCL5 (r=0.363: P<0.0001), CXCL5 (r=0.319: P<0.001) and AFP (r=0.421: P<0.0001). TACE procedure was performed in 40 HCC patients. MELD score, liver function tests, chemokine levels, neopterin, CRP and albumin levels were similar in patients with and without TACE and in patients with and without detectable AFP (P=not significant for all investigations). Tumour size was only correlated with TPO (r=0.41: P=0.002). In the present study, we investigated the serum levels of biomarkers, including cytokeratin 18 (M65), cytokeratin 18 (CK18; M30) fragment, TPO, CC and CXC motif chemokines and AFP, to find a diagnostic marker for HCC. A detailed comparison of serum levels and/or production of CXCL5 and CC chemokines between healthy controls and patients with ESLD has not been performed so far. The results of our study indicate that patients with advanced fibrosis and ESLD are unable to produce sufficient chemokines, in accordance with previous studies showing low expression and production of chemokines in cirrhotic patients. CK18 is an apoptosis marker and a major intermediate filament protein in liver cells and a popular marker for detecting liver fibrosis in recent years. This apoptosis marker increased in sera of patients with cirrhotic liver diseases compared with healthy controls, reflecting the higher rate of apoptosis. Chemokines \u2013 biomolecules that induce chemotaxis \u2013 have a fundamental role not only in inflammation and immune surveillance but also in cancer progression. Chemokines are important mediators of host defense functioning in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes and other cells at the sites of injury, infection and neoplasia (Driscoll, 1994). C-C receptor 5 is a receptor for CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 and is expressed in effector and effector memory subsets of Th1 CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells (Kang and Shin, 2011). Previous studies showed high expression of CCL4 and CCL5 chemokines in viral, alcoholic and autoimmune inflammatory diseases in the liver (Bautista, 2001; Bautista and Wang, 2001; Maghazachi, 2010; Kang and Shin, 2011). Intrahepatic and peripheral blood levels of chemokines CCL4 and CCL5 are increased during chronic hepatitis C. In patients with HCV infection intrahepatic expression of CCL4 and CCL5, especially in periportal and lobular areas is increased, and their levels of expression were significantly associated with the degree of liver inflammation. CCL4 and CCL5 expression have also been associated with liver histological activity index in chronic hepatitis C. CCL4 and CCL5 are potent chemoattractants for memory T lymphocytes, monocytes, NK cells and eosinophils, and they attract cells through an interaction with their receptor CCR5. CCL5 was found to be highly expressed in activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, platelets, mesangial cells, epithelial cells, megakaryocytes and some tumours. Interaction between host cells and cancer cells happens via a large variety of soluble factors. The association of chemokines with cancer is not surprising, as they both promote and restrict tumour onset and/or progression. CCL4 and CCL5 are expressed in human breast cancer and CCL5 is associated with the progression of particularly triple-negative (ostrogen, progesterone and tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 negative) breast cancer. This chemokine can regulate the function of effector cells and chemotaxis relies on its concentration. Therefore, the increased level of CCL5 can enhance its role in chemotaxis. CCL5 is minimally expressed by normal breast epithelial duct cells but is highly expressed by breast tumour cells, suggesting that this chemokine has a role in breast cancer development and/or progression (Soria and Ben-Baruch, 2008; Lapteva and Huang, 2010). Upregulation of CCL4 in human colon and gastric cancer was reported previously. Following prostatectomy, the expression of CCL4 is associated with recurrence of prostate cancer and the absence of CCL4 expression supported recurrence-free survival after prostatectomy. HCC is the commonest primary malignant cancer of the liver in the world. Some cancer staging systems, grading severity of dysfunction and tumour burden can estimate the survival of HCC patients. CCR1 binds a particular set of C-C chemokines, including CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, and is expressed by a variety of cells, including lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, neutrophils and bone marrow progenitor cells. CCR5, another specific receptor for CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, was also detected in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes but not in hepatoma cells. Lu et al (2003) provided that hepatoma cells express CCR1 in vitro and in vivo. The correlation between CCL5 and HCC is a controversial issue, whereas an association between HCC susceptibility and genetic polymorphism of CCL5-28 and CCL5-403 was described. A study by Liu et al (1999) provides evidence of CCL5\u201328G mutation with increased transcription of the RANTES gene. To our knowledge, the association of HCC with CCL4 gene expression and/or serum levels was not studied so far. Thus our report is the first study that evaluates this association. CCL4 and CCL5 can bind to their receptors in the carcinomatous tissues and Kupffer cells in the liver and induce the infiltration of various inflammatory cells. We speculate that cirrhotic high producers of CCL4 and CCL5 are at higher risk of HCC. It can be postulated that high serum levels of CCL4 and CCL5 indicate the presence of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis and along with other indicators can help in early detection of HCC. Algorithmic approach of our results (Figure 3) indicates that AFP is a specific test in patients with suspected HCC (imaging). When imaging is positive but AFP is negative, surrogate markers such CCL5 and CCL4 are confirmatory tests. We recommend a liver biopsy in patients with positive imaging and negative AFP, when CCL5 and/or CCL4 are positive. Furthermore, future large prospective studies may be needed to investigate the association between these chemokines and hepatocellular carcinoma. Until now, AFP together with imaging and pathology detection are commonly used in the clinical early diagnosis of liver cancer. However, the specificity and sensitivity of AFP used in screening for liver cancer are not satisfactory. The results of the present study indicate that CCL4 and CCL5 are more sensitive and AFP more specific markers of HCC and that monitoring the combination of these markers might be an innovative approach in the early diagnosis of HCC."}, "28604678": {"pmid": "28604678", "pmcid": "PMC5493987", "title": "Dynamic subunit turnover in ESCRT-III assemblies is regulated by Vps4 to mediate membrane remodelling during cytokinesis", "abstract": "\nThe Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT)-III mediates membrane fission in fundamental cellular processes, including cytokinesis.

ESCRT-III forms polymers that are thought to constrict membrane necks until they split18\u201325, but the mechanism underlying constriction is unknown. ESCRT-III is evolutionary conserved from humans to archaea, and is composed of four structurally related core subunits with distinct functions18\u201327. Budding yeast Vps20 (human homolog is CHMP6) functions as a nucleation factor, Snf7 (human homolog CHMP4 has three isoforms, A-C) serves as a main polymer subunit, Vps24 (CHMP3 in humans) and Vps2 (CHMP2A and B isoforms in humans) inhibit Snf7 polymerization28\u201332 and recruit the ATPase Vps4, which is thought to predominantly disassemble ESCRT-III polymers30,31,33\u201338. How different ESCRT-III components coordinately assemble and remodel polymer structures has remained unclear. Purified ESCRT-III subunits polymerize into filaments that form spirals on flat membranes or helices on membrane tubes36,39\u201345. ESCRT-III also forms filament spirals and helices in intact cells44,46,47, and it is required for the assembly of large filament helices that constrict the intercellular bridge during cytokinetic abscission4. Prevailing models propose that ESCRT-III mediates membrane fission by sequential assembly of distinct subunits18\u201323,25, whereby late-binding Vps2/Vps24 (CHMP2/CHMP3) subunits might form a rigid dome-shaped scaffold to guide attached membranes towards the fission site36 or induce changes in the curvature of pre-assembled Snf7 filament spirals to promote membrane neck constriction41. These models rely on the sequential addition of distinct subunits and the persistence of ESCRT-III polymers, yet this has not been directly observed under physiological conditions. We hence set out to systematically quantify the assembly kinetics, dynamics, and structure of ESCRT polymers in live human cells and in an in vitro reconstitution system. To investigate the dynamics of ESCRT-III polymers at the abscission site, we generated stable HeLa cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged subunits. We found that CHMP4B tagged with GFP via a long flexible linker (Localization and Affinity Purification tag, LAP) and expressed close to endogenous levels4 did not perturb abscission (Fig. 1a). To probe the functionality of LAP-tagged CHMP4B, we depleted endogenous CHMP4B in wild-type HeLa cells or in HeLa cells stably expressing siRNA-resistant mouse CHMP4B-LAP (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Cytokinetic abscission was substantially perturbed upon depletion of endogenous CHMP4B in wild-type HeLa cells, but was not affected in mouse-CHMP4B-LAP-expressing HeLa cells (Fig. 1a), validating the functionality of CHMP4B-LAP. We next investigated the dynamics of midbody-localized ESCRT-III by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. Unexpectedly, we found that CHMP4B-LAP rapidly re-accumulated at the midbody following photobleaching (Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Video 1). A single exponential function constrained to initial fluorescence values did not fit the FRAP kinetics (Fig. 1c), indicating the presence of two populations of CHMP4B-LAP with distinct residence times at the midbody. We determined the residence times for the two midbody-localized fractions by a double-exponential fit (Fig. 1b, h, i). A highly mobile fraction of 64 \u00b1 6% (mean \u00b1 SEM, as in the rest of the paper, if not otherwise noted) of CHMP4B-LAP had a residence time of 19.5 \u00b1 2.7 s, whereas a stably-bound fraction of 36 \u00b1 2% had a residence time of 716.0 \u00b1 91.3 s. Modeling the stably-bound fraction as completely immobile also yielded a good approximation (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). Importantly, both methods of model fitting yielded consistent values for the fraction and residence time of the highly mobile pool (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Thus, the majority of CHMP4B-LAP molecules at the midbody continuously turns over with a cytoplasmic pool \u2013 at a rate up to two orders of magnitude faster than the macroscopic accumulation of ESCRT-III at the midbody4,5. ESCRT-III initially localizes within two cortical regions adjacent to the midbody, which later constrict to split the plasma membrane4,5. Photobleaching of CHMP4B-LAP prior to or during constriction stages revealed similar recovery kinetics (Fig. 1b, d, e, and Supplementary Video 1), indicating that midbody-localized ESCRT-III dynamically turns over subunits with cytoplasmic pools during its macroscopic accumulation and constriction. We next investigated the localization and dynamics of other ESCRT-III subunits. We tagged human CHMP2B, CHMP3 and CHMP4B with the same design used for tagging mouse CHMP4B. All three LAP-tagged ESCRT-III subunits localized to the midbody (Fig. 2f, g, and Supplementary Video 2) and did not perturb abscission (Supplementary Fig. 2a-d). CHMP2B, CHMP3, and CHMP4B subunits accumulated at the midbody with indistinguishable kinetics (Fig. 2f, g, and Supplementary Video 2). Hence, ESCRT-III assembles at the midbody with a fairly constant proportion of different core subunits during the progression of abscission. We next probed the dynamics of human CHMP2B, CHMP3, and CHMP4B at the midbody. FRAP experiments showed that all three subunits had highly mobile fractions with residence times similar to mouse CHMP4B (Fig. 1h, i, and Supplementary Fig. 2g-i). We noticed somewhat variable kinetics at late stages of FRAP recovery, which resulted in inaccurate fitting of single exponential functions (Supplementary Fig. 2e-g). Given the technical difficulty to accurately measure long residence times, the relevance of the observed variations remains unclear. Importantly, however, all FRAP experiments consistently show that highly mobile fractions of CHMP2B, CHMP3, and CHMP4B dynamically turn over with similar residence times. Overall, our experiments show that ESCRT-III forms highly dynamic assemblies at the midbody. We wondered if VPS4 could be responsible for ESCRT-III turnover, as it is the only known nucleotide hydrolase in the ESCRT-III pathway30,33. VPS4 was previously detected at the midbody only during late stages of abscission5, which would be inconsistent with its contribution to the high ESCRT-III turnover observed during early stages. However, previous measurements of VPS4 accumulation were based on overexpression from a viral promoter5, which could limit its detection at the midbody owing to high cytoplasmic background. We thus re-examined VPS4 accumulation in cells stably expressing LAP-tagged murine VPS4B from its endogenous promoter (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In these cells, VPS4B-LAP indeed accumulated at the midbody simultaneously with CHMP4B-LAP (Fig. 2a, b, and Supplementary Video 3). Thus, VPS4 is present at early stages and could contribute to ESCRT-III dynamics throughout the entire abscission process. To investigate the role of VPS4 in ESCRT-III dynamics, we depleted both isoforms VPS4A and VPS4B in CHMP4B-LAP-expressing cells using RNAi. Depletion of endogenous VPS4A/B to undetectable levels at 48 h after siRNA transfection (Supplementary Fig. 3b) substantially reduced the amount of CHMP4B-LAP at the midbody (Fig. 2c, and Supplementary Fig. 3c). FRAP experiments revealed that under this condition, CHMP4B-LAP turnover at the midbody was almost completely suppressed (Fig. 2e, f). We considered that this phenotype may arise from the strong reduction of the cytoplasmic CHMP4B concentration, owing to the accumulation of ESCRT-III at endosomes upon complete VPS4 depletion47,48 (Fig. 3c, d). However, partial depletion of VPS4A/B at 20 h after siRNA transfection also reduced the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (Fig. 2e, f) without altering the cytoplasmic CHMP4B-LAP concentration (Fig. 2c, d). The cytoplasmic levels of CHMP2B-LAP or CHMP3-LAP were also not affected upon partial VPS4A/B depletion (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). Furthermore, microinjection of recombinant human CHMP4B protein into telophase cells resulted in rapid accumulation at the midbody in control cells, but a much slower rate in VPS4A/B-depleted cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). Together, these experiments show that VPS4 is required for dynamic turnover of ESCRT-III at the midbody. We next studied how VPS4 contributes to abscission. RNAi depletion of VPS4A/B delayed abscission and frequently caused cleavage furrow regression (Fig. 3a, b). These abscission failures did not occur in cells stably expressing murine VPS4B-LAP, which is resistant to siRNA targeting human VPS4A/B (Fig. 3b, and Supplementary Fig. 3a), validating that this phenotype is caused by on-target depletion. To gain further insight into the underlying defect, we investigated the ultrastructure of intercellular bridges in cryo-immobilized telophase cells. Most of the control cells contained constriction zones adjacent to the midbody with regularly spaced 17 nm diameter filaments and compressed bundles of microtubules (Fig. 3c; 4 out of 7 cells), as previously observed4. After partial VPS4A/B depletion at 26 h after siRNA transfection, only a small fraction of cells had 17 nm filaments (Fig. 3d; 4 out of 27 cells), and narrow constriction zones were never observed. Together, these data indicate that VPS4 is required for the formation and constriction of a functional ESCRT-III apparatus at intercellular bridges. The high ESCRT-III dynamics in cells prompted us to dissect the specific contribution of each subunit in vitro. As purified human ESCRT-III proteins are difficult to spontaneously polymerize on flat membranes under physiological concentrations49, we considered to use the evolutionarily conserved budding yeast proteins. We first tested whether budding yeast Snf7 (homolog of human CHMP4) can in principle recapitulate the cellular dynamics observed for human proteins and therefore expressed a LAP-tagged version in HeLa cells. Budding yeast Snf7-LAP specifically localized to the midbody during abscission and rapidly recovered after photobleaching similar to human and mouse CHMP4B-LAP (Supplementary Fig. 5a-d), validating the use of yeast proteins for in vitro analysis of ESCRT-III dynamics. Previous work showed that Snf7 spontaneously polymerizes on membrane covered areas of coverslips to form large patches composed of densely packed filament spirals43. We studied patch growth kinetics only in central areas of membrane-covered regions, as patches stop growth at the edge of membrane-covered regions (Supplementary Fig. 5e-g). We first investigated how Vps24 (homolog of human CHMP3) and Vps2 (CHMP2) affected the kinetics of Snf7 polymerization. We therefore incubated supported lipid bilayers with fluorescently labeled Snf7 until patches formed and then simultaneously added Vps2 and Vps24 (Fig. 4a, b, and Supplementary Video 4; 22 min). Following rapid binding, Vps2 and Vps24 suppressed patch growth and strongly reduced further accumulation of Snf7 in patches (Fig. 4c, d, and Supplementary Fig. 6a-c). Sequential injection of Vps2 and Vps24 into the fluid chamber further showed that these subunits depend on each other in their Snf7 growth-inhibitory function (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 6d, e, and Supplementary Videos 5 and 6). Thus, prolonged phases of ESCRT-III assembly, as observed during cytokinetic abscission4,5, are not recapitulated by mixed solutions of Snf7, Vps2, and Vps24. The inhibition of Snf7 patch growth by Vps2/Vps24 could be caused by lower rates of Snf7 subunit accumulation or by an increase of the Snf7 dissociation rate. To investigate this, we incubated supported lipid bilayers with fluorescently labeled Snf7 until patches formed and then washed out soluble Snf7. We subsequently added fluorescently labeled Vps2 and Vps24, which enriched at the edge of the patch, where newly growing Snf7 filament spirals localize43 (Fig. 4f, g, and Supplementary Video 7). Snf7 remained stably bound to patches throughout the entire imaging period, indicating that Snf7 polymers have extremely low intrinsic subunit dissociation rates irrespective of their association with Vps2 and Vps24. The inhibition of Snf7 patch growth imposed by Vps2 and Vps24 is thus independent of Vps4 and caused by a reduced rate of Snf7 subunit incorporation. We next investigated if growth inhibition by Vps2 and Vps24 could arise from an ultrastructural change in ESCRT-III polymers. Transmission electron microscopy showed that Snf7 alone polymerized on liposomes to form one-start spirals containing a single 4.5 nm wide filament, which occasionally paired between neighboring turns (Fig. 5a, b), as previously observed43. When Vps2 and Vps24 were added after Snf7 polymerization, filaments appeared double-stranded and neighboring spiral turns occasionally bundled to form quadruple strands with an approximate width of 15 nm (Fig. 5c, d) \u2013 close to the width of ESCRT-III-dependent filaments observed at the abscission site in vertebrate cells4 (Fig. 5c-f; compare Fig. 3c). Given the one-start single-stranded geometry of Snf7 spirals prior to addition of Vps2/Vps24, the paired filaments likely represent lateral copolymers of Vps2/Vps24 along Snf7. To further characterize the morphological changes of Snf7 filaments upon addition of Vps2/24, we visualized ESCRT-III assemblies by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) (Fig. 5g). Snf7 alone formed spirals with pronounced filaments, but subsequent addition of Vps2/Vps24 induced a compact disc-like morphology (Fig. 5g-i). This is consistent with a filament thickening and bundling limiting access of the AFM tip in between neighboring spiral turns. Together, these data suggest that Vps2/Vps24 might reduce the rate of Snf7 polymerization through the formation of bundled filaments. In cells, Vps2 and Vps24 are both present in the cytoplasm, raising the question of how ESCRT-III polymerization is sustained over prolonged periods. Our in vivo observations imply the possibility that Vps4 might leverage Vps2/Vps24-mediated growth inhibition by ESCRT-III turnover. To explore whether Vps4 promotes ESCRT-III turnover in vitro, we separately measured ESCRT-III subunit association and dissociation kinetics. We first determined the rate by which Vps4 disassembles Snf7 patches in the absence of Vps2 and Vps24. We polymerized Snf7 on supported lipid membranes, washed out soluble Snf7, and then added Vps4 and ATP. This did not cause detectable disassembly of Snf7 patches even at very high Vps4 concentrations (Fig. 6a, b), indicating that Vps4-mediated Snf7 depolymerization strictly depends on Vps2/Vps24, as shown before37. We thus quantified the rate of Vps4-mediated ESCRT-III patch disassembly in presence of Vps2 and Vps24. We first polymerized Snf7 patches on supported lipid membranes, then removed the soluble pool of Snf7, and subsequently added a mix of fluorescently labeled Vps2 and unlabeled Vps24, Vps4, and ATP. Vps2 first bound to Snf7 patches and subsequently partially disassembled together with Snf7 (Fig. 6c, d, Supplementary Fig. 7a, b, and Supplementary Video 8). Thus, Vps4-mediated Snf7 depolymerization is fast enough to account for dynamic turnover of its homolog CHMP4B at the midbody in human cells. To characterize the Snf7-disassembly process at the molecular level, we visualized morphological changes of individual ESCRT-III spirals by HS-AFM. We polymerized Snf7 patches on supported lipid bilayers, then added Vps2 and Vps24, and subsequently washed out the soluble components. We then added Vps4 and ATP and acquired HS-AFM movies, which showed that ESCRT-III spirals reduced their diameter (Fig. 6e, f, and Supplementary Video 9). When omitting ATP from the reaction, Vps4 did not disassemble ESCRT-III spirals (Fig. 6g, and Supplementary Video 10), confirming that ESCRT-III disassembly is an energy-consuming process. Given that the ESCRT-III spirals did not depolymerize below a certain diameter, these data suggest that Vps4 mediates Snf7 filament disassembly predominantly from the outer regions of spirals, whereby inner spiral segments are refractory to disassembly. We next tested whether Vps4 can mediate Snf7 turnover in vitro. For this purpose, we used Snf7 subunits labeled with two distinct fluorophores. We first incubated supported lipid bilayers with AlexaFluor-488-labeled Snf7 until patches formed and then added Vps24 and Vps2 to inhibit further patch growth (Fig. 7a-c, see 0 - 45 min, and Supplementary Video 11). We then exchanged the soluble pool of Snf7-AlexaFluor-488 with Snf7-Atto-647N while maintaining Vps2 and Vps24 in the reaction. At this point, we also added Vps4. Snf7 polymer patches maintained constant size and did not incorporate Atto-647N-Snf7, presumably because ATP was not yet present (Fig. 7a-c, see 45 - 54 min). Indeed, subsequent ATP addition caused dissociation of AlexaFluor-488-Snf7 from patches, but also concomitant binding of Atto-647N-Snf7 (Fig. 7a-c, see 54 - 88 min). Thus, an ATP-dependent activity of Vps4 promotes not only disassembly of ESCRT-III but also the formation of new ESCRT-III polymers on membranes. Interestingly, Vps4 and ATP also restored the macroscopic growth of Snf7 patches despite the continued presence of Vps2 and Vps24 (Fig. 7a, b, see 58 - 88 min, and Supplementary Video 11). We thus tested if a solution containing Vps4, ATP, and all three ESCRT-III subunits supports nucleation and growth of ESCRT-III polymers as observed in vivo. Strikingly, this combination resulted in efficient nucleation and growth of ESCRT-III patches, in contrast to a mix that lacked Vps4 (Fig. 7d, e). Furthermore, the net ESCRT-III assembly rate increased with higher concentrations of Vps4 (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Thus, Vps4 promotes net growth of ESCRT-III assemblies in presence of growth-inhibiting Vps2 and Vps24 subunits. To study Vps4-mediated polymer remodeling at the molecular level, we visualized ESCRT-III spirals by HS-AFM. We assembled Snf7 spirals on supported lipid bilayers and then added Vps2, Vps24, Vps4, and ATP. This induced a drastic reorganization of ESCRT-III polymers: preexisting spirals reduced their size, while many new spirals nucleated and grew in between the original spirals (Fig. 8a, b, and Supplementary Video 12). The innermost parts of ESCRT-III spirals appeared refractory to disassembly and thus might represent the stably-bound fraction of ESCRT-III observed by fluorescence microscopy. In contrast, pre-existing spirals remained unchanged in the absence of ATP (Fig. 8c, and Fig. 6g). Thus, Vps4 induces a dynamic steady-state with both growing and shrinking ESCRT-III spirals when Snf7, Vps2, Vps24 are present in solution. Furthermore, while ESCRT-III spirals formed an immobile array in the absence of ATP, the addition of ATP induced substantial lateral mobility of individual ESCRT-III spirals relative to each other (Fig. 8d-f, and Fig. 6g). Thus, in the presence of Vps4 and ATP, ESCRT-III forms highly dynamic polymer structures on membranes. Our study shows that membrane-bound ESCRT-III polymers rapidly turn over subunits with cytoplasmic pools while they assemble into larger structures. The dynamic subunit turnover is driven by Vps4 and is necessary to sustain efficient net growth of ESCRT-III assemblies in presence of inhibitory Vps2 and Vps24 subunits. Most previous models for ESCRT-III-mediated membrane fission imply sequential recruitment of different ESCRT-III subunits and Vps4 to establish distinct phases of polymer growth, reorganization/maturation, and disassembly5,14,18\u201321,23\u201325,28,30,31. However, our study shows that different ESCRT-III subunits and VPS4 accumulate at the midbody with indistinguishable kinetics. This does not rule out sequential subunit binding at the single-filament level, but indicates that the distinct stages of ESCRT-III accumulation, constriction, and disassembly during abscission cannot be explained by a sequence of subunit binding. Our findings call for re-interpretation of the terminal phenotype resulting from Vps4 depletion \u2013the accumulation of ESCRT-III polymers in endosomes (termed class E compartment in yeast) that has led to the model of Vps4 serving predominantly as a disassembly factor 26,28,33,50. We show that Vps4 is important for efficient ESCRT-III assembly, yet we also note that residual slow ESCRT-III polymerization in the absence of Vps4 is sufficient to ultimately capture all cytoplasmic subunits in class E compartments \u2013 owing to the extremely low intrinsic subunit dissociation rates. At the molecular level, Vps4 might promote the net growth of ESCRT-III assemblies by constant turnover of Vps2 and Vps24 in side-by-side co-polymers along Snf7 filaments \u2013 to create growth-competent free Snf7 filament tips (Fig. 8g). Furthermore, Vps4 might induce subunit turnover at the core of ESCRT-III filament bundles, in analogy to interaction of the Vps4 homolog Spastin with the lattice of microtubules51 (Fig. 8g). In contrast to previous models5,52, however, Vps4 does not cut an ESCRT-III helix during a single definite time point to induce tension release, but rather continuously remodels filaments. Within bundled filaments, such turnover does not necessarily lead to a complete breakage of larger structures. The innermost parts of ESCRT-III spirals appear refractory to disassembly even at high concentrations of Vps4, suggesting that ESCRT-III interaction with Vps4 might depend on mechanical stress owing to low filament curvature or on filament polarity. Potential stochastic fluctuations in subunit turnover rates could then lead to dynamic growth and shrinkage of ESCRT-III spirals. Vps4-induced subunit turnover in ESCRT-III assemblies might directly contribute to membrane constriction. Indeed, macroscopic shape changes of many other cellular polymer structures critically depend on dynamic subunit turnover within the constituent filaments, as for example mitotic spindles53 or actomyosin rings54. In ESCRT-III assemblies, Vps4-induced subunit turnover might facilitate sliding of adjacent helix turns, thereby promoting constriction of mechanically pre-stressed, low-curved filaments into more relaxed high-curvature states43. The underlying bending forces could be generated by binding of Vps2 and Vps24 to Snf741, or by shortening-induced increase of filament rigidity. By revealing dynamic subunit turnover in ESCRT-III assemblies, our study provides a framework for understanding how this highly conserved membrane fission machinery adapts to diverse membrane geometries. A Gateway recombination cassette was inserted into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) to generate a Tet-inducible pTO_mCherry_N-DEST. Next, mCherry was exchanged with a LAP tag using KpnI and XbaI (ThermoFisher Scientific), resulting in pTO_LAP_N-DEST, a Gateway destination vector for C-terminal LAP tags that allows FRT recombination and Tet-inducible expression. Expression vectors were generated by recombining pTO_LAP_N-DEST with Gateway entry clones containing cDNA of human ESCRT-III subunits in pDONR223 (obtained from hORFeome Database) or S. cerevisiae SNF7 (amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pDONR223) using Gateway LR Clonase II (Invitrogen), to generate pTO_CHMP2B_LAP, pTO_CHMP3_LAP, pTO_CHMP4B_LAP and pTO_SNF7_LAP. Cell lines for inducible expression of ESCRT-III subunits were generated from HeLa Kyoto FRT_H2B-mRED55. To remove H2B-mRED, cells were grown without selection for H2B-mRED in medium containing 0.5 \u00b5g/mL puromycin (Merck), 400 \u00b5g/mL zeocin (Invitrogen), but no G418. Cells were then FACS-sorted for the absence of red fluorescence, and single clones were isolated. Inducible ESCRT-III constructs were then integrated into the FRT site by co-transfection with pOG44 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1:10, and selected in medium containing 300 \u03bcg/mL hygromycin B (Roche) and 0.5 \u03bcg/mL puromycin (Merck). To generate a cell line expressing mmVPS4B-LAP, the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) RP24-139J22 was used to GFP-tag mouse VPS4B using BAC-TransGeneOmics56,57. Homologous recombination yielded BAC DNA containing VPS4B-LAP, which was isolated and transfected into HeLa cells using Effectene (Qiagen), and selected in medium containing 400 \u00b5g/mL G418 (Invitrogen). All HeLa BAC-GFP cell lines were cultured in medium supplemented with 300 \u03bcg/mL G418 (Invitrogen). No cell line used in this study is listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines that is maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample. The HeLa Wildtype cell line (\u2018Kyoto\u2019 strain) was obtained from S. Narumiya (Kyoto University, Japan) and validated by a Multiplex human Cell line Authentication test (MCA), 21.04.16. All cell lines have been regularly tested for mycoplasma, and a contamination has never been detected. HeLa cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% (v/v) Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). For live-cell imaging, cells were plated in LabTek II chambered coverslips (ThermoFisher Scientific) or glass bottom dishes (\u00b5-Dish35 mm, high Glass Bottom, Ibidi) in cell culture medium without riboflavin and phenol red to minimize background fluorescence58. Microtubules were stained with 100 nM SiR-tubulin59 and 10 \u00b5M verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich; to inhibit efflux of SiR-tubulin from cells), at least 1 h before imaging. Protein expression in cell lines bearing hsCHMP2B-LAP, hsCHMP3-LAP or hsCHMP4B-LAP was induced with 0.2 ng/mL doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich), titrated to match levels of mmCHMP4B-LAP from the BAC construct. For expression of yeast Snf7-LAP, HeLa Kyoto FRT were transfected with pTO_SNF7_LAP using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche) 24 h prior to imaging, and induced with 0.05 ng/mL doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope controlled by ZEN 2011 and an autofocus macro (AutofocusScreen) kindly provided by Jan Ellenberg (EMBL). Imaging was performed in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 37\u00b0C in an incubation chamber (EMBL). For analysis of accumulation kinetics, cells were imaged with a 63x 1.4 NA oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss). ESCRT-III levels at the midbody were quantified in single optical sections using Fiji60. For normalization, the fluorescence signal prior to ESCRT-III accumulation was set to zero. Due to the variable duration of abscission, we chose the earliest time point for which we had data in all cells, which was at 48 min before abscission. Peak signals were normalized to the average midbody fluorescence from 12 min before to 6 min after abscission. Accumulation curves in VPS4A/B depletion experiments were normalized to 18-30 min after complete cleavage furrow ingression. For quantification of abscission timing, cells were imaged with a 40x 1.4 NA oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss). Abscission timing was measured as the duration from complete cleavage furrow ingression until the first disassembly of the midbody microtubules. For VPS4B rescue experiments, only cells expressing mmVPS4B-LAP were analyzed. Midbodies were imaged using a 63x 1.4 NA oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss). Photobleaching was performed in circular regions with 2 iterations of 488 nm at 42-fold higher laser intensity compared to that used for imaging. Fluorescence was measured in midbody regions followed by background subtraction. For normalization, acquisition photobleaching and ESCRT-III net accumulation during the recording interval was measured separately for early and late-stage midbodies. FRAP curves were then normalized to the mean of the pre-bleach fluorescence and to the first frame after photobleaching. For all different constructs, cells with expression levels similar to that of mmCHMP4B-LAP cells were used. To determine FRAP recovery kinetics, we fitted single exponential functions f(t) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212kt, single exponential functions with a variable immobile fraction f(t) = A(1 \u2212 e\u2212kt), or double exponential functions f(t) = A1(1 \u2212 e\u2212k1t) + (1 \u2212 A1)(1 \u2212 e\u2212k2t), using the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares algorithm (minpack.lm package for R, version 3.0.2). Convergence to minimal residuals was reached in ~76% of the curves. Residence times were calculated from the dissociation rates as 1/k1 and 1/k2. Because the slow dissociation rate k2 was frequently fitted as 0 due to a completely stable fraction, we derived the slow residence times from the Taylor expansion to calculate the reciprocal mean from E[Y]=E[1X]=\u03bcY=1\u03bc+\u03c32\u03bc3, and standard deviation from \u03c3Y=\u03c3\u03bc2, where \u00b5 is the mean and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. Since the long residence time could not be measured accurately due to the relatively short duration of measurements, we constrained k2 to the mean \u00b1 SD of mmCHMP4B-LAP in all experiments. For comparison of highly mobile fractions, we additionally constrained k1 to the mean k1 of mmCHMP4B-LAP, which corresponds to a residence time of 19.5 s. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) with non-targeting siRNA siControl (ambion, sense strand: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt), or siRNAs targeting CHMP4B (Microsynth, sense strand: AGAAAGAAGAGGAGGACGAtt)4,61, VPS4A (Microsynth, sense strand: CCGAGAAGCUGAAGGAUUAtt)61, or VPS4B (Microsynth, sense strand: CCAAAGAAGCACUGAAAGAtt)61, at a final concentration of 80 nM. Samples were analyzed at the indicated times after transfection. To generate a CHMP4B bacterial expression plasmid containing an N-terminal 6xHis tag followed by a maltose binding protein (MBP) and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, human CHMP4B was cloned into pMBP-HIS2-Snf7 (Addgene #21492), by replacing Snf7 with PCR-amplified CHMP4B using BamHI and NotI. For production of recombinant protein, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli Rosetta cells and expressed for 3 h at 30\u00b0C after induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. Bacterial were lysed by sonication at 4\u00b0C in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Hepes pH8, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). CHMP4B was purified using affinity chromatography (MBPTrap HP 5 mL column, GE Healthcare), washed with 20 mM Hepes pH8, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and eluted in 20 mM Hepes pH8, 10 mM maltose, followed by removal of maltose using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (7K MWCO 5 mL, ThermoFisher Scientific). After cleavage with TEV protease, the resulting His-MBP fragment was removed by incubation with Ni-NTA Agarose beads (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1 h, followed by incubation with Dextrin Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h to remove remaining protein that was not cleaved by TEV protease. Purified CHMP4B was labeled with Atto-565-NHS ester (Sigma-Aldrich), by incubation with two molar excess of reactive dye in the presence of 100 mM NaHCO3 pH9. Excess free dye was removed by dialysis against 20 mM Hepes pH8 at 4\u00b0C using a MWCO membrane of 12-14 kDa, and the sample was further purified using Zeba spin desalting columns (ThermoFisher Scientific). The resulting labeling density was ~80%. Protein aggregates were removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the protein stored at -80\u00b0C after flash freezing. For microinjection into cells, CHMP4B was ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 80,000 g at 4\u00b0C and loaded into Femtotips (Eppendorf). Microinjection was performed using InjectMan 4 micromanipulator (Eppendorf) and the FemtoJet 4i (Eppendorf) microinjection system, with an injection pressure of 100 hPa, an injection time of 0.2-0.5 s, and a maintenance pressure of 20 hPa. The microinjection system was mounted on the Zeiss LSM780 system described above, and cells were imaged with a 40x 1.4 NA oil DIC Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss) immediately prior and after injection. Fluorescence intensity of injected CHMP4B-Atto-565 was measured in midbody regions containing a CHMP4B-LAP signal. The mean intensity of the surrounding region was subtracted for background correction, and the first time point after injection was normalized to 0. Cells were seeded and transfected as described above in LabTek II chambered coverslips (ThermoScientific). Protein extracts were separated on 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to Nitrocellulose (Protran, GE Healthcare) or PVDF membranes (Amersham Hybond, GE Healthcare). Western blotting was performed by standard methods using antibodies against CHMP4B (1:1000, Abcam, ab105767), actin (1:30000, Merck Millipore, MAB1501), VPS4B (1:500, Abcam, ab137027), GFP (1:5000, Abcam, ab290) and GAPDH (1:2500, Abcam, ab9485). HeLa cells were seeded in T75 flasks and transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). At 23 h post-transfection, a primary shake-off was performed to remove dead cells and debris. Mitotic cells were harvested ~2 h later with a second shake-off, and seeded on 3 mm sapphire discs (M. Wohlwend GmbH) coated with 0.01% Poly-L-lysine (Sigma) in PBS. 97 min later, sapphire discs were transferred to a 3 mm aluminum specimen carrier (type B, flat side up) and covered with a second carrier (type A), which had a 50 \u00b5m cavity filled with 10% (w/v) BSA (AppliChem) in cell culture medium, followed by high-pressure freezing in an HPF Compact 01 (M. Wohlwend GmbH). Freeze substitution was performed using a Leica EM AFS-2, in a medium of anhydrous acetone (Merck) containing 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 0.1% uranyl acetate (Merck) according to the following protocol: 21 h at -90\u00b0C, warm up at a rate of 5\u00b0C per hour to -30\u00b0C, 6 h at -30\u00b0C, warm up at a rate of 5\u00b0C per hour to 0\u00b0C, 2 h at 0\u00b0C. Specimen were washed 3 times in anhydrous acetone (Merck) at 4\u00b0C and embedded in an Epon/Araldite resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Serial thin sections of a nominal thickness of 100 nm were collected on Formvar-coated (Electron Microscopy Science) copper slot grids (PLANO). Sections were post-stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate (Polyscience) and Reynold\u2019s lead citrate (Electron Microscopy Science), and imaged either on a Morgagni 268D transmission electron microscope (FEI) at 80 kV with a Morada CCD camera (Olympus-SIS), or on an EM 906 transmission electron microscope (Zeiss) at 80 kV with a slow-scan CCD camera (Albert-Tr\u00f6ndle Systems). ESCRT-III yeast proteins were expressed from plasmids encoding Snf7 (Addgene #21492), Vps2 (Addgene #21494), Vps24 (gift from James Hurley lab), Vps4 (Addgene #21495) and purified as previously described 31. Snf7 with a cysteine residue at the N-terminus of the protein was purified as in 62. Snf7 was labeled either with maleimide-Atto-647N (Atto-Tec AD 647N-4), or with TFP-AlexaFluor-488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, A-30005). Vps2 was labeled with Atto-565 (Atto-Tec AD 565-3), and Vps24 with Atto-488 (Atto-Tec AD 488-3). The proteins were used at the following concentrations: [Snf7] = 300 nM, [Vps2] = 100 nM, [Vps24] = 100 nM, [Vps4] = 2 \u00b5M, except in Fig 6a, b, Supplementary Fig. 5e-g and Supplementary Fig. 7, where concentrations are indicated in the figures. When added to the reaction, ATP concentration was 2 mM. Fluorescent proteins were mixed with unlabeled proteins at the following ratios: Snf7-Atto-647N, Vps2-Atto-565, Vps24-Atto-488: 1/3 labeled with 2/3 unlabeled; Snf7-AlexaFluor-488: 2/3 labeled with 1/3 unlabeled. GUVs were prepared by electroformation using 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS) mixtures (Avanti Polar Lipids). 20 \u00b5l of 1 mg/mL lipid mix (DOPC:DOPS, 6:4, mol:mol) were deposited on two indium tin oxide-coated glass slides (70-100 \u03a9 resistivity, Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in a vacuum drying oven for 1 h for complete solvent evaporation. An opened tor rubber joint of ~1 mm thickness was used as a non-leaky spacer between the two ITO slides, and the chamber was formed by compressing the two slides with spring metal tweezers. The chamber was filled with 400 \u00b5l of 500 mM sucrose solution and exposed to 1 V AC-current (10 Hz sinusoidal) at room temperature for 1 h. The resulting suspension was collected in a tube and used within the next days for experiments. The assay is described in detail in 43. Briefly, to prepare supported membranes, a cleaned coverslip was assembled to a flow chamber (Sticky-Slide VI 0.4, Ibidi), with one entry connected to a syringe pump (Aladdin, World Precision Instruments), and the other left open for sequential introduction of solutions. The flow chamber is initially filled with 200 \u00b5L of buffer and 5 \u00b5l of GUV suspension. After ~5 min, bursting of multiple vesicles was observed on the surface of the coverslip. Then 100 \u00b5l of casein (Sigma-Aldrich) solution at 1 mg/mL was incubated for 30 min in the flow chamber to block the bare glass around membrane patches. The chamber was then washed with 200 \u00b5l of buffer before starting the experiment. The buffer used for all in vitro experiments was composed of 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 6.8), 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl2. An anti-bleaching mix composed of 10 mM glucose, 12 KU/mL catalase, 49 U/mL Glucose Oxidase and 0.75 mg/mL Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich) was used. When the incubation duration was longer than 20 min, the solution was renewed to avoid loss of the antibleaching mix efficiency (Fig. 7, and Supplementary Fig. 7). Imaging was performed using a spinning disc confocal inverted microscope assembled by 3i (Intelligent Imaging Innovation) including a Nikon base (Eclipse C1, Nikon), a 100x 1.49 NA oil immersion objective with a CSU-W1 confocal head and a photometrics evolve camera. Nikon perfect focus system was used in combination with a multi-positioning system (ASI) to acquire multiple fields of view over time. Imaging was performed only in membrane-covered areas of the coverslip, which were distinguishable from the non-membrane-covered glass surface based on an unspecific background fluorescence of the labeled ESCRT-III subunits adsorbing onto glass. For all experiments, a 2 \u00b5m thick volume stack surrounding the coverslip surface was acquired with one minute time lapse. The raw data was processed in 3 steps. First, the 3D stacks were projected in 2D by a Fiji plugin63, which determines the right focal surface plane along a z-stack. Second, the field illumination inhomogeneity was corrected by dividing all the images by an image of a homogeneously labeled surface. Third, the x-y stage drift throughout the image acquisition was corrected using the plugin Turboreg. For each experiment, patches that did not fuse completely with neighboring patches were manually selected for quantification. For each patch, a slice was manually selected to extract a kymograph. The integrated fluorescence intensity of these kymographs was measured and maximum values were normalized to 1 for all experiments, except for Fig. 7c, where curves were adjusted to match the end point of the experiment. To calculate kinetics of patch disassembly, Snf7 mean patch intensity curves were fitted to exponential decay function f(t)=(1\u2212a)\u2217e\u2212t\u03c4+a. For electron microscopy, multilamellar vesicles made of DOPC:DOPS, 6:4 (mol:mol), were prepared at 5 mg/mL. For Snf7 only experiments, vesicles at 0.5 mg/mL were incubated for 1 h with Snf7 at 750 nM. For Snf7+Vps2+Vps24 experiments, Snf7 was first incubated as before, then Vps2 and Vps24 were added, each at 500 nM final concentration for 1 h. All samples were then centrifuged for 4 min at 4000 g, washed, adsorbed onto Formvar-coated EM grids, then negatively stained for 30 s with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were acquired using a Tecnai G2 Sphera (FEI) electron microscope. 1 \u00b5L of adsorption buffer (10 mM Hepes, 220 mM NaCl, 25 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) was added to freshly cleaved mica, followed by addition of 1 \u00b5L of the GUVs suspension. GUVs were incubated for 10 min, gently rinsed with imaging buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM KCl, pH 7.4), before immersion into the HS-AFM fluid chamber (volume: ~120 \u00b5L). After SLB assessment and image acquisition area positioning, Snf7 was added to the fluid chamber to a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M. After ~20 min, Snf7 filaments started to form on the SLB and assembled into spiral structures in the following minutes. Vps2 and Vps24 were then added to the AFM fluid chamber to a final concentration of 100 nM. Next, Vps4 was injected to a final concentration of 1-2 \u00b5M. Finally, ATP and MgCl2 were added to the fluid chamber to a final concentration of 200 \u00b5M and 1 mM, respectively. Imaging was performed at room temperature on an HS-AFM 1.0 (RIBM) using ~8 \u00b5m long cantilevers (NanoWorld) with resonance frequency of ~0.7 MHz in liquid and a spring constant of ~0.15 Nm-1. Typically, pixel samplings ranged between 300 x 300 pixels and 200 x 200 pixels and frame acquisition rates ranged between 1 s-1 and 2 s-1. For HS-AFM movie analysis, we corrected stage drift using the StackReg plugin in Fiji, and performed a moving average of 2 to 4 consecutive time frames. ESCRT-III spiral diameters and line profiles were manually measured using Fiji. Coefficients of variation were determined for 45 nm-long sections of the line profiles from the ratio of SD to mean. TrackMate was used for manual and semi-automated tracking of spiral centers with a ~5 s interval. Tracks shorter than 55 s were omitted from the analysis. To account for non-normal distributions and unequal variances, statistical analysis was performed using the two-sided Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test using R (version 3.0.2) or GraphPad Prism 7. Numbers of repeated and experiments are indicated in the respective figure legends, and always refer to independent biological experiments, with all samples showing the same behavior. All experiments were performed 3 or more times independently under identical or similar conditions, except experiments shown in panels Fig. 3a, b, Fig. 4e, Fig. 5d, g-i, Fig. 6a-d, Fig. 7d, e, Supplementary Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 3a, b, d, and Supplementary Fig. 6d, e, that were performed twice, and experiments in panels Fig. 3c, d, and Supplementary Fig. 7a, b, that were performed once."}, "26615423": {"pmid": "26615423", "pmcid": "PMC4875171", "title": "Upregulation of centrosomal protein 55 is associated with unfavorable prognosis and tumor invasion in epithelial ovarian carcinoma", "abstract": "\nCentrosomal protein 55 (CEP55) is a cell cycle regulator implicated in development of certain cancers. However, characteristics of CEP55 expression and its clinical/prognostic significance are unclear in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Therefore, we investigated the expression and clinicopathological significance of CEP55 in patients with EOC and its role in regulating invasion and metastasis of ovarian cell lines. CEP55 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Potential associations of CEP55 expression scores with clinical parameters and patient survival were evaluated. CEP55 function was investigated further using RNA interference, wound healing assay, transwell assay, immunofluorescence analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. CEP55 was significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines and lesions compared with normal cells and adjacent noncancerous ovarian tissues. In the 213 EOC samples, CEP55 protein levels were positively correlated with clinical stage (P\u2009<\u20090.001), lymph node metastasis (P\u2009<\u20090.001), intraperitoneal metastasis (P\u2009<\u20090.001), tumor recurrence (P\u2009<\u20090.001), differentiation grade (P\u2009<\u20090.001), residual tumor size (P\u2009<\u20090.001), ascites see tumor cells (P\u2009=\u20090.020), and serum CA153 level (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Moreover, patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed tendencies to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and cytoreductive surgery (P\u2009=\u20090.020). By contrast, no significant correlation was detected between the protein levels and patient age, histological type, or serum CA125, CA199, CA724, NSE, CEA, and \u03b2-HCG levels. Patients with high CEP55 protein expression had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival compared with those with low CEP55 expression. Multivariate analysis implicated CEP55 as an independent prognostic indicator for EOC patients. Additionally, downregulation of CEP55 in ovarian cancer cells remarkably inhibited cellular motility and invasion. Aberrant CEP55 expression may predict unfavorable clinical outcomes in EOC patients and play an important role in regulating invasion in ovarian cancer cells. Thus, CEP55 may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for EOC.\n", "fulltext": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies and is the leading cause of gynecological cancer death. There were 204,000 new cases and 125,000 deaths estimated worldwide in 2011. Although advances in surgery and new chemotherapy regimens have resulted in downward trends of the incidence and mortality of ovarian cancer over the last few decades, it is still associated with the highest mortality rate among all gynecological malignancies worldwide. One reason for the lethality of ovarian cancer is that the majority of women are undiagnosed until advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages (III or IV) where the cancer has spread beyond the pelvis, which leads to an unfavorable prognosis. Several traditional clinical variables, including surgical stage, volume of residual tumor after primary surgery, and histologic grade play important roles in the FIGO staging system and patient prognosis. Moreover, biomarkers such as CA125, CA199, and CA153 have been used for predicting metastasis and prognosis in the clinic. Many novel genes, such as AGR2, Netrin-1 and STIP1, have been reported to be potentially useful metastatic and prognostic markers in ovarian cancer [6\u20138]. However, they are not sufficiently reliable for predicting tumor metastasis, clinical outcomes or for optimizing and individualizing the treatment. Thus, an urgent need remains for additional research to identify novel biomarkers for developing targeted therapy, detection of metastasis, and predicting the survival and relapse rates for ovarian cancer patients. Centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55), also designated as C10orf3, FLJ10540, or URCC6, is a centrosome- and midbody-associated protein of ~55\u00a0kDa in size and has been mapped to the 10q23 chromosomal region. The CEP55 gene encodes the 464 amino acid protein containing a domain known as AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities). CEP55 was found to play a role in centrosome-dependent cellular functions, such as centrosome duplication and/or cell cycle progression, or in the regulation of cytokinesis [10\u201313]. Recently, increased expression of CEP55 was reported in several human tumors, and it may be associated with the onset of oncogenesis, invasion, and mitosis. A study indicated that CEP55 forms a complex with PI3K, enhancing PI3K activity, and consequently, the AKT survival pathway, suggesting that CEP55 is a novel oncogene that may play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. A higher level of CEP55 has been associated with poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancer patients. It is reported that the early upregulation of FOXM1 during head and neck cancer progression, rendering it as an attractive diagnostic biomarker for early cancer detection and its candidate mechanistic targets, CEP55 and HELLS, as indicators of malignant conversion and progression. In addition, expression of CEP55 was correlated with aggressiveness of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma by stimulating cell migration and invasion through increased FOXM1 and MMP-2 activity. CEP55 was reported to be overexpressed in lung cancer tissues and associated with cell migration and invasion, as well as participate in the VEGF-A/PI3K/AKT pathway [18, 19]. Furthermore, some studies have identified the overexpression of CEP55 in colorectal carcinoma, prostate cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric cancer [20\u201326]. However, characteristics of CEP55 expression and its clinical/prognostic significance in human ovarian cancer remain unknown. In the current study, we aimed to explore the expression of CEP55 in ovarian cell lines and human ovarian tissues. Moreover, we investigated the association between the expression of CEP55 protein and clinical manifestations and survival outcomes of a cohort of 213 patients with ovarian cancer. We further investigated the function of CEP55 by using RNA interference (RNAi), wound healing assay, Transwell assay, immunofluorescence analysis, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and Western blot analysis, . This study was approved by the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center Ethic Review Committee, and each patient signed an informed consent prior to the use of the clinical materials for research purposes. All specimens were handled according to the ethical and legal standards. For qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, fresh ovarian cancer and matched distant noncancerous ovarian tissues were derived from 12 patients who had undergone surgery at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between March 2015 and May 2015. For Western blot analysis of different stages of ovarian cancer, we collected normal ovarian tissue, benign ovarian cancer tissue, and borderline ovarian cancer and ovarian cancer tissues from patients at different clinical stages from seven patients who had undergone surgery at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between January 2015 and June 2015. In addition, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was conducted on a total of 213 paraffin-embedded ovarian cancer samples, which were histopathologically and clinically diagnosed at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between 2002 and 2010. Clinical and clinicopathological classification and staging were determined by two experienced gynecological oncologists according to FIGO (2009). The follow-up time for the primary ovarian cancer cohort ranged from 5.1 to 176.1\u00a0months with a median of 73.82\u00a0months. The clinicopathological data of all the patients were summarized in Table 1. The ovarian cancer cell lines used in the current study were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). TOV-112D, COV434, OV-90, COV644, COV504, COV362, A2780, TOV-21G, SKOV3, OVCAR4, and EFO-27 were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10\u00a0% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and 1\u00a0% antibiotics (100\u00a0U/ml penicillin and 100\u00a0ug/ml streptomycin). The normal ovarian cell line HOSEpiC was maintained in DMEM. qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of CEP55 in ovarian cell lines, human epithelial ovarian cancer, and matched adjacent normal tissues. Total RNA samples from cultured cells and fresh tissues were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. These RNA samples were then pretreated with RNase-free DNase, and 2\u00a0\u03bcg of RNA sample was used for cDNA synthesis using random hexamers. The primers were designed using Primer Express v2.0 (Applied Biosystems, USA). CEP55 primers used were 5\u2032-GCCACTGCTGATTTTTCTCC-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-ACTGTGGCTCCAAACTGCTT-3\u2032. For the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, which was used as an internal control, the sense primer 5\u2032-AATGAAGGGGTCATTGATGG-3\u2032 and the antisense primer 5\u2032-AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAA-3\u2032 were used. For PCR-mediated amplification of CEP55 cDNA, an initial amplification step using CEP55-specific primers was conducted with a denaturation step at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, followed by 30 denaturation cycles at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0s, primer annealing at 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, and a primer extension phase at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s. Upon the completion of the cycling steps, a final extension at 95\u00a0\u00b0C was carried out before the reaction mixture was held at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. qRT-PCR was then performed to evaluate the fold increase of CEP55 mRNA in each of the primary ovarian cancer tissues relative to the matched adjacent normal tissues (ANT) and ovarian cancer cell lines relative to that in the normal ovarian cell line. We used a double-stranded DNA-specific SYBR Premix Ex Taq II kit (Takara Biotechnology, USA) on a Bio-Rad sequence evaluation system according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The expression data were normalized to the geometric mean of the level for GAPDH to control for variability in expression levels in all experiments. All assays were examined in triplicate. Total protein was prepared using the cell total protein extraction kits according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Equal concentrations of each protein sample (20\u00a0\u03bcg) were separated on 6\u00a0% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5\u00a0% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1\u00a0% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature, and incubated a primary monoclonal antibody to CEP55 (1:1000, Abcam, USA, ab170414) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA, SC-2004). The ECL prime Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) was used to detect CEP55 expression according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. GADPH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to confirm equal loading of the samples. IHC analysis was carried out to investigate alterations in protein expression in the 213 human ovarian cancer tissues. The procedures were performed with classical protocols. In brief, paraffin-embedded specimens were cut into 4-\u03bcm sections and baked at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated. Sections were submerged into EDTA antigenic retrieval buffer, microwaved for antigenic retrieval, and then treated with 3\u00a0% hydrogen peroxide in methanol to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, followed by incubation with 1\u00a0% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block any nonspecific binding. Sections were then incubated with a rabbit monoclonal antibody against CEP55 (Abcam, ab170414, 1:250) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing, the tissue sections were then incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Abcam), followed by further incubation with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex (Abcam). The tissue sections were immersed in 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole and counterstained with 10\u00a0% Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted in Crystal Mount. The degree of immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections was blind reviewed and evaluated by two independent pathologists. Scores given by the two independent observers were averaged, which were based on both the proportion of positively stained tumor cells and the intensity of staining. The proportion of tumor cells was scored as follows: 1 (<10\u00a0% positive tumor cells), 2 (10\u201350\u00a0% positive tumor cells), 3 (50\u201375\u00a0% positive tumor cells), and 4 (>75\u00a0% positive tumor cells). Cells were scored for intensity of staining on a scale of 0 (no staining), 1 (weak staining\u2009=\u2009light yellow), 2 (moderate staining\u2009=\u2009yellow brown), and 3 (strong staining\u2009=\u2009brown). The staining index was calculated as the product of the proportion of positive cells\u2009\u00d7\u2009staining intensity score (range from 0 to 12). Cutoff values for CEP55 were chosen on the basis of a measure of heterogeneity using the log-rank test with respect to overall survival (OS). An optimal cutoff value was identified as follows: staining index score of \u22656 was used to define tumors with high CEP55 expression, and a score of \u22644 indicated low CEP55 expression. To further identify the role of CEP55 in tumor invasion, two human small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized and purified by Ribobio Inc (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) for depletion of CEP55. The siRNA sequences used were as follows: siRNA#1: 5\u2032-GAAGCCUAGUAACUCCAAAdTdT-3\u2032, siRNA#2: 5\u2032-GGAAGAUGAUAGGCAUAAAdTdT-3\u2032, and siRNA#3: 5\u2032-GGAAACAGCUGCUCAUUCAdTdT-3\u2032. Transfection of siRNAs was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In the cell invasion assay, we used Transwell chambers (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with 8-\u03bcm pore polycarbonate filters that were coated with Matrigel\u2122 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Cells cultured in the absence or presence of siRNA for 24\u00a0h were seeded into the upper chambers in serum-free medium at a density of 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 per well, and 500\u00a0\u03bcl of NIH3T3-conditioned medium was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After 48\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in 5\u00a0% CO2, the cells that passed through the filter into the lower chamber were fixed with 3.7\u00a0% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1\u00a0% crystal violet solution. Cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed with cotton buds. Invaded cells on the underside of the filter were photographed and counted by phase contrast microscopy (\u00d7200 magnification). The experiments were performed in triplicate. For wound-healing assay, cells were seeded in individual wells of a six-well culture plate. Untransfected cells and cells exposed to CEP55 siRNA or negative control siRNA for 5\u00a0h were cultured in a quiescent medium for 24\u00a0h. Thereafter, a sterile 10-\u03bcl pipette tip was used to longitudinally scratch a constant-diameter stripe in the confluent monolayer. The medium and cell debris were removed by aspiration and replaced with 2\u00a0ml of fresh serum-free medium. Microscopic images were taken at 0, 24, and 48\u00a0h immediately after wounding (corresponding to 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h posttransfection) by phase contrast microscopy. For statistical analysis, three randomly selected points along each wound were marked, and the horizontal distance between the migrating cells and the initial wound was measured at 24 and 48\u00a0h. Values were means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. Differences between siRNA-treated and blank control data were determined by a Student\u2019s t test, where P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant. After a 5-h exposure to CEP55 siRNA, negative control siRNA, or no treatment, SKOV3 and TOV-21G cells were cultured overnight on sterile glass coverslips in a six-well plate for 24\u00a0h. The cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 3.7\u00a0% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1\u00a0% Triton-X100, and incubated in blocking solution (1\u00a0% BSA). The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies against E-cadherin, N-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, or fibronectin (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, UK) and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, USA). The coverslips were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and imaged with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus FV1000, Japan). Data were processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0. All statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS 16.0 statistical software packages. The associations of clinicopathological characteristics with the expression status of CEP55 were assessed using the chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test. Bivariate correlations between studied variables were calculated by Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients. Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and differences were analyzed using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model on all significant characteristics determined using univariate analysis. All P values were two-sided. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant in all cases. Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses revealed high levels of CEP55 expression in all 11 ovarian cell lines tested compared with the immortalized normal ovarian epithelial cell line HOSEpiC (Fig.\u00a01a, b). In order to determine whether the CEP55 upregulation found in ovarian cancer cell lines was related to clinical biochemical indicators, we did Western blotting analysis on 12 paired epithelial ovarian carcinoma tissues and noncancerous tissues adjacent to ovarian tumors. As shown in Fig.\u00a02a, b, CEP55 protein expression was higher in all 12 epithelial ovarian carcinoma samples, displaying more than a threefold increase compared with that in the adjacent noncancer tissue samples. These findings above are consistent with the results obtained in our immunohistochemical analysis (Fig.\u00a02c). Moreover, CEP55 was shown to be predominantly located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells (Figs.\u00a02c and 3c). As shown in Fig.\u00a03a, Western blotting results indicated that CEP55 protein expression was low in normal ovarian tissue, benign ovarian cancer tissue, and borderline ovarian cancer tissue, while it was high in ovarian carcinoma tissues from patients at different clinical stages. Interestingly, Western blot analysis showed that CEP55 protein expression levels were positively correlated with clinical stages of ovarian carcinoma patients. To further determine whether CEP55 protein overexpression is associated with clinicopathological characteristics of epithelial ovarian cancer, 213 paraffin-embedded, archived ovarian cancer tissue samples were examined by immunohistochemical analysis. The samples included 59 cases at stage I, 36 cases at stage II, 100 cases at stage III, and 18 cases at stage IV. In the cohort, CEP55 expression in 213 enrolled patient samples was determined as strong in 99 cases (46.5\u00a0%) and weakly positive or negative in 114 cases (53.5\u00a0%) (Table 1). As shown in Fig.\u00a04, the immunoreactivity of CEP55 was detected at variable levels, and specific CEP55 staining was mostly found in the cytoplasm of carcinoma cells. Additionally, the CEP55 protein expression was generally weak in early stage ovarian cancer (FIGO stages I and II), while it was strong in later stage ovarian cancer (FIGO stages III and IV) tissues (Fig.\u00a03c). Quantitative analysis indicated that the mean optical density (MOD) values of CEP55 staining in clinical stage I\u2013IV primary tumors were statistically significantly higher than those in the normal control ovarian tissues. In addition, the MOD values of CEP55 staining significantly increased with progression from stage I to IV (P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a03b). Taken together, these observations suggested that aberrant CEP55 expression was associated with the clinical development of primary ovarian tumors. Statistical analyses were employed to detect the correlation between CEP55 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of ovarian cancer patients (Table 1). As summarized in Table 2, no significant correlations were detected between the expression level of CEP55 protein and patient age, histological type, and serum CA125, CA199, NSE, CEA, \u03b2-HCG, or CA724 expression levels in patients with ovarian cancer. However, CEP55 expression was markedly associated with clinical stage (P\u2009<\u20090.001), lymph node metastasis (P\u2009<\u20090.001), intraperitoneal metastasis (P\u2009<\u20090.001), tumor recurrence (P\u2009<\u20090.001), differentiation grade (P\u2009<\u20090.001), residual tumor size (P\u2009<\u20090.001), ascites see tumor cells (P\u2009=\u20090.020), and serum CA153 level (P\u2009<\u20090.001) in patients with ovarian cancer. Moreover, patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed tendencies to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and cytoreductive surgery (P\u2009=\u20090.020). These data were further confirmed by association coefficient analyses assessing the correlation between CEP55 expression and clinicopathological features. As shown in Table 3, correlations between CEP55 expression and clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, tumor recurrence, differentiation grade, residual tumor size, serum CA153 level, and ascites see tumor cells were 0.550 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.328 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.414 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.607 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.251 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.235 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.289 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and 0.157 (P\u2009=\u20090.020), respectively. To identify factors with potential prognostic significance in ovarian patients, univariate analysis for each variable was performed in relation to the survival time. In our univariate analysis, stepwise inclusion of variables in the model indicated that significant prognostic factors included CEP55 protein level, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, FIGO stage, differentiation grade, recurrence, age, CA153 serum level, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that CEP55 protein level, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, FIGO stage, recurrence, age, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were indeed independent prognostic markers for ovarian cancer (Table 4). To further determine the value of CEP55 expression in predicting survival of ovarian cancer patients, Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used in this study. The log-rank test showed that the survival time was significantly different between these two groups. As shown in Fig.\u00a05, CEP55 expression in ovarian cancer patients was associated with survival time, with the patients expressing low CEP55 in their ovarian cancer lesions surviving much longer than those with high CEP55 expression (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The cumulative OS and disease-free survival (DFS) rates for the patients with high levels of CEP55 expression were 38.9 and 43.6\u00a0%, respectively, whereas these rates were 84.5 and 91.6\u00a0%, respectively, for patients with low or no CEP55 expression. Moreover, we analyzed the prognostic value of CEP55 expression in selected patient subgroups stratified according to characteristics of residual tumor size, serum CA125 level, serum CA153 level, serum CA199 level, differentiation, FIGO stage, intraperitoneal metastasis, and ascites see tumor size, as well as treatments of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), neoadjuvant chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and postoperative chemotherapy. Patients with tumors exhibiting high CEP55 expression had a significantly shorter OS compared to those with low CEP55-expressing tumors in the residual tumor size \u22641\u00a0cm subgroup (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06a), residual tumor size >1\u00a0cm subgroup (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06b), CA125 >35\u00a0U/ml subgroup (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06c), CA153 >25\u00a0U/ml subgroup (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06d), CA199 >35\u00a0U/ml subgroup (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06e), in those receiving HIPEC (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06f), in the differentiation grade 1 and 2 subgroup (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06g), in the differentiation grade 3 subgroup (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06h), in those with ascites see tumor cells (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06i), in the stage 1 and 2 subgroups (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06j), in the stage 3 and 4 subgroups (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06k), in those with intraperitoneal metastasis (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06l), in those receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06m), in those receiving cytoreductive surgery (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06n), and in those receiving postoperative chemotherapy (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.001, Fig.\u00a06o). To further investigate the role of CEP55 in the invasion of ovarian cancer, we transfected SKOV3 and TOV-21G cells with 200\u00a0pmol siRNA for 24\u00a0h, which offered the best silencing efficiency in our preliminary experiments. Three different siRNA duplexes targeting CEP55 and a negative control siRNA were separately transferred into SKOV3 and TOV-21G cells. At 24\u00a0h after transfection, we examined the resulting phenotype using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.\u00a07, CEP55 siRNA1 and CEP55 siRNA3 duplexes obviously reduced CEP55 protein in both ovarian cancer cell lines, and these more efficient siRNAs were therefore chosen for subsequent studies. The data were obtained from densitometric analyses of the ratio of CEP55 to \u03b2-actin protein levels (n\u2009=\u20095 independent experiments). Cancer cell migration and invasion are directly related to metastasis, and CEP55 has been reported to be related to the processes of cell mobility and cancer metastasis. In order to determine whether CEP55 induces epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), we probed the cancer cell lines with epithelial and mesenchymal markers. As shown in Fig.\u00a07, SKOV3 and TOV21G cells showed high CEP55 levels and the typical EMT phenotype, including downregulation of epithelial markers E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin and upregulation of mesenchymal markers fibronectin and N-cadherin. As shown in Fig.\u00a07a, c, silencing endogenous CEP55 in SKOV3 and TOV21G cells led to enhanced expression of epithelial markers and concomitant decreased expression of mesenchymal markers. The EMT phenotype was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining in SKOV3 and TOV-21G cells (Fig.\u00a07b, d). To further determine whether repression of CEP55 expression would inhibit SKOV3 and TOV-21G cell migration and invasion, a wound-healing assay and a cell invasion assay were performed on these two cell lines either untransfected or transfected with CEP55 siRNA1, CEP55 siRNA3, or negative control siRNA for 24\u00a0h. Results of the wound-healing assay revealed that the invasiveness of SKOV3 and TOV21G cells was dramatically hampered by the ablation of CEP55 (Fig.\u00a08b). As shown in Fig.\u00a08a, the number of SKOV3 cells that passed through the filter in the CEP55 siRNA1- and siRNA3-treated groups was remarkably lower than that in the untreated or negative control treated siRNA groups, indicating that inhibition of CEP55 expression suppressed SKOV3 and TOV-21G cell invasion in vitro. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that highly expressed CEP55 in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma was significantly correlated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, tumor recurrence, differentiation grade, residual tumor size, ascites see tumor cells, and serum CA153 level. Moreover, patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed a tendency to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery. The loss of CEP55 function mediated by RNAi in ovarian cancer cell models indicated that suppression of CEP55 repressed cellular invasion, demonstrating the involvement of CEP55 in enhancing the migratory and invasive activity in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, elevated expression levels of CEP55 protein served as independent prognostic factors for short OS and DFS rate in patients with EOC. In light of these findings, our results suggest that overexpression of CEP55 protein is associated with tumor aggressiveness and may represent an independent prognostic factor for clinical outcomes in EOC patients. Recent studies have indicated overexpression of CEP55 as an important event in patients with certain types of cancer. Its elevated expression has been shown to be associated with carcinogenesis in bladder cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, and colon cancer [21\u201326]. Moreover, high CEP55 expression was found to promote progrowth signaling pathways resulting in cancer cell metastasis and poor patient prognosis [14, 23]. Altogether, these findings suggest that CEP55 may play an oncogenic role in cancer development and progression. In our cohort, we examined the expression of CEP55 mRNA and protein in ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer samples. We found that both CEP55 mRNA and protein showed aberrant expression levels in ovarian cancer tissues compared with noncancerous tissues, indicating that the overexpression of CEP55 occurred not only at the posttranscriptional level but also at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between CEP55 expression and the clinicopathological features of ovarian cancer patients. We found that CEP55 protein expression was significantly correlated with FIGO stage, tumor recurrence, differentiation grade, residual tumor size, ascites see tumor cells, serum CA153 level, lymph node metastasis, and intraperitoneal metastasis strongly supporting the hypothesis that this protein plays a role in the progression of ovarian cancer. Patients with CEP55 protein overexpression showed a tendency to accept neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery. In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses showed high CEP55 protein expression as a predictor of poor prognosis in these patients. Patients with elevated CEP55 expression showed a 38.9\u00a0% cumulative OS rate, which was significantly lower than that in patients with low expression levels of this protein (91.6\u00a0%). Taken together, these findings provide with essential, reliable evidence for the clinical significance of CEP55 as an independent prognostic marker to identify ovarian cancer patients with poor prognosis. Using CEP55 biomarker to identify patients with a higher risk of developing worse clinical outcome may thus help patients choose better treatment and reduce mortality. To date, lymph node metastasis and intraperitoneal metastasis play important roles in determining the ovarian carcinoma staging. According to FIGO (2013), stage III is divided into three substages: stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC. Moreover, stage IIIA is divided further into substages IIIA1 and IIIA2. Ovarian cancer patients only with a positive retroperitoneal lymph node are classified as stage IIIA1, while patients with microscopic intraperitoneal metastasis are defined as stage IIIA2. Furthermore, patients who have macroscopic intraperitoneal metastasis are determined as stage IIIB and IIIC. In addition, recent studies reported that lymph node metastasis represents poor clinical prognosis for ovarian cancer patients. Early diagnosis of intraperitoneal metastasis is pivotal for the survival of patients with EOC. Therefore, having the ability to predict lymph node metastasis and intraperitoneal metastasis is critically important, but no ideal, preoperative marker has been established. In our study, we found that aberrant CEP55 protein expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and intraperitoneal metastasis. Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between shorter OS and high CEP55 protein expression in the subgroup with intraperitoneal metastasis, which indicates that CEP55 may be a useful prognostic marker for such ovarian cancer patients. EMT has been found to contribute to invasion, metastatic dissemination, and acquisition of therapeutic resistance of cancer cells. Several reports have shown that CEP55 plays an important role in regulating EMT. For example, increased CEP55 expression was reported to promote EMT in nasopharyngeal carcinoma via the osteopontin/CD44 pathway [23, 24]. Chen et al. showed that CEP55 could regulate EMT through the CEP55/FOXM1/MMP-2 pathway in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, overexpression of CEP55 was shown to regulate EMT through the VEGF-A/PI3K/AKT pathway in lung cancer. Here, we suppressed CEP55 expression by siRNA and demonstrated, for the first time, that downregulation of CEP55 remarkably repressed ovarian cancer cellular invasion and reversed EMT. However, further studies are required to obtain a detailed picture of CEP55-related signaling pathways in regulating ovarian cancer EMT. Although primary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer for many years, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery has emerged as a new alternative treatment. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines indicate that patients with a clear diagnosis of histopathology, patients with ascites cytology showing malignant tumor cells, as well as those with a physical examination and imaging examination or exploratory laparotomy determining that the tumor would be difficult to remove should accept neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Recent studies have shown the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer patients. Kang et al. found that neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not only equally effective but also a substantially safer strategy compared with standard treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgical cytoreduction, is reportedly a promising treatment strategy for the management of advanced EOC. Interestingly, ovarian cancer patients in our study with aberrant CEP55 protein expression had a tendency to accept neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, upregulation of CEP55 protein expression was significantly associated with ascites see tumor cells, which is one of the indications for accepting neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In a more detailed analysis of survival, we observed a significant correlation between shorter OS and high CEP55 expression in the subgroup with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This finding suggests that CEP55 may be a useful prognostic marker for ovarian cancer patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Primary cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy are standard treatments for advanced ovarian cancer. In our cohort, patients with high expression of CEP55 protein showed a significant tendency to obtain cytoreductive surgery. Furthermore, we found that higher CEP55 protein expression was correlated with a significantly shorter OS in the cytoreductive surgery subgroup. However, no correlation was observed in the subgroup without cytoreductive surgery. This result indicates that CEP55 protein expression is a more significant predictor of prognosis for ovarian cancer patients who require cytoreductive surgery. Currently, postoperative chemotherapy is the main treatment for ovarian cancer patients who have been treated with cytoreductive surgery. Our study identified a significant correlation between shorter OS and high CEP55 expression in the postoperative chemotherapy subgroup. This finding suggests that CEP55 may be a useful prognostic marker for ovarian cancer patients with postoperative chemotherapy. One of the most distinct features of EOC is the tendency to disseminate into the peritoneal cavity and remain confined to the peritoneum and intra-abdominal viscera. The peritoneal barrier enables the targeted delivery of chemotherapy directly to the peritoneal tumors, which makes it an ideal target for locoregional therapy. In randomized trials, intraperitoneal therapy following frontline surgery has shown a significant impact on survival. Improved long-term results can be achieved in highly selected patients using cytoreductive surgery in combination with HIPEC. For advanced ovarian cancer, a curative therapeutic approach combining optimal cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC should be considered as it may achieve long-term survival in patients with a poor prognosis, even in those with chemoresistant disease. Here, our data showed that patients with high CEP55 protein expression did not have a significant tendency to receive HIPEC. However, a significant correlation was found between higher CEP55 expression and shorter OS in the HIPEC subgroup, which indicates that CEP55 expression is an important prognostic factor of ovarian cancer patients who accept HIPEC. In this cohort, we demonstrated the upregulated expression of CEP55 in EOC cells and surgical specimens and reported, for the first time, the correlation of CEP55 protein expression with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, intraperitoneal metastasis, tumor recurrence, differentiation grade, residual tumor size, ascites see tumor cells, serum CA153 level, as well as prognosis in patients with EOC. Patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed tendencies to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery. Moreover, CEP55 may induce ovarian cancer lymph node metastasis through regulating EMT. Taken together, our results suggest that CEP55 may be a marker predicting unfavorable outcomes in ovarian carcinoma and plays a significant role in the migration and invasion of human EOC."}, "25622904": {"pmid": "25622904", "pmcid": "PMC4309684", "title": "Inactivation of Sag/Rbx2/Roc2 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Triggers Senescence and Inhibits Kras-Induced Immortalization", "abstract": "\nOur recent study showed that SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates apoptosis and vasculogenesis by promoting degradation of NOXA and NF1, and co-operates with Kras to promote lung tumorigenesis by activating NF\u03baB and mTOR pathways via targeted degradation of tumor suppressive substrates including I\u03baB, DEPTOR, p21 and p27. Here we investigated the role of Sag/Rbx2 E3 ligase in cellular senescence and immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and report that Sag is required for proper cell proliferation and KrasG12D-induced immortalization. Sag inactivation by genetic deletion remarkably suppresses cell proliferation by inducing senescence, which is associated with accumulation of p16, but not p53. Mechanistically, Sag deletion caused accumulation of Jun-B, a substrate of Sag-Fbxw7 E3 ligase and a transcription factor that drives p16 transcription. Importantly, senescence triggered by Sag deletion can be largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, the p16 encoding gene, indicating its causal role. Furthermore, KrasG12D-induced immortalization can also be abrogated by Sag deletion via senescence induction, which is again rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a. Finally, we found that Sag deletion inactivates KrasG12D activity and block the MAPK signaling pathway, together with accumulated p16, to induce senescence. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a KrasG12D-cooperating oncogene required for KrasG12D-induced immortalization and transformation, and targeting SAG-SCF E3 ligase may, therefore, have therapeutic value for senescence-based cancer treatment.\n", "fulltext": "CRL (Cullin-RING ligase) is the multi-complex E3 ubiquitin ligase with SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F box protein), also known as CRL1, as its founding member. CRL consists of four components: an adaptor protein (e.g. SKP1), one of seven cullin family members (e.g., Cul-1), a substrate recognizing receptor (e.g., F-box protein Skp2), and one of two small RING family proteins: RBX1/ROC1 and SAG/RBX2/ROC2. While the receptor protein determines the substrate specificity, the cullin-RING components constitute the core ubiquitin ligase activity. Activity of CRL also requires cullin neddylation. By promoting the ubiquitylation of various regulatory proteins for targeted degradation by 26S proteasome, CRL regulates many biological processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle progression, signal transduction, DNA replication, embryogenesis, and tumorigenesis,. SAG (Sensitive to Apoptosis Gene), also known as RBX2 (RING box protein-2), ROC2 (regulator of cullins-2), or RNF7 (RING finger protein 7), an evolutionarily conserved small RING-containing protein with 113 amino acids, is the second member of the ROC/RBX/RING component of the CRL E3 ubiquitin ligases. In response to various stimuli (e.g., ROS, mitogen and hypoxia), SAG is induced at the transcriptional level by transcription factors AP-1 and HIF1\u03b1, respectively. Induced SAG then recruits other components of CRL E3s to promote the ubiquitylation and degradation of various substrates, including c-Jun, HIF-1\u03b1, I\u03baB\u03b1,, Nf-1, NOXA, p27, and pro-caspase-3 in a cell context, temporal, and spatial dependent manner. In human tissues, SAG overexpression was detected in carcinomas of lung, colon, stomach and liver, which is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients,,. In whole animals, SAG over-expression via injection of SAG expressing recombinant adenovirus or transduction of a Tat-SAG fusion protein protected mouse brain tissues from ischemia/hypoxia-induced damage,. SAG transgenic expression in mouse skin inhibited tumor formation at the early stage by targeting c-Jun/AP1, but enhanced tumor growth at the later stage by targeting I\u03baB\u03b1 to activate NF\u03baB in a DMBA-TPA carcinogenesis model, and promoted UVB-induced skin hyperplasia by targeting p27. Targeted Sag deletion in mouse caused embryonic lethality at E11.5-12.5, which is associated with overall growth retardation, induction of apoptosis, and poor vasculogenesis. Conditional Sag deletion in endothelial cells also caused embryonic lethality around E15.5. Finally, we recently showed that Sag is required for lung tumorigenesis triggered by KrasG12D. However, it is unknown whether Sag is required for proper cell proliferation, or for immortalization, induced by a mutant Kras. In this study, we investigated these roles of Sag E3 ligase and report here that Sag is required for proliferation and Kras-induced immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We showed that genetic deletion of Sag remarkably suppresses proliferation and abrogates immortalization by inducing senescence. Mechanistically, we found that Jun-B, a transcription factor, that drives p16 expression, is a novel substrate of Sag E3. Targeted Sag deletion causes accumulation of Jun-B to transactivate p16, which in turn induces senescence. Significantly, simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, a gene encoding p16, completely rescued senescence phenotype, regardless of KrasG12D status. We further found that Sag deletion significantly inactivates Mapk signaling pathway by directly inhibiting constitutively active KrasG12D activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a growth essential gene required for cell proliferation as well as for Kras-induced immortalization, indicating that Sag plays a role at very early stage of neoplastic transformation. Thus, Sag targeting may have a value for chemoprevention, as well as for senescence-based cancer therapy, particularly in human cancers harboring a mutant Kras. We recently found that Sag inactivation via the gene trap (gt) approach induced embryonic lethality at E11.5-12.5 stage, which is associated with growth retardation, induction of apoptosis, and poor vasculogenesis, and attributable at least in part to inactivation of Ras-MAPK signals via Nf1 accumulation. To further define the role of Sag in cell proliferation, we generated primary MEFs and found that while early passage MEF cells from Sag+/+ or Saggt/+ (not shown) mice proliferated well with a doubling time of ~\u00a048 hours, Saggt/gt MEF cells underwent a complete growth arrest (Figure\u00a01, A and B). To further confirm this finding, we generated MEFs from conditional Sagfl/fl mice., Sagfl/fl MEFs upon infection with Ad-Cre, but not Ad-GFP control, showed a complete elimination of Sag protein (Figure\u00a01C) and complete growth arrest, as measured by ATP-lite proliferation assay (Figure\u00a01D) and BrdU incorporation assay (Figure\u00a01E). Thus, Sag is required for proper growth of MEFs. Significantly, both Saggt/gt MEFs and Sagfl/fl MEFs after Ad-Cre infection to eliminate Sag demonstrated a flattened and enlarged morphology with a positive p16 staining (Figure\u00a02, A and B), reminiscent of premature senescence,. Furthermore, at passage 6, about 55% of Sag-null MEFs was stained positively for senescence-associated \u03b2-Gal (SA-\u03b2-Gal), as compared to only 2.4% of wild-type MEFs (Figure\u00a02C). Finally, we found that Sag deletion caused accumulation of p16, but not of p15, nor p53/p21 (Figure\u00a02D). Thus, Sag inactivation induces a premature senescence phenotype via the p16 pathway, rather than the p15 pathway, nor the p53/p21 axis. Given the fact that p16 contains no lysine residue, it is unlikely that p16 is a direct ubiquitylation substrate of Sag E3 ligase. We then determined if accumulation of p16 protein upon Sag deletion is due to enhanced transcription of p16 mRNA. Indeed, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis in two lines of primary MEFs isolated from two independent Sagfl/fl embryos showed that p16 mRNA levels were much higher in Ad-Cre infected MEFs, as compared to MEFs infected with Ad-GFP control (Figure\u00a03A). Thus, regulation of p16 occurred at the transcriptional level. Given that Sag is the RING component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase required for its ligase activity, Sag disruption would be expected to cause the accumulation of its substrates. We next focused on a known substrate of SCFFbxw7 E3 ligase, Jun-B, which is also a transcription factor known to positively regulate p16. Indeed, we found that Sag deletion in MEFs increased Jun-B protein (Figure\u00a03B), but not Jun-B mRNA (Figure\u00a03A), indicating that Sag-mediated regulation occurred likely at the posttranslational level. It has been previously shown that Fbxw7 is the F-box protein that mediated the ubiquitylation and degradation of Jun-B, and that Fbxw7 is associated with Sag for targeted degradation of NF-1. We, therefore, determined whether Sag-Jun-B could form a complex in vivo and found that indeed, endogenous Sag is associated with endogenous Jun-B (Figure\u00a03C). Furthermore, we found Sag overexpression shortened the protein half-life of endogenous JUN-B (Figure\u00a03D), whereas Sag silencing extended it (Figure\u00a03E). Finally, we found that MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8 activating enzyme, which indirectly inhibits SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase by cullin deneddylation,, effectively extended the protein half-life of JUN-B (Figure\u00a03F). Taken together, our results demonstrated that Jun-B is a novel substrate of Sag E3 ubiquitin ligase and Jun-B accumulation, as a result of Sag deletion, transactivates p16 to induce senescence. We next investigated whether accumulated Jun-B or p16 plays a causal role in senescence induced by Sag deletion. Indeed, we found that lentivirus-based Jun-B silencing rescued the effect of Sag deletion, as evidenced by abrogation of p16 increase and suppression of senescence (Figure\u00a04, A and B). We further crossed Sagfl/fl mice with Cdkn2a-/- mice and generated Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a-/- mice. MEFs were generated from these mice, along with Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a+/+ control mice, and infected with Ad-Cre to delete Sag or Ad-GFP as the control (Figure\u00a04C). Remarkably, simultaneously deletion of Cdkn2a, a gene encoding p16, completed rescued senescence induced by Sag deletion, as measured by SA-\u03b2-Gal staining (Figure\u00a04D), as well as by 3T9 protocol which measures cumulative population doubling time by serial passaging (Figure\u00a04E). To determine the effect of Sag inactivation on immortalization, triggered by mutant KrasG12D, we generated MEFs from compound mice with genotypes of LSL-KrasG12D and Sagfl/+ or Sagfl/fl, respectively. We first confirmed that a) KrasG12D was activated in MEFs after infection of Ad-Cre, but not Ad-GFP control, through the Cre-recombinase mediated removal of Lox-STOP-Lox (LSL) fragment (Figure\u00a05A), and b) Sag was inactivated in MEFs with genotype of Sagfl/fl, but not Sagfl/+ after Ad-Cre infection (Figure\u00a05B). We further observed that upon Ad-Cre infection, MEF cells with KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl genotype showed a reduced growth rate (Figure\u00a05C) with a premature senescence phenotype starting at passage 8, as evidenced by a significant increase of SA-\u03b2-Gal positive population (Figure\u00a05D) and by failure in cumulative population doubling, measured by 3T9 protocol (Figure\u00a05E). In contrast, KrasG12D;Sagfl/+ MEF cells proliferated well and showed no sign of senescence up to passage 18 (Figure\u00a05, C\u2013E), indicating an immortalized phenotype, consistent with what was reported for KrasG12D;Sag+/+ MEFs. More specifically, MEFs at passage 8 with Sag inactivation and even in the presence of KrasG12D activation showed a flattened morphology with positive senescence-associated \u03b2-Gal (SA-\u03b2-Gal) staining (Figure\u00a05D). Thus, Sag is required for KrasG12D-mediated immortalization. Mechanistically, we found that Sag inactivation again fails to cause accumulation of p15 or p53/p21, but does trigger accumulation of p16 (Figure\u00a05F), which is likely contributing to senescence induction. Given that p16 is accumulated in senescent KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl MEFs, we next determined whether p16 again plays a causal role. We generated MEFs with the following 4 genotypes: 1) KrasG12D;Sagfl/+;Cdkn2a+/+, 2) KrasG12D;Sagfl/+;Cdkn2a-/-, 3) KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a+/+, and 4) KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a-/- and found Cdkn2a deletion, which caused completely depletion of p16 protein (Figure\u00a06A), rescued decreased growth rate of KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a+/+ MEFs (Figure\u00a06B). More importantly, Cdkn2a deletion rescued senescence phenotype seen in KrasG12D;Sagfl/fl;Cdkn2a+/+ MEFs, completely, as measured by the SA-\u03b2-Gal staining (Figure\u00a06C), and partially, as measured by the 3T9 protocol (Figure\u00a06D). It is worth noting that the rescue effect appears to be less effective in the presence of KrasG12D, which extended the senescence occurring time from passage 6 to 9 in Sag-null MEFs (compare Figure\u00a04E vs. Figure\u00a06D). Nevertheless, p16 plays a key role in senescence triggered by Sag deletion, largely independent of KrasG12D, although the senescence process is being delayed if KrasG12D is present. Finally, we investigated the potential mechanism by which Sag deletion abrogates the ability of active KrasG12D to immortalize primary MEFs. We focused directly on the Kras activity by a classic RBD (Ras-binding domain of Raf-1) pull-down assay and found that Sag deletion significantly reduced Kras activity with no effect on total Ras levels (Figure\u00a07A). Consistent with inactivation of Kras, Ras-Mapk signaling pathway was also inactivated, as evidenced by markedly reduction of Erk phosphorylation (Figure\u00a07A). Few recent studies have shown that Ras/Erk activation is associated with ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation, which could triggers senescence,,, and we have previously shown that Sag has antioxidant activity,,. We, therefore, used DCFHDA staining to measure ROS levels and found that Sag deletion had no significant effect on ROS generation (Figure\u00a07B), excluding the involvement of ROS in the process. Finally, we measured the levels of several natural occurring inhibitors of Ras signalling pathway, including Erbin, Nf1, Rkip, Spred2, and Spry2, and found that Sag deletion caused a moderate increase of Nf1, Rkip and Spred2, but not Erbin and Spry2 (Figure\u00a07A), suggesting that Nf1, Rkip and Spred2 may contribute to inactivation of KrasG12D pathway. Sag, a stress inducible protein, has been shown to play a significant role in a variety of cellular processes, including embryogenesis, vasculogenesis, and apoptosis (for review see). Our recent study has shown that Sag is involved in tumor angiogenesis and required for KrasG12D-induced lung tumorigenesis. Here we report a novel finding that Sag genetic inactivation in MEFs induces senescence, as evidenced by flattened cell morphology, enhanced staining of SA-\u03b2-Gal and p16. Mechanistically, we found that senescence triggered by Sag deletion is caused by p16, not by the p15 pathway, nor the p53/p21 axis. We further showed that Jun-B is a novel substrate of Sag E3 ubiquitin ligase, as evidenced by a) the binding between Sag and Jun-B under physiological conditions, likely through Fbxw7, since Sag directly binds to Fbxw7, and Fbxw7 binds to Jun-B, b) Sag overexpression shortens protein half-life of Jun-B, whereas Sag silencing extends it; and c) pharmaceutical inactivation of Sag E3 by MLN4924 extends Jun-B half-life. Jun-B, upon accumulated following Sag deletion, transactivates p16 expression to induced senescence. Finally we showed by a genetic rescuing experiment that p16 accumulation is the cause, not the consequence, of premature senescence, triggered by Sag deletion. Thus, we identified that the Sag-JunB-p16 axis regulates proper proliferation of MEFs by preventing senescence. It is well-known that immortalization of primary fibroblasts can be induced by a single oncogene, whereas transformation will require collaboration of two oncogenes or one oncogene in combination with the loss of a tumor suppressor gene,. It is also known that overexpression of an active Ras oncogene (Hras or Kras) in primary MEFs induces premature senescence,, whereas expression of KrasG12D at physiological levels immortalizes MEFs and induces proliferation. In this study, we showed that Sag deletion blocks KrasG12D-induced immortalization again through inducing senescence, although appearance of senescence induced by Sag deletion was delayed. Mechanistically, we showed that Sag is required for the maintenance of KrasG12D activity, since Sag deletion significantly reduces such an activity, leading to inactivation of Ras-Raf-Mapk signaling pathway. Among few naturally occurring inhibitors of Ras, we identified that Sag deletion caused moderate increase of Nf1, Rkip and Spred2. However, accumulated Nf1 is unlikely to inactivate KrasG12D, since Nf1 with GAP activity is a naturally occurring inhibitor of wild-type Ras, but not mutant constitutively active Ras, which has very low intrinsic GTPase activity and insensitive to RasGAPs,. Similarly, other two Ras inhibitors, Rkip and Spred2, are not direct inhibitors of KrasG12D, although they block Ras mediated signaling pathway and contribute to its inactivation. Thus, exactly mechanism by which Sag deletion inactivates KrasG12D activity remains elusive. Finally, we showed that abrogation of Kras-induced immortalization by inducing senescence as a result of Sag deletion is causally related to p16, but not to ROS generation, and it can be largely rescued by simultaneous depletion of p16 encoding gene Cdkn2a. In summary, we showed here that on one hand, Sag promotes cell proliferation by inducing ubiquitylation and degradation of Jun-B to prevent p16 transactivation. On the other hand, Sag cooperates with KrasG12D to trigger immortalization by maintaining an active Ras-Raf-Mapk signaling pathway. Likewise, Sag inactivation by genetic deletion causes Jun-B accumulation to induce p16 expression and subsequent premature senescence. Sag inactivation also blocks the Ras-Raf-Mapk signaling pathway to inhibit proliferation (Figure\u00a08). Future study is directed to elucidate the mechanism by which Sag maintains KrasG12D in a constitutively active form. The Sagfl/fl conditional KO mouse model was generated with exon 1 flanked with loxP sites. Cdkn2a-/- mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories. All procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals. Animal care was provided in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. MEFs were isolated from day E10.5 or E13.5 embryos, as described. Briefly, the embryos were washed with DMEM supplemented with 25 mM HEPES buffer and PBS. The tissue was then minced with a scalpel and digested with 0.05% trypsin solution containing 0.53 mM EDTA (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C with vigorous shaking. The tissue mixture was then passed 3 times through an 18G needle to further dissociate any remaining clumps. The cells from each embryo were put into a 100-mm dish and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. MEF media contained 15% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids and 10 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin. Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse tail tips and was genotyped using the primer set of PSag-KO-F: 5\u2032-TTCTGGCCAGGTGTGGTGATATC-3\u2032, and PSag-KO-G: 5\u2032-CTTAGCCTT GGTTGTGTAGAC-3\u2032 to detect floxed allele (140 bp) and wild-type allele (105 bp). The primer set for detecting the removal of the Sag targeting fragment (1.3 kp) is PSAG-KO-Seq-B: 5\u2032-GTAACTCCAGACAATGCTCGCT\u2032-3 and PSAG-KO-Seq-R: 5\u2032-TGAGTTCCAGGACAGCCA GGG-3\u2032 with Sag deletion (275 bp) or without Sag deletion (1.6 kb). The primer set for KrasG12D activation is Kras-CreF: 5\u2032-TCCGAATTCAGTGACTACAGA-3\u2032 and Kras-CreR: 5\u2032-CTAGCC ACCATGGTCTGAGT-3\u2032. Unrecombined 2 loxP band is approximately 500 bp, whereas wildtype is 620 bp. Upon recombination, the 500 bp is lost and a 650 bp 1 loxP band is present which represents the recombined Kras mutant allele. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicates and cell proliferation was measured with an ATPlite kit (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). MEFs after 48-hours of infection with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre were serum starved for 18 hours to allow cells arrested at the G0 phase. BrdU (100 \u03bcg/ml) was then added into the culture medium. BrdU incorporation assay was performed as described previously with the following modifications. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA-PBS and BrdU positive cells detected with a 5-Bromo-2\u2032-deoxy-uridine labeling and detection Kit II (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and counterstained with Eosin-Y. MEFs Cells were harvested, lysed in a Triton X-100 lysis buffer and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. SAG monoclonal antibody was raised against the RING domain (AA44-113). Other antibodies were purchased commercially as follows: p21 (BD Transduction Labs, Gibbstown, NJ), p53, Jun-B, p-Erk, Erk, and Rkip (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), p16, p15, Nf1, and Spry2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and Spred2 and \u03b2-Actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Anti-Erbin antibody was a gift from Dr. Lin Mei. For p16 staining, MEF cells were seeded on a cover slid and grown for few days before being subjected to p16 immunostaining using anti-p16 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) with ABC kits (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). The sections were developed with DAB and counterstained with haematoxylin. Normal goat serum was used for negative controls. The MEF cells with various indicated genotypes at passages of 4-7 were seeded in 6-well plate. Cells were grown for 2-days to reach sub-confluency, then subjected to SA-\u03b2-gal staining, as described. The total RNA was isolated from MEFs after infection with Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cDNA was made with random primers and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequence of primers used is as follows: Jun-B-F: 5\u2032-GCAGCTACTTTTCGGGTCAG-3\u2032, and Jun-B-R: 5\u2032-TTCATCTTGTGCAGGT CGTC-3\u2032. P16-F: 5\u2032-GAACTCTTTCGGTCGTACCC-3\u2032, and P16-R: 5\u2032-CGAATCTGCACCG TAGTTGA-3\u2032. Actin-F: 5\u2032-CACAGCTTCTTTGCAGCTCCTT-3\u2032 and Actin-R: 5\u2032-CGTCATCC ATGGCGAACTG-3\u2032. Ras activity was measured by using Ras binding domain of Raf (RBD) pull-down assay kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA), following manufacturer's instruction. The MEF cells with various indicated genotypes at passage 4 to 7 were seeded in 60-mm dish. Cells were grown for 2-days to reach sub-confluency and stained with 20 \u03bcM DCFHDA for 30 min in the dark and analyzed using the flow cytometer equipped with a 488-nm argon laser as a light source to determine the DCF fluorescence intensity. The green fluorescence was measured in the FL1 (FITC) channel. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 10,000 cells was analyzed by WinMDI 2.8 software. The MFI data were normalized to control levels and expressed as relative fluorescence intensity (DCF). Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student's t-test. All statistical analyses were carried out using the GraphPad Prism software version 5.01 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM of at least 3 independent experiments. P < .05 was considered statistically significant."}, "27643404": {"pmid": "27643404", "pmcid": "PMC5111609", "title": "Alcohol consumption and prostate cancer incidence and progression: A Mendelian randomisation study", "abstract": "\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer in men in developed countries, and is a target for risk reduction strategies.

These results suggest that alcohol consumption is unlikely to affect prostate cancer incidence, but it may influence disease progression.\n", "fulltext": "Abbreviations ADH alcohol dehydrogenase ALDH aldehyde dehydrogenase CI confidence interval HR hazard ratio LD linkage disequilibrium; OR odds ratio PRACTICAL PRostate cancer AssoCiation group to Investigate Cancer\u2010associated ALterations in the genome SNP single nucleotide polymorphism Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in developed countries, with 758,700 new cases diagnosed and 142,000 deaths in 2012.1 With increasing uptake of prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA) testing and the ageing population, prostate cancer incidence is increasing.2 The factors influencing prostate cancer incidence and survival after diagnosis are poorly understood, therefore more evidence is needed.3 Alcohol is a carcinogen associated with oropharyngeal, liver, breast, colorectal and oesophageal cancers.4 Functional variation in the genes involved in alcohol metabolism result in altered exposure to the carcinogenic metabolites of ethanol, suggesting a mechanism for genetic sensitivity to alcohol to influence the pathogenesis of cancers.5 For example, populations with an increased prevalence of common genetic variation in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene, that results in reduced enzyme activity, have an increased risk of oesophageal cancer compared with populations with the fully active enzyme.4 At present the role of alcohol use on prostate cancer remains uncertain. The World Cancer Research Fund's extensive report based on systematic reviews described the evidence as limited and inconclusive,6 and the International Association for Research on Cancer did not list this cancer site amongst others more apparently caused by alcohol in their Monograph on alcohol's carcinogenicity.4 There have been conflicting reports of possible associations of alcohol with various stages or histological grades of prostate cancer,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and meta\u2010analyses have highlighted the inconsistencies, emphasising the need for further research in this area.13, 14 The majority of evidence about the effects of alcohol on prostate cancer is from observational studies. One potential limitation of traditional observational research is that the findings can potentially be explained by common causes of both exposure and outcome (confounding factors). Other potential sources of bias are reverse causation and recall bias, where having prostate cancer affects drinking behaviour or its reporting, rather than alcohol consumption increasing the risk of prostate cancer. A prospective study design could mitigate both of these problems, but could still be affected by bias in the form of the \u201csick quitter\u201d effect, where former heavy drinkers reduce their alcohol intake in middle\u2010age because of comorbidities that may be alcohol\u2010related. Mendelian randomisation is an approach that uses genetic variants robustly associated with exposures of interest, or their metabolic effects, as instrumental variables to test the un\u2010confounded and unbiased causal effects of those exposures and their metabolic effects with cancer.15 Mendelian randomisation analyses rely on two approximate laws of Mendelian genetics,15, 16 that at meiosis alleles segregate without any influence of environmental factors and that the inheritance of one trait is independent of the inheritance of others. This allows genetic variation to be used in epidemiological studies as an un\u2010confounded proxy for an environmental exposure,15, 16, 17 in this case alcohol consumption, to estimate the influence of cumulative life\u2010time risk of exposure, to reduce recall bias and the \u201csick\u2010quitter\u201d effect and to negate reverse causation. All these features are limitations of previous conventional observational studies.7, 8, 13 Mendelian randomisation has already been used successfully in both cardiovascular18, 19 and cancer epidemiology20, 21, 22, 23, 24 to clarify the causal effects of alcohol on disease. In this study, we undertook Mendelian randomisation analyses in which we used variants in alcohol metabolising genes influencing metabolism and intake, to test the causal effect of alcohol exposure on prostate cancer risk and progression. The motivation is that if alcohol intake causally increases prostate cancer risk or progression, then genetic variants associated with metabolic effects of alcohol or increased intake will be differentially represented in cases and controls. We stratified the analysis by histological prostate cancer grade, based on Gleason score, as low\u2010 and high\u2010grade prostate cancers have differing natural histories which could be influenced by different risk factors. We used phenotypic and genotypic data from 46,919 men (23,868 cases) in the international Prostate cancer association group to investigate cancer\u2010associated alterations in the genome (PRACTICAL) consortium. Data were provided by 25 studies within the consortium, based in USA, Australia and European countries. This study population was limited to those of European ethnicity. The studies used a number of methods of recruitment, including screen and clinically detected cases and participants selected due to a family history of prostate cancer. The background characteristics of the participants of each study are shown in Table 1. Gleason scores were used to categorise cancers as low grade (Gleason score \u22646) or high grade (Gleason score \u22657). Further details are available from the consortium website (practical.ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk). All studies adhered both to national ethical guidelines and to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The participants were genotyped using a custom Illumina Infinium genotyping array (iCOGS), which was specifically designed for the Collaborative Oncological Gene\u2010environmental Study (COGS) and recorded 211,155 SNPs (details available from: http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/cancer/fp7-projects/cogs_en.html).25, 26 The iCOGS array was designed to investigate SNPs in regions thought to be associated with breast, ovarian and prostate cancer; 68,638 of the SNPs on the array were chosen because of their potential role in prostate cancer aetiology. The other 125,877 SNPs were selected on the basis of potential importance for other cancers and common SNPs known to be associated with any other traits. Individuals with fewer than 95% of genotypes called, or high or low heterozygosity (p\u2009<\u20091 \u00d7 10\u22125) were dropped from our analysis. In total 201,598 SNPs passed quality control. The genotypic data were used to impute SNPs which were not directly genotyped, but were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with genotyped SNPs. We used the HapMap 2 CEU reference panel and IMPUTE2 software.27 In this study, we searched the iCOGS array database for all alcohol\u2010metabolising genetic variants (within Alcohol Dehydrogenases (ADHs) or Aldehyde Dehydrogenases (ALDHs) genes), and identified 68 common variants in 5 distinct genomic regions: the ADH cluster on chromosome 4, comprising ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C and ADH7; ALDH1A1 and ALDH 1B1 on chromosome 9; ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3 on chromosome 15. Of these SNPs, 67 were directly genotyped, and one was imputed. An overview of the genes' role in alcohol metabolism and behaviour is shown in Supplementary material Table S1. The characteristics of the SNPs included in this study are shown in Supplementary material Table S2. We converted the genotypic data for each SNP into a count of the number of minor alleles at each locus. We used logistic regression to estimate the associations of the SNPs with prostate cancer risk (cases vs. controls), for all cases and stratified by high\u2010 vs. low\u2010grade disease. In a case\u2010only analysis, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate associations of each SNP with prostate cancer\u2010specific mortality, stratified by grade of prostate cancer. All regression analyses were adjusted for the first 8 principal components of population stratification, since these genomic regions show marked variation across different populations and so do prostate cancer incidence and survival. When checking the proportional hazards assumption, we found little evidence of violation. These regressions were performed for each study and then meta\u2010analysed using both fixed\u2010 and random\u2010effects models. Studies were excluded from the survival meta\u2010analysis if there were <5 deaths during the follow up period or <90% completion of follow up data. We investigated between\u2010study heterogeneity using the Stata metan command to estimate the I 2 statistic assuming a fixed\u2010effect model; we also report random\u2010effect models for completeness as such models may be relevant where I 2 values are high (e.g., >75%).28 Using meta\u2010regression, we investigated whether heterogeneity could be explained by the following a priori defined study\u2010specific characteristics: mean age at diagnosis, mean PSA at diagnosis, country of study (USA vs. elsewhere), and the percentage of participants with a family history of prostate cancer. Manhattan plots of the associations in the five chromosomal regions were constructed to identify SNPs exceeding the Nyholt corrected p values threshold for association \u2014a multiple testing correction which accounts for LD between the SNPs.29 Sensitivity analyses were conducted by reclassifying low\u2010 and high\u2010grade disease as <8 and 8\u201310 Gleason grade, respectively. The power of our study was also assessed using reverse power calculations to demonstrate the effect size we would expect to detect given our sample size and \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 with SNPs of a range of minor allele frequencies.30 The analysis was carried out using Stata v.13.1. The statistical code used to produce these results can be accessed here (https://github.com/nmdavies/practical-alcohol/). The background characteristics of the participants are summarised in Table 1, by study. Variation between studies reflects their individual recruitment methods (e.g., some studies selected for those men with a positive family history of prostate cancer). The Manhattan plots with results from both fixed and random effects meta\u2010analyses testing associations between SNPs in the five genomic regions and prostate cancer risk are presented in Figure 1 (detailed results available in Supplementary material Tables S4\u2013S9, and sensitivity analyses with alternative definitions of low\u2010 and high\u2010grade presented in Supplementary material Tables S16\u2013S19). The figure and Supplementary material tables show that no SNP exceeded the Nyholt corrected p values threshold for association with prostate cancer risk. In case\u2010only analyses, four SNPs exceeded the Nyholt corrected p values threshold for association with prostate cancer\u2010specific mortality in the fixed\u2010effect meta\u2010analysis (summary Manhattan plots presented in Figure 2, and individual SNP results presented in Supplementary material Tables S10\u2013S15, with results of sensitivity analyses with alternative definitions of low\u2010 and high\u2010grade presented in Supplementary material Tables S20\u2013S23). Three SNPs within ALDH1A2 were associated with prostate cancer mortality following diagnosis with any prostate cancer: rs1441817 (fixed effects hazard ratio, HRfixed\u2009=\u20090.78; 95% confidence interval (95%CI):0.66,0.91, p values\u2009=\u20090.002, I 2\u2009=\u200919.4); rs12910509, HRfixed\u2009=\u20090.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91, p values\u2009=\u20090.003, I 2\u2009=\u200923.0); and rs8041922 (HRfixed\u2009=\u20090.76; 95%CI:0.64,0.91, p values\u2009= 0.002, I 2\u2009=\u200925.5). To identify the top independent signal amongst these three, we conducted jointly adjusted analyses. Levels of pairwise LD were too high to attempt study\u2010specific analyses (pairwise LD rs1441817 and rs12910509 r 2\u2009=\u20090.89, rs1441817 and rs8041922 r 2\u2009=\u20090.88, rs12910509 and rs8041922 r 2\u2009=\u20090.99).31 Pooled analyses were conducted to estimate the joint effects of rs1441817 and rs12910509/rs8041922 (r 2\u2009=\u20090.99) on prostate cancer survival, with a random effect correction for standard errors. These showed an independent effect of rs1441817, similar in size to that of univariate analyses, but no independent effect of rs12910509/rs8041922 once adjusting for rs1441817. Given the high LD between the three SNPs, they should be taken as representing one underlying genetic signal. Figure 3 presents the forest plot of individual studies contributing to the meta\u2010analysis of prostate cancer\u2010specific survival in association with the top independent signal in ALDH1A2. A fourth SNP, rs10973794 in ALDH1B1 (also close to IGFBPL1), was associated with prostate cancer mortality in men with a diagnosis of low\u2010grade prostate cancer (HRfixed\u2009=\u20091.43; 95%CI:1.14,1.79, p values\u2009= 0.002, I 2\u2009=\u200923.4, Fig. 4). This result was robust to changing the low\u2010grade definition to <8 (HRfixed\u2009=\u20091.23; 95% CI:1.06,1.41, p values\u2009=\u20090.002, I 2\u2009=\u20090, Supplementary material Table S22). In general, random effects meta\u2010analyses yielded weaker evidence of association than fixed\u2010effect models, as one would expect due to variability across studies producing larger confidence intervals for the former. However, levels of heterogeneity as quantified by the I 2 statistics were low, with point estimates remarkably similar across the two types of meta\u2010analysis. Meta\u2010regression analyses found limited evidence that the study\u2010level characteristics examined had a strong influence on the pooled results (Table 2). Using data from the PRACTICAL Consortium, we pooled data from 25 studies including a total of 23,868 prostate cancer cases and 23,091 controls, to investigate the association of 68 SNPs within genes thought to be involved with alcohol metabolism with prostate cancer risk and prostate cancer\u2010specific mortality (amongst men diagnosed with prostate cancer), overall and by Gleason grade. After correcting for multiple testing in the fixed\u2010effect meta\u2010analysis, no SNPs exceed the Nyholt threshold for association with a diagnosis of prostate cancer, whereas three SNPs in ALDH1A2 (in strong LD with each other, therefore representing one signal only) exceed the Nyholt threshold for association with prostate cancer\u2010specific survival. One SNP in ALDH1B1 also exceeds the Nyholt threshold for association with prostate cancer\u2010specific survival in low\u2010grade prostate cancer. There is evidence that genetic variations in ADH and ALDH genes affecting ethanol metabolism32, 33, 34, 35 are associated with altered alcohol intake and risk of alcohol dependence.31, 35, 36, 37 The most extensively studied SNP in the context of alcohol intake is rs1229984 in ADH1B. It has been shown to be associated with increased adverse effects from alcohol intake and reduced consumption.35, 36 On average minor allele carriers drink 17.2% fewer units/week (95%CI:15.6%, 18.9%), are less likely to be in the top third of alcohol drinking volume (odds ratio, OR\u2009=\u20090.7; 95%CI:0.68,0.73) and are less likely to binge drink (OR\u2009=\u20090.78; 95%CI:0.73,0.84).23 It has also been reported to affect cancer risk at various sites.5 In our study, the associations of this SNP with prostate cancer diagnosis and survival were ORfixed\u2009=\u20091.00 (95%CI:0.96,1.03, p values\u2009=\u20090.87), and HRfixed\u2009=\u20091.11 (95%CI:0.95,1.30, p values\u2009=\u20090.17), respectively. Combining the effects of the ADH1B SNP on alcohol intake with the upper confidence intervals from our results implies that a 17% reduction in alcohol consumption is unlikely to reduce prostate cancer risk by >3% and prostate cancer mortality by >5%. Alcohol is metabolised to acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen, and there is evidence to support the theory that genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes, which control the production and breakdown of acetaldehyde, contribute to carcinogenesis.4, 5, 20, 24 There is also evidence of a tissue\u2010specific interaction in the prostate between ethanol and retinoic acid, through modulations of ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3 levels.38 To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive investigation of the association between ADH and ALDH variants, as genetic proxies for alcohol, and prostate cancer to date. Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer has been examined by GWASs, which shows common genetic variants can explain 33% heritability of prostate cancer but no genome\u2010wide significant hits are in ADHs or ALDHs39, 40 (however, this lack of evidence from GWASs could be a type 2 error). Similarly, we did not find any evidence of genetic association between ADH/ALDH variants and prostate cancer incidence in this study. Possible reasons for this include type 2 error, especially if the underlying effects of alcohol on prostate cancer incidence are small and limited to the very heavy drinking behaviours and/or to the more aggressive forms of disease, as possibly suggested by the recent literature.7, 12 We have shown that SNPs in ALDH1A2 are associated with altered prostate cancer\u2010specific mortality in a case\u2010only analysis. None of these SNPs appear to have regulatory features (www.ensemble.org), so they are unlikely to be causal variants themselves but rather they could be in LD with the causal variants. Recently, ALDH isoforms have been suggested as possible mechanistic mediators of metastasis in prostate cancer in particular41 and other solid tumours in general.42 One study found lack of compelling evidence linking variation in ALDH1 (including ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3 and ALDH1B1) with prostate cancer progression,41 but another had reported preliminary evidence for a potential role of ALDH1A2 as a tumour suppressor gene in prostate cancer cell lines43 and decreased expression of ALDH1A2 has been associated with shorter recurrence free survival in patients with prostate cancer.43 In our study, three intronic SNPs in ALDH1A2 were associated with longer survival, none of which were directly or indirectly (through LD) associated with alcohol\u2010related phenotypes (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). One potential explanation for our results may be that these SNPs, or others in LD with them, lead to increased activity in ALDH1A2. We speculate that the observed prostate cancer survival effect could be the result of a net increase in the synthesis of retinoic acid (by ALDH1A2), which is particularly beneficial when the rate of conversion is affected by slower ADH activity in the presence of alcohol consumption (retinol and ethanol both being ADH substrates,44 and ethanol modulating retinoic acid synthesis in the rat prostate38). Another intronic SNP in ALDH1B1 (also close to IGFBPL1) was found to be associated with increased mortality following a diagnosis of low\u2010grade prostate cancer. ALDH1B1 is the second most abundant mitochondrial ALDH, after ALDH2, with documented involvement in alcohol metabolism and dependence.45 However, this specific SNP is not known to be in LD with any of the variants associated with alcohol phenotypes to date, therefore we cannot speculate on its specific role in relation to alcohol. Evidence has been previously found linking levels of ALDH1B1 to survival following gastric cancer46 and non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer,47 but not prostate cancer,41 however the latter was a study in vitro Conversely,ALDH1A1 expression in the prostate has been reported to be a good candidate prognostic biomarker, based on all cause mortality and to a lesser extent prostate cancer\u2010specific mortality,48 and ALDH1A3 expression is thought to be involved with initiation and progression of several cancers,49 however we did not observe an association with common germ\u2010line mutations in either of these genes, or did we observe associations with variation in ADH genes. This could be due to different functional effects of variants on metabolic levels (e.g., alcohol and acetaldehyde peak levels and cumulative concentrations), affecting prostate cancer proliferation or survival differently both in terms of effect sizes and pathways. In this study, we have found that genetic variants in genes involved in alcohol metabolism were associated with disease\u2010specific mortality in men with prostate cancer, most of whom had been diagnosed with low\u2010grade disease. We found a signal specific to low\u2010grade prostate cancer survival, but none for high\u2010grade disease. Possible reasons why stronger associations were not seen with high\u2010grade cancers include: limited power, as there were smaller numbers of high\u2010 compared with low\u2010grade cases (this was investigated using a reverse power calculation, to assess the power of this study to detect small associations (Supplementary material Table S3)); patients behaviour may change following a diagnosis, e.g. patients with high\u2010grade prostate cancer may be too ill to drink and the effect of the SNPs cannot be seen in the absence of drinking; or the findings could reflect a true clinical difference in the way alcohol affects survival for the different grades of prostate cancer. The strengths of this study include the large sample size and availability of data on both risk and mortality stratified by grade, which is an important predictor of prognosis. Importantly, we used a Mendelian randomisation approach, which minimises the potential for bias due to confounding, information bias (recall bias and sick\u2010quitter effect) and reverse causation, major limitations of previous studies in this area.7, 8, 13 We were also able to control for confounding by population stratification by adjusting for basic population characteristics. A potential limitation of our study is its power to detect small effects of alcohol on high\u2010grade disease, with fewer of these cases having been diagnosed and followed\u2010up. Data for this study were contributed to the PRACTICAL Consortium from many studies with varying recruitment and inclusion/exclusion criteria, as different screening practices could complicate the interpretation of our results.50 For example, CAPS participants were all diagnosed clinically, whereas ProtecT participants were all screen detected. While the consortium provides a large sample size for investigation, there is inevitably some heterogeneity in the contributing studies. The effect of this was investigated using random effects meta\u2010analysis and meta\u2010regression. No one study\u2010level characteristic had a strong influence on the results, and we were unable to clearly determine the reason for the modest levels of heterogeneity observed, and the consequent variation between the fixed\u2010effect and random\u2010effect analyses. Potential explanations include: systematic differences in smaller vs. larger studies, and the former being assigned larger weights in random\u2010effect models; true variation in the effects of alcohol in the different study populations; effects of study designs that we were not able to investigate, e.g. the different ways cases were ascertained/recruited. Another possible limitation to consider is the potential influence of pleiotropy. There may be other direct pathways through which the SNPs influence prostate cancer mortality independently of alcohol metabolism and intake. In particular, SNPs in ALDH1A2 could have a role in retinoic acid synthesis, which could affect cancer survival per se and in conjunction with alcohol,38 and we note that the ALDH1B1 SNP is in close proximity to IGFBPL1, which may encode a putative tumour suppressor protein.51 However, there were no other associations of these SNPs, or others in LD with them, reported by the catalogue of published genome\u2010wide association studies (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/); therefore the risk of pleiotropy for the genetic variants under study here is likely to be small. Finally, the direction of effect of the SNPs on alcohol intake, apart from rs1229984, is unknown so it is not possible to estimate the effect size of the four SNPs we found to be associated with survival. There are a number of ways in which this work could be taken forward. These include further analysis in larger consortia with longer follow up data availability, or repeating within individual subsets with certain study design characteristics to increase similarity of studies included in analysis (direct replication). Analysis of further genetic variants with known effects on alcohol metabolism or behaviour would also allow further development of this work (indirect replication), as would establishing the magnitude and direction of effect of genetic variants in alcohol metabolising genes on alcohol intake. It would also be interesting to investigate patient behaviour following diagnosis to establish if the varied effect seen between high\u2010 and low\u2010grade disease could be due to differences in behaviour. If confirmed in independent studies or through direct or indirect replication, these findings suggest a role for alcohol in the progression of prostate cancer, whilst also confirming that alcohol is unlikely to have a large impact on prostate cancer carcinogenesis. This has potential public health implications and alcohol intake could be targeted to improve survival from prostate cancer as part of holistic care."}, "29049388": {"pmid": "29049388", "pmcid": "PMC5648285", "title": "An inducible mouse model of podocin-mutation-related nephrotic syndrome", "abstract": "\nMutations in the NPHS2 gene, encoding podocin, cause hereditary nephrotic syndrome. The most common podocin mutation, R138Q, is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. Knock-in mice carrying a R140Q mutation, the mouse analogue of human R138Q, show developmental arrest of podocytes and lethal renal failure at neonatal age. Here we created a conditional podocin knock-in model named NPHS2\nR140Q/-, using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase, which permits to study the effects of the mutation in postnatal life. Within the first week of R140Q hemizygosity induction the animals developed proteinuria, which peaked after 4\u20135 weeks. Subsequently the animals developed progressive renal failure, with a median survival time of 12 (95% CI: 11\u201313) weeks. Foot process fusion was observed within one week, progressing to severe and global effacement in the course of the disease. The number of podocytes per glomerulus gradually diminished to 18% compared to healthy controls 12\u201316 weeks after induction. The fraction of segmentally sclerosed glomeruli was 25%, 85% and 97% at 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis was present at later disease stage and was correlated quantitatively with the level of proteinuria at early disease stages. While R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated, protein abundance was reduced by more than 50% within one week following induction. Whereas miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first 4 weeks, miRNA-193a expression peaked 2 weeks after induction. In conclusion, the inducible R140Q-podocin mouse model is an auspicious model of the most common genetic cause of human nephrotic syndrome, with a spontaneous disease course strongly reminiscent of the human disorder. This model constitutes a valuable tool to test the efficacy of novel pharmacological interventions aimed to improve podocyte function and viability and attenuate proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure.\n", "fulltext": "Recessive mutations in the NPHS2 gene, coding for the podocyte membrane protein podocin, constitute the most common genetic cause of childhood-onset nephrotic syndrome [1, 2]. Podocin is part of a multi-protein complex at the podocyte slit diaphragm that serves to recruit nephrin to the plasma membrane and link the slit diaphragm to the podocyte cytoskeleton [3\u20135]. Focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the typical histopathological finding of podocin-related glomerulopathy and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) inevitably occurs, although the age at first disease manifestation and the rate of disease progression are rather variable. The phenotype is to a major degree related to the type and position of the mutations. Among more than 120 pathogenic mutations described to date the p.R138Q (c.413G>A) mutation is the most common, at least among Caucasians, representing 32% and 44% of all mutated alleles in two large European series [8, 9]. The resulting substitution of the highly conserved glutamine at this position for arginine leads to protein misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [3, 10]. The R138Q mutation is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to ESRD. Several mouse models of podocin-related glomerulopathy have been developed over the past decade to elucidate the function of the protein, study the natural course of the disease and assess potential therapeutic approaches [10\u201312]. A constitutive podocin knockout (Nphs2-/-) mouse model revealed the requirement of podocin for the correct assembly of nephrin at the slit diaphragm. However, constitutive absence of podocin led to developmental arrest of podocytes and lethal renal failure at neonatal age. Subsequently, to mimic the most common human genetic abnormality, a mouse strain carrying the R140Q mutation (knockin), the murine analogue of human R138Q, was generated. Unfortunately, similar to the knockout model, the constitutive knock-in mice died from renal failure within the first 1\u20132 weeks of life. More recently, an inducible podocin knockout mouse model was generated using inducible Cre recombinase technology. In these mice bearing one Nphs2 allele with a floxed exon 2, one null Nphs2 allele, and a podocyte-expressed, tamoxifen-responsive Cre recombinase transgene, podocin loss was induced by tamoxifen injection. When podocin deficiency is induced postnatally in mature kidneys, massive albuminuria develops which is followed by glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure, with death occurring at a median time of 11 weeks after induction of podocin deficiency. While this phenotype resembles the course of podocin-related nephropathy in humans, the inducible podocin knockout model does still not allow one to study the fate of R140Q mutant podocin and mutation bearing podocytes in vivo. Therefore, the inducible podocin knockout is not a suitable model to explore innovative therapeutic approaches aimed to rescue R140Q mutant podocin function. Here, we combined the previous approaches to generate a novel inducible knock-in mouse model of podocin-associated glomerulopathy. Cross-breeding of animals carrying one floxed podocin allele, one podocin allele bearing the R140Q mutation, and a tamoxifen-sensitive inducible Cre transgene enabled us to induce hemizygosity for the R140Q mutant, i.e. a genetic condition closely mimicking the human disease. We provide a detailed characterization of this potentially useful model of the most common single genetic abnormality causing human hereditary nephrotic syndrome. Proteinuria became detectable within few days (day 7: 3.48 \u00b1 0.74 g/g creatinine in Nphs2R140Q/- mice vs. 1.70 \u00b1 0.16 g/g creatinine in healthy controls) and increased to a maximum 4\u20135 weeks after induction of Nphs2R140Q/- using tamoxifen. Thereafter proteinuria decreased gradually but remained much elevated compared to controls until the end of the observation period (Fig 1A). Weight gain ceased in the proteinuric animals, leading to significantly lower body weight from week 6 onward (Fig 1B). Blood pressure moderately increased in Nphs2R140Q/- animals compared to healthy controls (Fig 1C). Four weeks after induction Nphs2R140Q/- animals displayed hypoalbuminemia (20.4 \u00b1 1.9 g/l vs. 30.8 \u00b1 1.7 g/l), hypercholesterolemia (345 \u00b1 34 mg/dl vs. 76 \u00b1 6.9 mg/dl) and diminished creatinine clearance (121 \u00b1 21 \u03bcl/min vs. 171 \u00b1 33 \u03bcl/min) compared to healthy controls (Fig 1D\u20131F). The median survival time of the Nphs2R140Q/- animals was 12 (95% CI: 11\u201313) weeks (Fig 1G). The expression of wild type (wt) podocin mRNA rapidly decreased after induction of the hemizygous state. Notably, R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated in Nphs2R140Q/- animals during the first four weeks of observation compared to healthy controls (Fig 2A). By contrast, podocin protein abundance was significantly reduced starting from week one (to 48% of that of healthy controls) and was almost completely abolished eight weeks after induction (to 4% of that of healthy controls) (Fig 2B). The loss of podocin in Nphs2R140Q/- animals progressed to subtotal to total podocin loss at the end stage disease. These findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence studies (Fig 3). The Nphs2R140Q/- animals displayed significant early glomerular sclerosis from the first week after induction (glomerular sclerosis index (GSI) 0.39, p = 0.003). Subsequently the GSI progressively increased until week eight, when 100% of glomeruli were partially or globally sclerosed (Fig 4). In addition, the mice developed significant tubular atrophy and severe interstitial fibrosis, which were visible from the first week after induction and increased to 12% of the total kidney area in the course of disease until end-stage kidney disease was reached (Fig 5A\u20135E). Tubulointerstitial fibrosis at four weeks was quantitatively correlated with the degree of proteinuria two weeks after disease induction (p = 0.01; Fig 5F). The number of podocytes per glomerulus progressively diminished with time starting at the end of the second week after induction (68% of that of healthy controls) to 18% of that of healthy controls at 12\u201316 weeks (Fig 6A). Podocyte loss was also visualized by Wt1 labeling (Fig 6B\u20136E). Electron microscopy showed irregularly shaped or fused foot processes one week after induction (Fig 7A and 7B), progressing to effacement and global fusion at subsequent time points (Fig 7C and 7D). At variance to the previously described glomerular basement membrane (GBM) denudation as a mechanism of glomerular sclerosis, our Nphs2R140Q/- mice did not display any area of GBM denudation in ultrastructural studies. 3D modelling of the glomerular structure revealed GBM thickening in induced animals relative to controls. Moreover, four weeks after induction the podocyte foot processes number per \u03bcm GBM was significantly decreased in addition to severe loss of foot process organization (Fig 7E\u20137H). To investigate possible post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in our model, we searched for differences in the expression of miRNA-21 and miRNA-193a, previously described to be involved in chronic kidney failure [15\u201321]. In kidneys of Nphs2R140Q/- and control animals one, two and four weeks after induction, miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first four weeks of disease whereas miRNA-193a expression was increased by 100% within one week after induction and reached a peak after two weeks (Fig 8). The induction of hemizygous R140Q podocin expression in our model resulted in a progressive glomerulopathy with a nephrotic phenotype gradually evolving to renal failure. The histopathological sequence of renal lesions includes foot process effacement, podocyte loss, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Previous mouse models of hereditary podocytopathies included deficiency or selective mutation of nephrin, podocin [10, 11], \u03b1-actinin 4, CD2AP, laminin \u03b22 [25\u201327], TRPC6 and \u03b13 (IV) collagen [29\u201331] (Table 1). Most of these models are characterized either by severe renal developmental defects and congenital nephrotic syndrome leading to early demise [10, 11, 22, 25\u201327] or by incomplete penetrance [23, 28]. The conditional inactivation of normal protein expression achieved by use of an inducible CreLox system allows inducing and describing comprehensively a uniform renal phenotype established at postnatal age, well after completion of nephrogenesis. In our model, proteinuria appeared within days after induction of the hemizygous knockin state and peaked after four weeks. Hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia, the other key biochemical features of nephrotic syndrome, manifested within two weeks of disease induction. Proteinuria gradually decreased in the second and third month as the animals developed progressive FSGS, hypertension and renal failure. Death from uremia occurred mainly between week 6 and 16, with an average survival time of 11 weeks. The observed phenotype closely resembles that of the inducible podocin knockout mouse model previously developed by the group of C. Antignac, with similar time courses of proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and death in uremia. However, the model presented here provides a better molecular recapitulation of human disease as complete podocin deficiency rarely occurs in humans. Furthermore, the production of a podocin protein with defective folding due to a single amino acid exchange and consecutive retention in the ER renders the model suitable for in vivo screening of candidate chaperone compounds that would stimulate protein trafficking to the membrane. With regards to the timing and extent of histopathological and ultrastructural changes, it is worth noting that at the earliest stage of disease mild proteinuria was observed in the presence of still almost normal EM findings (showing some unincisive irregular FPs), whereas the progression to higher grade proteinuria was associated with pronounced foot process fusion and effacement (Fig 7). These findings are in keeping with previous reports of hereditary podocytopathy models including the inducible podocin kockout model [5, 12, 32]. No invasion of GBM by podocytes was observed as has been reported for collagen IV nephropathy and other models of glomerular disease. FSGS is the typical histopathological lesion found in renal biopsies of patients with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) due to NPHS2 mutations [2, 34, 35]. The Nphs2R140Q/- mice demonstrated very similar histomorphology starting with segmental glomerular scarring in individual glomeruli that progressed gradually to almost all glomeruli, leading to terminal renal failure. Several FSGS subtypes including the collapsing, glomerular tip lesion and crescent variants were observed along with diffuse foot process effacement and podocyte loss. These lesions might occur secondary to podocyte detachment [36, 37] or result from altered expression of genes encoding important structural or functional components of the podocytes. Toxin-induced podocyte depletion studies in a transgenic rat model revealed a quantitative correlation of glomerulosclerosis with the extent of podocyte loss. Also in the model presented here, the development and progression of glomerulosclerosis is likely to result from gradual podocyte depletion. In support of this notion, podocyte loss correlated with the significant increase of the glomerular sclerosis index, which was noted four weeks after induction. While podocyte loss is believed to be essential for developing glomerulosclerosis, the mechanisms leading to podocyte detachment remains elusive. Specifically, it is not even clear whether podocytes detach because they die or due to loss of adhesion. Podocyte loss in this model is compatible with either mechanism since intact podocin is essential both for podocyte survival and for the maintenance of foot process structure and function. Furthermore, although no GBM denudation could be detected in our model, massive podocyte hypertrophy observed in our animals (e.g. Fig 7D) could promote podocyte stress leading to podocyte loss and subsequent development of glomerulosclerosis [40, 41]. The percentage of sclerotic glomeruli, as well as the area affected by sclerosis in each glomerulus, increased with time in Nphs2R140Q/- animals, a process presumably enhanced by increasing hyperfiltration stress to podocytes in remaining glomeruli once a critical mass of nephrons was obliterated. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis was visible from the end of the first week after disease induction and was enhanced after four weeks (Fig 5). The degree of tubulointerstitial fibrosis was correlated with the preceding degree of proteinuria after disease induction. Ample experimental evidence supports that nephrotic range albuminuria is toxic to tubular epithelial cells and a potent cause of tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, it has been hypothesized that \u2018misdirected filtration\u2019 with diffusion of ultrafiltrate into the peritubular space may occur in segmental glomerulosclerosis following synechial attachment of the GBM to Bowman\u2019s capsule. On the molecular level, we observed a gradual loss of podocin protein (both by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining) following induction of the hemizygous knockin state. A reduction of podocin abundance by more than 50% was observed within one week following induction. Due to the inactivation of the floxed wt podocin allele in Nphs2 R140Q/- animals the expression of wt podocin mRNA decreased, however R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated during the first four weeks after induction. Significant upregulation of R140Q podocin mRNA was previously showed in the R140Q podocin knockin mouse model. The diminished podocin protein abundance in face of elevated mutated Nphs2 gene expression is in keeping with intracellular retention and increased proteasomal degradation of mutant protein as previously demonstrated in vitro for the R138Q mutation [44, 45]. When glomerulosclerosis was fully established after four weeks, podocin abundance had dropped to less than 10% of that of controls. At that time the number of podocytes per glomerulus had only decreased by one third of that of healthy controls and R140Q podocin mRNA expression was still elevated, indicating that podocin protein loss at this stage of the disease was a specific consequence of the hemizygous mutated state with enhanced intracellular degradation rather than a consequence of early global podocyte depletion. In order to elucidate key molecular responses to the podocin mutated state, we chose to study the expression of miR-193a and miR-21 based on a review of the recent literature. miR-193a was found highly upregulated in glomeruli isolated from FSGS patients and it has been shown that its overexpression in an inducible mouse model led to focal and later global glomerulosclerosis with broad capsular adhesion [15, 16]. We observed an early and transient upregulation of miR-193a in our model, supporting the notion that this miRNA is an important player in the sequence of molecular events leading to FSGS in hereditary podocytopathies caused by functional deficiency of a single podocyte protein. The major target of miR-193a is WT1, which plays an essential role in the development and maintenance of podocytes [16, 46, 47]. Repression of WT1 upon upregulation of miR-193a initiates a cascade of events resulting in structural destabilization and disrupted function of podocytes, leading to progressive FSGS. Intriguingly, we found that upregulation of miR-193a two weeks after disease induction was followed by a reduction in Wt1 expression in week 4 (Fig 9). The function of miR-21 in animal models of kidney injury is controversial. In some models of kidney disease upregulation of miR-21 promotes kidney injury [17\u201319], whereas other studies suggest that increased miR-21 expression might rather activate protective molecular programs that would attenuate tubulointerstitial and glomerular injury [20, 21]. Our finding that miR-21 is upregulated in Nphs2 R140Q/- animals compared with controls is consistent with a function of miR-21 in promoting glomerular injury. In conclusion, we have generated an inducible mouse model of podocin nephropathy with a disease course and histopathological features closely resembling the human disorder. The inducible Nphs2 R140Q/-knockin mouse is the ideal model to test the efficacy of antiproteinuric therapies including novel molecular approaches targeting the underlying molecular defect. C57BL/6 mouse lines transgenic for Cre+/-, Nphs2+/- and Nphs2lox2/lox2 and Nphs2+/R140Q were previously established in collaboration with the Mouse Clinical Institute (Institut Clinique de la Souris, Illkirch, France) and described in Mollet et al., 2009 and Philippe et al., 2008, respectively. The two lines Cre+/-, Nphs2+/- and Nphs2lox2/lox2 were crossed and offspring mice with Nphs2lox2/+, Cre+/- and Nphs2lox2/-, Cre+/- genotypes were subsequently used for further matings. Nphs2lox2/lox2, Cre+/+ mice, resulting from mating between Nphs2lox2/+, Cre+/- and Nphs2lox2/-, Cre+/- mice, were then crossed with the Nphs2+/R140Q mice. The resulting Nphs2lox2/R140Q, Cre+/- mice were used for the final experiments. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with EU regulations for animal experimentation. The project was approved by the Government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Regierungspr\u00e4sidium Karlsruhe, Germany under Aktenzeichen 35\u20139185.81/G-191/09 and 35\u20139185.81/G-181/15. Hemizygosity for the R140Q allele was induced in six weeks old Nphs2lox2/R140Q, Cre+/- mice by intraperitoneal administration of tamoxifen (33 mg/kg/day for 5 days; Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO), dissolved in sunflower oil (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO). The resulting mice were named Nphs2 R140Q/- in the manuscript. Control mice with the same genotype (Nphs2lox2/R140Q, Cre+/-) received the equivalent volume of sunflower oil without tamoxifen. Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment (S1 Table) of Interfaculty Biomedical Facility (IBF) (Clinical experimental area- KEB), Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg, where their health and behaviour were controlled daily by skilled animal takers. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the German Law on Animal Welfare (TierSchG), paragraph \u00a7 8 \u2013animal experiments\u2014from 7 June 2006 (BGBI. I S. 1313). All research staff handling with animals was trained in accordance with the recommendations of the GV-SOLAS (Society of laboratory animal science) and the FELASA (Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations) in a class B course. The onset and course of proteinuria was monitored by weekly collection of 24-hour urine in metabolic cages (Tecniplast, Hohenpei\u00dfenberg, Germany). Proteinuria was monitored weekly until the time of sacrificing. Starting from the first week after tamoxifen administration, the animals were accustomed to tail-cuff plethysmography according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Coda\u2014Kent Scientific Corporation). Thereafter, blood pressure measurements (25 cycles per session per mouse) were obtained once weekly by tail-occlusion plethysmography. The median values of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure of accepted cycles were taken as representative for the session. At least four control and four induced mice were sacrificed at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 after tamoxifen administration or followed open end for max. 35 weeks for survival studies. In case of anorexia of about 50% or cachexia over 10%, as specific endpoint criteria, the affected animal was euthanized immediately. Only 16 animals died spontaneously during the whole observation time. At defined experimental time points animals were deeply anesthetized with CO2 and blood was obtained by cardiac puncture. The sacrificed mice were then perfused with 10 ml 0.9% NaCl solution. Both kidneys were excised and decapsulated and samples were collected for RNA and protein isolation, histopathological analysis, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Urine protein concentration was measured according to the Bradford method. Blood urea, serum albumin, creatinine and cholesterol, and urinary creatinine were measured using standard laboratory methods. Approximately 1 \u03bcg of total RNA obtained from kidney tissue blocks using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was reverse transcribed with oligo (dT)/random hexamer primers (10:1). Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed with the StepOne Plus Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with specific primers for 18 S (forward: 5'-AGTTGGTGGAGCGATTTGTC- 3'; reverse: 5'-CGGACATCTAAGGGCATCAC- 3'), Nphs2 WT (forward: 5'-GTCCTCGCCTCCCTGATCTT-3'; reverse: 5'-AGGAAGCAGATGTCCCAGTC-3'), Nphs2 R140Q (forward: 5'-GTCCTCGCCTCCCTGATCTT-3'; reverse: 5'-AGGAAGCAGATGTCCCAGCT-3'), Nphs2 total (forward: 5'-TTGATCTCCGTCTCCAGACCTT-3'; reverse: 5'-TCCATGCGGTAGTAGCAGACA- 3'), Wt1 (forward: 5'-GAAATGGACAGAAGGGCAGA-3'; reverse: 5'-GACCCCGTGGGTGTGTATT-3'), and Universal Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR green to detect PCR products at the end of each amplification step. Serial dilutions of an arbitrary cDNA pool were used to establish a standard curve. Relative quantities of RNA levels were determined, accounting for amplification efficacy by the software provided with the PCR system. Messenger RNA levels were normalized to corresponding 18S quantities, determined within the same run. The analysis of miRNA-21 (5'- UAGCUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUGA-3') and miRNA-193a (5'- AACUGGCCUACAAAGUCCCAGU-3') was performed by qPCR by CBC (Comprehensive Biomarker Center GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Delta CT values were normalized to endogenous snoRNA 202 (NCBI Accession: AF357327) and snoRNA 234 (NCBI Accession: AF357329). Snap-frozen kidney tissues were homogenized on ice with CHAPS buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 \u03bcl CHAPS buffer per mg tissue). Samples were then vortexed and centrifuged (4000 g) for 35 min at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured according to Bradford method and 30 \u03bcg of total protein were denatured in 4\u00d7 sample buffer separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%, SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a PVDF Transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes was blocked in 5% milk and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with primary rabbit anti-podocin antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4\u00b0C (1:1000), followed by incubation with the second antibody (HRP-anti-rabbit, 1:3000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). The membrane was visualized using chemiluminescent detection. Equal protein loading was confirmed by reprobing the membrane for GAPDH (1:20000) (Meridian Life Sciences, Memphis, USA). Signal intensity was evaluated densitometrically (Quantity one software, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Kidney tissues fixed in 4% buffered formalin were paraffin-embedded and 3 \u03bcm thick sections were stained with Masson-Trichrome for qualitative and Sirius Red for quantitative analysis of tissue fibrosis, and with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) to determine the degree of sclerosis within the glomerular tuft. Samples stained with Sirius Red were scanned using Aperio Spectrum software (Aperio Technologies). Images were captured using Aperio ImageScope software at total magnification of 300. The percentage of sirius red\u2013stained tubulointerstitial area was measured in 30 randomly sampled fields per kidney using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) as described previously. The degree of sclerosis within the glomerular tuft as a parameter of renal disease progression was determined in a blinded manner on PAS-stained paraffin sections using the semiquantitative scoring system. Images of scanned sections were captured at total magnification of 300. For each animal the glomerular sclerosis index (GSI) was derived as the mean of 50 glomeruli. The glomerular score for individual glomeruli was: grade 0\u2014normal glomerulus; grade 1\u2014mesangial proliferation/sclerosis involving less than 25% of the glomerular tuft; grade 2\u2014sclerosis involving more than 25%, but less than 50% of the glomerular tuft; grade 3\u2014sclerosis involving more than 50%, but less than 75% of the glomerular tuft; grade 4\u2014diffuse glomerulosclerosis with total tuft obliteration. The fractional sclerosed area within the glomerular tuft was determined using Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The number of podocytes per glomerulus was determined according to the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium protocol (www.diacomp.org). Samples were treated with Wt1 antibody from LifeSpan Biosciences, Seattle, WA. Tissues frozen in Tissue-Tek Gel (Sakura, Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands) were cut in 5 \u03bcm sections, fixed in acetone/methanol solution (1:1), washed with PBS and incubated with DCS antibody dilution buffer (Innovative Diagnostik-Systeme, Hamburg, Germany) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Samples were then incubated with primary rat anti-mouse Nidogen antibody (1:6000) (Millipore) to stain the basal membranes for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by washing and treating with donkey anti-rat antibody (DyLight 549 red, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) diluted 1:2000 for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing steps, samples were blocked again in DCS for 1 hour at room temperature. After just tipping the blocking solution away the primary rabbit anti mouse podocin antibody diluted (1:1000) (Sigma) or the primary rabbit anti mouse Wt1 antibody diluted (1:400) (LifeSpanBiosciences, Seattle, WA, USA) was added and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C or 1 hour at room temperature, respectively. After washing the secondary donkey anti rabbit antibody (DyLight 488 green, Dianova) (1:1000 for Podocin and 1:250 for Wt1) was added (1 hour, room temperature). Nuclei were labelled using bisbenzimide (diluted 1:1000 in water) (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Slides were examined using a Leica DMI 4000 B microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL, USA). Renal tissue samples (1 mm3) were stored in EM fixation solution (phosphate buffer containing 1.5% Glutaraldehyde und 1.5% Paraformaldehyde) at 4\u00b0C until embedding. Following embedding with Epon and subsequent polymerisation, ultra-thin sections were obtained using diamond knives (Diatome\u00ae, Hatfield, PA or Drukker\u00ae, Drukker International BV, the Netherlands) with a Leica\u00ae UltraCut microtome (Leica, Deerfield, IL, USA). The samples were then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed under a ZEISS EM 10A transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Kidney samples were prepared for SBF-SEM as described previously. In brief, mouse kidneys were cut into 1 mm cubes and fixed in situ by using 2% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde (Agar Scientific, UK) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2); stained in 1% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide, 1.5% (wt/vol) potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, followed by 1% (wt/vol) thiocarbohydrazide. After washing, more osmium was added by staining in 1% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide, and soaked in 1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate overnight. The final staining step incubation was performed at 60\u00b0C with lead aspartate pH 5.5 for one hour. Samples were dehydrated in ethanol and infiltrated in TAAB 812 hard resin. Tissue was mounted onto an aluminium cryo pin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat. no. 70446) using cyanoacrylate glue and all block surfaces trimmed at 90\u00b0C using a glass knife or diamond trimming tool (Diatome). A gold coating was applied to the block to create a conductive surface. The block was placed in the Quanta 250 FEG (FEI Company) + Gatan 3view system and a 41 \u03bcm \u00d7 41 \u03bcm field of view was chosen and imaged by using a 4096 \u00d7 4096 scan, which gave an approximate pixel size of 10 nm. The section thickness was set to 50 nm in the Z (cutting) direction. Different blocks from the same sample used for SBF-SEM (Serial block face-scanning electron microscopy) were used to quantify the ultrastructure by means of TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy). Tissue blocks were removed from their moulds and sectioned (70\u201380 nm thickness). Sections were examined using a FEI Tecnai 12G2 Biotwin transmission electron microscope. Magnification varied from 145X to 6800X. n = 6 glomeruli were imaged. Images were saved as original.dm3 files and.tiff files. The dm3 files were opened using Fiji/ImageJ software version 2.0.0-rc-29/1.49r. Collectively 60 randomly selected points of the GBM across 50.dm3 images were measured to assess GBM thickness. The straight-line option was used to draw across the width of the GBM at the chosen point >Analyse > Measure. To quantify podocyte FP number 50 randomly selected areas of GBM 5 \u03bcm in length were measured as above and FP number counted manually. All measurements were imported into GraphPad Prism software version 5.0 for interpretation and graphical representation. All data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM and compared using t test for independent samples. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."}, "27292643": {"pmid": "27292643", "pmcid": "PMC4920917", "title": "Negative Selection and Chromosome Instability Induced by Mad2 Overexpression Delay Breast Cancer but Facilitate Oncogene-Independent Outgrowth", "abstract": "\nSummary\nChromosome instability (CIN) is associated with poor survival and therapeutic outcome in a number of malignancies. Despite this correlation, CIN can also lead to growth disadvantages. Here, we show that simultaneous overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad2 with KrasG12D or Her2 in mammary glands of adult mice results in mitotic checkpoint overactivation and a delay in tumor onset. Time-lapse imaging of organotypic cultures and pathologic analysis prior to tumor establishment reveals error-prone mitosis, mitotic arrest, and cell death. Nonetheless, Mad2 expression persists and increases karyotype complexity in Kras tumors. Faced with the selective pressure of oncogene withdrawal, Mad2-positive tumors have a higher frequency of developing persistent subclones that avoid remission and continue to grow.\n", "fulltext": "Genomic instability is one of the main enabling features of cancer, setting the path for subsequent events of uncontrolled growth, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). One of the most studied mechanisms of generating genomic variability is aberrant distribution of chromosomes during cell division, known as chromosomal instability (CIN) (Boveri, 1912). Large-scale analyses of human tumors predict that 86% of solid and 72% of hematopoietic malignancies are aneuploid (Zasadil et\u00a0al., 2013). CIN gene signatures have become an important prognostic tool to evaluate patient survival and therapeutic outcome (Carter et\u00a0al., 2006, Habermann et\u00a0al., 2009). However, deregulation of CIN genes in\u00a0vitro causes a decrease in cellular fitness through p53-mediated cell death and metabolic stress because of protein imbalance (Li et\u00a0al., 2010, Thompson and Compton, 2010, Torres et\u00a0al., 2007). Studies in\u00a0vivo show that CIN genes can have either no effect or lead to an increase in spontaneous or carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis (Schvartzman et\u00a0al., 2010). In combination with loss of known tumor suppressor genes or oncogene activation, even suppressive effects on tumor induction have been reported (Janssen and Medema, 2013, Zasadil et\u00a0al., 2013). To explain these ambiguities, Silk et\u00a0al. (2013) proposed a model in which the level of CIN might tip the balance between tumor-promoting and -suppressive outcomes. Despite this, it is still unclear when during tumor development aneuploidy exerts its modulating effects on tumor growth. Most researchers agree that oncogenes are the main drivers of tumorigenesis, whereas CIN contributes to genetic variation and plasticity (Chen et\u00a0al., 2012, Tamborero et\u00a0al., 2013). To understand how genetic instability can influence classical oncogenesis, we focused on the effect of Mad2-induced CIN during oncogene-driven tumorigenesis. Mad2 is a downstream target of two major tumor suppressors: RB and p53 (Schvartzman et\u00a0al., 2011). In addition, Mad2 overexpression in a transgenic model of KrasG12D-driven lung carcinogenesis facilitated both tumor onset and relapse following oncogene silencing (Sotillo et\u00a0al., 2010). Moreover, its elevated level in various cancer types (Rhodes et\u00a0al., 2004) makes it an attractive target for cancer studies. Considering the detrimental effect of aneuploidy on cellular homeostasis (Torres et\u00a0al., 2007) and the continued controversy with respect to both its tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing function in\u00a0vivo, it is unclear whether this synergy is a general principle of cancer. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide and can be driven by a wide spectrum of oncogenes (Sanchez-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2014, Stephens et\u00a0al., 2012). Although Kras mutations are prevalent in 30% of all human cancers, Her2 is deregulated in 15% of human mammary tumors (Cerami et\u00a0al., 2012, Gao et\u00a0al., 2013). Similar to lung cancer, human breast tumors are highly aneuploid (Zasadil et\u00a0al., 2013); however, animal models are less prone to CIN-induced mammary tumorigenesis (Duijf and Benezra, 2013). We combined KrasG12D or Her2 conditional mouse models with Mad2 overexpression in the adult mammary gland to mirror the timing of tumor onset in breast cancer patients. This resulted in a strong delay in tumor formation compared with KrasG12D or Her2 expression alone. Pathologic analysis of early events after transgene induction revealed increased cell turnover caused by an initial depletion of Mad2-expressing cells and an accumulation of mitotic errors in the surviving population. Three phenotypic subgroups of the Kras/Mad2-expressing cohort were identified, all of which resulted in the generation of Mad2-overexpressing, highly aneuploid tumors. The level of aneuploidy seen in Her2 tumors was not exceeded by additional Mad2 expression, indicating that tumors self-regulate the ultimate level of CIN (Montagna et\u00a0al., 2002). In both oncogenic models, Mad2-induced CIN failed to have an effect on tumor progression but led to the generation of abnormal cells that survived the strong selective pressure of oncogene withdrawal. To better understand the effect of CIN on tumor initiation we\u00a0generated a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-driven, doxycycline-inducible model to overexpress hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Mad2 (Sotillo et\u00a0al., 2007) and KrasG12D (Fisher et\u00a0al., 2001) in mammary glands of adult virgin mice (Gunther et\u00a0al., 2002). Mice were placed on a doxycycline-enriched diet and followed weekly for tumor development. Monitored mice were divided into four cohorts depending on the presence of KrasG12D (K), Mad2 (M), both KrasG12D and Mad2 (KM), and control mice lacking transgene expression (CTRL). CTRL and M animals developed no tumors during the aging period of 18\u00a0months, suggesting that elevated levels of Mad2 are not sufficient to induce breast cancer in this model (Figure\u00a01A). As described previously, expression of KrasG12D in the mammary gland results in the development of breast tumors (Podsypanina et\u00a0al., 2008; Figure\u00a01A). Simultaneous overexpression of KrasG12D and Mad2 led to a significant delay in mammary tumor onset compared with KrasG12D alone. Although K mice showed palpable nodules after a median latency of 147\u00a0days (n\u00a0= 107), KM mice survived 221\u00a0days (n\u00a0= 75) without tumors (Figure\u00a01A). In addition, KM mice developed a lower number of tumors per animal compared with K mice (Figure\u00a01B). These findings show that elevated Mad2 levels are detrimental to oncogene-driven mammary tumor initiation. To address the consequences of high Mad2 levels on early events during tumorigenesis, we evaluated the histological changes in mammary glands stained with an HA-specific antibody (to detect exogenous HA-tagged Mad2; Figure\u00a01C) and Kras (Figure\u00a0S1A) prior to formation of palpable tumors. Serial surgeries on different mammary glands of the same animal were performed after 4, 30, and 100\u00a0days of transgene induction. In this 3-month period, young wild-type animals showed no significant changes in tissue architecture (Figures 1C; Figure\u00a0S1A) except estrous cycle-dependent fluctuations in proliferation and apoptosis (Fata et\u00a0al., 2001). To control for these hormonal influences on tissue remodeling, all surgeries were performed at the pro-estrous stage. Overexpression of KrasG12D in the mammary gland led to gradual neoplastic growth starting with a numerical expansion of acinar density 30\u00a0days post-induction. The increase in epithelial cells resulted in the formation of micro-nodules that, by 100\u00a0days, had already expanded into palpable tumors (Figure\u00a0S1A). Upon Mad2 overexpression, an initial enlargement of ducts and a predominant localization of Mad2-positive mitotic cells inside the acinar lumen were observed. The decreased number of Mad2-expressing cells and the return to normal tissue architecture at 100\u00a0days suggested epithelial cell clearance during early days of transgene induction (Figures 1C and 1D; Figures S1A\u2013S1C). These observations are in line with the lack of carcinogenic growth seen in Mad2-overexpressing animals. Morphological examinations of the KM cohort prompted us to partition it into three phenotypic subgroups. All animals started with a normal distribution of Mad2-expressing cells per acinus (average of 38.8% of HA-positive cells at 4\u00a0days of induction) but differed both in the Kras levels and in the expression pattern of Mad2 after 100\u00a0days on doxycycline (Figures 1C and 1D; Figures S1B\u2013S1E). Group A continuously expressed very low amounts of Kras compared with Mad2 and, similar to the M cohort, reduced Mad2-expressing cells during the first 100\u00a0days on doxycycline. After a strong initial luminal filling of mitotic cells at 4\u00a0days, the ductal system regressed to a normal mammary architecture. Groups B and C displayed higher levels of Kras and were prone to acinar hyperplasia at 4\u00a0days. After the expansion period, mammary glands underwent a regression phase leading to an almost complete reconstitution of the normal state after 30\u00a0days on doxycycline. After 3\u00a0months, the mammary glands of Group B showed increased budding and branching from the main ducts, an augmented number of Mad2-expressing cells, and a slight increase in Kras levels. Group C showed no change in the overall percentage of Mad2-expressing cells, whereas total expression levels were reduced and Kras expression substantially augmented (Figures 1C and 1D; Figures S1B\u2013S1E). Phenotypically, group C was reminiscent of the tumorigenic progression observed in the KrasG12D-driven model and had an equally early tumor onset at 165\u00a0days after doxycycline administration, whereas group B developed the first palpable tumors at 233\u00a0days and group A at 313\u00a0days (Figure\u00a01E). Together, these data best fit a model in which high levels of Mad2 have a detrimental effect on mitotic progression, leading to cell depletion. Only in the presence of sufficient amounts of Kras can this phenotype be overcome. During transgene induction, the epithelial cell population can undergo different selective scenarios leading to loss of Mad2-expressing cells in the presence of low Kras levels, tolerance of high Mad2 levels in the presence of high Kras levels, or early selection of cells with lower Mad2 levels. To understand the morphogenetic processes caused by Mad2 overexpression during early pre-malignancy, we examined epithelial cell turnover in\u00a0vivo via quantification of phospho-Histone 3 (pH3) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated d-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Compared with controls, K mice showed an incremented number of pH3-positive cells with a punctate staining pattern at 4\u00a0days, hinting at elevated proliferation (Figures 2A and 2C). In M and KM mice, an increase was also observed, but the staining clearly exhibited morphological features of mitosis. Notably, the majority of pH3-positive cells in the M and KM cohorts were located inside the acinar lumen, suggesting delamination of mitotic cells (Figure\u00a02A). In addition, elevated numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were found in M and KM groups compared with K and CTRL cohorts 4\u00a0days after transgene induction (Figures 2B and 2D; Figure\u00a0S2A) and were clearly associated with Mad2 expression (Figure\u00a0S2B). Together, these results suggest that high Mad2 levels in mammary epithelial cells in\u00a0vivo may lead to mitotic arrest followed by apical extrusion and cell death. However, the presence of Mad2-positive cells in all KM subgroups at 100\u00a0days indicated that a substantial number of cells must have escaped mitotic block and apoptosis. One mechanism to escape mitotic arrest is to progress through mitosis without cytokinesis, otherwise known as mitotic slippage. To evaluate this possibility and its effect on chromosome content, we measured the nuclear size of mammary epithelial cells after 4 and 100\u00a0days of transgene expression. Numerical aberrations in the karyotype have been reported to correlate directly with nuclear size (P\u00e9rez de Castro et\u00a0al., 2013). Mammary cells in KM animals acquired a higher variance of nuclear size compared with K and CTRL mice. KM group A showed no significant changes in nuclear volume. Group B reached the highest nuclear volume on day 4, together with increased cell death (Figures S2A, S2C, and S2D), returning to a less pronounced phenotype after 100\u00a0days of induction (Figure\u00a02E). Together with the development of the first tumor-like nodules, KM group C doubled their nuclear volume at 100\u00a0days (Figure\u00a02E). These results suggest that a fraction of cells escape the block imposed by Mad2 overexpression and accumulate errors during chromosome segregation. In\u00a0vivo analysis of mammary glands following doxycycline administration indicated an increased mitotic index and a possible variance in the genomic content because of Mad2 overexpression. To better understand whether the mitotic arrest induced by high Mad2 was responsible for cell depletion, we used a 3D culture system of primary mammary epithelial cells. 3D culture offers the possibility of recapitulating the growth of mammary acini ex\u00a0vivo and allows the visualization of epithelial tissues in a microscopically accessible context (Jechlinger et\u00a0al., 2009). Both control samples and KrasG12D-expressing cultures showed no evident morphological changes after 36\u00a0hr on doxycycline (Figures 3A and 3B; Figure\u00a0S3A). Mad2 overexpression (in both ColA1-Mad2 and TetO-Mad2 strains; Figures S3B and S3C) led to a dramatic increase in the number of mitotic cells that mostly appeared in the acinar lumen starting 30\u00a0hr post-induction. This phenotype was exacerbated in the combination of Mad2 overexpression and mutant Kras, where the acinar structures were filled with mitotic cells and cell fragments (Figures 3A and 3B; Figure\u00a0S3A). In line with previous findings, the observed phenotype is likely due to mitotic arrest as a consequence of checkpoint overactivation, given that Mad2 overexpression results in an accumulation of Cyclin B (Figures S3D and S3E) and downregulation of Aurora B (Figures S3F and S3G; Kabeche and Compton, 2012, Sotillo et\u00a0al., 2007). To investigate whether the arrest was followed by apoptosis, 3D cultures were stained for cleaved Caspase 3 after 36\u00a0hr on doxycycline. K structures did not exceed the cell turnover seen in control cultures. However, M and KM spheres contained a significantly elevated number of apoptotic cells per acinus (Figures 3A and 3C). Nuclear volume counts after 4\u00a0days on doxycycline indicated that a significant number of M and KM cells became polyploid (Figure\u00a03D). Taken together, the 3D culture system recapitulated the phenotypes seen in\u00a0vivo. Taking advantage of time-lapse imaging, we monitored the fate of single cells expressing Histone2B-GFP in acinar spheres after administration of doxycycline for 30\u00a0hr. Mitotic cell division in control cultures as well as in Kras-expressing spheroids is oriented perpendicularly to the apical and basal membrane within the epithelial layer and is completed within 1\u20132\u00a0hr (Figures 4A and 4C; Figure\u00a0S4A; Movies S1 and S2). However, in M and KM cultures, mitosis was initiated inside the epithelial layer, but cells arrested at metaphase for over 8\u00a0hr in 100% of the cycling cells in M and 91% in KM (Figures 4A and 4C). This prolonged mitotic block led to stepwise delamination until, in some cases, contact with neighboring cells was completely lost. Afterward, cells were either degraded into apoptotic blebs (85% in M and 79% in KM; Figures 4A, center, and 4D) or completed cell division inside the epithelial rim (15% in M and 12% in KM; Figures 4A, bottom, and 4D). In 43% of Mad2 dividing cells and 33.7% of KM, mitotic abnormalities, including chromosome misalignments, lagging chromosomes, and micronuclei formation, were observed (Figures 4B and 4E; Figures S4B\u2013S4D; Movies S3, S4, and S5). These aberrations are likely causes for consequent aneuploidization (Figure\u00a04F) and/or the depletion of Mad2-expressing cells. Deregulation of mitotic checkpoint genes in\u00a0vivo has been shown to increase mitotic errors and is strongly associated with a CIN phenotype in human tumors (Janssen and Medema, 2013). Despite Mad2\u2019s initial detrimental effects, analysis of tumor samples from all three KM subgroups verified the presence of both transgenes (Figures S5A and S5B), and immunohistochemistry for HA revealed Mad2-expressing cells in all tumors analyzed (Figure\u00a0S5C). Nuclear size measurements proved a higher variance and a significant gain in nuclear volume in KM tumor cells compared with K (Figures S5D and S5E). In line with the finding of Kras inducing centrosome abnormalities (Zeng et\u00a0al., 2010), K\u00a0tumors also showed an increase in nuclear variance over control mice (Figure\u00a0S5E). To determine the full extent of Mad2\u2019s effects on karyotype composition and chromosome rearrangements, we performed low-pass, whole-genome sequencing of primary tumors (median coverage 0.11-fold), followed by somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) analysis. On average, genomes of KM tumors were more frequently affected by and had significantly more SCNAs than K tumors (mean 2.70 versus 0.85; Figures 5A and 5B). The most frequent variant types present in either cohort were whole chromosome gains and losses, followed by large partial chromosome gains and losses (Figure\u00a05A). Although chromosomes 2 and 4 were recurrently affected in both cohorts (30% and 25% in K tumors as well as 34.7% and 52% in KM tumors, respectively), additional aneuploidies were present in nearly all other chromosomes of KM tumors (Figure\u00a0S5F). No specific SCNAs were found to occur at a significantly higher frequency in KM versus K tumors, suggesting that, in this model, Mad2 serves to increase the total amount of aneuploidy in the tumor rather than selecting for specific rearrangement patterns. To analyze whether Mad2 influences CIN during tumor growth, we performed time-lapse microscopy of primary tumor cells. Indeed, 30% of KM cells continued to missegregate chromosomes compared with 10% in Kras tumors (Figures 5C and 5D), suggesting that Mad2 overexpression increases CIN prior to tumorigenesis and during tumor cell expansion. To assess the effect of Mad2-induced CIN on tumor phenotype, we analyzed tumor progression and histopathological features of primary tumors. Despite the prolonged tumor onset, K and KM\u00a0cohorts displayed no differences in overall tumor growth (Figure\u00a0S5G) and developed similar histopathological subtypes (Figure\u00a0S5C). The tumor spectrum included mostly solid or solid-papillary carcinomas (88%) that displayed a high number of HA-Mad2-positive cells. A minor fraction of tumors was categorized as tubulo-alveolar carcinomas and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype carcinosarcomas (Rudmann et\u00a0al., 2012) and contained fewer HA-Mad2-positive cells (Figure\u00a0S5C). Although a low number of mice developed lung metastases, the incidence was not altered by Mad2 overexpression (data not shown). The absence of an additional Mad2 effect despite the elevated CIN in the KM tumors suggested that tumorigenesis had so far followed the strong lead of the driving oncogene. Over the past years, it has been argued that the full potential of CIN can only be seen under selective conditions (Chen et\u00a0al., 2012, Chen et\u00a0al., 2015). Here, karyotype diversity can boost the adaptive potential of a cell population and enhance its fitness. We therefore set out to investigate whether the increased aneuploidy in Mad2-expressing tumors would reveal its potential when faced with strong selective pressure such as that seen with oncogene inactivation. Doxycycline was withdrawn in 48 K and 44 KM animals, each of which harbored multiple mammary tumors. In the K cohort, a total of 155 out of 166 tumors completely regressed to a non-palpable state (93.4%), demonstrating that the majority of epithelial cells remained dependent on Kras for maintenance of the transformed state. Strikingly, in the KM cohort, 23 of 108 primary tumors (21.3%) showed no signs of shrinkage, and malignant growth continued in the absence of doxycycline (Figures 5E and 5F). Activation of the same oncogenic pathway has been described as a possible mechanism of doxycycline independence (Podsypanina et\u00a0al., 2008). To exclude the possibility of transgene re-expression, non-regressing tumors were analyzed for Kras and Mad2 transgene expression. Whereas 27.3% of K and 34.8% of KM tumors re-activated the transgenic system (Figure\u00a0S6A), around 70% of persisting tumors remained unaccounted for. In addition, no mutations were found in the endogenous ras genes (data not shown). This finding suggests that genetic heterogeneity most likely had led to the establishment of oncogene-independent subclones, facilitating tumor persistence after transgene de-induction. Her2 is one of the most common oncogenes overexpressed or amplified in human breast cancer (Moody et\u00a0al., 2002, Sanchez-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2014, Stephens et\u00a0al., 2012). To test whether our findings for Kras-driven mammary tumorigenesis also apply to other breast cancer drivers, we crossed Mad2 animals into tetracycline-inducible Her2 mice (Moody et\u00a0al., 2002). Her2 (H)-positive animals developed tumors with a shorter median latency (93\u00a0days, n\u00a0= 60) than the ones observed with Kras (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Similar to the Kras model, overexpression of Mad2 in Her2 animals (HM) led to a significant delay in tumor onset (138\u00a0days, n\u00a0= 73) and a decrease in the overall tumor load per animal (Figures 6A and 6B). Histology 4 and 100\u00a0days following transgene induction revealed that Her2-driven tumorigenesis largely mimicked the continuous proliferation observed in Kras animals. Elevated Mad2 levels in this model resulted in an increase in pH3-positive cells accompanied by a predominant localization of mitotic cells to the acinar lumen (Figures 6C and 6D). The delayed tumor onset observed in the Her2/Mad2 animals might therefore also be a consequence of Mad2-induced mitotic arrest. Unlike the KM model, in which ultimately all tumors were positive for exogenous Mad2, a minor fraction of tumors (18%) in the Her2/Mad2 cohort completely downregulated Mad2 expression (Figure\u00a0S6B). The Her2 model further differed in the appearance of copy number changes. Whereas strong differences were found between K and KM, H and HM tumors showed similar numbers of SCNAs (mean 2.30 versus 2.60), with Mad2-positive tumors tending toward increased numerical aneuploidy compared with Her2 tumors (Figures 6E and 6F; Figure\u00a0S6C). H and HM tumor cells also displayed similar missegregation rates in\u00a0vitro (Figures 6G and 6H). The elevated number of SCNAs seen in Her2 tumors is in line with findings of centrosome abnormalities and increased aneuploidy in MMTV-Her2-induced murine breast cancer (Montagna et\u00a0al., 2002). It is possible that tumorigenesis can only proceed below a certain CIN threshold (Jamal-Hanjani et\u00a0al., 2015, Silk et\u00a0al., 2013), restricting Mad2\u2019s effect to increase SCNAs on Her2 mammary tumors. These results prompted us to investigate whether tumor regression after transgene de-induction was affected in these animals. As seen previously with this model (Moody et\u00a0al., 2002), of 174 Her2-positive tumors, only two tumors failed to fully regress after doxycycline withdrawal (1.15%; Figure\u00a06I). In the HM cohort, a higher number of persistent tumors was detected, with 12 of 144 HM tumors not fully regressing upon inactivation of Her2 and Mad2 (8.33%; Figure\u00a06I). Strikingly, 50% of HM non-regressing tumors re-expressed the oncogene (Figure\u00a0S6D), suggesting that elevated Mad2 levels in the other 50% of Her2 primary tumors also offered a selective benefit to enable the escape from oncogene dependence. The presence of persistent tumors in the HM model was probably not only a result of the induced aneuploidy, given that similar levels of SCNAs were also present in the H tumors that fully regressed. It is possible that tumor cells require a certain time for the acquired CIN to generate and select fitter tumor subclones. Whereas Her2 tumors arose very early (93\u00a0days), Her2/Mad2 tumors needed a longer time to develop (138\u00a0days), allowing sufficient time for the chromosome missegregations to create oncogene-independent subclones. We speculate that the biological context established by the initiating oncogenic drivers as well as the mutational processes at work thereafter are additional determinants of the genetic adaptation. The consequence of chromosome instability on tumor development continues to stand at the center of a scientific debate. Depending on genetic- and tissue-specific contexts, CIN-associated gene de-regulations promote, suppress, or have no effect on spontaneous tumorigenesis (Janssen and Medema, 2013, Zasadil et\u00a0al., 2013). The overexpression of Mad2 is a frequent event in human cancers that has been modeled both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. The induction of Mad2 in adult mouse tissues leads to CIN, tumor initiation (Sotillo et\u00a0al., 2007), and acceleration of KrasG12D-driven lung cancer (Sotillo et\u00a0al., 2010). In this study, we extend this analysis and show that elevated levels of Mad2 in the mammary gland cause a delay in both KrasG12D- and Her2-induced breast cancer. The different outcomes upon Mad2 overexpression in the lung versus the mammary gland might be due to tissue-specific differences in cell homeostasis and signaling. The lung is one of the tissues with the highest incidence of spontaneous tumor formation in mouse models of CIN, suggesting that lung cells are specially sensitive to aneuploidy (Duijf and Benezra, 2013). Alternatively, expression levels of the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) driven by the lung-specific promoter (CCSP) could differ from the mammary-specific MMTV promoter, making it difficult to compare both models. Murine breast cancer models allow multi-sampling of mammary glands during tumor development from the same animal. Taking advantage of this, we follow the transgenic effect in individual animals and demonstrate that early Mad2 overexpression in mammary cells in\u00a0vivo leads to strong mitotic arrest and increased cell death. Moreover, time-lapse imaging of mammary spheroid cultures showed that prolonged mitotic arrest results in apical extrusion and cell degradation inside the lumen. Apical cell shedding is a common mechanism in epithelia to eliminate defective cells (Denning et\u00a0al., 2012, Rosenblatt et\u00a0al., 2001). Both the mitotic arrest and the higher mitotic error rate during the first rounds of division might mark Mad2-expressing cells as aberrant. It is also plausible that cells ultimately undergo anoikis because of delamination (Gilmore, 2005). The signaling pathway responsible for mitotic cell death is still unclear; however, it is possible that Myc contributes to apoptosis after prolonged checkpoint activation, as suggested recently (Topham et\u00a0al., 2015). Strikingly, not all cells expressing Mad2 die. A small percentage of cells is able to overcome the arrest and complete cell division inside the epithelial layer. In all KM and the majority of HM animals, Mad2 expression continues throughout tumorigenesis, leading to the formation of Mad2-positive tumors. The time and route to steady state, however, vary among individuals. When Mad2 expression strongly outweighs Kras (subgroup A), animals show a substantial reduction of Mad2-expressing cells over time. In subgroup B, where initial Kras and Mad2 levels are high, mammary glands can maintain or even increase the number of Mad2-expressing cells. In subgroup C, a reduction of Mad2 levels occurs, whereas Kras increases its expression. The different phenotypes depend on a tight balance between oncogenic and Mad2 signaling. Pro-survival signals downstream of Kras (Pylayeva-Gupta et\u00a0al., 2011) and Her2 (Moasser, 2007) as well as supporting signals from the microenvironment (Radisky, 2012) might thereby promote cell cycle progression. Considering that Mad2 increases karyotype instability, it is possible that CIN-induced genetic changes might also take part in the detrimental effect of early Mad2 expression and contribute to overcoming checkpoint arrest or even subsequently support tumor initiation. Models combining chromosome missegregation with the process of negative selection and tolerance, as seen in the presented mouse models, are therefore good approximations to mimic human tumor growth (Valind et\u00a0al., 2013). An increased occurrence of karyotype aberrations because of Mad2 overexpression was primarily seen in KrasG12D-driven mammary tumors. Mad2-positive tumors markedly outweigh the solely KrasG12D-expressing counterparts in the genomic variance between cells as well as the number and complexity of chromosomal rearrangements. Interestingly, Mad2 did not further increase the high number of structural variants observed in Her2 mammary tumors but caused a slight trend toward whole chromosome gains and losses. Her2 has been shown to cause centrosomal defects and, thus, by itself, interferes with chromosome segregation (Montagna et\u00a0al., 2002). The fact that Mad2\u00a0did not significantly contribute to additional karyotype complexity in the aneuploid Her2 tumors supports the hypothesis that a certain threshold of CIN is permissive for tumor development (Jamal-Hanjani et\u00a0al., 2015, Laughney et\u00a0al., 2015, Silk et\u00a0al., 2013). An alternative theory suggests that the genetic setting shapes initial CIN and aneuploidy tolerance, which, after rounds of negative selection, balances into an optimized equilibrium at a specific aneuploidy index (Laughney et\u00a0al., 2015, Valind et\u00a0al., 2013). Karyotypic heterogeneity can confer genetic flexibility and, in turn, increase the adaptability of a tumor cell population. Here we present in\u00a0vivo evidence that Mad2-induced mitotic aberrations enhance the generation of oncogene-independent tumor subclones in breast cancer. Upon silencing of the driving oncogene, previously Mad2-expressing animals showed a higher percentage of non-regressing tumors in the K and H models. It is startling, however, that, despite the high number of structural variants in both H and HM tumors, the number of non-regressing tumors is much lower than in KM while having similar CIN levels. It may be that, given distinct initiating oncogenes, differing grades of genomic instability are necessary for an oncogene-independent subclonal population to arise. Alternatively, the stochastic appearance of fitness-improving chromosomal changes depends on the time a tumor population has to establish and expand itself. Multi-region sequencing and genomic profiling studies have verified that, although tumor growth originates from early driver mutations, fitness-contributing private alterations arise continuously during tumor development (Sottoriva et\u00a0al., 2015). Therefore, both genetic instability-driving mechanisms and the time for tumor evolution might contribute to the generation of oncogene-independent cells. A previously reported MYC-induced breast cancer model supports this argument. Myc-induced mammary tumors appear at a very long latency compared with Kras and Her2 and are associated with a strong CIN phenotype (McCormack et\u00a0al., 1998). Interestingly, incomplete regression following Myc inactivation is observed in 60% of tumors (Leung et\u00a0al., 2012), whereas simultaneous overexpression of Mad2 in these animals results in a further increase of tumor persistence by 30% (M.M., unpublished data). The effect of transient Mad2 expression on the incidence of oncogene-independent tumors is therefore discernable in three different oncogenic settings, even if the overall adaptive capacity might depend on the initiating oncogene. Taken together, it is becoming clear why the effect of CIN on tumor progression only becomes evident through strong selective pressures. Under such circumstances, the wide distribution of karyotypes promotes gross adaptive leaps (Chen et\u00a0al., 2012, Chen et\u00a0al., 2015, Endesfelder et\u00a0al., 2014). Therefore, it is not surprising that CIN is found to be associated with poor prognosis and contributes to multidrug resistance (Lee et\u00a0al., 2011, Zasadil et\u00a0al., 2013). Their predominant role as evolutionary drivers makes CIN genes important predictive biomarkers in cancer (Carter et\u00a0al., 2006, Habermann et\u00a0al., 2009). Further studies aiming at understanding the contribution of individual CIN genes to oncogene independence will extend our understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity and tumor evolution. Considering the low incidence of oncogene-independent tumors in some oncogenic mouse models, the combination with CIN models might facilitate the identification of escape mechanisms from targeted therapies. The link between karyotypic and mutational changes further complicates the understanding of tumor evolution (Sheltzer et\u00a0al., 2011). The role and effect of CIN-induced genetic changes has still to be determined and is likely to be an important component during tumorigenesis and acquisition of therapeutic resistance. Animals were of mixed background (mainly Friend virus B [FVB]) with a heterozygous genotype: MMTV-rtTA (Gunther et\u00a0al., 2002), TetO-KrasG12D (Fisher et\u00a0al., 2001), TetO-rat-Her2 (Moody et\u00a0al., 2002), HA-tagged-TetO-Mad2 (Sotillo et\u00a0al., 2007), and H2B-GFP (Hadjantonakis and Papaioannou, 2004). ColA1-HA-Mad2 animals were included in the in\u00a0vitro experiments (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Breeding and experimentation was performed at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Monterotondo, with ethical approval from the EMBL animal welfare and ethical review body and in accordance with current Italian legislation (Art. 9; January 27, 1992; no. 116) licensed by the Italian health ministry (Decree no. 233/2011-B). For animal experimentation, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Immunohistochemistry was performed according to Sotillo et\u00a0al. (2007). For antibody details, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Mammary glands were harvested from 8- to 9-week-old female mice and prepared and stained according to published records (Jechlinger et\u00a0al., 2009). The following primary antibodies were used: HA (1:,1000, Covance, MMS-101R), cleaved Caspase3 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, 9661S), LaminB1 (1:500, Abcam, 16048), \u03b1-Tubulin (1:500, Sigma, F2168), and Aurora B (1:150, BD Biosciences, 611082). Imaging of fixed samples was performed on a Leica TCS SP5/SP8 confocal microscope and time-lapse imaging during 20\u00a0hr on an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Ultraview-Vox): 0.3-\u03bcm optical sectioning across a 35-\u03bcm stack, 5 frames/hr. Volocity version 6.2 (Improvision, PerkinElmer) served for image acquisition and analysis. Harvested tumors were digested with 150\u00a0U/ml Collagenase type 3 (Worthington, CLS3) and 20\u00a0mg/ml Liberase Blendzyme 2 (Roche, 11988425001) for 1\u00a0hr, washed with PBS, and dissociated with 0.25% Trypsin (Life Technologies, 25200056). Cells were cultured on 8-well chambered coverglass (Thermo Scientific, 155411) in serum-free mammary epithelial basal medium (MEBM) with supplements (Lonza, CC-3150) with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml doxycycline. Time-lapse imaging during 15\u00a0hr was performed on a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5): 2-\u03bcm optical sectioning across an 8-\u03bcm stack, 30 frames/hr. Volocity version 6.2 (Improvision, PerkinElmer) served for image analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from cells using the DNA blood mini kit (QIAGEN). Library preparation and low-coverage sequencing were pursued on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) using 50-base pair single-end reads as described previously (Mardin et\u00a0al., 2015). Reads were aligned to the mm10 build of the mouse reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA; version 0.7.10). Tumor coverage files were log2-normalized to mouse genomic DNA derived from normal mammary tissue. Circular binary segmentation (CBS; R package) was applied, and somatic copy number alterations were categorized as follows. Whole chromosome gains/losses were defined as chromosome-wide shifts in the segmentation of a chromosome, whereas partial chromosome gains/losses entailed changes spanning at least one-fifth of the chromosome. Focal amplifications and deletion encompassed events smaller than this. When the number of copy number state switches on a chromosome exceeded ten, they were called as gross chromosomal rearrangements. Statistical analysis was carried out using Prism 6 (GraphPad). p values were as follows: \u2217p\u00a0< 0.05, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.001, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.

Huynh and Vale reconstitute Rab6 regulation of BICD2-mediated dynein transport in vitro and show that disease-associated mutations in BICD2 cause an increase in retrograde transport.\n", "fulltext": "The retrograde motor cytoplasmic dynein is involved in a host of cellular activities, including the trafficking of diverse cargos such as organelles, vesicles, and mRNA as well as mitotic spindle alignment and chromosome positioning (Allan, 2011). In contrast to yeast dynein, which can achieve long-range transport on its own, mammalian dynein must form a tripartite complex with the 1.2-MD dynactin complex and an adapter protein to move processively along microtubules.A number of different adaptor proteins that join dynein and dynactin into an active motile complex have been identified. For example, bicaudal D2 (BICD2), one of the best-studied dynein adaptors, interacts with the small GTPase Rab6, which is found on early endosomes and ER\u2013Golgi vesicles. BICD2 is thought to be autoinhibited through an interaction between its C-terminal coiled coil domain with the N-terminal domain of the protein, which prevents it from associating with its other partners, including dynein. Autoinhibition is thought to be relieved by binding to an effector, such as Rab6a in its GTP-bound form; however, evidence for this model is lacking.BICD2 recently emerged as a genetic locus associated with dominant spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder characterized by the degeneration of anterior horn cells and leading to eventual muscle atrophy and weakness.. The effects that these point mutations have on BICD2\u2019s ability to function as a dynein adaptor are not known, although overexpression of these mutants has been reported to cause Golgi fragmentation and changes in BICD2 localization in cultured cells. Interestingly, point mutations in the tail region of heavy chain 1 of cytoplasmic dynein have been associated with another form of SMA, SMA-LED1. These mutations were reported to cause an increase in the affinity between the motor and BICD2 and a decrease in dynein\u2013dynactin processivity.Here, using biochemical and single-molecule motility assays, we demonstrate that BICD2 disease mutations cause a gain of function in the motility of DDB complexes both in vitro and in cells. In addition, we show that the expression of BICD2 mutants in neurons leads to impaired neurite outgrowth. These results indicate that the SMA BICD2 mutants hyperactivate dynein motility, a gain of function consistent with a dominant genetic trait that could explain the gradual loss of motor neuron function in SMA.BICD2 is composed of five coiled coil domains that can be grouped into three distinct regions (Fig. 1 A). The C-terminal region of the protein is the most well-conserved and contains the binding site to different partners localized to different cargos, including the small GTPase Rab6a. An N-terminal construct of the protein, which spans residues 25\u2013400 (BICD225\u2013400), was shown to be more effective in binding dynein\u2013dynactin in cell lysate pull-down assays compared with autoinhibited full-length protein. We replicated these findings; the difference in dynactin binding was especially striking, exhibiting about a 10-fold reduction for the BICD2FL pull-down compared with BICD225\u2013400, whereas dynein was two- to threefold lower (Fig. S1, A and B).We next tested whether the autoinhibited state of BICD2FL could be activated by Rab6a. We added purified recombinant Rab6a\u2013Q72L, which is locked in a GTP-bound state (hereafter referred to as Rab6aGTP), to porcine brain lysate and performed pull-downs using BICD2 as bait. With increasing Rab6aGTP, there was a corresponding increase of dynein and dynactin in the BICD2FL pull-down. Conversely, the GDP-bound mutant of Rab6a (Rab6a\u2013T27N, hereafter Rab6aGDP) appeared to somewhat reduce the pull-down of dynein and dynactin (Fig. 1 B). Rab6aGTP also was detected in the pellet fraction in these experiments, whereas Rab6aGDP was absent (Fig. S1 C). A densitometric analysis shows a 2.5-fold increase in dynein enrichment and a 10-fold increase in dynactin at the highest Rab6aGTP concentration used (Fig. S1 D). The greater pull-down of dynactin relative to dynein might reflect an interaction of the Rab6aGTP\u2013BicD2 complex with dynactin alone. Together, these results indicate that Rab6aGTP is able to activate full-length BICD2 and enhance its ability to bind to dynein and dynactin.To further examine whether Rab6aGTP can activate BICD2FL and enable dynein\u2013dynactin motility, we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to visualize DDB motility on microtubules. Purified dynein and dynactin from mammalian RPE-1 cell lysates were incubated with similar concentrations of either superfolder-GFP (sfGFP)\u2013fused BICD225\u2013400 or BICD2FL, and the numbers of moving motor complexes were analyzed via kymographs (Fig. 1 C). This single-molecule in vitro assay revealed that the truncated BICD225\u2013400 produced more processive dynein\u2013dynactin complexes when compared with BICD2FL, which is again consistent with the idea that BICD2FL is autoinhibited (Fig. 1, C and D; and Video 1). The addition of Rab6aGTP to BICD2FL and dynein\u2013dynactin resulted in a three- to fourfold increase in the number of moving DDBFL complexes on microtubules compared with Rab6aGDP or the individual DDB components alone (Fig. 1 E). In contrast, Rab6aGTP neither increased the motility of DDB25\u2013400 (Fig. S1 E) nor interacted with BICD225\u2013400 (Fig. S1 F). Collectively, these results suggest that Rab6aGTP is capable of alleviating the autoinhibition of full-length BICD2 and activating its ability to form processive DDB complexes.Next, using our assays, we sought to examine the effects of three BICD2FL mutants identified in patients afflicted with DC-SMA/SMA-LED2 (S107L, N188T, and I189F) and a mutant (F739I) that is equivalent to the Drosophila melanogaster F684I mutant that produces a bicaudal phenotype (Fig. 1 A; Mohler and Wieschaus, 1986; Wharton and Struhl, 1989). The latter mutation has been shown to have higher affinity toward dynein compared with WT and was proposed to be more readily activated upon binding to cargo. All four of the mutated residues are highly conserved in the BICD protein family.In a brain lysate pull-down assay with Rab6aGTP, the four BICD2FL mutants recruited more dynein and dynactin compared with WT BICD2FL, with the greatest difference being observed in dynactin binding (Figs. 2 A and S2 B). Weak binding of dynein\u2013dynactin also was observed with Rab6aGDP or without added Rab6a (Fig. 2, A and B; and Fig. S2, A andB). It is possible that endogenous Rab6a in the brain lysate might be responsible for this weak BICD2 mutant-specific pull-down or that other factors in the lysate allow for a loss of autoinhibition. In the single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence assay in the presence of Rab6aGTP, three of the BICD2FL mutants (N188T, I189F, and S107L) showed a statistically significant 20\u201330% increase in the number of motile DDB complexes compared with WT BICD2FL (Fig. 2 C). Neither the velocity (Fig. 2 D) nor run-length (Fig. 2 E and Fig. S2 C) of DDB was different between WT and mutant BICD2FL. In the presence of Rab6aGDP, however, motility was much lower, and no statistical difference was observed between mutant and WT BICD2FL (Fig. S2 D). No significant difference also was observed in the number of motile DDB complexes formed by WT and mutant truncated BICD225\u2013400 (Fig. 2 F). WT and mutant BICD225\u2013400 also pulled down similar amounts of dynein and dynactin (Fig. S2 E). Collectively, these results indicate the point mutations in BICD2FL enhance Rab6aGTP-dependent activation from the autoinhibited state, producing more motile DDBFL complexes but not altering the measured parameters of DDBFL motility.The retrograde transport of native membranous cargos involves prenylated, membrane-bound Rab6a interacting with BICD2. We sought to recapitulate this cargo motility in vitro using recombinant Rab6aGTP or Rab6aGDP covalently linked to large unilamellar vesicles via maleimide lipids (Fig. 3 A). With Rab6aGTP on the liposomes, we observed the frequent binding and movement of liposomes along microtubules in the presence of dynein, dynactin, and BICD2FL (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, motility events were only rarely observed with Rab6aGDP-coated liposomes (Fig. 3, B and C; and Video 2). Next, we examined the BICD2FL mutants in the Rab6aGTP liposome motility assay. All four mutants produced significantly more moving Rab6aGTP liposomes compared with WT BICD2FL (Fig. 3 D). The velocities of WT and mutant BICD2 were similar (500 nm/s; Fig. S2 F) and slightly higher than the single-molecule velocities. Thus, consistent with the single-molecule motility assays, the BICD2 mutants hyperactivated dynein\u2013dynactin motility in an in vitro cargo transport assay.To examine the behavior of WT and mutant BICD2 in cells, we turned to a previously established inducible cargo trafficking assay. In this assay, FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB) fused to GFP and a peroxisome localization sequence is coexpressed with BICD2 fused to FK506 binding protein (FKBP; Fig. 4 A). As shown previously, an N-terminal construct of BICD2 (BICD21\u2013594-FKBP) in the presence of rapamycin increased retrograde transport of peroxisomes and produced significant clustering of the GFP\u2013peroxisome signal around the perinuclear region. This longer construct includes coiled coil 2 but still lacks the C-terminal region needed for autoinhibition. In contrast, the autoinhibited BICD2FL-FKBP construct displayed a more dispersed peroxisome signal (Fig. 4 B).We next tested the mutant BICD2FL constructs in this inducible peroxisome motility assay. To quantify the degree of peroxisome clustering due to minus end\u2013directed motility, we used a previously created plugin for the image analysis software Icy that calculates the fraction of the cell area containing 90% of the total peroxisome GFP signal; increased transport to the centrosome results in a more clustered signal, and thus 90% of the signal occupies less area. In the absence of rapamycin, the clustering values for the WT and mutants were similar (55%; Fig. 4 D). With the addition of rapamycin to cells expressing BICD21\u2013594, the peroxisomes occupied 20% of the cell area compared with 40% expressing autoinhibited BICD2FL. The four mutants tested in the BICD2FL construct, while not achieving the same degree of peroxisome clustering observed for BICD21\u2013594, showed an increase in the compaction of the peroxisome signal compared with WT BICD2FL (Fig. 4 D). Thus, similar to the in vitro data, the mutant BICD2FL proteins hyperactivated dynein\u2013dynactin in a cellular context and more efficiently transported peroxisomes toward the centrosomes.We also tested whether localizing Rab6aGTP containing a peroxisome-targeting sequence (Rab6aGTP\u2013PEX) could increase the activity of FKBP\u2013BICD2FL. However, we found that Rab6aGTP\u2013PEX alone (without FKBP\u2013BICD2FL coexpression) was sufficient to cluster peroxisomes, presumably through the recruitment of endogenous BICD2 and then dynein\u2013dynactin (Fig. S3, A\u2013C). Thus, targeting of Rab6aGTP on peroxisome membranes is sufficient for the recruitment and activation of endogenous BICD2 to produce dynein-mediated transport of peroxisomes.We next examined whether the hyperactivating BICD2FL mutants affected neurite outgrowth and neuronal morphology. Rat hippocampal neurons, dissected from embryonic day 18 tissue and grown in culture, were transfected with either WT or mutant mouse mCherry\u2013BICD2FL constructs along with soluble GFP to visualize the cell body and neurites (Fig. 5 A). Three days later, dual mCherry- and GFP-positive neurons were then scored for the length of their longest process as well as the total length of all processes. Cells transfected with WT mCherry\u2013BICD2FL and GFP showed similar neurite lengths compared with cells transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 5, B and C). This result is consistent with previous work showing that overexpression of WT BICD2 in either hippocampal or rat dorsal root ganglion neurons does not affect axon length or overall neurite length. However, cells transfected with the disease mutant BICD2FL constructs for 3 d showed a 40% decrease in both the length of the longest neurite as well as an overall decrease in total neurite length after 3 d (Fig. 5, B and C). This result is similar to what was reported when the BICD-related protein BICDR-1, which forms a higher velocity DDB complex, is overexpressed in neurons.. The number of long (>15-\u00b5m) processes emanating from the cell body was not affected by the BICD2 mutants (Fig. S3 D). The Drosophila mutant (F739I) also showed a significant reduction in total neurites, but not in the axon length (Fig. S3, E and F). These results demonstrate that mutations in BICD2 affect the process of neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons in culture.In conclusion, our vitro and cell-based assays recapitulate Rab6aGTP-dependent activation of DDB motility and reveal that three BICD2 disease-associated mutations and one Drosophila mutant all display a similar phenotype of eliciting more dynein\u2013dynactin motility. These effects were not evident with the Rab6a-independent, constitutively active BICD225\u2013400 construct. These results suggest a scenario in which the mutants lower the energy barrier for Rab6aGTP to convert the autoinhibited BICD2FL into an active conformation. Future work can test this possibility by using assays that probe the conformational states of BICD2FL.Previous cell-based models have suggested that BICD2 disease mutants may have a dominant-negative effect on dynein function, resulting in disrupted Golgi morphology. Although we cannot rule out dominant-negative effects that cannot be measured with our assays, our data suggest that the mutants produce a dominant-positive effect leading to enhanced dynein cargo transport. Although subtle (25% increase in motile DDB complexes), such effects may perturb transport in an axon (which can be up to 1 m long in a motor neuron) over time.To explain the SMA-LED2 disease phenotype, we propose a model in which mutant BICD2 increases dynein activation and leads to an imbalance between anterograde and retrograde transport (Fig. 5 D). The shift toward dynein transport could produce a decrease in the delivery of cargo to the nerve terminal, which in turn could lead to a gradual decline in function of neurons with long axons. This model is congruous with experimental data from transgenic mouse models. BICD2-null mice possess a normal spinal cord and their motor neurons exhibit no evidence of abnormal retrograde transport. These mice, which die at around p30, do not display a SMA phenotype, suggesting that the absence or inhibition of BICD2 activity cannot explain the disease etiology. In contrast, transgenic mice expressing the shorter, more active N-terminal construct of BICD2 were impaired in retrograde axonal transport and Golgi fragmentation, presumably through a dominant-negative effect of activating dynein and dynactin without cargo and causing its accumulation in the cell body. Curiously, however, these mice, which live up to 2 yr, also did not develop any motor abnormalities. The phenotypic differences in mice expressing the N-terminal construct of BICD2 compared with haploid S107L, N188T, and I189F mutations suggests that the C terminus of the BICD2 protein that interacts with cargo is necessary for contributing to the SMA disease phenotype.Recently, Hoang et al. (2017) showed that disease-related mutants in the human dynein heavy chain, including three mutations associated with SMA, exhibited normal DDB complex formation and velocity, but displayed a 60%\u201370% reduction in processivity. These results differ from those described for the SMA BICD2 mutants, which show no change in processivity and a gain-of-function increase in the amount of retrograde transport. Taken together, these studies on dynein and BICD2 mutations reveal multiple ways in which changes in motor activity can affect can affect the homeostasis and function of neurons in SMA.The cDNAs for mouse BICD2 (GenBank accession no. AJ250106.1) and mouse Rab6a (GenBank accession no. BC019118.1) were obtained from the Thermo Fisher Scientific MGC collection. BICD2 N-terminal constructs were cloned into a pet28a vector containing an N-terminal 6xHis-strepII-sfGFP tag. Full-length BICD2 WT and mutant constructs were cloned into a pFastbac vector containing either an N-terminal StrepII-sfGFP or StrepII-SNAPf tag followed by a C-terminal 6xHis tag for tandem purification. Rab6a was cloned into a pGEX vector containing an N-terminal GST tag followed by a PreScission protease cleavage site. The Rab6a constructs span the GTPase domain of Rab6a (aa 8\u2013195), followed by a short linker and either a KCK motif for maleimide labeling purposes (liposome experiment) or a His10 tag. Point mutations for both the BICD2 constructs and the Rab6a GDP/GTP (Q72L and T27N, respectively) constructs were created by the protocol of Phusion.For the cell-based peroxisome assay, the sequence spanning aa 1\u201342 of human PEX3 was synthesized via a gBlock (IDT) and was cloned into the N-terminal of a modified eGFP vector, followed by a C-terminal FRB sequence. BICD2 constructs for this assay were cloned into a pHR vector containing an N-terminal mCherry sequence and C-terminal FKBPf36v sequence. The Rab6a\u2013PEX construct was constructed by fusing the PEX3 sequence to the C terminus of Rab6a lacking the cysteines for lipidation (1\u2013203 aa). An mTagBFP2 was fused to the N terminus of this construct as well. For neuron expression, BICD2 was cloned into an N-terminal pmCherry vector.BICD2 N-terminal and Rab6a constructs were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 RIPL from Agilent. Cells were grown in LB at 37\u00b0C until growth reached 0.6 OD280. The temperature was then lowered to 18\u00b0C, and cells were induced overnight with 0.5 mM IPTG. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in either strep lysis buffer (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF) for BICD2 or PBS containing 5% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF for Rab6a. Cells were lysed using an Emulsiflex press (Avestin) and clarified at 40,000 g for 60 min. Lysates were bound to either Strep-Tactin Superflow Plus resin (QIAGEN) or GST Sepharose 4B (GE Lifesciences). Beads were then washed extensively, and the bound protein was eluted with 3 mM desthiobiotin in lysis buffer (BICD2) or via overnight cleavage with PreScission (Rab6a).BICD2 full-length constructs were purified from SF9 cells and purified using tandem purification. Bacmids isolated from DH10Bac cells were transfected into SF9 cells. P2 virus was used to infect SF9 cells grown in shaker flasks to a density of 2 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. After 60 h of infection, cells were harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in NiNTA lysis buffer (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM \u03b2ME) and lysed using an Emulsiflex. The lysate was clarified at 40,000 g for 1 h and bound to NiNTA resin from QIAGEN. After extensively washing with lysis buffer, cells were eluted with lysis buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The eluted material was then diluted to lower the imidazole concentration to 100 mM, and bound to Strep-Tactin beads. The beads were then washed with lysis buffer and eluted with lysis buffer containing 3 mM desthio-biotin. After elution, proteins were concentrated and injected onto either a Superose 6 10/300GL column (BICD2 constructs) or a S200 10/300GL column (Rab6a) from GE Healthcare. Gel filtration buffer was composed of 30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated and then flash frozen. For SNAP-fusion constructs, purified proteins were bound to Strep-Tactin beads and incubated at a 2:1 ratio of SNAP-TMR Star:Protein on ice for 1 h. Beads were briefly washed in the gel filtration buffer, and the protein was eluted with 3 mM desthiobiotin in gel filtration buffer.Dynein and dynactin were prepared from RPE-1 cells. Fifteen 15-cm dishes of RPE-1 cells were grown to 80%\u2013900% confluency and then washed with PBS. The cells were then harvested using a cell scraper and pelleted at 500 g for 5 min. They were then resuspended in 2.5 ml buffer A (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol) along with 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysate was clarified at 266,000 g and diluted to a volume of 25 ml using buffer A containing 1 mM PMSF and 5 mM DTT to reach a final Triton X-100 concentration of 0.1%. Strep-Tactin Sepharose (GE Healthcare) bound to purified StrepII-SNAP-FIP3 was added to the lysate and incubated for 1 h. The beads were then washed four times with buffer A containing 5 mM DTT and 0.1% NP-40. Buffer A containing an additional 300 mM NaCl was then added to the beads to form a 50% slurry and incubated on ice for 10 min to elute the dynein and dynactin bound to FIP3. This slurry was then passed through a 0.22-\u00b5m filter to remove the beads. An equal volume of 50% Strep-Tactin Sepharose was added to this elution and allowed to gently mix for 30 min at 4\u00b0C to remove any remaining StrepII-SNAP-FIP3. The slurry was then filtered again and then diluted with buffer A to reach a final NaCl concentration of 200 mM. Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 6%, and the dynein and dynactin were then flash frozen as aliquots.Pull-downs were performed as previously described. 500 \u00b5l clarified porcine brain lysate in buffer A (30 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, and 10% glycerol) was added to 80 \u00b5l of a 50% suspension of Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) along with 100 nM of the BICD2 construct to be tested. To this, 0.1% of NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 mM DTT were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. The beads were then pelleted and washed four times with buffer A containing 0.1% NP-40 and 5 mM DTT. The proteins were then eluted using SDS loading buffer and resolved on an acrylamide gel (Invitrogen). For experiments in which Rab6a was supplemented, the appropriate amount of recombinant Rab6a protein was added before the 4\u00b0C incubation step and processed in the same fashion.The SDS-PAGE gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot system from Invitrogen. Western blotting was performed using TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T). Membranes were blotted for 1 h at RT with 5% milk in TBS-T, followed by a 1-h primary antibody incubation. Antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-p150 (clone 12, 1:250; BD), mouse anti-dynein intermediate chain (clone 74.1, 1:1,000; EMD Millipore), mouse anti-6xHis (1:1,000; Roche), and mouse anti-Rab6a (ab55660, 1:500; Abcam). Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and then incubated with a secondary antibody for 1 h at RT. Secondary antibodies were anti\u2013mouse-800 or anti\u2013rabbit-680 (1:10,000; Molecular Probes). Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and then imaged using an Odyssey Clx Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Quantification of band intensity was performed using ImageJ\u2019s (National Institutes of Health) gel analysis feature. P-values were calculated using a one-sample t test with a hypothetical mean of 1.Liposomes were prepared from a mixture of lipids dissolved in chloroform at (82.4% POPC, 15% POPS, 2.5% 18:1 PE MCC, and 0.1% rhodamine PE; Avanti). After mixing, they were dried under a constant stream of argon and then desiccated in vacuum overnight. The lipid film was then resuspended with buffer A without glycerol and passed 25 times through an extruder containing a 200-nm pore size polycarbonate filter. A 3:1 ratio of Rab6a to maleimide lipid was then mixed together and incubated overnight. The next day, DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mM to quench the reaction, and the liposomes were pelleted at 160,000 g for 20 min to remove unlabeled Rab6a. The pellet was then washed and resuspended with buffer A.Microtubules were prepared as previously described. Unlabeled tubulin was mixed with biotinylated tubulin and Alexa-640-labeled tubulin at a ratio of 10:2:2 in BRB80 (80 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM MgCl2). 5 mM GTP was added and the mixture was incubated in a 37\u00b0C water bath for 10 min before adding 20 \u00b5M Taxol and incubated for an additional 50 min at 37\u00b0C. Microtubules were spun over a 25% sucrose cushion at 160,000 g for 10 min in a tabletop centrifuge before use.DDB complexes were formed in a 30-\u00b5l reaction volume containing \u223c20 nM recombinant BICD2, \u223c0.15 mg/ml of dynein/dynactin, and buffer A along with 0.1 mg/ml Biotin-BSA, 0.5% pluronic acid F-127, and 0.2 mg/ml \u03ba-casein (buffer B). The proteins were mixed and incubated on ice for 20 min before use. In experiments in which Rab6a was also included, the respective construct was added to a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M. Flow chambers with attached microtubules were performed as described (Schroeder and Vale, 2016). A 1:4 or 1:5 dilution of the DDB complex in buffer B was then added in presence of 1 mM ATP and the Trolox/PCA/PCD oxygen scavenging system. For processivity experiments, a SNAP-BICD2 construct labeled with the TMR-Star fluorophore from NEB was used. Because the run lengths using buffer B tended to span the entire lengths of our microtubules, we added 15 mM of KCl to buffer B (termed buffer C) for measurement of processivity. The increased amount of salt in buffer C reduced the run length for DDB (4 \u00b5m) so that it could be measured more accurately on microtubules (mean length of 16 \u00b5m used in these measurements).For liposome assays, the same components as in the aforementioned DDB mixture were mixed in a tube, along with either Rab6aGTP or Rab6aGDP liposomes. The liposomes were diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 \u00b5M total lipid. After incubation, the solution was flowed in undiluted into an imaging chamber after addition of 1 mM ATP and Trolox/PCA/PCD. The amount of BICD2\u2013GFP fluorescence on the liposomes was used to determine the mean number of molecules bound to each liposome by comparing it to that of single GFP molecules captured via biotin-anti-GFP stuck onto a coverslip coated with streptavidin. Fluorescence intensities were measured by integrating the average fluorescence intensity over five frames at 200-ms exposure and quantified with the FiJi plugin Spot Intensity Analysis (http://imagej.net/Spot_Intensity_Analysis). Liposome GFP fluorescence (bound to glass) was normalized to single GFP fluorescent yielded an average of 6.01 BICD2 molecules per Rab6aGTP liposomes (n = 6,000 intensity measurements of single GFP and n = 728 intensity measurement of BICD2\u2013GFP on liposomes).Total internal reflection fluorescence images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse TE200-E microscope equipped with an Andor iXon electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera, a 100\u00d7 1.49 NA objective, and MicroManager software. Exposures of 100 or 200 ms with a frame interval of 1 per second for 300 s was typically used for the acquisition. All assays were performed at RT.U2OS cells from ATCC were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 1\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. Cells were seeded in glass-bottom 96-well plates and were at 40% confluence on the day of transfection. Cells were transfected with TransIT Lt1 as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with a combination of the PEX\u2013eGFP\u2013FRB, mCherry\u2013BICD2\u2013FKBP, and PEX\u2013Rab6a plasmids and incubated overnight. The next day, 1 \u00b5M rapamycin or DMSO was added to cells and allowed to incubate at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 10 min before the end of this incubation, Cell Mask Far Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added (0.5\u00d7 of the manufacturer\u2019s solution) to stain the plasma membrane. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA at RT, followed by extensive washing with PBS. Cells were imaged at RT using an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope using a 0.75 NA 40\u00d7 air objective, Andor Xyla camera, and Micro-Manager software.Primary hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from tissue from embryonic day 18 (E18) rat brains that were shipped overnight on ice from BrainBits. Cells were prepared according to provider\u2019s instructions. Briefly, the tissue was incubated with a 2 mg/ml solution of papain in Hibernate E without calcium (BrainBits) for 10 min at 30\u00b0C. The tissue was then triturated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette for 1 min, and then large tissue pieces were allowed to settle for 1 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 200 g for 1 min to collect cells. After removal of most of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended with 1 ml NbActiv1 and the cells were counted after staining with Trypan Blue (1:5 dilution). 50,000 cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine/laminin coated round coverslips (Corning BioCoat) placed into wells of a 24-well plate.One day after plating, neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Each transfection reaction contained 1 \u00b5g total plasmid DNA along with 4 \u00b5l Lipofectamine reagent incubated together for 20 min at RT. Media from the neurons was then removed and saved, and fresh NbActiv was added to the wells along with the transfection mixture. After 2.5 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2, the neurons were washed with NbActiv, and the original conditioned media was added back. Cells were fixed 3 d after transfection using 4% PFA for 20 min at RT. After washing, the coverslips were mounted onto slides using VECTASHIELD (Vector Labs). Neurons were imaged for both soluble GFP and mCherry\u2013BICD2 signal at RT using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a 0.5 NA 20\u00d7 air objective, a C4742-98 charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu), and Micro-Manager software.Kymographs were created from the single-molecule or liposome movies using ImageJ. The number of runs per micrometer of MT per unit of time was obtained from these kymographs, with each run being scored if it was >1 \u00b5m in length. P-values were calculated using an unpaired t test. The cumulative frequency was used for analysis of run lengths, as previously described. The one-cumulative frequency distribution was fitted with a one-phase exponential decay for run lengths of >1 \u00b5M, as runs shorter than this were undersampled or difficult to measure given our imaging conditions.The images acquired from fixed U2OS cells were processed and analyzed using the Compaction Profiler plugin previously developed for Icy software. In brief, the fluorescent signal from the GFP channel corresponding to peroxisomes was detected after masking the shape of cell via the CellMask channel and quantified using the Spot Detector plugin in Icy. The detected fluorescence data were then passed along to the Compaction Profiler plugin, which then calculated the area of a region of interest inside the cell that represents 90% of the total fluorescence signal. A higher degree of clustering results in a smaller calculated area, whereas a more diffusive signal yields a larger area. P-values were calculated using an unpaired t test.Neurite lengths were measured using the soluble GFP signal from the transfected plasmid. Acquired images were processed via ImageJ. The background was subtracted using the default setting, followed by a median filter with a value of 2.0. The images were adjusted for brightness and contrast and the ImageJ plugin NeuronJ was then used to trace all neurites, including branches from individual neurite. The longest neurite from a cell was also identified and measured. P-values were calculated using an unpaired t test.Fig. S1 shows a comparison of a brain lysate pull-down between BICD225\u2013400 and BICD2FL, a Rab6a blot for the titration experiment in Fig. 1, along with the quantification of dynein intermediate chain and p150 intensity for Rab6aGTP, single-molecule quantification of BICD225\u2013400 with or without Rab6a, and a GST pull-down showing Rab6a binding to BICD2FL but not the truncated BICD2.

The present study was performed to investigate the existence of an association between CFI genetic polymorphisms and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 100 patients diagnosed with VKH syndrome and 300 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Two milliliters of peripheral blood were collected in a sterile anticoagulative tube. CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY technology. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using a \u03c72 test. The analyses were stratified for recurrent status, complicated cataract status, and steroid-sensitive status.\n\n\nResults\nNo significant association was found between CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms and VKH syndrome. However, patients with recurrent VKH syndrome had lower frequencies of the G allele and GG homozygosity in CFI-rs7356506 when compared to the controls (p=0.016, odds ratio [OR]=0.429, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.212\u20130.871; p=0.014, OR=0.364, 95% CI=0.158\u20130.837, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant decreases in the frequencies of the G allele and GG homozygosity in CFI-rs7356506 in patients with VKH syndrome with complicated cataract compared to the controls (p<0.001, OR=0.357, 95% CI=0.197\u20130.648; p<0.001, OR=0.273, 95% CI=0.135\u20130.551, respectively). Nevertheless, no significant association with patients with VKH syndrome in steroid-sensitive statuses was detected for CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results indicate that CFI polymorphisms are not significantly associated with VKH syndrome; nevertheless, we identified a trend for the association of CFI-7356506 with VKH syndrome that depends on the recurrent status and the complicated cataract status but not on the steroid-sensitive status.\n\n", "fulltext": "Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, one of the most common types of panuveitis in China, is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by bilateral, chronic, diffuse granulomatous panuveitis associated with auditory, neurologic, and cutaneous involvement. VKH syndrome is not associated with mortality; however, the development of VKH syndrome may result in long-term blinding complications, including complicated cataracts, secondary glaucoma, and subretinal neovascularization or proliferation. The vision-threatening complications often occur during the recurrent stage. Iwahashi et al. reported that 25.5% of patients with VKH syndrome in Japan exhibited recurrent inflammation. Sakata and associates reported that 79% of Brazilian patients with VKH syndrome given early high-dose corticosteroids evolved to chronic-recurrent inflammation. Complicated cataract, which has a reported prevalence of 42% in patients with VKH syndrome, is the most common complication of VKH syndrome. Quek et al. identified recurrent inflammation as a critical poor prognostic factor for cataract surgery in VKH syndrome. In addition, the recurrence of VKH syndrome inflammation gives rise to longer courses of therapy with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, elevating the risk of side effects. The specific etiology of VKH syndrome is unclear, although it has been speculated that VKH syndrome pathogenesis involves autoimmune mechanisms, genetic factors, and infection. Previous studies suggested that VKH syndrome is mediated by an autoimmune response directed against melanocytes. VKH syndrome with an underlying genetic predisposition typically occurs more frequently in pigmented individuals, such as Chinese, Japanese, Hispanics, and Indians, and is rare in Caucasians. Furthermore, recent genetic surveys of VKH syndrome have shown numerous immune-associated genes including the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system (HLA-DRB4, Gene ID: 3126; HLA-DRB1, Gene ID: 3123, OMIM 142857), programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, Gene ID:5133, OMIM 600244), interleukins (IL-12B, Gene ID: 3593, OMIM 161561; IL-12RB1, Gene ID: 3594, OMIM 601604; IL-17F, Gene ID: 112744, OMIM 606496), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF, Gene ID: 4282, OMIM 153620), Fc receptor-like 3 (FCRL3, Gene ID: 115352, OMIM 606510), and osteopontin (OPN, Gene ID: 6696, OMIM 166490). In addition, Hou et al. revealed a decreased frequency of the C4 gene copy number determined with real-time PCR in patients with VKH syndrome. Yang et al. demonstrated higher frequencies of the G allele of the CFH-rs800292 in patients with non-infection intermediate and posterior uveitis using TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assays. However, to date, an association between SNPs in CFI and VKH syndrome has not yet been reported. The complement system is a critical component of the innate immune system and is involved in regulating various immunological and inflammatory processes. Previous genetic studies of the complement system have identified several associated intraocular inflammatory diseases, including uveitis, pathological myopia, and age-related macular degeneration. Ocular complement activation via the alternative pathway contributes to the development of experimental autoimmune anterior uveitis (EAAU) in melanin-associate antigen (MAA)-sensitized Lewis rats, whereas complement system depletion in the host can mediate inhibition of EAAU. Complement factor H (CFH, Gene ID: 3075, OMIM 134370), complement factor B (CFB, Gene ID: 629, OMIM 138470), complement factor I (CFI, Gene ID: 3426, OMIM 217030), and component 2 (C2, Gene ID: 717, OMIM 613927) have been shown to be associated with acute anterior uveitis (AAU). To the best of our knowledge, only one study, by Hou and associates, identified a decreased copy number of C4 in patients with VKH syndrome using TaqMan real-time PCR technology and concluded that C4 might be an important factor in the development of this disease. However, the direct role of component system in the pathogenesis mechanisms of VKH syndrome has not yet been established. Recently, we described a significant association between CFI-rs7356506 and the development of AAU. Our findings revealed an increased frequency of the A allele and AA genotype in Chinese patients with AAU. In the genotype\u2013phenotype analysis, we showed that gender and HLA-B27 status influenced the susceptibility to inherit the CFI risk alleles. On this basis, we hypothesized that CFI- rs7356506 might be associated with other types of uveitis, such as VKH syndrome. In this study, we aimed to investigate an association of CFI-rs7356506 gene variants with VKH syndrome in Chinese patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report an association between polymorphisms in the CFI gene and VKH syndrome. In addition, we identified that CFI-rs7356506 associated with VKH syndrome depended on recurrent and complicated cataract status. The study protocol was designed according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethic Committee of the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls who participated in this study. The study adhered to the ARVO statement on human subjects. Patients were recruited at the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. A total of 100 patients with VKH syndrome and 300 healthy controls, who were recruited from a Chinese Han population, were enrolled in the study. All subjects were given a detailed ophthalmic assessment that included slit-lamp examinations, dilated fundoscopy, B ultrasonography, optical coherence tomography (GmBH, Heidelberg, Germany), and fluorescence angiography. All patients with VKH syndrome fulfilled the revised diagnostic criteria proposed by the First VKH International Workshop group. Patients diagnosed with any other type(s) of uveitis were excluded from the study. The treatment protocol for VKH syndrome was started from orally administered prednisolone in the range of 1\u20131.5 mg/kg/day or intravenously administered hydroprednisone in the range of 0.5\u20131 g daily, and followed by tapering of the orally steroid guided by ocular inflammation for 12 months or more. Additional immunosuppressive therapy was required for those in whom no improved activity of inflammation was observed for 1 week or more, and he (or she) was defined as steroid insensitive. Recurrent status was defined as recurrent episodes of intraocular inflammation that occurred after uveitis had been in remission for more than 3 months. The healthy controls were unrelated individuals without any ocular disease except senile cataract. The subjects with autoimmune disorder were also excluded. The clinical characteristics of the subjects are presented in Table 1. Peripheral venous blood was obtained from each subject, and genomic DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit (Simgen, Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Genomic DNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The rs7356506 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CFI gene was genotyped in our study. The SNP was genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY technology platform with iPLXGOLD chemistry (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). Genotyping reagents recommended by the iPLEX Gold SNP genotyping kit (Sequenom) were used in this study. The software and equipment provided by the MassARRAY platform (Sequenom) were also employed. Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested using the \u03c72 test for evaluating the deviation of the selected SNP. Either the \u03c72 test or a Fisher exact test was performed to compare the allele and genotype frequencies between the patients with VKH syndrome and the control subjects. Common genetic models (dominant and recessive) in terms of minor alleles were applied to identify associations. Stratified analyses were performed based on recurrent status, complicated cataract status and steroid sensitive status. We also calculated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Of the 100 patients with VKH syndrome, 54 (54.0%) were men, and 46 (46.0%) were women. The mean age of patients with VKH syndrome was 42.6 years (range from 14 to 74 years). All patients had recorded detailed lens diaphaneity, and 56 (56.0%) were diagnosed with complicated cataract. Sixteen (16.0%) patients were insensitive to steroid treatment. Seventy-two subjects were followed for at least 3 years; 27 (37.5%) had recurrent VKH syndrome, and 45 (62.5%) had non-recurrent VKH syndrome. The control group of subjects (300 individuals) comprised 66% men and 34% women. The mean age of the controls was 69.5 years (range from 60 to 88 years). Patients\u2019 detailed clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The CFI genotyped SNP successfully conformed to HWE in the controls. No significant associations in either allele or genotype frequencies for the SNP were detected between the patients with VKH syndrome and the controls (Table 2). When the analyses were stratified by the recurrent status, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of the G allele and GG homozygosity for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP in recurrent patients with VKH syndrome compared with the control subjects (p=0.016, OR=0.429, 95% CI=0.212\u20130.871; p=0.014, OR=0.364, 95% CI=0.158\u20130.837, respectively); however, no significant association was detected in either the allelic or genotypic frequencies for the CFI SNP between the non-recurrent patients with VKH syndrome and the controls (Table 3). When the analyses were stratified by complicated cataract status, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of the G allele and GG homozygosity for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP in patients with VKH syndrome with complicated cataract compared to the control subjects (p<0.001, OR=0.357, 95% CI=0.197\u20130.648; p<0.001, OR=0.273, 95% CI=0.135\u20130.551, respectively); however, no significant association was detected in either allelic or genotypic frequencies for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP between the patients with VKH syndrome without complicated cataract and the controls (Table 4). When the analyses were stratified by steroid-sensitive status, there was no significant association in either the allele or genotype frequencies for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP in the steroid-sensitive patients with VKH syndrome and the control subjects (p=0.239 and 0.491, respectively). The same result was detected for steroid-insensitive patients with VKH syndrome and control subjects (Table 5). In this study, we demonstrated that CFI gene polymorphisms are not significantly associated with VKH syndrome. Interestingly, the stratified analyses revealed that there was a significant decrease in the frequency of G allele and GG homozygosity for the CFI-rs7356506 SNP in the patients with recurrent VKH syndrome or with complicated cataract compared with the control subjects, suggesting that CFI-rs7356506 may decrease the risk for VKH syndrome in the context of recurrent VKH syndrome or complicated cataract. Whereas, no significant association with patients with VKH syndrome in the steroid-sensitive status was detected for CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms. Complement factor I (CFI) is a serine protease, which inhibits activation of the complement proteins C3b and C4b in the presence of cofactors. CFI can inhibit C3b and cleave C3b into inactive iC3b. This process prevents the assembly of C3 convertases in the classical and alternative pathways. The complement system plays an important role in the primary immune process and is an essential component of various immunological and inflammatory responses. As a key regulator in the complement pathway, CFI deficiency is associated with various kinds of immune diseases or inflammatory disease such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Uveitis is usually regarded as intraocular inflammation. Our previous study showed that CFI-rs7356506 played a genetic protective role in acute anterior uveitis. Meanwhile, our results indicated the G allele and GG genotype play a protect role in recurrent inflammation and complicated cataract of patients with VKH syndrome. The single ethnicity of the subjects may only represent a selected population of patients. Therefore, the results may be applicable only to Chinese Han populations and must be verified in other ethnic cohorts. Although we recruited quite a few cases and controls, the small sample size and the diverse phenotype of VKH syndrome might have affected the stratified analysis. Also of note, it is difficult to separate complicated cataract caused by intraocular inflammation and secondary to long-course corticosteroid agents. Further studies are needed to expound a more accurate relationship between phenotype and genotype in VKH disease. In conclusion, although our results indicate that CFI polymorphisms are not significantly associated with VKH syndrome, we identified a trend for the association of CFI-rs7356506 with VKH syndrome, depending on recurrent status and complicated cataract status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the genotype\u2013phenotype association between a CFI SNP and VKH syndrome. Further studies are required to replicate the candidate SNP in other phenotypes of VKH syndrome and in other ethnic groups, and to investigate the biologic roles of these polymorphisms in immune mechanisms involved in uveitis."}, "28368537": {"pmid": "28368537", "pmcid": "PMC5460932", "title": "Tissue-Specific Ablation of the LIF Receptor in the Murine Uterine Epithelium Results in Implantation Failure", "abstract": "\nThe cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is essential for rendering the uterus receptive for blastocyst implantation. In mice, LIF receptor expression (LIFR) is largely restricted to the uterine luminal epithelium (LE). LIF, secreted from the endometrial glands (GEs), binds to the LIFR, activating the Janus kinase\u2013signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) 3 (Jak-Stat3) signaling pathway in the LE. JAK-STAT activation converts the LE to a receptive state so that juxtaposed blastocysts begin to implant. To specifically delete the LIFR in the LE, we derived a line of mice in which Cre recombinase was inserted into the endogenous lactoferrin gene (Ltf-Cre). Lactoferrin expression in the LE is induced by E2, and we demonstrate that Cre recombinase activity is restricted to the LE and GE. To determine the requirement of the LIFR in implantation, we derived an additional mouse line carrying a conditional (floxed) Lifrflx/flx gene. Crossing Ltf-Cre mice with Lifrflx/flx mice generated Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ females that were overtly normal but infertile. Many of these females, despite repeated matings, did not become pregnant. Unimplanted blastocysts were recovered from the Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ uteri and, when transferred to wild-type recipients, implanted normally, indicating that uterine receptivity rather than the embryo\u2019s competency is compromised. The loss of Lifr results in both the failure for STAT3 to translocate to the LE nuclei and a reduction in the expression of the LIF regulated gene Msx1 that regulates uterine receptivity. These results reveal that uterine expression of the LIFR is essential for embryo implantation and further define the components of the LIF signaling pathway necessary for effective implantation.\n", "fulltext": "In mammals, implantation, the period during which the blastocyst establishes an intimate connection with the uterus, is essential for embryonic development. In preparation for implantation, the uterus undergoes a series of changes, primarily driven by the ovarian steroid hormones that culminate in the uterus becoming transiently receptive to blastocysts. In mice, receptivity commences on the morning of the fourth day after mating (day of plug = day 1 pregnancy), with implantation, trophoblast invasion, and decidualization occurring some 12 hours later (1). The ovarian steroid hormones estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) are the key factors regulating uterine preparation (2). At ovulation, high levels of E2 stimulate uterine cell proliferation (3). Subsequently, levels of P4 increase, and these suppress cell proliferation and initiate cell differentiation, culminating in the uterus, becoming potentially receptive on the fourth day after mating. On the morning of the fourth day, blastocysts are distributed along the uterine lumen, juxtaposed to the antimesometrial luminal epithelium (LE). Implantation is then initiated by a brief surge of E2 (nidatory E2) that results in the embryonic trophectoderm invading the LE. The LE adjacent to the invading trophectoderm undergoes either apoptosis or entosis (4), and the underlying stroma differentiates to form the decidua (5). Decidualization increases vascular permeability and acts to support early postimplantation embryonic growth and placenta formation, as well as restrict trophoblast invasion. The hormonal effects on the uterus are mediated either directly or indirectly through locally produced growth factors and cytokines (6). One of these factors, essential for implantation, is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (7). During ovulation, LIF is expressed in the murine glandular epithelium (GE) (8, 9). Over the next 3 days of the reproductive cycle, LIF levels decline but then transiently increase in the GE prior to implantation on D4 of pregnancy. The second increase of LIF is induced by nidatory E2, together with the tumor suppressor and transcription factor, p53 (10, 11). In a wide variety of mammalian species, including human females, a rise in uterine LIF expression is associated with the onset of implantation, implicating LIF in having an important role in regulating uterine receptivity in humans and many other mammals (12). Polymorphisms in the p53 gene, which are associated with reduced LIF levels due to reduced transcriptional activity, are frequently present among young women undergoing in vitro fertilization, potentially correlating a reduction LIF levels with infertility (13). Uteri from Lif\u2212/\u2212 mice show no evidence of epithelial apoptosis, stromal decidualization, or blastocyst invasion (10). However, transfer of the blastocysts from Lif\u2212/\u2212 females to wild-type (WT) pseudopregnant recipients results in the embryos undergoing normal implantation and development (7). Furthermore, a single injection of recombinant LIF into pregnant Lif\u2212/\u2212 mice on day 4 or 5 of pregnancy induces blastocyst implantation with development to term, revealing that during pregnancy LIF is only required to initiate implantation (10). The injection of LIF is also sufficient in replacing nidatory E2 at inducing implantation in appropriately primed ovariectomized mice. Together these findings demonstrate that E2, together with p53, induces LIF expression, with LIF mediating the effects of nidatory E2 at initiating uterine receptivity and implantation. In the absence of LIF, implantation fails and is a maternal defect (14). LIF acts by binding to the heterodimeric receptor comprised of the LIF receptor (LIFR)\u03b2 and GP130. In the uterus, both LIFR\u03b2 and GP130 are detected in the GE and LE at 3 to 4 days postcoitum (dpc) (15\u201317). LIFR expression is initially restricted to the uterine LE, with levels increasing from day 3 onwards after mating. On day 4 following LIF expression, LIFR levels transiently increase in the LE and to a lesser extent in the GE, thereafter expression declines. GP130 expression is restricted to the apical surface of the day 4 LE (17). Treatment of the LE with LIF induces activation of the Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/Stat)\u2013signaling pathway that phosphorylates the latent transcription factor Stat3 (15). Phosphorylated dimers of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3) then translocate to the nucleus (18). In the LE of Lif\u2212/\u2212 mice, Stat3 translocation to the nucleus does not occur (15, 17). Mice that are homozygous for a deletion of the Stat3-GP130 docking site show defective implantation, and deregulation of soluble GP130 has been reported in patients with unexplained fertility (19, 20). In addition, genetic ablation of the Stat3 gene or the application of Jak/Stat inhibitors (21\u201323) results in defective implantation. A deeper examination into the role of LIF signaling components in implantation is complicated due to the broad expression of these proteins, with the loss of each of the three proteins (LIFR, gp130, and Stat3) resulting in embryonic/perinatal lethality (24\u201326). Lifr-deficient mice die during embryogenesis or shortly after birth making it impossible to determine the LIFR\u2019s role at regulating implantation. To define this role, we first derived a mouse line carrying conditional alleles of Lifr (Lifrflx/flx) by the introduction of LoxP sites at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, flanking the extracellular domain of the Lifr gene. In addition, we established a mouse line (LtfCre/Cre) in which the lactotransferrin/lactoferrin gene (Ltf) was used to drive Cre recombinase expression in the uterine epithelia. Lactotransferrin is an iron-binding antimicrobial protein that is expressed in many secretory tissues including tear ducts, salivary glands, and mammary glands, as well as the uterine GE and LE, where it functions as part of the innate immune system (27). Mice lacking a functional Ltf gene are viable and overtly normal. In the murine GE and LE, Ltf expression is induced by E2 and inhibited by P4 and is highly expressed for 3 days after ovulation. The Cre recombinase gene was \u201cknocked into\u201d the Ltf locus, so placing Cre under the control of the Ltf promoter, and we show that this knock-in, in the uterus, restricts Cre expression to the LE and GE. Here, we show that Lifrflx/\u0394 mice crossed with LtfCre/Cre (CB4) mice results in viable adult mice. In the females, there is a loss of the Lifr expression in the uterine LE and GE. This is associated with a failure to activate the Jak-Stat pathway upon treatment, with LIF resulting in the majority of blastocysts not implanting. Mice were maintained at the A*STAR Biological Resource Centre facility in accordance with (28), with the protocols reviewed and approved by the A*STAR Biological Resource Centre Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. An outline of the three transgenic and recombinant (gene-targeted) lines is presented in Supplemental Fig. 1. A 2.5-kb EcoRI-SmaI fragment from the mL14p9E plasmid containing the Ltf promoter (corresponding to bases \u20132637 to \u201318, ATG = 1) was ligated with the Cre-poly (A) cassette, to generate a Ltf-Cre transgenic mouse line by pronuclear injection of the plasmid (Supplemental Figs. 1A and 2A). Ltf-Cre (L4-Cre) transgenic animals were generated by standard pronuclear injection techniques at the National Cancer Institute at Frederick transgenic mouse facility. After pronuclear injection of the transgene, 170 mice were derived and genotyped by southern blotting to detect the presence and dosage of the transgene. Six males from the 55 genotyped as being positive for the transgene were then subsequently analyzed, by crossing with Rosa26R3 female reporter mice (29). From each female, the E13 embryo was collected and stained for \u03b2-galactosidase expression. To derive the \u201cknock-in\u201d mouse line, CB4, the Cre recombinase, was inserted into the endogenous lactoferrin gene, just downstream of the ATG start site (Supplemental Fig. 1B and Supplemental Fig. 3). The lactoferrin (Ltf) gene consists of 17 exons and is transcribed as a single transcript. A 9-kb EcoRI fragment in pGEM3Z (mL14p9E) containing 2.6 kb of 5\u2032 flanking sequence and the first eight exons of the Ltf gene, was subcloned from a 14-kb Ltfl phage clone (mL14 from a 129/J mouse genomic DNA library, DASH, Strategene\u2014a gift of C. T. Teng; Supplemental Fig. 3A and 3B). An XbaI fragment containing exon 1 was subcloned into pBluescript. Cre recombinase complementary DNA (cDNA) containing the SV40 poly (A) sequence was excised from the pmnCre plasmid (gift from P. Soriano) using StyI-HindIII digestion and cloned by blunt-end ligation into the StyI site at bp72 in exon 1. The resulting XbaI sequence containing Cre-pA was then recloned into mL14pE9. A neomycin (neo) cassette under the control of the PGK promoter was isolated from pPGKneobpA, using Xho1, was blunt-end ligated into the partially digested XbaI site. A thymidine kinase (TK) cassette, under the control of the MC1 promoter from pKS-TK, was cloned into the Xho1-BamH1 (in the vector) site to replace an Xho1-EcoRI fragment in the mL14p9E plasmid, thus generating the targeting vector, pLF-C-N-TK (Supplemental Fig. 3B). A 1.5-kb fragment spanning exons 5 to 8 was excised with Xho1-BamH1 (Supplemental Fig. 3B) and used as a probe for southern analysis to detect homologous recombinants (Supplemental Fig. 3D). The resulting transcript from the targeted allele (Supplemental Fig. 3B) would produce the initial 17 amino acids of Ltf followed by the Cre sequence (Supplemental Fig. 3C and 3E). The LifR gene contains 21 exons spanning some 50 kb. To generate the conditional LifR allele (LifRflx/flx; Supplemental Fig. 1C), two targeting vectors were constructed: pTV-LRup (pTV-LifR-fH), which generated (LifRflx/flxHyg), and pTV-LRdown (pTV-LifR-fN), which generated LifRflxlxNeo (Supplemental Fig. 4A and 4B). These vectors targeted introns 1 and 14, respectively (30). pTV-LRup was derived from pl5-5.5 Asp, a 5.7-kb KpnI fragment between exons 1 and 2 and cloned into pGEM7 (gift from C. Ware) (25). A PGK-hygro-poly (A) cassette flanked by loxP sites was blunt-end ligated into the BstEII site. The resulting construct was digested with BamHI and cloned into pBS-TK, containing the TK negative selection cassette. The 0.5-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment in p15-5.5, absent from pTV-LRup, was used as a probe for southern analysis. The genomic DNA fragment used to make the targeting vector pTV-LRdown (pTV-LifR-fH) was derived by screening a library of 129 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs; RP22-129S6/SvEvTac Research Genetics) using LifR cDNA as a probe. From 27 BAC clones, three were confirmed by dot blot analysis as containing the LifR gene (RP22-175O16, RP22-417F23, and RP23-476A13). DNA from a mixture of the three BACs was digested with EcoRI; large fragments were gel purified and cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEMTEasy (Promega). Clones were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers targeting the fibronectin type III domains of LifR (exons 12 to 14), LR1783 forward (5\u2032-CATTGAACGAGGAGACACAGTCAGTTTTGG-3\u2032) and LR2197 reverse (5\u2032-GAACGTAACAGTTGGTATCCCTGGTTAGTGC-3\u2032), resulting in the identification of a 9kb EcoRI fragment containing exons 11 to 16. A PGKneobpA cassette flanked by loxP sites was excised from pHR68 (gift from D. Duboule) by XhoI digestion and inserted into an XhoI site within intron 14 in the same orientation as the PGK-hygro-poly (A) cassette. An MC1-TK cassette was cloned into the Sac1-Sal1 site to generate the pTV-LRdown targeting vector. The DNA fragment used for southern analysis was generated from the BAC by cloning an EcoR1-BamH1 fragment 3\u2032 to the targeting construct. The targeting vectors were linearized by Not1 digestion and electroporated into W9.5 129 embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES clones were cultured and selected for as described (31, 32). For the LtfCre (CB4) knock-in southern analysis, genomic DNA was digested with EcoR1. The blots were probed with a 1.0-kb Xho-Bam1 fragment from mL14p9E corresponding to the sequence immediately 3\u2032 to the targeting vector. The probe hybridized to the 9-kb WT allele and a 7.4-kb recombinant allele due to addition of EcoR1 site within the neo cassette (Supplemental Fig. 2B). Four positive clones were identified among 144 G418-resistant clones. Clones were karyotyped to ensure diploidy, and two clones were expanded, injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts, and transferred to B6CBAF1 recipient females. Germline chimeras were identified and transmission of the LtfCre verified by PCR (31, 32). For derivation of the LifRflx/flx conditional mouse line, a double targeting strategy was used. Initially, the constructs pTV-LRup and and pTV-LRdown were electroporated individually to test their respective targeting efficiencies. Screening of 48 antibiotic-resistant clones using Kpn1 digestion for LRup (LifRflxH), which produced a 5.7-kb WT band, or a 4.1-kb mutant band and BamH1 digestion for LRdown (LifRflxH) that resulted a 3.9-kb WT band or a 5.1-kb recombinant band, was performed. The LRup (LifRflxH) electroporation produced 32 (67%) positive clones, whereas the LRdown (LifRflxNeo) electroporation produced 22 (46%) positive clones. The high rate of homologous recombination revealed that the LifR locus is easily targetable and that a simultaneous double-targeting strategy could be attempted. To this end, the ES cells were electroporated with a mixture containing both the pTV-LRup and pTV-LRdown targeting constructs. After 24 hours, ES cells were simultaneously selected with hygromycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and G418 (Invitrogen). Of 48 clones, five were confirmed to be positive by southern analysis for homologous recombination at both loci. To further ensure that both targeting vectors recombined with the LifR gene in cis and ensure that the loxP sites were functional, Cre recombinase was transiently expressed in the five ES clones by transfection of pMC1-Cre (a Cre cDNA expressed under the MC1 promoter, gift of K. Rajewsky). PCR was used to identify the deletion product of the floxed LifR. Two of five clones were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeras. Clone J8 produced germline offspring inheriting the conditional LifRflx/+ allele. Germline transmission of the Ltf-Cre knock-in was confirmed by southern analysis, and mice were subsequently genotyped by PCR amplification of genomic DNA. Two pairs of PCR primers were used to genotype LtfCre (CB4) lines: Cre primers (Cre73 forward: 5\u2032-GTGTCCAATTTACTGACCGTACACC-3\u2032; Cre373 reverse: 5\u2032-GACGATGAAGCATGTTTAGCTGG-3\u2032) and Ltf primers (forward 5\u2032-TGAGGTCACCCAGCACAGATAAAG-3\u2032; Ltf intron1-5\u2032-GAGAGGGTGAGATGTTCCTGTGAGTC), corresponding to sequences within the promoter through intron 1. The Ltf primers generate a 331-bp WT product or a 1.7-kb LtfCre (CB4; CreKI) product. Mice containing the LifR+/flx alleles were identified by PCR using the following primers: LifR-CKO up-forward (U5) 5\u2032-CCTTTTGCAGTCTCACAGGTCTTG-3\u2032; Lifr-CKO up-reverse (U3) 5\u2032-TGGAAAGCAGAGAAGCACAAGC-3\u2032 to generate a 368-nucleotide (nt) WT product, a \u223c2-kb hygromycin-containing fragment (Hygro-on; fH) or a 461-nt loxP-containing product (Hygro-off; fDH). Lifr-CKO down-forward (D5) 5\u2032-gcccctttgtgacatactcgattc-3\u2032; Lifr-CKO down-reverse (D3) 5\u2032-TGGTAAGTCCAACTCAGCTAAGTGC-3\u2032 to generate a 172-nt WT product, an \u223c2-kb neo-containing fragment (fN) or a 272-nt loxP-containing fragment. In addition, using primers U5 together with D3, amplifies a 474-nt product in the null Lifr\u0394/\u0394 allele. To delete the neo and hygromycin selectable markers, the LifrfH-fN/fH-fN mice were crossed with CB4 mice, and the resultant Lifrflx/+:LtfCre/+ mice were screened for loss of neo and hygromycin cassettes by PCR as described above. The deletion of the selectable markers leaves two loxP sites at introns 1 and 14 intact. To generate the complete Lifr deletion (Lifr\u0394/\u0394), the Lifrflx/flx mice were crossed with the Ltf-Cre transgenic line (L4-Cre), used here as a general deletor to obtain Lifr\u0394/+:Cre/+. The Lifrflx/+:Ltf Cre/+ mice were then crossed with Lifr\u0394 /+:Cre\u2013 mice to obtain Lifrflx/\u0394::Ltf Cre/+. Females with this genotype were then used to determine the consequences of Lifr deletion in the LE. To determine the tissue specific expression of Cre activity in vivo LtfCre/Cre mice were crossed to the mouse reporter lines: Z/AP (33), Rosa26R3, and mT/mG (34). For whole-mount embryo analysis, embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). \u03b2-Galactosidase activity in the Rosa26R3 crosses was detected after incubation with X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-galactopyranoside; Invitrogen). Alkaline phosphatase activity in Z/AP mice was detected using BCIP/NBT (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium; Vector Laboratories) staining according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Cre expression in the uterus was evaluated using the Gt (ROSA)26R3Sortm1Sor/J, Z/AP, and mT/mG mouse reporter lines. Frozen sections were fixed with 4% PFA and then stained with BCIP/NBT or by immunofluorescent analysis for mT or mG. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed on paraffin-embedded samples as previously described (17). The effects of Lifr deficiency on glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and osteoclasts in bone were histologically characterized and by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining with images being recorded on a Zeiss Axioimager. Paraffin-embedded thin sections of spinal cords (5 \u03bcm) were stained with an antibody against GFAP to identify glial cells and counterstained with Nissl stain. The osteoclasts in the long bones were identified by their unique morphology and size after H&E staining, performed using standard histological procedures. The uteri from day 1 pregnant CB4+/+/TL +/+ or Tl +/+ mice were fixed in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 for 24 hours, followed by fixation in 30% sucrose (Sigma, St Louis, MO) in PBS pH 7.4 for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C. Fixed uteri were cut into pieces and placed in tissue freezing medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and frozen in cold heptane (Sigma) kept on dry ice. Cryosections of 10 \u03bcm were cut and stored at \u201370\u00b0C. For detecting membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein (mGFP) fluorescence, cryosections were dried completely at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. The sections were treated with chloroform: isoamyl acetate 24:1 (Sigma) for 10 seconds to eliminate background autofluorescence. The sections were dried and then rehydrated in PBS, pH 7.4, for 15 minutes. Sections were incubated in 1% sodium borohydride (Sigma) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 minutes followed by washing in PBS twice for 5 minutes each. The sections were treated with a mouse-on-mouse blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour and then washed in PBS twice for 5 minutes each to quench additional autofluorescence arising from antibody binding to blood vessels. The sections were incubated with DAPI (Invitrogen) to stain nuclei for 10 minutes and washed with PBS. Subsequently they were treated with 75 mM copper sulfate in ammonium acetate solution, pH 5.0 (Sigma), for 90 minutes to further decrease lipofuscin autofluorescence (35). The sections were washed in PBS and mounted in ProLong gold antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen) and viewed and photographed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For the analysis of blastocyst implantation, female mice with the desired genotype (Lifrflx/\u0394: LtfCre/+) were derived and were mated with WT males of proven fertility. Plug dates were recorded. After the mice were plugged at least three times without becoming pregnant, they were killed after the fourth mating at 7 dpc. Uteri were collected and flushed to recover unimplanted blastocysts, and these were transferred to pseudopregnant recipients (7, 32). From a pool of three to five uteri, 10 \u00b5g of total RNA was prepared, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Northern Max, Ambion), separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde denaturing gels, and transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham). P-32\u2013labeled cDNAs corresponding to Cre and lactoferrin were used as probes. After standard washing, the membranes were analyzed using a phosphorimager for 1 to 3 days. Uteri were isolated and frozen in optimum cutting temperature and then sectioned at 10 \u00b5m and mounted on Superfrost slides (VWR International). In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (9). Sections were warmed to room temperature and fixed in 4% PFA. Sections were treated with Proteinase K and prehybridized in 50% (volume-to-volume ratio) formamide, 4\u00d7SSC, 5% dextran sulfate (weight-to-volume ration), 1\u00d7 Denhardt\u2019s solution, 0.25 mg/mL transfer RNA and heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA (0.5 mg/mL) for 3 hours at 42\u00b0C. A full-length Lifr cDNA clone was used to generate sense and antisense probes by in vitro transcription with (\u03b1-35S) uridine triphosphate. The hybridization was performed overnight with either S35-labeled sense or antisense probes. Slides were processed for liquid emulsion autoradiography and visualized using Kodak D-19 developer. LE from D3 pregnant mice was isolated from uteri by enzymatic digestion as previously described (15, 36). The purified LE was incubated at room temperature in freezing holding buffer (Specialty Media). LIF (Esgro, Millipore) was added and incubated for 2 hours. Proteins were extracted by lysis buffer containing 0.1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and complete miniprotease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein extracts were separated on 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) and incubated O/N with the following primary antibodies: pSTAT3 (Cell Signaling) and STAT3 (Cell Signaling) at 4\u00b0C. Loading was normalized using an antibody to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. After washing in TTBS, membranes were exposed to horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies, incubated in enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Amersham), and processed for autoradiography on film (Kodak). In the sexually mature uterine LE, lactoferrin (lactotransferrin, Ltf) is induced by E2, both during estrous and the first 3 days following ovulation. Its expression is then inhibited by a rise in P4 (27, 37, 38). To determine whether lactoferrin would be a tissue-specific promoter for Cre expression in the uterine LE, we initially generated a transgenic line, Ltf-Cre (Supplemental Fig. 1A) using an EcoRI-Sma1 fragment from the Ltf promoter (corresponding to sequences \u20132637 to \u201318; transcriptional start site = +1) that contains the E2-regulated element. Following pronuclear injection, we examined the offspring from six independently derived transgenic males. The offspring from all six males, when crossed to mice carrying the \u03b2-galactosidase (ROSA26R3Sortm1Sor/J) reporter gene, all showed ubiquitous expression of \u03b2-galactosidase in midgestation embryos (Supplemental Fig. 2A), indicating that the Ltf-Cre transgene was probably expressed very early in development. We retained one line, homozygous for the transgene, which subsequently served as a universal constitutive deleter line to generate the Lifr\u0394/\u0394 mice. Because the transgenic approach failed to produce mice with Cre expression restricted to the LE and GE, we then chose to \u201cknock-in\u201d the Cre recombinase gene into the Ltf gene so that Cre is under control of all Ltf regulatory elements. The vector for a knock-in of Cre recombinase was made by inserting a modified Cre recombinase cDNA (mnCre) within exon 1, downstream of the ATG start site of the Ltf gene (Supplemental Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig. 3A\u2013E). Four homologous recombinant ES clones (out of 144 clones) were identified and confirmed by southern analysis (Supplemental Fig. 3D). The resulting fusion protein was predicted to contain the initial 14 amino acids of Ltf followed by Cre sequence (Supplemental Fig. 3E). Homozygous Cre knock-in (LtfCre/Cre or CB4) mice were indistinguishable from WT siblings and did not display any overt phenotype, consistent with Ltf-null mice being viable (39). There was however some anemia and reduced levels of hemoglobin in pups derived from homozygous mothers (data not shown). In contrast to the Ltf-Cre transgene, the Ltf-Cre insertion line (CB4) had a restricted expression profile. Northern blot analysis detected Cre recombinase transcripts and no Ltf transcripts in the uteri from homozygous CB4 mice (Supplemental Fig. 2B). To further evaluate the tissue-specific expression and activity, female CB4 mice were crossed with different reporter lines; the double-fluorescent mT/mG reporter Line (34), the \u03b2-galactosidase reporter mice Gt (ROSA26Sortm1Sor/J) (29) and the alkaline phosphatase Z/AP (33). As shown in Supplemental Fig. 2C, E13 embryos generated from the Z/AP \u00d7 CB4 cross, in contrast to the transgenic lines, did not show ubiquitous AP expression, but showed small discreet regions of AP expression that varied between individual embryos. CB4 female mice were then crossed with the dual reporter mT/mG male reporter mice to obtain a more precise definition of Cre activity in the different tissues, and specifically in the uterus of CB4 \u00d7 mT/mG female offspring. The mT/mG mice constitutively express Tomato Red (mT) prior to Cre-mediated recombination. Following Cre introduction, expression of mT is lost and expression is switched to an mGFP, specifically in cells where Cre is functional. Strong mT expression was observed in the uterine stroma without CB4 [Fig. 1(B) and 1(D)]. After crossing with CB4 males, mG expression was only induced and localized at the LE membrane and more weakly in the GE membranes, as well as a few cells in the stroma that were probably neutrophils or macrophages expressing Ltf [Fig. 1(E) and (H)] (37). For unknown reasons, mT expression in the stroma was lost, but no mG expression was induced. In females prior to their first reproductive cycle (at \u223c5 to 6 weeks) or in ovariectomized mice, mG expression was not induced in the LE or GE. However, following E2 injection (50 ng), mG was induced in the LE of ovariectomized mice (data not shown). Confirmation that Cre activity in the CB4 line was restricted to the uterine LE and GE was established by crossing the Cre mice to the \u03b2-galactosidase reporter mice Gt (ROSA26Sortm1Sor/J) where \u03b2-galactosidase activity was restricted to the LE and GE [Fig. 1(I) and 1(J)]. In other tissues from the mT/mG \u00d7 CB4 mice, strong Cre activity was noted in the salivary glands, whereas in the liver (where the LIFR is highly expressed), no activity was detected. Weak activity was, however, detected in the ovarian stroma and, to a lesser extent, the heart myocardium, with no activity being detected in other adult tissues (Supplemental Fig. 5). To ensure that as much of the Lifr gene could be deleted following recombination, loxP sites were introduced into Lifr gene flanking the exons encoding the extracellular domains the LIFR (Supplemental Fig. 4A\u2013F). Mice homozygous for the floxed Lifr (Lifrflx/flx) allele and mice heterozygous with a deleted allele (Lifr\u0394/+or Lifr\u0394/flx) were viable and indistinguishable both in growth rate and fertility from their WT siblings. We derived homozygous deleted Lifr\u0394/\u0394 mice by crossing the Lifrflx/flx mice with the Ltf-Cre constitutive deleter line and compared their phenotype to the phenotype of the previously described Lifr\u2212/\u2212 mice (25). The Lifr\u2212/\u2212 mice die perinataly, and viable Lifr\u0394/\u0394 offspring were identified at birth which then subsequently died within a few hours after birth (n = 38 newborns analyzed; P > 0.001). Lifr\u0394/\u0394 E16 and E19 embryos were identified (n = 7) at normal Mendelian ratios and showed no overt abnormalities apart from being smaller. Compared with WT littermates, Lifr\u0394/\u0394 mice were 8% (E14) and 27% (E19) lighter and 5% (E14) and 12% (E19) shorter in body length (data not shown). Such growth retardation may have been due defective placental development, as reported for the Lifr\u2212/\u2212 mice (25), because the placenta expresses high levels of the LIFR. Lifr\u2212/\u2212 mice have increased osteoclast numbers in the long bones and defects in glial cell differentiation in the CNS. We observed a similar reduction in glial cell numbers, by GFAP staining in both E16 and E19 Lifr\u0394/\u0394 embryos (Supplemental Fig. 6A). We also observed increased osteoclast numbers in the long bones, visualized by H&E staining (Supplemental Fig. 6B). Because of the perinatal lethality of the Lifr\u0394/\u0394 mice, the mice were maintained with a Lifrflx/flx genotype. We derived Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ females to determine if LE/GE expression of the LIFR is required for implantation. Mice with either of these genotypes were, in size and overall health, indistinguishable from WT siblings, indicating that any non LE-GE expression of LtfCre/Cre did not significantly delete Lifrflx/flx in other adult tissues, such as the liver, where the LIFR is highly expressed (40) or during development, which would result in potential lethality. To analyze the consequences of Lifr loss in the LE on blastocyst implantation, females with the desired genotype (Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+) were mated with WT males of proven fertility. Plug dates were recorded from a total of 11 females. After each of the females had mated for at least three cycles without becoming pregnant, a fourth mating was initiated. The females were then killed at 7 days after the last mating (7 dpc). Uteri were collected, examined for the presence of implantation sites and then flushed to isolate unimplanted blastocysts. From the 11 females, 27 hatched, unimplanted blastocysts were recovered from six of seven mice that showed no indication of implantation sites [Fig. 2(A)], indicating their uteri did not support implantation. The remaining four females showed evidence of implantation with a total of seven decidual swellings being identified in the four mice. The recovered blastocysts [Fig. 2(B)] were morphologically similar to normal blastocysts undergoing implantational delay, in that they were elongated and were not enclosed in a zona. To verify that the embryos were unaffected by loss of Lifr expression, the blastocysts were transferred to WT pseudopregnant recipients. Twelve blastocysts were transferred to pseudopregnant WT recipients, and seven pups were subsequently born. These data indicate that implantation failure in Lifr flx/\u0394:LtfCre+ LE mice is a consequence of a defective uterus rather than defective blastocysts. The uteri from which the blastocysts were recovered showed no evidence of a decidual response or any indication that implantation had been initiated (data not shown). The fact that seven implantation sites were detected in four of the Lifr flx/\u0394:LtfCre+ females, even after four rounds of mating, indicated that Ltf-Cre mediated deletion, may, occasionally not be fully penetrant. To analyze this, we preformed in situ hybridization and Immunostaining on uterine sections from the females. In situ hybridization, using a full-length Lifr cDNA as a probe, hybridized to Lifr transcripts in the LE of the WT uterus. The Lifr hybridization signal in the LE was weak on day 3 dpc, and increased in intensity between days 4 and 5 dpc, in agreement with previous reports (16, 17) [Fig. 3(A), panel b]. No signal was detected using the sense probe. Screening for the Lifr in Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+mice revealed the complete absence of Lifr transcripts from three Lifr flx/\u0394:LtfCre+ individuals [Fig. 3(A), panels c and d]. However, a substantial hybridization signal, indicative of Lifr transcripts, was found in the LE of the fourth mouse (not shown). These results were supported by western analysis and immunostaining of the LIFR protein [Fig. 3(B), panels e\u2013h, and 3(C)] where LIFR was detectable in the basal and apical sides of the LE of WT mice 2 hours after an injection of nidatory E2 [Fig. 3(B), panel e], whereas in the LE from three Lifr\u2212/\u2212, it was either undetectable by immunostaining or western analysis in two individuals [Fig. 3(B), panels f and h, and 3(C)] and weakly expressed in the LE of another mouse [Fig. 3(B), panel g]. There was an apparent correlation between fertility (ability to support implantation) and detectable Lifr mRNA signal in the LE; the pregnant female was still LIFR positive, whereas the infertile ones showed no LIFR signal. These results indicate that Cre recombinase, under the control of the Ltf promoter in Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ females, was effective in the tissue-specific ablation of the Lifr in the majority of mice analyzed. The binding of LIF to the LIFR/gp130 receptor complex activates the JAK/STAT pathway (41). Previously, we demonstrated that STAT3 is constitutively expressed in the LE during the preimplantation period but is only phosphorylated and translocates to the nuclei in the LE, but not the GE, in response to LIF treatment on days 3 and 4 after mating (15, 17). To determine whether STAT3 is phosphorylated in the LE of Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ mice, we performed western and immunofluorescence analysis on whole uteri and LE extracts from mice on days 3 and 4 after mating [Fig. 3(D\u2013F)]. We isolated and purified LE from WT females at 3 dpc and incubated the LE with LIF as previously described (15). Treatment of the WT LE, with LIF, resulted in a robust increase of phosphorylated Stat3 [Fig. 3(F), lanes 1\u20134]. As with previous observations, the overall levels of STAT3 did not change in response to LIF treatment, but pSTAT3 levels were strongly increased [Fig. 3(F), lane 4] (15). Extracts of LE from WT and Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+mice from 4 dpc were analyzed following LIF treatment using an antibody specific for pSTAT3. Although treatment of WT LE with LIF resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 10), in the Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+, LE extracts STAT3 phosphorylation did not change [Fig. 3(F), lanes 5\u20138]. These results were confirmed by Immunostaining uteri from ovariectomized WT and Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ mice 2 hours after the injection of nidatory E2 (n = 3 each genotype). STAT3 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of WT and Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ LE at varying levels [Fig. 3(D), panels j\u2013m]; however, only in the WT LE was pSTAT3 localization to the nuclei detected [Fig. 3(E), panel n]\u2014not in the LE nuclei from the Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ mice [Fig. 3(E), panels o\u2013q]. One of the genes whose expression is inhibited in the LE by LIF is the homeobox gene Msx1 (17, 42, 43, 44). In WT mice on day 4 dpc, MSX1 expression is detectable in the uterine LE (42, 44). However, within 2 to 3 hours after either E2 or LIF injection, MSX1 expression is completely suppressed [Fig. 4(A)]. In the Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ uteri, MSX1 expression was sustained and even appeared to have spread into some stromal cell nuclei [Fig. 4(B)] by 3 hours after E2 injection. This supports previous findings that LIF induction on day 4 suppresses MSX1 expression and that this suppression is necessary to render the uterus receptive to implanting blastocysts. Embryo implantation is a highly complex yet coordinated process that is driven by the ovarian steroid hormones E2 and P4. These hormones operate by activation of many autocrine and paracrine signaling molecules in different tissue compartments of the uterus. Among these signaling molecules, the cytokine LIF is essential. LIF\u2019s action on the LE results in the change in the expression of at least 50 transcription factors within 1 hour of LIF treatment. These transcription factors, in turn, activate a multitude of physiological pathways (17, 45). Analysis of how these different factors act in concert, resulting in successful blastocyst implantation, has been hampered by the lack of an appropriate in vitro system to dissect the molecular and cellular events. Consequently, it has been necessary to resort to studying the process in vivo, primarily through genetic routes in which mutations are introduced into genes suspected of being important to implantation. However, deletion of many of these genes results in embryonic or developmental abnormalities that prevent female mice from reaching a reproductive maturity. This issue can be sidestepped using the Cre-Lox system to conditionally regulate gene expression. At least five Cre lines of mice have been derived to specifically delete genes in the uterus, these being PR-Cre (46), Amhr2-Cre (47), Wnt7a-Cre (48), Sprr2f-Cre (49), and recently, another Ltf line, Ltf-iCre (50). Each of these lines has advantages and disadvantages at directing gene ablation in different cellular compartments. A major issue with many of these lines is that the expression of the genes driving Cre may not be restricted to a specific cell type in the uterus. For instance, PR is expressed in all cellular compartments in the uterus, as well the ovary, mammary gland, and pituitary, so making it difficult to define gene function in uterine biology, if the floxed gene is expressed in additional cell types. Furthermore, some of these genes are expressed, either during embryogenesis or in the maturing postnatal uterus, and so disrupting uterine development rather than physiological function during adult reproduction. Here, we have described the derivation of an Ltf-Cre line (CB4) and showed that it can be used to specifically ablate gene expression in the uterine LE and GE. The mouse line, CB4 (LtfCre/Cre), has Cre recombinase that was inserted into the lactoferrin (Ltf) gene, so placing Cre expression under control of the E2/P4 regulated Ltf promoter. We used the CB4 line to specifically delete a floxed conditional allele of the LIF receptor in the uterine LE. LIF initiates implantation by binding to the heterodimeric receptor comprised of the LIFR and gp130 proteins that are expressed in the LE. Binding of LIF to the heterodimeric receptor activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the LE (15, 17, 18, 41), resulting in the LE becoming receptive to the juxtaposed blastocysts. Determining the requirement for the LIFR in implantation has been hindered by the fact that Lifr-nulls die at birth, so preventing the analysis of LIFR function in different adult tissues (25). In the LE and GE of Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ mice, Lifr transcripts and protein were eliminated, indicating that the Ltf\u2013Cre resulted in deletion the Lifrflx/\u0394 alleles. The majority of the Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ females, despite repeated mating with males of proven fertility, did not become pregnant or produce offspring. These females were carrying unimplanted blastocysts, and following transfer to pseudopregnant WT recipients, the majority of these blastocysts implanted and developed to term, a result identical to that seen in the Lif-null mice (7). These results demonstrate that LIFR and GP130 expression in the LE, are the signaling receptor components required by LIF to initiate the onset of LE receptivity followed by embryo implantation. Lifr transcript loss in the LE was, in a few mice, incomplete, with some residual Lifr signal persisting in about 15% of the LE cells. Such mosaic expression may well account for some Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ LE females being subfertile, with a reduced number of implantation sites. Several reasons may account for the apparent partial loss, including insufficient levels of expression of Cre from the Ltf promoter, Ltf expression varying between individual LE cells and the distance between the loxP sites in the floxed Lifr allele, reducing the efficiency of recombination. However, the patchy expression of Cre activity, both in embryos and in the uterus, as revealed in the reporter mice, suggests that variable expression of Cre is a possibility. These observations suggest that LIFR expression in a few LE cells may be sufficient to allow for the implantation of a few blastocysts, probably in the regions of the LE where LIFR was still expressed, suggesting that changes in the LE in response to LIF that allow embryo implantation are highly localized and do not \u201cspread\u201d to neighboring cells. Many studies have shown that deletion, mutation, or pharmacological inhibition of either the Stat3 or the Gp130 genes results in female infertility and implantation failure. Gp130-null mice die in utero due to defective cardiac and vascular development. However, a mouse line homozygous for a truncation of a C-terminal region of gp130, which eliminates the STAT3 binding and activation site, has defective implantation, similar to the LIF-deficient mice (19). Pharmacological inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway has also supported the notion that STAT3 and JAK are required for implantation (21, 51). Recently, the conditional deletion of either Stat3 or Gp130 in the uterus using the PgrCre/+ was reported (23, 52). Loss of either factor resulted in female infertility and implantation failure confirming their requirement for implantation, although because Pgr is expressed in both the uterine epithelium and stroma, this makes it difficult to interpret which tissue is affected by loss of either factor. Stimulation of the WT-LE with LIF resulted in efficient phosphorylation of STAT3 and nuclear translocation in the WT LE, but not in LE from the Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ mice, where pSTAT3 levels were reduced and did not show increased phosphorylation following LIF treatment. The reduced levels of STAT3 and phosphorylation dynamics may have been partly due to a breakdown in the autoregulation of STAT3 levels due to a failure to increase expression of the negative regulator SOCS3 that inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation and that is transcriptionally induced by pSTAT3. The failure to activate the JAK-STAT pathway in the LE probably was responsible for the persistent expression of the homeobox gene MSX1, in which LIF mediated suppression of MSX1 expression is required for the uterus to become receptive (42). Together with previous reports, these findings demonstrate the centrality of the LIF-Lifr/gp130-JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in regulating uterine receptivity and implantation. Based on our reporter analysis, the CB4 Ltf-Cre line was largely effective in expressing Cre recombinase in the LE and in deleting LifR function in this cellular compartment. However, Ltf-Cre is strongly expressed in other tissues, especially the salivary gland and more weakly in the heart. Ablation of the Lifr in these tissues would probably not affect reproductive functions in the uterus. We also compared the effectiveness of the Wnt7a-Cre line at deleting the LifR in the uterus and we were only able to derive one female (out of 75 offspring tested) that was of the Lifrflx/\u0394: Wnt7a Cre/+ genotype, whereas we derived 21 Lifrflx/\u0394:LtfCre/+ females from 81 offspring. This may have been due (based on our observation) to Wnt7a \u2013Cre expression in the developing CNS, so ablating LifR that is essential to the developing CNS (data not shown). Cell-specific ablation of any gene of interest in the uterus may therefore require the judicious choice of a specific line of Cre mice. Although all these results have been obtained primarily in mice, they are relevant to human reproductive health. In women with unexplained fertility defects, altered expression of soluble gp130 has been reported (20), and reduced fertility is associated with specific polymorphisms in the transcription factor p53 and its regulator Mdm2 affecting the levels of LIF expression in the uterus (23, 53). In summary, our results show that defective loss and/or function of the LIFR in the LE adversely results in reduced numbers of implanting blastocysts. The levels of LIFR expression and its functional activity in the LE change during the preimplantation phase and suggest that incorrect expression/function of the LIFR during reproductive cycles maybe an additional factor contributing to infertility in human reproduction."}, "28584052": {"pmid": "28584052", "pmcid": "PMC5535036", "title": "Mutations in N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase in patients with X-linked intellectual disability", "abstract": "\nN-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) regulates protein O-GlcNAcylation, an essential and dynamic post-translational modification. The O-GlcNAc modification is present on numerous nuclear and cytosolic proteins and has been implicated in essential cellular functions such as signaling and gene expression. Accordingly, altered levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation have been associated with developmental defects and neurodegeneration. However, mutations in the OGT gene have not yet been functionally confirmed in humans. Here, we report on two hemizygous mutations in OGT in individuals with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and dysmorphic features: one missense mutation (p.Arg284Pro) and one mutation leading to a splicing defect (c.463\u20136T>G). Both mutations reside in the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT that are essential for substrate recognition. We observed slightly reduced levels of OGT protein and reduced levels of its opposing enzyme O-GlcNAcase in both patient-derived fibroblasts, but global O-GlcNAc levels appeared to be unaffected. Our data suggest that mutant cells attempt to maintain global O-GlcNAcylation by down-regulating O-GlcNAcase expression. We also found that the c.463\u20136T>G mutation leads to aberrant mRNA splicing, but no stable truncated protein was detected in the corresponding patient-derived fibroblasts. Recombinant OGT bearing the p.Arg284Pro mutation was prone to unfolding and exhibited reduced glycosylation activity against a complex array of glycosylation substrates and proteolytic processing of the transcription factor host cell factor 1, which is also encoded by an XLID-associated gene. We conclude that defects in O-GlcNAc homeostasis and host cell factor 1 proteolysis may play roles in mediation of XLID in individuals with OGT mutations.\n", "fulltext": "Protein O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification that is present on many nucleocytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins (1, 2). O-GlcNAcylation involves cycling of a single N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) 5 moiety on serine and threonine residues of a spectrum of substrates, affecting their stability, activity, and subcellular localization (3, 4). The transfer of O-GlcNAc is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) (5, 6) and is modulated by the availability of the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc (7). UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis is coupled to glucose, glutamine, and nucleotide metabolism. Concomitantly, OGT exerts a nutrient-sensitive regulation over various cellular functions by acting on myriad targets (8). OGT is highly conserved in metazoa and consists of multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) on the N terminus and a C-terminal glycosyltransferase domain (9, 10). Although TPRs are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions, in the context of OGT they facilitate substrate recognition and specificity (11). In addition to its glycosyltransferase activity, OGT was recently shown to have a role in proteolytic processing of host cell factor 1 (HCF1) (12, 13), a transcriptional co-regulator of the cell cycle (14). HCF1 is heavily O-GlcNAcylated (15), but a recent study revealed that O-GlcNAcylation and proteolytic cleavage of HCF1 by OGT are independent processes (16). OGT activity is counteracted by O-GlcNAcase (OGA), a hexosaminidase that specifically removes O-GlcNAc modifications (17). It has been shown that chemical inhibition of OGA in different human cell lines leads to a decreased expression of OGT and an increased expression of OGA (18), which indicates an as yet unidentified mechanism of regulation to maintain global O-GlcNAc homeostasis. OGT has been linked to embryonic development in a number of animal models. Caenorhabditis elegans with null mutations in ogt-1 are viable and fertile, but with metabolic defects (19). In Drosophila, OGT is encoded by the super sex combs gene, which is essential for Drosophila viability and segmentation (20, 21). Knockdown of OGT in zebrafish causes impaired embryonic growth with reduced brain size (22). Although OGT is ubiquitously expressed, it is remarkably abundant in brain (9, 10). Accordingly, O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to neuronal function and brain development in a number of cell and animal models (22, 23). In addition, recent studies have shown that O-GlcNAc signaling can regulate axonal and dendritic growth (24, 25) and AMPA receptor trafficking (26, 27), possibly affecting learning and memory processes. Also, alterations in protein O-GlcNAcylation have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases (28).Genetic OGT variants identified in patients with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) have previously been documented: first, in a clinical report, albeit accompanied by mutations in MED12 (a known XLID gene) (29), and second, in a large screen for novel XLID genes (30). Here, we describe two patients with intellectual disability, bearing hemizygous mutations in OGT. By combining characterization of the O-GlcNAcylation machinery in patient cells and characterization of the effects of OGT XLID mutations on OGT dual activity in vitro, we provide preliminary evidence suggesting that effects on the O-GlcNAc proteome and proteolytic processing of HCF1 may underpin the observed XLID phenotypes.Two male patients showed intellectual disability and a developmental delay with an unknown cause. Cognitive testing in patient 1, at the age of 5 years old, showed reduced intelligence (WPPSI-III-NL, score 2;9) and delay in adaptive behavior (VABS, score 2;0). Additional neurological symptoms were pyramidal syndrome, mild spastic diplegia, and psychomotor retardation with behavioral conduct disorder. In addition, patient 1 had an inguinal hernia. Dysmorphic features included hypertelorism, low-set ears, a broad nose, full lips, supernumerary nipple, hypoplastic toe, mild retrognathia, long and thin fingers, clinodactyly, and microcephaly (Fig. 1A). Patient 1 showed involvement of the eyes including amblyopia and possible astigmatism. He was born with a mild respiratory insufficiency based upon transient tachypnea of the neonate. Cardiac screening revealed a bicuspid aortic valve. An MRI at the age of 2 years old showed mild abnormalities pointing toward periventricular leukomalacia (Fig. 1C), but with a normal EEG.The global developmental level of patient 2, at the age of 5.5 years old, was estimated at 1.5 years. He showed mouth hypotonia with drooling and involvement of the eyes including nystagmus, astigmatism, and high hypermetropia. Genital abnormalities included a small phallus, and orchiopexy was performed at the age of 3 years. His dysmorphic phenotype was less evident, with bitemporal narrowing and metopic ridge as main features (Fig. 1B). Upon birth, a ventricular septal defect was detected, which closed spontaneously at a later age. An MRI performed at the age of 3 years old showed no clear brain abnormalities (Fig. 1D). The clinical features of the patients are summarized in Table 1.Whole exome sequencing was performed in the two male patients from unrelated families to uncover the cause of their intellectual disability. Mutations in OGT were found in both patients.In patient 1, trio-sequencing and filtering for de novo variants revealed two potential candidate genes. A heterozygous de novo mutation was found in bromodomain-containing protein 1 (BRD1): Chr22(GRCh38): g.49,823,630C>G; NM_001304808.1: c.688G>C (p.Val230Leu). In addition, a hemizygous de novo missense variant in OGT was discovered: ChrX(GRCh38): g.71,555,312G>C; NM_181672.2: c.851G>C (p.Arg284Pro) (Fig. 2A). Arg-284 is conserved among many vertebrates and some invertebrates such as Drosophila (supplemental Fig. S1). In silico analysis of p.Arg284Pro in OGT predicted pathogenicity of the mutation (Table 2). The heterozygous nature of the mutation in BRD1, in addition to lower pathogenicity predictions for p.Val230Leu (Table 2), made this variant less likely to be pathogenic.For patient 2, a gene panel for known intellectual disability genes and de novo analysis did not reveal a potential causative mutation. Further analysis of the exome data by filtering for variants following an autosomal recessive or X-linked inheritance showed a hemizygous variant in OGT: ChrX(GRCh38): g.71,544,561T>G; NM_181672.2: c.463\u20136T>G. Segregation analysis revealed that the mutation originates from a de novo mutation in the grandmother of the patient, passed on via the mother, who is the carrier (Fig. 2A). The thymine at position c.463\u20136 is highly conserved (phyloP score of 6.93), and in silico splicing analysis of c.463\u20136T>G predicted an effect on the canonical splice site. RT-PCR in patient fibroblasts showed an additional splice variant for OGT (Fig. 2B). Sanger sequencing showed a deletion of 69 base pairs, corresponding to skipping of exon 4 caused by partial loss of the canonical splice site in patient 2 (Fig. 2B). Skipping of exon 4 could result in a truncated protein with a loss of 23 amino acids (\u0394155\u2013177-OGT).Both mutations in OGT were absent in >60,000 controls (ExAC database) (31). Thus, we have identified two XLID patients that possess two novel mutations in OGT.Given that OGT is a glycosyltransferase, we next investigated the effects of the XLID mutations on global O-GlcNAc levels in lysates from patient-derived fibroblasts by immunoblotting. As controls, we used fibroblasts from an unrelated male neonate (control 1) and a female adult (control 2). Using the RL2 anti-O-GlcNAc antibody, we observed no substantial difference in global O-GlcNAc levels between the controls and patients (Fig. 3, A and B). To verify the specificity of this O-GlcNAc antibody, cell lysates were treated with a bacterial O-GlcNAcase from Clostridium perfringens (CpOGA), leading to a loss of O-GlcNAc signal compared with untreated lysates (Fig. 3A). As an independent control experiment, we applied a recently developed method to detect O-GlcNAcylated proteins, which relies on detection using a tagged inactive bacterial O-GlcNAcase (D298N-CpOGA) (32). In this experiment, no substantial differences were observed in global O-GlcNAc levels in fibroblasts derived from patients versus healthy controls (Fig. 3, C and D).We next investigated the effects of the OGT mutations on levels of OGT and OGA mRNA and protein. Gene expression levels of OGT and OGA appeared to be unaffected in patient fibroblasts compared with those of the controls (Fig. 4A). Although OGT protein levels appeared reduced in both patients compared with the healthy controls (Fig. 4, B and C), there was considerable variability in OGT protein levels of the healthy controls (Fig. 4, B and C). At the mRNA level, two OGT variants (corresponding to WT and mis-spliced products) were present for patient 2 (Fig. 2B). However, at the protein level, comparative analysis with recombinantly expressed \u0394155\u2013177-OGT (Fig. 4F) did not show evidence for presence of a truncated OGT protein, suggesting that \u0394155\u2013177-OGT may be unstable/degraded in the context of these patient fibroblasts. There was a reduction in OGA protein levels, although again variability was observed in OGA protein levels of the healthy controls (Fig. 4, D and E). Thus, OGT mutations may lead to reduced functional OGT protein levels in patient-derived fibroblasts, which may be compensated for with down-regulation of OGA protein levels, thereby maintaining global O-GlcNAc levels.The absence of the truncated OGT in patient 2 and potential reductions in OGT protein levels in patient-derived fibroblasts suggest that the mutations may compromise OGT stability. To further investigate this, stability of recombinant wild-type/mutant OGT TPR domain was analyzed by thermal denaturation experiments. We observed reduced stability for \u0394155\u2013177-OGT (Tm = 51 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) and R284P-OGT (Tm = 52 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) compared with wild-type OGT TPR domain (Tm = 59 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) (Fig. 5A). Given that \u0394155\u2013177-OGT was not detected in patient-derived fibroblasts, further biochemical characterization of this mutant was omitted. OGT has over 1000 O-GlcNAcylation substrates; therefore, to explore the effects of the p.Arg284Pro mutation in an environment similar to that of cell physiology, de-O-GlcNAcylated HEK-293 cell lysate was employed as a complex array of substrates. R284P-OGT was not able to restore protein O-GlcNAcylation, to the extent achieved by wild-type OGT (Fig. 5B).OGT is known to possess a second catalytic activity, promoting autocatalytic cleavage and activation of the transcriptional co-regulator HCF1, itself an XLID gene (33, 34), via an intermediate glycosylation step (13, 35). Thus, we decided to investigate the effects of the p.Arg284Pro substitution on OGT-mediated HCF1 processing. To measure proteolytic activity, we used a GST fusion of a minimal HCF1 fragment (HCF1-rep1) possessing the first of the PRO repeats (which are the target sites of proteolysis; Fig. 5C). Wild-type OGT was able to hyperglycosylate HCF1-rep1, as evidenced by a band shift that was reversible by incubation with CpOGA (Fig. 5D). The HCF1-rep1 band shift observed in the R284P-OGT-catalyzed reaction was smaller, suggesting that the mutant OGT was less effective than the wild type in glycosylating HCF1-rep1 (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, wild-type OGT was able to induce autoproteolysis, whereas the proteolytic activity of R284P-OGT was reduced (Fig. 5D). When the enzyme concentration was reduced relative to substrate levels, proteolytic activity of R284P-OGT was abrogated, whereas wild-type enzyme still displayed detectable activity (Fig. 5E). Thus, recombinant R284P-OGT is defective in HCF1 glycosylation and proteolytic processing.Here, we report two patients with XLID attributable to hemizygous mutations in OGT: one missense mutation (p.Arg284Pro) and one splice-site mutation (c.463\u20136T>G). We identified potential perturbations in protein O-GlcNAc homeostasis in both patients and altered HCF1 maturation in patient 1.XLID is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of disorders, estimated to account for \u223c10% of all intellectual disability phenotypes in males (36). Mutations causing XLID have been reported in over 100 genes, and new XLID genes are still being identified (37). In 2015, Niranjan et al. (30) published a series of 65 potential XLID genes, by sequencing the X-exome of 56 XLID families. This was the first publication in which a genetic variant in OGT (p.Leu254Phe) was found associated with XLID. During the course of our work, Vaidyanathan et al. (38) reported a study on the functional characterization of this previously published p.Leu254Phe variant of OGT (30). In patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells, decreased OGT levels were accompanied by decreased OGA levels, resulting in unaltered O-GlcNAc levels. This is in agreement with our findings in both patient-derived fibroblast cell lines, indicating that homeostasis of O-GlcNAc levels through decreasing OGA could be a general principle in cases of OGT deficiency. However, in contrast to our results, recombinantly expressed p.Leu254Phe OGT and wild-type OGT showed equal activity toward O-GlcNAc substrate CK2\u03b1 and HCF-1 (38). Another study described a missense mutation in OGT (p.Ala319Thr) in an XLID family, although this mutant also segregated with a previously uncharacterized variant of MED12, another gene that is associated with XLID. Evidence for functional loss of OGT for this mutation was not provided (29).To date, including our findings, four hemizygous mutations in OGT have been identified in patients with XLID (Table 1). The three missense mutations (p.Arg284Pro, p.Leu254Phe, and p.Ala319Thr) and one splice-site mutation (c.463\u20136T>G) all affect the N-terminal TPR domain (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1). The TPR motif is characterized by a repeat of 34 amino acids that fold into two antiparallel helices. The TPR domain consists of 13.5 repeats, and the antiparallel helices align to form an elongated superhelix, where the first helix of each TPR repeat (helix A) faces toward the inner surface of the elongated superhelix and their antiparallel pairs (helix B) form the outer surface (11). The missense mutations p.Arg284Pro, p.Leu254Phe, and p.Ala319Thr are located in helix B of the OGT TPR7, TPR8, and TPR9, respectively (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, Ala-319 is one of the conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues of the canonical TPR repeat (39) (supplemental Fig. S1). Each of these missense mutations could disrupt the \u03b1-helical secondary structure of the TPR domain, thereby affecting the overall stability of the elongated superhelix (Fig. 2D). Arg-284 is located in the middle of TPR helix 7B, and mutation of this residue to a Pro likely disrupts this secondary structure element, destabilizing this region.The splice-site mutation c.463\u20136T>G is predicted to result in an OGT protein missing 23 amino acids (p.\u0394155\u2013177) (Fig. 2B), although we could not confirm the presence of a truncated OGT in patient fibroblasts (Fig. 4F). We propose that this mutation might exert its effect by producing an unstable splice variant and reducing the amount of functional OGT within the cell (Figs. 4B and 5A). Global O-GlcNAc levels in patient-derived fibroblasts were not substantially reduced compared with healthy controls (Fig. 3). Protein levels of OGT and OGA appeared to be reduced in both patients; however, both healthy controls displayed variation in their OGT and OGA levels, complicating the interpretation of these findings. We hypothesize that the decrease in OGT protein levels in these cells might be counteracted by the concomitant reduction of OGA protein levels (Fig. 4, D and E), thereby sustaining basal O-GlcNAc homeostasis. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that chemical inhibition of OGA in different human cell lines leads to a decreased expression of OGT and an increased expression of OGA (18), which indicates an as-yet-unidentified mechanism of regulation to maintain global O-GlcNAc homeostasis. We propose a similar mechanism in our patient-derived fibroblasts.It is as yet not fully understood how OGT recognizes serines/threonines on specific proteins for O-GlcNAcylation, although there is evidence to suggest that the TPRs play a key role for at least a subset of substrates (40). To assess the in vitro activity of OGT with mutations affecting the TPR domain and the impact on substrate O-GlcNAcylation, we produced recombinant R284P-OGT. Given that \u0394155\u2013177-OGT was not detected in patient-derived fibroblasts, further biochemical characterization of this mutant was not undertaken. Activity assays against de-O-GlcNAcylated HEK-293 lysate demonstrated that the p.Arg284Pro mutation led to a global reduction in protein O-GlcNAcylation, as opposed to reducing recognition and O-GlcNAcylation of specific substrates. In a physiological context, this nonspecific reduction in OGT activity may be rescued by down-regulation of OGA levels, which was observed to some extent in the fibroblasts from both patients. However, the p.Arg284Pro mutation is located on the surface of the TPRs (11), a region that has been shown to play a role in the recognition of specific substrates (40). It is therefore possible that this mutation could affect modification of specific substrates, in addition to causing the observed global reduction in substrate O-GlcNAcylation, and this possibility is neither excluded nor confirmed by our current data. O-GlcNAcylation activity of R284P-OGT against HCF1-rep1 was reduced, as judged by the poly-O-GlcNAcylation-induced shift in HCF1-rep1 molecular weight versus wild-type OGT (Fig. 5D).In addition to being abundantly O-GlcNAcylated (15), HCF1 is also proteolytically processed by OGT (12, 35). The p.Arg284Pro mutation appears to alter HCF1-rep1 proteolysis in vitro (Fig. 5, D and E). The TPR domain is critical for proteolytic maturation of HCF1 (13), and this could explain why R284P-OGT shows decreased proteolytic activity toward HCF1 in vitro. Interestingly, HCFC1, the gene that codes for HCF1, is located on the X-chromosome, and it is reported as an XLID gene (41). This hints at possible overlap in downstream disease mechanisms causing intellectual disability in patients bearing OGT or HCFC1 mutations.Precisely how alterations in protein O-GlcNAcylation and HCF1 cleavage lead to intellectual disability is not yet clear. OGT is expressed in a broad range of tissues, with a remarkably high expression in brain (9, 10). O-GlcNAc-modified proteins were detected in nerve terminals, and abundant OGT activity was detected in nerve synaptosomes (42), indicating that O-GlcNAc could play a role in neuronal function and neurodegenerative disease. It has been suggested that regulation of the proteasome complex by O-GlcNAcylation in the brain could contribute to apoptosis of hippocampal cells and thus neurodegeneration (43). In addition, aberrant O-GlcNAcylation levels have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (28). Future work analyzing the effect of XLID mutations on OGT function in a more phenotype-relevant model, such as a neuronal cell line or an animal model where the effect of the mutations on different tissues, including the brain, can be investigated, would be important. The present study utilized fibroblasts from two unrelated individuals as controls, and we noted substantial variability in OGA and OGT protein levels in these cells, complicating the interpretation of our data. To minimize the effect of variability introduced by the differing genetic background between individual patients and controls, it would be of use to introduce these mutations into cell lines with an identical genetic background. Our study provides the first detailed clinical characterization of patients with XLID attributable to mutations in OGT and furthermore proposes a potential molecular explanation for how these mutations may impact on OGT dual function of O-GlcNAcylation and HCF1 proteolysis.The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Radboud University Medical Centre and Utrecht University Medical Centre. All participating affected individuals or their legal representatives gave informed consent for exome sequencing and to publication of this study. Fibroblasts of the patients were obtained for diagnostics of inborn errors of metabolism and used after informed consent from parents and/or treating physicians, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. For use of facial images, written informed consent was obtained.For patient 1, whole exome sequencing was performed in a trio diagnostic approach as described before (44). Exome capture was performed with the SureSelect Human All Exon v4 enrichment kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Whole exome sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform (San Diego, CA). Data were analyzed with the BWA (read alignment) and GATK (variant calling) software packages. Variants were annotated using an in-house developed pipeline. Prioritization of variants was done by an in-house designed \u201cvariant interface\u201d and manual curation.Exomes of patient 2 and parents were enriched using the SureSelect XT Human All Exon V5 kit (Agilent) and sequenced in rapid run mode on the HiSeq2500 sequencing system (Illumina) at a mean target depth of 100\u00d7. The target is defined as all coding exons of UCSC and Ensembl \u00b1 20-bp intron flanks. At this depth >95% of the target is covered at least 15 times. Reads were aligned to hg19 using BWA (BWA-MEM v0.7.5a), and variants were called using the GATK haplotype caller (v2.7-2). Detected variants were annotated, filtered, and prioritized using the Bench NGS Lab platform (Cartagenia; Agilent). The OGT gene sequences of the grandmother and great-grandmother were analyzed to study the origin of the mutation. All potentially causative variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Skin fibroblasts derived from patients and healthy donors were cultured at 37 \u00b0C under 5.0% CO2 in M199 medium (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Labtech, Uckfield, UK) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Total cell RNA was extracted from skin fibroblasts using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was synthesized with a RevertAid First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using random hexamer primers. For quantification of OGT and OGA expression levels, cDNA from skin fibroblasts was mixed with GoTaq\u00ae qPCR Master Mix (Promega) and both forward and reverse primers. Tubulin expression was used as an internal control. All qPCR experiments were conducted at Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time system following the GoTaq\u00ae qPCR Master Mix manual. Specificity of the reactions was verified with melt curve analysis. The primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. For analysis of OGT mRNA splicing in skin fibroblaststk;1 of patient 2, cDNA and primers were mixed with AmpliTaq Gold\u00ae 360 Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RT-PCR was conducted according to standard conditions and PCR products were purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified PCR products were used for sequencing analysis.Patient-derived fibroblasts were grown on 15-cm plates and were washed twice with ice-cold PBS buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) prior to lysis. The cells were lysed by addition of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm pyrophosphate, 0.27 m sucrose) supplemented with 1 \u03bcm GlcNAcstatin-G, 1 \u03bcm \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm PMSF, 5 mm leupeptin). The lysate was transferred into an Eppendorf and clarified by centrifugation at 4 \u00b0C (1200 \u00d7 g for 15 min). Lysate proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4\u201312% acrylamide; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Analysis of O-GlcNAcylated fibroblast proteins by the far Western method was performed as described previously (32). Briefly, soluble cell lysates were prepared, resolved by SDS-PAGE (3\u20138% Tris acetate; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) as described above, but with lysis buffer lacking GlcNAcstatin-G.Full-length wild-type OGT and mutants (R284P and \u0394155\u2013177) were expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal His fusion proteins as described previously (45). The wild-type OGT TPR domain (residues 26\u2013420) and mutants (TPR-R284P and TPR-\u0394155\u2013177) were expressed and purified as described previously (11). HCF1-rep1 (residues 867\u20131071) was expressed in E. coli as a non-cleavable N-terminal GST and C-terminal His fusion protein. Transformed BL21 (DE3) cells were grown, induced for expression, lysed, and clarified as described previously (45). Clarified lysate was incubated with 1 ml/liter of culture of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The resin was thoroughly washed with base buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP) and eluted using base buffer supplemented with 0.5 m glutathione. Eluted protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 \u00b0C in buffer A (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl). Dialyzed protein was passed through 5 ml of HiTrap Q-Sepharose FF anion exchange resin (GE Healthcare), collecting the flow-through, which was then concentrated and passed through a 300-ml SuperdexTM 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with base buffer. The peak fractions were concentrated to 10 mg/ml, mixed 1:1 with 50% glycerol, snap-frozen, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.The fragment of HCF1-rep1 (residues 867\u20131071) was obtained from MVP human total brain RNA from Agilent using the Takara PrimeScript high-fidelity RT-PCR kit. The reverse primer coded for the C-terminal addition of a His6 tag. The PCR product was cloned as a BamHI-NotI fragment into a mutated version of pGEX6P1, which lacks the PreScission protease site. The full-length codon optimized OGT was obtained from GenScript and subcloned as a BamHI-NotI fragment into pHEX6P1 (modified version of pGEX6P1 which contains a His6 tag instead of GST). The R284P and the \u0394155\u2013177 mutations were introduced using a method similar to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) but using KOD polymerase and DpnI from Fermentas. All inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Thermal denaturing experiments were performed in triplicate, using the OGT TPR domain constructs. 50-\u03bcl solutions contained 5 \u03bcm protein and 1.1x SYPRO\u00ae Orange dye (Sigma) in base buffer of 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP. A Bio-Rad (CFX ConnectTM real-time system was used to measure fluorescence (\u03bbex = 530 nm, \u03bbem = 560 nm) while temperature was increased from 25 to 95 \u00b0C at 1\u00b0/min increments. The data were transformed, normalized, and fitted to a Boltzmann sigmoidal curve using GraphPad Prism 5.0.O-GlcNAcylation assays were performed in triplicate on de-O-GlcNAcylated HEK-293 lysate proteins. HEK-293 cell lysates were prepared as described for patient-derived fibroblasts, but with the lysis buffer lacking GlcNAcstatin-G. HEK-293 lysate was treated with 120 \u03bcg of CpOGA per mg of lysate protein and incubated for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C. CpOGA was neutralized by the addition of 250 \u03bcm GlcNAcstatin-G. Reactions were supplemented with wild-type OGT or R284P-OGT (0.2 \u03bcm) in the presence of 2 mm UDP-GlcNAc and incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (3\u20138% acrylamide; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare).Proteolytic assays were performed using HCF1-rep1 (residues 867\u20131071) with GST and His tags at the N and C termini, respectively. For qualitative measurement of proteolytic activity, HCF1-rep1 (2.5 \u03bcm), preincubated or not with CpOGA (5 \u03bcm), was combined with wild-type OGT or R284P-OGT (1 \u03bcm) in the presence of 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 8 h with gentle agitation, followed by optional addition of CpOGA. Mixtures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 1 h, before stopping the reaction by addition of LDS loading buffer (4\u00d7) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4\u201312% acrylamide; Life Technologies) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Initial velocity for OGT-catalyzed proteolysis of HCF1-rep1 was measured in triplicate. HCF1-rep1 (1.5 \u03bcm) was combined with wild-type OGT or R284P-OGT (0.15 \u03bcm) in the presence of 150 \u03bcm UDP-GlcNAc. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with gentle agitation, whereas aliquots were taken out at the designated time points (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 h) and stopped by mixing with LDS loading buffer (4\u00d7) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The initial volume of the reaction was 90 \u03bcl, and 2.5-\u03bcl aliquots were loaded in each lane. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and visualized by Coomassie staining. The amount of product formed was quantified using a LI-COR Odyssey scanner and associated quantification software. The data were background-corrected and plotted using GraphPad Prism 5.0.Membranes were probed with following primary antibodies: O-GlcNAc (RL2; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), actin (Sigma), OGT (H300; Santa Cruz), OGA (14711-1-AP; Proteintech, Rosemont, IL), tubulin (Cell Signaling), HSP-90 (Cell Signaling), and GST-S902 (Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, University of Dundee). In case of the far Western method, membranes were probed with 10 \u03bcg/ml Halo-tagged CpOGA and incubated with halo primary antibody (Promega). Subsequently all membranes were incubated with IR680- or IR800-labeled secondary antibodies (LI-COR) and analyzed using a LI-COR Odyssey scanner and associated quantification software. All primary and secondary antibodies were used in 1:5,000 and 1:10,000 dilutions, respectively.Scatter plots indicate ratios of any given normalized signal as averaged from three biological replicates, with the error bars representing standard deviation.

However, obese subjects differ in insulin resistance, adipokine production and co-morbidities. Based on fasting plasma analysis, obese subjects were grouped as Low Acylation Stimulating protein (ASP) and Triglyceride (TG) (LAT) vs High ASP and TG (HAT).

By contrast, oxidation related genes were decreased (AMPK, UCP1, CPT1, FABP7).

The incidence of obesity has increased dramatically in the last decade throughout the world. The rate of deaths from obesity related diseases is also on the rise. Understanding the factors that contribute to obesity related diseases is crucial to help obese patients achieve better health status. Notwithstanding the strong associations of obesity with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, it has been recognized in recent years that not all forms of obesity are the same. Visceral obesity presents a greater risk for obesity related disease than subcutaneous obesity. Classification of obese populations based on their level of insulin sensitivity identifies distinct subsets variously referred to as insulin-sensitive obese, metabolically-healthy but obese, and metabolically-normal obese. In each of these cases, specific parameters, such as glucose or insulin, are within the normal healthy range found in non-obese subjects. Most studies classify \"healthier obese subjects\" according to insulin sensitivity, but also according to other parameters such as HDL cholesterol, plasma triglycerides, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, LDL cholesterol, and visceral fat. We have recently shown that intracellular insulin signalling pathways in adipose tissue are different between insulin sensitive versus insulin resistant obese subjects. However, in addition to altered glucose metabolism, dyslipidemias, such as elevated plasma triglyceride (TG), are common in obesity and are an independent risk factor for many diseases including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. When coupled with other risk factors such as high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or insulin resistance, the risk for these diseases increases. Accordingly, in the present study, obese subjects were evaluated based on characterization according to fasting triglyceridemia and acylation stimulating protein (ASP) to examine potential differences in adipose tissue gene expression. Cellular studies have demonstrated that acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is a main anabolic stimulator of TG storage in adipose tissue and is produced by adipocytes. ASP stimulates TG synthesis via the ASP receptor, C5L2, a seven transmembrane G protein coupled receptor. Downstream several key signalling proteins have been identified, including phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, Akt and protein kinase C culminating in increased glucose transport and diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity. ASP is identical to C3adesArg and is produced through the interaction of the precursor protein C3, Factor B, and adipsin (a.k.a. Factor D), components of the alternative complement immune pathway which are secreted by adipose tissue. In the adipose tissue milieu ASP levels increase postprandially, although general circulating levels change little. Overall, fasting ASP is strongly predictive of postprandial TG (evaluated as area-under-the-curve: AUC) in both men and women. ASP is increased in obesity, as well as insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome, all disorders associated with obesity. However obesity is not an essential feature of elevated ASP levels, as ASP is increased in subjects with diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome, even in the absence of obesity. A direct association between plasma ASP on one hand and the metabolic function of the subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue on the other hand are unknown, and this is the first study to examine this. Further there are no studies on C5L2 adipose expression in humans. Our hypothesis was that morbidly obese subjects separated based on the fasting plasma levels of ASP and TG into HAT (High ASP and Triglyceride) and LAT (Low ASP and Triglyceride) groups would demonstrate differential expression of genes in lipid metabolic and inflammatory biologic pathways. Characterization of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue using a microarray approach was used. To target lipid metabolic and inflammatory biologic pathways, all known genes in these pathways were identified and all those available in the microarray were pooled a priori, and then expression in LAT vs HAT for both subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue was evaluated. A total of 11 subjects participated in the microarray study. A fasting blood sample and subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue samples were taken from each subject. Of the 21 adipose samples, 20 were paired omental (OM) and subcutaneous (SC) samples from 10 subjects, and the remaining SC sample was unpaired. As shown in Table 1, the subjects were divided into 2 groups based on an ASP-TG lipemic index (as described in methods). Using this functional ASP calculation two groups were defined, one with low ASP, low TG, and thus a lower lipemic index which we have termed the Low ASP and TG group (LAT, n = 4) and a second group with high ASP (60.5 \u00b1 11.7 vs. 36.1 \u00b1 7.4 nmol/L), TG (2.01 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 mmol/L), and lipemic index (119.5 \u00b1 22.2 vs. 44.8 \u00b1 5.7, p < 0.05), which we have termed the High ASP and TG group (HAT, n = 7). Both groups were morbidly obese based on body mass index (BMI) where a BMI > 30 kg/m2 is considered obese and BMI > 40.0 kg/m2 is morbidly obese. The two groups did not differ significantly in average BMI (52.0 \u00b1 5.8 vs. 56.4 \u00b1 4.7, p=ns), nor in average age. Average insulin and glucose values were the same between the two groups (Table 1, p ns for all). While none of the patients had been previously diagnosed as diabetic, at the time of pre-operative sampling one subject in the LAT group and two subjects in the HAT group had glucose values > 7.0. For all tables and figures, the data are presented as averages \u00b1 SEM for the groups as indicated. In order to avoid sample bias, no samples were pooled prior to microarray analysis, and all 21 tissue samples were analysed individually. Two different analysis paradigms were used for the evaluation of the microarray results: (i) overall evaluation using SAM analysis and (ii) evaluation targeting the specific biological pathways of interest, lipid metabolism and inflammation. As the primary hypothesis was to evaluate LAT (Low ASP-TG index) vs HAT (High ASP-TG index) we first compared these two groups using overall analysis. The cDNA microarrays contained a total of ~20,000 probes (~10,000 human genes, plus ESTs, housekeeping genes, and positive and negative controls) which were analysed for all 21 samples. Information on Codelink Uniset 20K I Gene List #30019 can be obtained directly from http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/microarrays/codelink_genelists.html. The complete data set is reported in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ as Accession # GSE 15524. SAM (Significant Analysis of Microarrays) analysis was performed on SC and OM samples separately, but using the same analysis parameters. The SAM procedure using version 3.09 is available at http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM using suggested guidelines. This program is a validated statistical technique for identifying differentially expressed genes across high density microarrays. With an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of 2.0%, and a minimum of a 2-fold change considered significant, 464 genes were identified as significantly different between HAT and LAT in SC tissue (which represents 2.3% of all genes on the microarray). Using the same analysis parameters, no genes were identified as significantly different between HAT and LAT in OM tissue. Using less stringent criteria (FDR = 5% and minimum 2-fold change), 1236 genes were identified in SC, but again, none in OM tissue. Even when criteria were relaxed to an FDR of 15%, only 6 genes were identified in OM. Thus, the major changes between HAT and LAT were restricted to SC adipose tissue. When gene expression in OM tissue was compared to SC tissue using paired analysis and stringent parameters (FDR = 2.0% and minimum 2 fold difference), only 108 genes were identified. Using less stringent criteria (FDR = 5%, minimum 2 fold change), only 178 significant genes were identified. By far, the major differences in gene expression in relation to the classification of subjects as HAT or LAT using the lipemic index (plasma ASP and TG) in this sample set are in SC adipose tissue. Therefore further analysis was focused on SC tissue, although supplementary information is provided for omental tissue as well. The genes identified in SC adipose tissue were further examined. Of those genes identified as different using FDR = 2.0% and a minimum twofold change, 453 were up-regulated (positive genes) and 11 were down-regulated (negative genes) in HAT subjects as compared to LAT with q values for the genes identified ranging from 0.00000 to 0.02103. Gene description and access to Codelink Uniset 20K I Gene List #30019 http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/microarrays/codelink_genelists.html were used to assign the genes manually into functional categories. Many of the genes identified (~50%) were tagged as EST, \"hypothetical proteins\" or clones labelled based on putative protein sequence as \"similar to\" or \"hypothetical\" with no known function. Of the genes with assigned function, the positively regulated genes coded for proteins involved in extracellular signalling (including cell-cell signalling and endocrine functions), intracellular signalling, intermediary metabolism and energy metabolism, structural proteins, transcription and translation (including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and proteolysis) based on manual group assignment. A supplementary table listing the positive and negative genes is available upon request. As the specific aim of the study was to evaluate the biological pathways of storage lipid metabolism and inflammation, areas of current interest in adipose tissue biology, a specific analysis was then undertaken of pathways of interest in SC adipose tissue. First, housekeeping genes (as controls) were identified, then genes potentially involved in ASP and C5L2 function were identified. As ASP represents a crossroad of immune and lipid metabolism, targeted pathways included all genes for proteins that could be identified in ASP generation, complement related factors, storage lipid metabolism including TG synthesis, lipolysis and oxidation, adipocyte differentiation, and inflammatory genes. The method of analysis was the following: (i) all functional genes within the identified biologic pathways were listed; (ii) accession numbers were identified using Entrez Gene http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; (iii) the Codelink gene list was screened to tag all of the accession numbers present in the array; (iv) all genes identified, and the associated SC and OM datasets were then pooled before initiating statistical analysis and (v) the data was then analyzed for HAT vs LAT. Using this approach where biologic pathways were identified a priori followed by subsequent statistical analysis, of the 88 functional genes identified (excluding housekeeping genes), 51 were differentially expressed in relation to HAT vs LAT (Additional File 1, Table S1), either increased or decreased, which represents 58%. A number of these genes had also been identified using the SAM analysis (such as genes involved in lipid synthesis); this is a substantial pathway enrichment. The expression of 4 housekeeping genes suggested for studies in adipose was evaluated across all 11 SC samples was evaluated (Additional File 2, Table S2). The expression of B2M, GUSB, PPIA, and TFRC were constant across all 11 samples with no significant differences when LAT and HAT were compared. There were no significant correlations between any of the housekeeping genes and age, BMI, or fasting plasma levels of ASP, TG, insulin, or glucose. The expression of insulin receptor (InsR), insulin receptor substrates 1 and 4 (IRS1 and IRS4), insulin like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF1 and IGF2) were also evaluated (Additional File 2, Table). The expression of these genes was also constant across all 11 samples and not significantly different between the two groups, which is consistent with the plasma data for insulin and glucose. There were no significant correlations between these genes and age or BMI. As the two groups have similar insulin related gene profiles, differences between the 2 groups are not likely explained by differences in insulin signalling or sensitivity. We next looked at genes related to plasma ASP generation by adipose tissue. As previously published, the key genes in the conversion of complement C3 to its ASP form (aka C3adesArg) are all produced by adipocytes: C3, factor B (FB), adipsin (or factor D), and carboxypeptidase N (CPN1). Additionally, factors that enhance or inhibit the process are also produced by adipocytes: factors H, I, and properdin. As shown in Figure 1A, C3, factor B and factor H are all moderately increased in HAT vs LAT (where LAT is set as 100%). We also analyzed the expression pattern of CR1, aka CD35, an inhibitor to both the classical and alternative complement pathways. CR1 inhibits both C3 and C5 convertases, thus decreasing production of C5a, C3a and desArg forms including ASP, and has a high affinity for C3b. As CR1 was decreased in HAT SC tissue (Figure 1A) this reduction may be permissive for increased ASP production via C3 convertase. Properdin, which stabilizes C3 convertase, also tended to be increased (Additional File 1, Table S1). Additionally, C3, adipsin and factor B were all closely correlated to one another in SC tissue (Figure 1B to 1D). These 3 genes also correlated closely with other genes and have been termed the \"ASP triad\" in the present study. In omental (OM) tissue, although expression of C3 and factor B were higher than in SC, overall there was no difference between LAT and HAT for any of the factors other than a decrease in factor B in HAT subjects (Additional File 1, Table S1). As C5L2, a newly identified receptor, was not present on the microarray used for analysis, quantitative expression of C5L2 in the LAT and HAT groups was measured using TAQMAN real time RT-PCR via the delta-delta Ct method relative to expression of B2M, a housekeeping gene. For the real time RT-PCR, a non-obese control group was added and results are provided for both SC and OM tissue, as this is the first quantitative measurement of C5L2 in human adipose tissue. This additional non-obese group had the following characteristics: BMI 25.1 \u00b1 1.4 kg/m2, age 54.8 \u00b1 7.6 years, plasma ASP 30.4 \u00b1 1.5 nmol/L, plasma TG 1.12 \u00b1 0.18 mmol/L, glucose 3.75 \u00b1 0.21 mmol/L, insulin 137.2 \u00b1 16.1 pmol/L and lipemic index 34.8 \u00b1 6.7. As shown in Figure 2A, using 2-way ANOVA, there is a significant difference in groups (p < 0.0001), but no significant difference between tissues (SC vs OM). With post-hoc analysis, HAT is significantly increased vs LAT in SC and OM (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively), and HAT is also significantly different from NO in SC and OM (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), while there was no significant difference between LAT and NO. There was also a positive correlation between expression in SC adipose tissue and OM adipose tissue, such that subjects with high expression in SC tissue also had high expression in OM (R = 0.676, p = 0.023). The majority of the genes involved in ASP production were initially identified as being alternative complement factors and thus part of the immune system. Therefore we looked at the regulation of other complement factors, including C5 and two receptors of complement activation, C3aR and C5aR. The sequence of C5L2 closely resembles these two receptors. It has been demonstrated that C3a, C5a, and ASP all bind to C5L2, only C3a binds to C3aR, and only C5a binds to C5aR. Both C3aR and C5aR are expressed at similar levels in the LAT and HAT groups for both SC and OM tissues (Figure 2B and Additional File 1, Table S1) and there is no significant correlation with C3, factor B or adipsin, although C5 had a negative correlation. A wide variety of genes are involved in dietary lipid storage and de novo lipid synthesis. We have focused here on all of the key genes that could be identified from each pathway including fatty acid and glucose transporters (CD36, GLUT4), and TG synthesis enzymes such as diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 and DGAT2), and fatty acid elongating enzymes (ELOV) potentially related to ASP function. Microarray analysis revealed increased expression of fatty acid transporter (CD36) but decreased glucose transporter (GLUT4, Figure 3). Genes involved in TG synthesis were up-regulated in the HAT group, including stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD1), DGAT1 and DGAT 2, fatty acid synthase (FASN), phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP2A2) and malic enzyme (ME1) (Figure 3, Additional File 1, Table S1). On the other hand, other genes related to de novo fatty acid synthesis were down-regulated (Figure 3B). The fatty acid elongation enzyme genes (ELOVL2 and ELOVL4) were both down-regulated (Figure 3B). By contrast there were no significant differences in OM tissue, other than an increase in ME1 in HAT subjects (Additional File 1, Table S1). It is interesting to note that there is a significant correlation with the ASP triad (C3/B/adipsin) and specific lipid metabolic genes, where DB1, DGAT1, ME1 and Glut4 are examples (Figure 3 and Additional File 1, Table S1) Several other genes correlated well within the group of metabolic genes such as DGAT1, DGAT2, SCD1, FASN, GLUT4 and ELOV2 (Figure 3 and Additional File 1, Table S1). A number of intracellular and extracellular adipocyte lipases hydrolyze TG. The main extracellular lipase, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hydrolyzes dietary fats, releasing fatty acids for cellular transport and intracellular esterification to TG. LPL and hepatic lipase (LIPC), both of which localize to the cell surface membrane, tended to be up-regulated in the HAT group vs LAT and correlated significantly with the ASP triad in SC tissue (Figure 4A, 4C, 4D). On the other hand, two additional extracellular lipases, pancreatic lipase (PNLIP) and endothelial lipase (EL), were down-regulated (Figure 4B and Additional File 1, Table S1). Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) was considered the primary intracellular adipocyte lipase responsible for releasing fatty acids from the cell; however, additional lipases have subsequently been identified. Both HSL, and perilipin, which interacts directly with HSL to regulate lipolysis, were up-regulated in the HAT group (Figure 4E) as were carboxylesterase 1 (CES1, aka triacylglycerol lipase) and monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) (Figure 4E). These lipases correlated closely with the metabolic genes GLUT4, DGAT2 and HSL (Figure 4G, 4H, Additional File 1, Table S1). Adiponutrin, on the other hand, was down-regulated in the HAT group (Figure 4F). Again, there were no differences for any of the genes in OM tissue, other than a decrease in LIPC in HAT subjects (Additional File 1, Table S1). A number of genes related to oxidation in adipose tissue were down-regulated in HAT vs LAT (Additional File 1, Table S1), including carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-1C), carnitine acetyltransferase (CRAT), uncoupling protein (UCP1), AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) as well as some AMPK regulatory genes (PRKAB2, PRKAG3, Additional File 1, Table S1). Other AMPK regulatory genes (PRKAA1, PRKAG1, and PRKAG2) were up-regulated in the HAT group (Additional File 1, Table S1). Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) was increased in SC HAT tissue, and had some weak correlations with the ASP triad (Additional File 1, Table S1). The contrasting regulation of ACC and AMPK is reflected in their opposing physiological roles: ACC catalyzes the rate limiting step in fatty acid synthesis and AMPK senses energy availability and inactivates ACC. CPT-1C and UCP1 (Additional File 3, Figure S1) were both correlated with GLUT4 and DGAT2 but, consistent with the trends described above, only partially with any of the genes from the ASP triad (Additional File 1, Table S1). There were no differences in OM tissue between LAT and HAT for any genes except for PRKAG1 which increased in HAT subjects (Additional File 1, Table S1). As shown in Additional File 4, Figure S2, some of the FABP group of genes were up-regulated in the HAT SC tissue, but not all (Additional File 4, Figure S2). Several correlated strongly with the ASP triad (Additional File 4, Figures S2C to S2E). Although FABP4 was first identified in adipose tissue, all of these binding proteins are ubiquitously expressed. Further, FABP2 and FABP7 are decreased (Additional File 4, Figure S2B). The roles of FABP are varied, including differential binding of various fatty acids, with functional links that include signalling and association with transcription factors, channelling to lipid synthesis vs oxidation, cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. These differential roles of FABP may explain the opposite changes. However no differences were detected in OM tissue (Additional File 1, Table S1). Both the C/EBP and the PPAR nuclear receptor families are important factors in adipocyte differentiation. The C/EBP genes \u03b1 and \u03b2 were increased (Figure 5), while C/EBP\u03b5 was decreased (Figure 5B). C/EBP\u03b2 is a checkpoint for differentiation and is induced by C/EBP\u03b1, which is increased early in the differentiation process. Interestingly, C/EBP\u03b3 correlates with the ASP triad (Figure 5C). PPAR\u03b3 is best recognized as a late marker of differentiation. PPAR\u03b3 was increased in the HAT group, along with many of the other differentiation genes (Figure 5A). However, PPAR\u03b4 was an exception, being significantly down-regulated (Figure 5B). While the role of PPAR\u03b4 is not fully understood, it is believed that activation of PPAR\u03b4 leads to increased fatty acid metabolism. In accordance with decreased expression of genes in fatty acid oxidation, and increased expression of fatty acid storage genes, the decrease in PPAR\u03b4 is consistent with that interpretation. The majority of differentiation genes correlate with the metabolic genes (Figure 5). There was no change in OM tissue for any of the genes examined (Additional File 1, Table S1). Recently, there has been intense interest in the potential interactions between adipocytes and macrophages within the adipose tissue milieu. The potential role of ASP in both the immune system and storage lipid metabolism makes it all the more pertinent to examine pro-and anti-inflammatory genes in association with ASP and the lipemic index. The anti-inflammatory genes transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP1, 3 and 4) were increased in the HAT group (Additional File 5, Figure S3A), with decreases in some interleukin genes such as IL4. Of the pro-inflammatory interleukin and receptor genes, there was little difference between the LAT and HAT groups other than for PIG7 (Additional File 5, Figure S3B) with no difference in OM tissue (Additional File 1, Table S1). Hand in hand with inflammation of adipose tissue, is remodelling of adipose tissue. Key genes in this process are macrophage recruitment genes and matrix metalloproteinases. A number of genes for macrophage recruitment tended to be increased in the HAT group in subcutaneous tissue, especially macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) genes which were also closely correlated with the ASP triad of genes (Additional File 6, Figures S4A-S4C). Of the matrix metalloproteinases, MMP20 and MMP10 were significantly down-regulated in the HAT group (Additional File 6, Figures S4D) while MMP 2 was increased. OM tissue had no significant changes between HAT and LAT (Additional File 1, Table S1). Confirmatory analysis by real time PCR using the delta-delta Ct method relative to expression of B2M, a housekeeping gene, was also conducted for 7 additional genes. The genes chosen included two genes with markedly increased expression in HAT vs LAT (CD36 and DGAT2), two genes with moderately increased expression in HAT vs LAT (C3 and CEBP\u03b3) and two genes with little change in expression in HAT vs LAT (C5aR and FABP4). In addition, results for insulin receptor (INSR) were also presented. Further, all genes were analyzed in both SC and OM tissue, for all samples available, in duplicate or triplicate. As can be seen in Table 2, overall results from the real-time PCR correlated well with the results from the microarray analysis in both SC and OM tissues from LAT and HAT subjects. Adipose tissue has been well documented as an endocrine organ in the last two decades. The recognition that ASP (aka C3adesArg) is produced by adipose tissue, and that the three precursor proteins C3, factor B and adipsin, all increase with differentiation of adipocytes was one of the first demonstrations that hormones with both paracrine and endocrine functions were produced within the adipose milieu. The primary function of ASP in adipocytes appears to be promotion of lipid storage, and this is achieved through increases in fatty acid esterification and glucose uptake. A number of human studies have demonstrated positive associations between ASP and various metabolic disturbances (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, nephrotic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome) with or without the presence of obesity. Previous studies have demonstrated that circulating plasma ASP is associated with TG and fatty acid levels, with a strong correlation between fasting ASP and postprandial TG clearance even in non-obese individuals. The demonstration of direct adipose tissue production of ASP postprandially in human studies, coupled to evidence that dietary TG in the form of chylomicrons directly stimulate C3 and ASP production in cultured human adipocytes provides a strong link between plasma ASP and TG. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to evaluate microarray expression in subcutaneous vs. omental adipose tissue in relation to plasma ASP and TG (lipemic index), and genes directly related to ASP production, storage lipid metabolism and inflammation. However, there are several limitations to this study. The samples were derived from morbidly obese subjects, limiting interpretations to that population. Further, although there were often large relative differences between the two groups (LAT vs HAT), the limited number of samples restricted the statistical power. There was also no functional analysis of the adipose tissue. On the other hand, the strengths of the study are that no samples were pooled and microarray analysis was conducted individually on all 21 samples. It should be noted that intact adipose tissue was specifically chosen for the analysis. This tissue represents a pool of adipocytes as well as preadipocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Direct analysis of the tissue prevented the introduction of artefactual changes resulting from processing and separating the various cell populations. Hence, this can be viewed as both a strength and a weakness. Interestingly, while the design of the study allowed for a comprehensive comparison of gene expression between SC and OM adipose tissue, we discovered that the significant differences were found primarily in the SC tissue. SAM analysis determined that OM tissue did not have significant differences between the LAT and HAT groups. Targeted analysis of specific biological pathways allowed us to compare genes from many different gene families simultaneously. Differential results between LAT and HAT in the SC tissue included genes involved in the alternative complement system, lipid synthesis, lipolysis, oxidation, fatty acid binding proteins, markers of differentiation, pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, macrophage recruitment, and matrix remodelling genes. This contrasts markedly with a previous study comparing insulin resistant obese with insulin sensitive obese where differences were primarily noted in OM tissue, with no differences in SC tissue. This is a particularly interesting point. While differences in omental adipose tissue in relationship to insulin resistance have been noted (in microarray studies and others), our present study specifically identified differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue with respect to ASP related metabolism. While differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue have been identified using other biochemical parameters (such as differences in triglyceride synthesis in subcutaneous adipose tissue in non-obese vs obese subjects) this is the first to identify this based on ASP metabolism. We speculate (as a hypothesis to be tested) that this may indicate a compensatory mechanism, whereby genes related to ASP are concomitantly increased with genes related to lipid storage, however this remains to be tested in future studies. In contrast to the demonstrated changes in the gene families described above, there were no significant differences in housekeeping genes, insulin signalling genes and non-related complement genes between these two groups (LAT vs HAT). We demonstrated that four genes commonly reported as housekeeping genes, B2M, GUSB, PPIA, and TFRC, were not significantly different between the LAT and HAT groups nor did they correlate with age or BMI. Further, not only were plasma glucose and insulin comparable between the 2 groups, the expression of genes related to insulin resistance and insulin signalling such as insulin receptor InsR, IRS-1, IRS-4, IGF1, and IGF2 were comparably expressed between LAT and HAT groups, and did not correlate with age or BMI. Further, the expression of other complement genes (C5) and receptors (C3aR, C5aR) that are not involved in ASP production or signalling were not different between groups (LAT and HAT). This suggests that there is selective regulation of metabolic genes directly related to the role of ASP, independent of insulin or other immune related genes. On the other hand, there was a strong association between increased plasma ASP and TG (lipemic index) and expression of the genes related directly to ASP production and function. Thus complement C3, factor B and adipsin were generally increased in the microarray in HAT vs LAT groups. Further, C5L2, the receptor for ASP, was assessed by real-time PCR, and expression was also increased in HAT vs LAT. C5L2, a G protein coupled receptor, has been shown to be present on human adipocytes and preadipocytes, but this is the first quantitative evaluation of C5L2 reported in human adipose tissue. While C5L2 is increased in the HAT group, the expression of C5L2 in the LAT group is very similar to the non-obese control group in both SC and OM tissue. Further, in the present study there was a significant correlation between C5L2 expression in SC and OM adipose tissue. These results are consistent with increased binding of ASP to adipose plasma membranes in obese subjects vs non-obese subjects, although the C5L2 receptor was as yet unrecognized at that time, and no plasma data was available. We have also previously demonstrated an association between SC and OM adipose tissue for radiolabelled ASP binding to plasma membranes, across a range of BMI from obese and non-obese subjects. On the other hand, in our previous study, ASP binding and affinity was greater in SC vs OM adipose tissue, while in the present study, C5L2 mRNA expression was not different in SC vs OM, which could reflect a further level of regulation at the plasma membrane. This is the first study evaluating expression of ASP related genes, including the receptor C5L2, in the context of plasma ASP. The few studies that have examined complement C3 gene expression in adipose tissue have demonstrated associations with BMI, adipose tissue site, insulin sensitivity, age and postprandial lipemia. Only one study examined the levels of plasma ASP in relationship to adipose tissue gene expression and demonstrated significant associations between C3 mRNA, plasma ASP and both insulin sensitivity and postprandial TG. This raises the question whether chronically increased plasma ASP represents an ASP resistant state (analogous to increased plasma insulin reflecting insulin resistance), or whether the increased ASP is compensatory. Hypothetically, the presence of increased plasma ASP, increased expression of C3, factor B and adipsin in the microarray and increased C5L2 based on real-time PCR would suggest a compensatory mechanism, indicative of a more effective response, and interpretation of the results are evaluated in that context below. There was a striking correlation between the three genes most relevant to ASP production: C3, Factor B, and adipsin (aka Factor D), constituting an ASP triad. Other complement genes (C3aR and C5aR) that are neither related to ASP production nor signalling do not correlate with the \"ASP triad.\" This selectivity within the alternative complement pathway and the correlation with many metabolic genes points to the physiological relevance. A general trend observed was that the HAT group has up-regulated genes for lipid TG storage. Along with the high plasma ASP and high C5L2 receptor, there are multiple genes including intracellular lipid storage, lipoprotein lipase, and fatty acid trafficking genes that are increased in the HAT group. The simultaneous increase in both lipid storage and lipolytic genes suggests an overall increase in substrate cycling and fatty acid flux. Concurrently, de novo TG synthesis and oxidative genes were down-regulated. Taken together, the cells appear to be responding to an increased plasma TG level in the HAT group and are increasing their uptake and storage of TG. Many of the increased storage genes correlated with the \"ASP triad\" of genes including DB1 and LPL. Among the oxidative genes, ACC correlates negatively with the ASP triad. Changes in adipose tissue function implicate alterations in differentiation genes, remodelling genes, and inflammatory complications. The HAT group is characterized by increased in differentiation factors CEBP\u03b1, \u03b2, and CEBP\u03b4 as well as PPAR \u03b3, consistent with the increased TG storage genes. Interestingly, we have previously demonstrated that ASP stimulates adipogenesis in cultured 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cells, reflected by early increases in CEBP, followed later by increases in PPAR\u03b3, DGAT-1, adipsin and TG accumulation. The HAT group is also characterized by increased anti-inflammatory gene TGF\u03b21 and inhibitors of metalloproteinases TIMP1, TIMP3 and TIMP4 and decreased metalloproteinase MMP20 and MMP10. On the other hand, there were few increases in pro-inflammatory genes, although pro-inflammatory and cell remodelling factors such as PIG7, CCR2 and MMP2 were increased. An interesting link between the role of the alternative complement pathway factors ASP and C5L2 and immune and adipose have been supported by active demonstration of adipose tissue macrophage infiltration, apoptosis and tissue remodelling in obesity, and the differences demonstrated between HAT and LAT. Overall, the profile of C5L2 receptor, ASP gene expression and metabolic factors in adipose tissue from the HAT group of morbidly obese subjects suggests a compensatory response associated with the increased plasma ASP and TG. A shift in the various pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, macrophage recruitment and matrix remodelling proteins demonstrates a differential expression in the HAT group, although the specific benefits or deleterious effects of this regulation remain to be elucidated. Men and women living in Montreal, Canada were recruited for this study. Altogether, for the microarray there were two men and nine women, all morbidly obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2). Chi2 analysis indicated no significant difference in gender distribution. A sample of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue along with a fasting blood sample were collected during gastric bypass surgery (n = 11). Ethics approval for this project was obtained from the McGill University Health Centre (Royal Victoria Hospital) ethics review committee (Montreal, QC) and subjects signed an informed consent form prior to participation. Of the 11 subjects, none had previously been identified as having diabetes or any other known disease (other than the presence of morbid obesity). All women were pre-menopausal. None were taking hypoglycaemic or lipid lowering medication. Body weight was stable at the time of study. For the real time RT-PCR analysis, a lean control group was included to compare C5L2 gene expression (a gene not on the microarray) to the morbidly obese subjects. This group consisted of four non-obese subjects, two women and two men. Adipose tissue samples were collected during elective hysterectomy surgery (n = 2), valve replacement (n = 1), and hernia (n = 1) surgeries. All other inclusion/exclusion parameters were the same as for the morbidly obese group. Although we cannot rule out the presence of an inflammatory component in these subjects, all were elective and not emergency surgeries. Venous blood samples were collected in the fasting state into non-heparinized EDTA tubes. Samples were collected at 7:00 am, on the ward following a 12 hour fast, prior to transfer of patients to surgery. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes and plasma was stored at -80\u00b0C for later analysis. Insulin levels were measured by RIA (Medicorp, Montreal, Canada). Glucose was measured by colorimetric enzyme assay (GOD-PAP, Roche Diagnostics. Plasma triglycerides were measured by GPO-PAP (glycerol phosphate oxidase coupled to phenol and 4-aminophenazone) method. ASP levels were measured by colorimetric enzymatic ELISA. A lipemic index utilizing the fasting values of ASP and TG was calculated. ASP strongly correlates with postprandial TG, therefore a lipemic index of [ASP \u00d7 TG] may be indicative of ASP effects on clearance of postprandial TG. Adipose tissue was collected at the beginning of the operation (within 30 minutes) into sterile 50 mL conical tubes and immediately flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected from the subcutaneous abdominal wall and omental adipose tissue was collected from the greater omentum which is representative of intra-abdominal adipose depots drained by the portal vein. RNA was extracted from tissues using Qiagen spin columns (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) following manufacturer's protocol for fatty tissue with the addition of two RNase free DNase treatments (Qiagen) between RW1 washes. RNA quality was assessed by spectrometry (260/280 ratio) with ratios of 1.9 - 2.0. As well, RNA quality was assessed by chromatography. Synthesis of cRNA by in vitro transcription and hybridisation was performed as previously described. Briefly, 10 ug of high quality total RNA was converted to cDNA and then to biotin-labelled cRNA (10 mM Biotin-11-UTP, Perkin-Elmer) by linear amplification (iExpress Assay reagent kit, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Montreal, Quebec). 10 ug of labelled cRNA was hybridised to CodeLink UniSet Human 20 K I (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The microarray slides were processed according to manufacturer's instructions and analysed using Codelink System Software (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The spot intensities were median normalized (signal intensity of probe/median intensity of all discovery probes). The results have been deposited to GEO database under accession number GSE 15524. Real time RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression pattern of C5L2, the ASP receptor, because no probes for C5L2 were present on the microarray. The specific primer/probe sets used were human C5L2 (Hs_00218495). Confirmatory RT-PCR was also analyzed for 7 additional genes (complement C3 (C3), C5a receptor (C5aR), CD36, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), CEBP\u03b3 and insulin receptor (INSR), as well as a housekeeping gene beta-2-microglobulin (B2M, 4326319E). All primer\u00e9probe sets were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Toronto, Canada). RNA was collected as described above for the real time RT-PCR and run separately from the microarray. RNA (2 ug) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's protocols. All primer/probe sets were validated over an exponential range of 1:2 to 1:7500 dilutions of cDNA concentrations. A positive control consisting of pooled adipose tissue RNA isolated from human adipose tissue was used to establish the dynamic range of the assay for each primer/probe specifically in adipose tissue. Detection of the fluorescent signal was quantified by Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research). The control sample was assayed in each real-time PCR run to ensure consistency. For all samples, a dilution of 1:50 of the cDNA was used, which was linear within the tested exponential range, and all samples (n = 15) were analysed simultaneously, in duplicate or triplicate (no samples were pooled). Expression patterns for all genes, including C5L2 were analysed by real-time PCR using delta delta CT method expressed relative to the housekeeping gene B2M, according to manufacturer's protocol. Further, B2M was shown to be consistent across all samples (no significant changes) in both the microarray analysis (Additional File 2, Table S2) and in real time RT-PCR. Plasma data is presented as means \u00b1 SEM, and the two groups (HAT vs LAT) were compared by 2-sided t-test. The results were considered significant with p-values \u2264 0.05. For real-time PCR, data is presented as means \u00b1 SEM data. For C5L2 data, the groups were compared by two-way ANOVA for tissue (SC and OM) and groups (HAT, LAT, and NO) with all-pairwise post-hoc test used to compare significant differences between groups. For all other genes analyzed by real-time PCR, the two groups (HAT vs LAT) were compared by 2-sided t-test. The results were considered significant with p-values \u2264 0.05. Two types of analysis were conducted for the microarray analysis: (i) SAM analysis and (ii) targeted analysis of biologic pathways involved in lipid storage and inflammation. For the former, analysis was conducted using SAM (Significant Analysis of Microarrays) program version 3.09 and available at http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM using suggested guidelines (see on-site manual). This program is a validated statistical technique for identifying differentially expressed genes across high density microarrays. This analysis technique provides a list of significant differentially expressed genes and their q values, and an estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR) which represents the percentage of genes that could be identified by chance. Following SAM analysis of subcutaneous and omental tissues, we further analyzed the data targeting specific metabolic biologic pathways (according to the a priori hypothesis). For the targeted microarray analysis, the following procedure was used: (i) using known biochemical pathways, a list of proteins/genes involved in ASP generation, complement related factors, lipid storage metabolism including TG synthesis, lipolysis and oxidation, adipocyte differentiation, and inflammatory genes were collated; (ii) accession numbers were identified using Entrez Gene http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; (iii) the Codelink gene list was screened to tag all of the accession numbers present in the array; (iv) all genes identified with the associated SC and OM datasets were then pooled and (v) the data was then statistically analyzed for HAT vs LAT. All data was assembled prior to initiating analysis on HAT vs LAT. All genes identified in these pathways are presented for SC and OM tissues (Additional File 1, Table S1), whether significantly different or not (according to a 2-sided t-test). Microarray data were expressed using mean \u00b1 SEM. The cross-nested design was to analyze two experimental factors: (i) the comparison between two groups (LAT versus HAT), and (ii) between the different tissues (SC vs OM). A mixed model analysis was performed with interaction between the fixed factors. To proceed with the analysis, we used a model with a compound symmetry structure. For most variables, values were log transformed to stabilize variances. Reported p values are based on these transformations. Relationships between variables were expressed using Spearman correlation coefficients. For all microarray data, the results were considered significant with p-values \u2264 0.025, where ns indicates not significant. Graphical and statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA), SAS, version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and SigmaStat (Jandel Scientific, CA)."}, "28416580": {"pmid": "28416580", "pmcid": "PMC5503714", "title": "A TSPO ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage", "abstract": "\nIntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease without effective treatment. After ICH, the immediate infiltration of leukocytes and activation of microglia are accompanied by a rapid up-regulation of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). TSPO ligands have shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in models of CNS injury. In this study, we determined the impact of a TSPO ligand, etifoxine, on brain injury and inflammation in 2 mouse models of ICH. TSPO was up-regulated in Iba1+ cells from brains of patients with ICH and in CD11b+CD45int cells from mice subjected to collagenase-induced ICH. Etifoxine significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema after ICH induction by injection of either autologous blood or collagenase. In collagenase-induced ICH mice, the protection of etifoxine was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brain and microglial production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Etifoxine improved blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and diminished cell death. Notably, the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice depleted of microglia by using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor. These results indicate that the TSPO ligand etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH. TSPO may be a viable therapeutic target that requires further investigations in ICH.\u2014Li, M., Ren, H., Sheth, K. N., Shi, F.-D., Liu, Q. A TSPO ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage.\n", "fulltext": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating condition that afflicts 10\u201315% of all stroke victims, but no effective treatment exists (1\u20135). Emerging evidence suggests that inflammation plays a key role in the progression of ICH-induced brain injury (4, 6, 7). Upon the onset of ICH, blood components, including leukocytes, enter the brain and activate resident immune cells, such as microglia. Subsequently, the infiltrating leukocytes and activated microglia then augment the local production of proinflammatory cytokines. Together with cell death products, these factors amplify blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) disruption and destroy surrounding tissues, contributing to the development of perihematomal edema and the aggravated mass effect (4, 6, 7). Therefore, brain inflammation has emerged as a major modifiable determinant as a target for the development of new ICH treatment (7).The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is a 5-transmembrane unit localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane with the major function of transporting cholesterol across that membrane for neurosteroid synthesis (8). As leukocytes infiltrate and microglia become activated after ICH, TSPO is rapidly up-regulated in microglia and other brain-resident immune cells (9). Substantial evidence has verified the augmentation of TSPO in several neuroinflammatory conditions, including ischemic stroke (10, 11) and multiple sclerosis (12, 13). The prevalence and up-regulation of TSPO in the neuroinflammatory environment suggest that targeting TSPO may be a viable approach to limiting neuroinflammation and brain injury after ICH. In a recent study of experimental ICH, the up-regulation of TSPO was documented in brain microglia (9), but still unclear is what immune cell types may express TSPO after ICH.Etifoxine is a clinically available, high-affinity TSPO ligand (8). Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of etifoxine and other TSPO ligands in down-regulating microglial activation and promoting neural survival after several types of CNS injury (12, 14\u201316). However, no studies have been performed to determine the potential impact of etifoxine on brain injury and inflammation in the context of ICH. In this study, in 2 mouse models of ICH, etifoxine treatment attenuated neurodeficits, lesion size, perihematomal edema, cell death, and neuroinflammation.Human brain tissues were obtained at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. The protocols were approved by the institutional review boards in Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. Among the 9 patients studied, the perihematomal tissues were from 5 patients who underwent surgical evacuation of hematomas within 24 h of ICH onset. The specimens were collected with informed consent. The patients with ICH were between 40 and 60 yr of age with a computed tomography-confirmed hematoma located in the basal ganglia (30\u201370 ml). The other 4 samples were obtained from individuals who died of nonneurologic diseases, and those tissues were collected within 4 h after death for use as controls. The 4 control subjects had no history of neurologic or neuropsychiatric diseases, which was confirmed by histopathological examination.All animal experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Tianjin Neurologic Institute and Barrow Neurologic Institute. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in China and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA]. Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA), 8 to 10 wk old, were used. The mice were randomly assigned into each experimental group. All mice were housed in pathogen-free conditions of the vivarium facilities. All surgeries were performed with animals under anesthesia. Reporting of this study complies with the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines).ICH was induced as we have described (17\u201320). Mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Thereafter, they were fixed on a stereotactic frame. A hole was drilled on the right side of the skull (2.3 mm lateral to midline, 0.5 mm anterior to bregma). For the ICH model induced by collagenase injection, 0.0375 U bacterial collagenase (type IV-S; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 0.5 \u03bcl saline was infused at a rate of 1 \u03bcl/min at the caudate nucleus (3.7-mm depth below the surface of the skull) through an infusion pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA). For the ICH model induced by injection of autologous blood, a double-injection method was used. Whole blood (30 \u03bcl) withdrawn from the angular vein was transferred into a 50 \u03bcl syringe with a 26-gauge needle (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA). The needle was inserted into the right caudate nucleus (2.3 mm lateral to the midline; 0.5 mm anterior to the bregma; 3 mm below the surface of the skull). During the infusion process, the first 5 \u03bcl of blood was injected at the rate of 1 \u03bcl/min through the infusion pump beneath the hole, to generate a clot; the needle was then moved to a depth of 3.7 mm from the 3-mm position. After a 5-min pause, the remaining 25 \u03bcl blood was infused at the same rate of 1 \u03bcl/min. The needle was held in position for an additional 20 min and then gently withdrawn. Sham-treated controls were injected with an equal volume of saline. The burr hole was sealed with bone wax (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). During surgery, body temperatures were maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C. Afterward, animals were placed in cages and given free access to food and water.Etifoxine was dissolved in saline supplement with 1% Tween-80 as previously described (12). Etifoxine or the saline vehicle was administrated at 50 mg/kg in 200 \u03bcl by intraperitoneal injection immediately after ICH and was given daily until the experiment ended.Neurologic deficits were assessed at d 1 and 3 after ICH by at least 2 investigators blinded to the treatments of all ICH mice in each group. The modified Neurologic Severity Score (mNSS) and corner-turning test were performed as described (21, 22). The mNSS rates neurologic functioning and includes a composite of motor, sensory, reflex, and balance tests. The corner-turning test was used to assess sensorimotor and postural asymmetries. The mouse being tested was allowed to enter a corner with an angle of 30\u00b0 and was required to turn either to the left or the right to exit the corner. The clinical scoring and corner test procedures were performed as published elsewhere (23, 24).Three days after ICH, a 7-T small-animal MRI scan was performed to evaluate lesion volume and hematoma volume (17). T2-weighted images (repetition time, 4500 ms; echo time, 65.5 ms; field of view, 28 \u00d7 28; image matrix, 256 \u00d7 256; slice thickness, 0.5 mm) and susceptibility weighted images (SWIs; repetition time, 30 ms; echo time, 10 ms; field of view, 32 \u00d7 32; image matrix, 256 \u00d7 256; slice thickness, 0.3 mm) were acquired to assess lesion volume and hematoma volume, respectively. The lesion and hematoma areas were manually outlined on each slice, then the areas in all slices were summed and multiplied by section thickness using Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization software (MIPAV; NIH). The lesion and hematoma volumes were measured by 2 investigators blinded to the tissues source.The T1 postcontrast images were used to assess BBB integrity (25). After administration of the contrast agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine; Gd-DTPA), (Magnevist, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) with a dosage of 0.2 mmol/kg body weight, T1 postcontrast images were acquired with the following parameters: repetition time, 322 ms; echo time, 10.5 ms; field of view, 28 mm; image matrix, 256 \u00d7 256; slice thickness, 0.5 mm). MRI data were analyzed with MED\u00d73.4.3 software (Medical Numerics, Germantown, MA, USA) on a Linux workstation.Brain water content was measured 3 d after ICH (26). In brief, after anesthesia and decapitation, brains of mice were obtained and divided into 3 parts: ipsilateral hemisphere, contralateral hemisphere, and cerebellum. The tissues were then weighed to obtain the wet weight, followed by drying for 24 h at 100\u00b0C to obtain the dry weight. The calculation formula of brain water contents was: (wet weight \u2013 dry weight)/wet weight \u00d7 100%.To analyze immune cell infiltration and microglia cytokine expression in brains, we isolated cellular components from brain tissue to perform flow cytometry analysis. Three days after ICH, brains were harvested and homogenized with 40 \u03bcm nylon cell strainers (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in PBS. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and cell pellets were collected. Thereafter, 5 ml of 70% Percoll solution (GE Healthcare Bio Science AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to resuspend the cell pellet, and 30% Percoll solution was overlaid on it. The gradient was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. Single cells in the interface between 30 and 70% Percoll were collected for antibody staining. Cells were diluted to 1\u00d7106 cells in 100 \u03bcl PBS solution with 1% bovine serum albumin and stained for antibodies and isotype control. All antibodies were purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA), unless otherwise indicated, and the staining protocol followed the manual\u2019s instructions. The following antibodies were used: CD45 (30-F11), CD11b (M1/70), CD3 (145-2C11), CD4 (GK1.4), CD8 (53-6.72), anti-NK1.1 (PK136), anti-CD19 (1D3), F4/80 (6F12), Ly6G (1A8). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with a commercial solution (BioLegend) and then stained for the antibodies: IL-6 (MP5-20F3), IL-10 (JES5-16E3), TNF-\u03b1 (MP6-XT22), TGF-\u03b2 (TW7-20B9), and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for TSPO. Fluorescence minus one controls were stained, respectively.To analyze cell death after ICH, we harvested single-cell suspensions as previously described and removed the myelin with 30% Percoll solution. The pellets were collected and stained for annexin V, as detailed in the manual\u2019s protocol. Flow cytometry data were obtained on FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by Flow Jo, v.7.6.1 (Informer Technologies, Walnut Creek, CA, USA).Brain tissues of patients with ICH and ICH mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Brain sections (5 \u00b5m thick) were made and rehydrated in a series of ethanol dilutions. Brain sections were permeabilized and incubated in blocking solution (5% goat or donkey serum in PBS solution), followed by incubation with primary antibodies: goat anti-Iba1 (Wako, Richmond, VA, USA) and rabbit anti-PBR (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After triple washings with PBS, the slices were incubated with secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and donkey anti-goat 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After triple washings with PBS, the brain sections were stained with DAPI (Abcam). For TUNEL staining, the Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Biotin-dUTP Nick End Labeling kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Images were captured with a microscope (Model BX-61; Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA), and data were analyzed with Image J (NIH). For cell counting, positively stained cells were counted in 3 comparable, randomly selected microscopic fields. The numbers of cells from 9 locations per mouse (3 fields per section \u00d7 3 sections per mouse) were averaged and expressed as positive cells per field.Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of tight junction proteins as has been described (17). In brief, 3 d after ICH, ipsilateral hemispheres of brains were harvested. Proteins were extracted, electrophoresed, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). After being blocked, the PVDF membranes were incubated with primary antibodies: anti-zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1, 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific); anti-claudin-5 (1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) antibodies or anti-\u03b2-actin (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase\u2013labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000; Zymed, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (27). The intensity of blots was detected with a Bio-Rad 721BR08844 Gel Doc Imager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).Sample size was determined by power analysis using a significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05 with 80% power to detect significant differences. Power analysis and sample size calculations were performed using SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The experimental design was based on previous publications with similar mechanistic studies (20, 28\u201330). All results were analyzed by investigators blinded to the treatment. All data are shown as means \u00b1 sem. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). Two-tailed, unpaired Student\u2019s t test was used to determine significance of differences between 2 groups. One-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey post hoc test were used for comparison of multigroup data. Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.In the determination of which immune cells might express TSPO after ICH, we prepared single-cell suspensions of brain tissues from mice injected with collagenase to induce ICH and measured the expression profile of TSPO using flow cytometry. We found a marked increase in cells expressing TSPO after ICH (Fig. 1A, B). Of note, CD11b+CD45int microglia were the most prominent immune cell type that expressed TSPO 24 h after ICH. In contrast, the expression of TSPO was less abundant in CD11b+CD45hi myeloid cells or barely seen in infiltrating CD11b\u2212CD45hi leukocytes. In addition, immunostaining analysis revealed that TSPO expression was significantly up-regulated in Iba-1+ cells, including microglia in the brain sections from patients with ICH, as compared to the controls (i.e., tissues from patients with nonneurologic diseases) (Fig. 1C, D). Together, these data suggest a marked up-regulation of TSPO in brain microglia after ICH onset.To assess whether the TSPO ligand, etifoxine, affects brain injury after ICH, we examined neurodeficits, lesion volume, and perihematomal edema in ICH mice receiving etifoxine or a vehicle control. Etifoxine (50 mg/kg) or vehicle (1% Tween-80) was injected intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days starting immediately after the injection of autologous blood or collagenase (Fig. 2A). Neurodeficits were measured using the mNSS and the corner turning test at d 1 and 3 after ICH induction in both models. Lesion volume and hematoma volume were evaluated with T2 and SWI MRI images 3 d after ICH induction. As a result, etifoxine treatment significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema after the onset of ICH (Fig. 2B\u2013D). In addition, etifoxine reduced water content in the brain after ICH (Supplemental Fig. 1A, B). Etifoxine was protective in a dose-dependent manner among the doses examined (25\u2013100 mg/kg). We elected to use the dose of 50 mg/kg in this study, because etifoxine at this dose can provide efficacy similar to that of 100 mg/kg.We then sought to determine the impact of etifoxine on brain inflammation after ICH. For that purpose, we used flow cytometry to measure cellular components in the ICH-afflicted brain including brain-infiltrating leukocytes and microglia (Fig. 3A). We found that etifoxine treatment significantly reduced the counts of brain-infiltrating macrophages (CD45hiCD11b+F4/80+), neutrophils (CD45hiCD11b+Ly6G+), CD4+ T cells (CD45hiCD3+CD4+), CD8+T cells (CD45hiCD3+CD8+), B cells (CD45hiCD3-CD19+), NK cells (CD45hiCD3-NK1.1+) and microglia (CD11b+CD45int) (Fig. 3B, C). In addition, decreased expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and increased expression of TGF-\u03b2 were seen in microglia after etifoxine treatment (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that etifoxine can reduce brain inflammation after ICH.The dysregulated BBB function after ICH contributes to vasogenic edema and perihematomal edema development (4, 31). To determine whether etifoxine impacts BBB integrity after ICH, we measured BBB permeability and expression of tight junction proteins. The presence of brain parenchymal enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1 is generally accepted as an indicator of contrast medium leakage across the disrupted BBB. The quantification of parenchymal enhancement showed a significant decrease in ICH mice receiving etifoxine vs. vehicle controls (Fig. 4A, B). Similarly, etifoxine-treated ICH mice had far less Evans Blue extravasation than recipients of the vehicle control (Supplemental Fig. 2A, B). Western blot measurement showed that etifoxine preserved the expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and ZO-1 after ICH (Fig. 4C, D). In addition, immunostaining and flow cytometry analyses were performed to determine cell death. Quantitation of TUNEL+ cells in the perihematomal area or annexin V+ cells in the brain portrayed the reduction of cell apoptosis after etifoxine treatment (Fig. 5). Together, these results suggest that etifoxine can preserve BBB integrity after ICH.Our previous study showed that microglia have a detrimental effect on the brain during the injury phase of ICH (20). Because the expression of TSPO occurs primarily in microglia after ICH, we sought to determine whether etifoxine provides protection by targeting microglia. The survival of microglia depends on signaling through colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) (20, 32). Using the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397, we effectively depleted microglia preceding ICH induction. PLX3397 treatment continued in this group of mice until the end of the experiments (Fig. 6A). Flow cytometry measurement of microglia (CD11b+CD45int) showed that depletion efficacy was \u223c90% before or after ICH (20). We found that the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice receiving PLX3397 (Fig. 6B\u2013D). These results demonstrated that the protection conferred by etifoxine treatment against brain injury after ICH requires microglia.This study provides, for the first time to our knowledge, evidence that etifoxine attenuates hemorrhagic brain injury. Etifoxine significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema in 2 models of experimental ICH. Etifoxine treatment was sufficient to reduce leukocyte infiltration, decrease microglial production of proinflammatory factors, improve BBB integrity, and alleviate cell death after ICH. In addition, the protection provided by etifoxine was lost in mice subjected to highly efficient depletion of microglia. These results suggest that etifoxine may be a viable drug candidate for ICH treatment.Microglial activation occurs within minutes after the onset of ICH, and activated microglia were found in the perihematomal area. Microglia possess multiple capabilities that would have an impact on hemorrhagic brain injury, including production of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines and antigen presentation (33, 34). Indeed, we and others have demonstrated that microglial activation correlates with observations of perihematomal edema, and the inhibition or depletion of microglia activation can provide neuroprotection after ICH (35, 36), suggesting a detrimental role of microglia in ICH. A recent study showed that TSPO expression appeared mostly in microglia, but not in astrocytes or neurons (9). Consistent with this report, we found low expression of TSPO in uninjured brains in contrast with ICH-induced up-regulation of TSPO in CD11b+CD45int microglia. Combined with our data showing the expression of TSPO in IBa1+ cells in brain sections from patients with ICH, these results suggest that TSPO may be a suitable target for modulating the microglial response after ICH.To understand the possible mechanisms by which etifoxine might confer protection after ICH, we examined the immune responses in the brain. Evidence has shown that activated microglia and infiltrating leukocytes are key contributors of neuroinflammation after ICH, because of their rapid release of proinflammatory and immunoactive factors, including cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins, proteases, and ferrous iron (37\u201339). In the current study, the administration of etifoxine significantly reduced the infiltration of leukocytes and the production by microglia of proinflammatory factors, together with the preservation of BBB integrity and decreased cell death after ICH. Our results are consistent with those in previous reports showing that TSPO ligands provide neuroprotective effects and limit brain inflammation (12, 14\u201316). In those studies, reduced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 and improved neural function were seen in multiple models of neural injury (12, 14\u201316).Because brain inflammation and BBB dysfunction are key contributors to vasogenic perihematoma formation after ICH, we postulate that etifoxine may mitigate the brain\u2019s inflammatory milieu to confer protection in ICH. In support of this notion, we found that the benefit of etifoxine was abolished in mice depleted of microglia by using a CSF1R inhibitor. Together with the finding that the expression of TSPO primarily occurs in microglia after ICH, this result suggests that the protective effect of etifoxine involves its action on microglia to offset the damage from ICH. Possibly, then, the reduced infiltration of leukocytes results from the etifoxine-induced restriction of microglial responses, which have been reported to enhance neuroinflammation by recruiting and activating lymphocytes (40, 41). However, also noteworthy is the finding that CD11b+CD45hi leukocytes, which may include monocytes and macrophages, also express TSPO after ICH onset, albeit less abundantly than microglia. In addition, etifoxine may exert an effect on these CD11b+CD45hi leukocytes that restricts brain inflammation. Nevertheless, the precise operating mechanisms by which etifoxine restrict brain inflammation after ICH require further investigation.Reportedly, etifoxine is a potent enhancer of neurosteroid synthesis (8). Etifoxine-induced production of pregnenolone, progesterone, and allopregnanolone can confer neuroprotection (42\u201345). Progesterone treatment after ICH in rodents has, indeed, reduced brain edema, inflammatory response and cell death after ICH. Together with those results, our findings suggest that protection by the TSPO ligand etifoxine in ICH may involve the local production of neurosteroids that limit brain inflammation. Of interest, etifoxine is also reported to be a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (46). As previously documented, a significant decrease in the production of GABA and GABAergic system-related genes was observed in rodent models of ICH (47, 48). Because the GABAA receptor is expressed by microglia/lymphocytes and activation of the GABAA receptor can reduce their proinflammatory activities (49\u201352), further investigation is needed to better understand whether and to what extent the action of etifoxine on GABAA receptors may contribute to its benefit in ICH.In summary, our data reveal that etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH, suggesting that it may serve as a promising candidate for investigation in advanced preclinical ICH studies."}, "20828385": {"pmid": "20828385", "pmcid": "PMC2944815", "title": "Cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects of temsirolimus in refractory mantle cell lymphoma", "abstract": "\nMantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and their prognosis is poor. However, a 38% remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor.\nHere we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment, and a progression-free survival of 10 months. In this case, lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy. Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells. Apart from this cytostatic effect, temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression. Moreover, numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post-necrotic tissue repair, were found after 6-month temsirolimus therapy. Thus, temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects.\nThis dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory MCL resistant to conventional chemotherapy.\n", "fulltext": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), representing about 6% of NHL cases. T(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosomal translocation, one of the most important cytogenetic abnormalities of MCL, juxtaposes genes of cyclin D1 and of immunoglobulin heavy chain, inducing cyclin D1 over-expression and cell cycle deregulation. Thus, cyclin D1 over-expression and/or the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation are hallmarks of MCL, included in current WHO guidelines for MCL diagnosis. MCL patients are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage (III or IV). They become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and have a poor overall survival. Therefore, alternative therapeutic strategies are actively studied. The mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase. It plays an important role in cell growth, protein synthesis, and cell-cycle progression. Since mTOR pathway is constitutively activated in MCL, it could be a potent therapeutic target for this disease. Recent clinical trials showed that temsirolimus (Wyeth Pharmaceutical, Philadelphia, PA), a mTOR inhibitor, induced a 38% response rate and a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) of 3.4-6.9 months in refractory MCL patients. We studied here a refractory MCL patient, who had tumor regression under temsirolimus treatment. A 53-year-old male with generalized lymphadenopathy and fatigue, was diagnosed as MCL on inguinal lymph node biopsy. After 10 cycles of CHOP and 2 cycles of E-CHOP, lymph nodes bulged. Disease was still progressing after 2 cycles of R-ICE. Therefore, R-ICE was stopped. The patient was recruited in phase III study of temsirolimus (number: 3066K1-305-WW) on August 2006 but was randomized in investigator's choice group. According to the protocol, fludarabine 25 mg/m2 was infused daily for 5 days, and it was repeated every 28 days. After 8 cycles, fludarabine had to be stopped because of severe bone marrow inhibition on March 2007. One year later, enlarged iliac lymph-node compressed ureter, causing renal dysfunction with elevated blood creatinine. To confirm the diagnosis of recurrence, a biopsy of enlarged right cervical lymph node was performed and the place was noted on CT scan. After confirmation of the MCL recurrence, the patient was permitted to enter the temsirolimus treatment group on March 2008. He received temsirolimus 175 mg/week for 3 weeks, followed by weekly doses of 75 mg. Circulation blood count was monitored weekly, CT scan and serum chemistry every other month. Temsirolimus was suspended, when absolute neutrophil count <1000/\u03bcl, or hemoglobin <8 g/dl, or platelet <50000/\u03bcl. According to the response criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma we use in our hospital, six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses were measured. The sum of dimensions of these six nodal masses was recorded before temsirolimus as well as every other month under temsirolimus treatment. Other lesions were recorded but not measured. After 2 months of temsirolimus treatment, a 33% regression of the sum of dimensions was observed by CT scan (Figure 1). Meanwhile, renal function recovered and blood creatinine returned to normal level. However, lymph nodes enlargement was still present on CT scan after 6 months of temsirolimus. To assess the extent of the therapeutic effect, and to detect a possible early recurrence, a second biopsy of the same right cervical lymph node was performed but in a different direction. Informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Disease remained stable until January 2009 when CT scan showed a cervical lymph node behind the right jugular vein bulged. Temsirolimus was then stopped. No further biopsy was taken. Patient then received arsenic combined with thalidomide and chlorambucil treatment. On March 2009, all lymph nodes enlarged, and disease still progressed after 3 cycles of bortezomib. The patient finally died of severe bone marrow inhibition and pulmonary infection after hyperCVAD treatment on October 2009. During temsirolimus treatment, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occasionally occurred, and disappeared after one week of treatment suspension. No sign of thrombosis was observed. Cyclin D1, the hallmark of MCL, is the down stream target of mTOR. Its expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining (Dako; Glostrup, Denmark; dilution 1:100) on the two successive biopsies. Tumor cell proliferation was assessed by Ki67 (Dako; dilution 1:100), apoptosis by cleaved caspase-3 (Cell signaling; MA, USA; dilution 1:50), microvessel density (MVD) by CD31 (Dako; dilution 1:50), and angiogenesis cytokine expression by VEGF-A (R&D system; MN, USA; dilution 1:200). Irrelevant isotypic antibodies and absence of primary antibodies were used as controls. Immunostained cells were counted on 5 different microscopic fields at \u00d7400 magnification, out of fibrotic and necrotic areas, the count including a minimum of 1000 cells. Fibrotic areas were randomized photographed at \u00d7200 magnification for five fields and analysed with Cell Software (Olympus, Tokyo). The ratio between fibrotic areas and tumor areas gave the relative fibrotic area. Differences between analyses before and after temsirolimus were assessed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Two-sided P < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Comparison between the 2 biopsies, before and after temsirolimus, showed a significant decrease of cyclin D1 (P < 0.01), and Ki67 (P < 0.01). But there was no change in apoptotic cell counts (P = 0.15). VEGF-A expression (P <0.05) and microvessel density (P < 0.05) were also significantly decreased after temsirolimus therapy. Numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas were observed within the tumor. Relative fibrotic area significantly increased after temsirolimus (P < 0.05) (Figure 2). The use of m-TOR inhibitor in MCL is an emerging therapy, but its in vivo anti-tumor mechanism is not yet fully explained. In this refractory MCL case, temsirolimus was able to induce tumor regression as well as a progression-free survival of 10 months. Tissue analyses before and after temsirolimus showed the direct cytostatic effect of this mTOR inhibitor through cell cycle arrest, as demonstrated by down-regulation of cyclin D1 and Ki67 in lymphoma cells, and the absence of apoptotic change. This cytostatic effect observed on human biopsies is in agreement with experimental results reported in temsirolimus-treated breast and acute leukemia cell lines. However, temsirolimus significantly reduced tumor burden in our refractory MCL case, an effect difficult to link only to its cytostatic properties. Further assessment of its efficiency on lymphoma tissue showed that the tumor microvessel density and the VEGF-A expression were both significantly reduced after treatment. On the same biopsies, we also found patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post-necrotic tissue repair. Along this line, tumor infarct and necrosis linked to tumor microvessel thrombi have been reported in xenografted pancreas and colon cancer treated by mTOR inhibitor. Reduction of microvessel density and of VEGF-A expression were also found in another series of xenografted breast cancers. Temsirolimus could thus reduce tumor burden through a direct cytostatic effect on the tumor cells, but also through an associated effect on tumor angiogenesis. This dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory MCL resistant to conventional cytotoxic drugs. On the long term, this supports the evaluation of anti-angiogenic drugs in refractory MCL.

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, the homozygous mutations T71N and A190T in the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) hippocalcin were identified as the genetic cause of primary isolated dystonia (DYT2 dystonia). However, the effect of these mutations on the physiological role of hippocalcin has not yet been elucidated. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrated that hippocalcin oligomerises in a calcium-dependent manner and binds to voltage-gated calcium channels. Mutations T71N and A190T in hippocalcin did not affect stability, calcium-binding affinity or translocation to cellular membranes (Ca2+/myristoyl switch). We obtained the first crystal structure of hippocalcin and alignment with other NCS proteins showed significant variability in the orientation of the C-terminal part of the molecule, the region expected to be important for target binding. We demonstrated that the disease-causing mutations did not affect the structure of the protein, however both mutants showed a defect in oligomerisation. In addition, we observed an increased calcium influx in KCl-depolarised cells expressing mutated hippocalcin, mostly driven by N-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Our data demonstrate that the dystonia-causing mutations strongly affect hippocalcin cellular functions which suggest a central role for perturbed calcium signalling in DYT2 dystonia.\n", "fulltext": "Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes muscle spasms and contractions. It is characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements and painful postures than can be accompanied by dystonic tremor (1). Dystonia may be classified according to its distribution (2) or as primary or secondary (3). In contrast to secondary dystonia that can be caused by brain damage (head injury, stroke) or exposure to particular drugs, the pathophysiological mechanisms of most forms of primary dystonia are unknown (4). Recently, using a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome next-generation sequencing in a consanguineous kindred affected by autosomal-recessive isolated dystonia, homozygous mutations were observed in the genes LAPTM5, coding for a lysosomal transmembrane protein and HPCA, encoding the calcium-binding protein hippocalcin. After in silico analysis, hippocalcin was identified as the most plausible cause for DYT2 primary isolated dystonia (5). HPCA or hippocalcin, is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family (6) and is highly expressed in hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons, in particular in their dendrites (7\u20139). It contains four EF-hands out of which only three are capable of binding calcium. In response to increased intracellular calcium, hippocalcin undergoes a conformational change and translocates from the cytosol to cellular membranes through a Ca2+/myristoyl switch mechanism (10). The extrusion of the myristoyl-containing hydrophobic N-terminus region from the hydrophobic pocket (11) allows hippocalcin to localize to membranes where it can interact with downstream targets (10,12,13). In addition to its role in the control of apoptosis (14), hippocalcin has been shown to be involved in neuronal excitability (15\u201317), regulation of neurite outgrowth (18) and gene transcription (19,20), long-term depression (21\u201323) and the modulation of cyclic nucleotide signalling (24). Mutations at positions T71N and A190T were shown to be critical in development of DYT2 dystonia (5). It was speculated that T71N mutation could impair or prevent calcium binding to EF-hand domain 2, possibly leading to a loss of function, whereas A190T could be involved in target specificity. However, no direct evidence was provided to support these hypotheses. In this study, we investigate the effect of the dystonia-causing mutations on the biophysical and physiological properties of hippocalcin. We demonstrate that hippocalcin oligomerises upon calcium binding and interacts with voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). We observed that the structure, stability and calcium-binding properties of the mutants remain unchanged. Both mutants, however, show strong oligomerisation defects and increased intracellular calcium influx. These results suggest that the cause of the disease is not due to loss of hippocalcin expression or stability but to subtle changes in its ability to participate in calcium signalling. To determine if the calcium-binding properties of hippocalcin were altered by the mutations, equilibrium calcium-binding titrations were performed using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 1). Free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]) were calculated using the Maxchelator program (25) and were verified using OGB-1 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). In order to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) and the Hill coefficient (n), calcium titrations were normalised and fitted to the Hill equation (correlation coefficient values between 0.96 and 0.98). Hippocalcin wild-type had a Kd of 65\u2009\u00b1\u20094\u2009nM and a Hill coefficient (n) of 1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1. As expected, hippocalcin(A190T) presented similar calcium-binding properties to the wild-type protein with Kd\u2009=\u200977\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009nM and n\u2009=\u20091.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 (Table 1). Affinities for calcium for hippocalcin(T71N) (Kd\u2009=\u200993\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u2009nM) was not significantly different from the wild-type, even though the mutation was located within the second EF-hand of hippocalcin. However, the cooperativity of calcium binding, shown by the Hill coefficient, significantly decreased from n\u2009=\u20091.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 for the wild-type, to n\u2009=\u20090.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 for hippocalcin(T71N). Stability of hippocalcin proteins was determined by trypsin limited proteolysis and temperature/chemical denaturation (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Incubation of wild-type hippocalcin with trypsin showed 32\u2009\u00b1\u200914% degradation over 30\u2009min (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2A). Similar susceptibility to protease degradation was observed for both mutants. In addition, \u03b1-helices temperature unfolding followed by circular dichroism revealed that hippocalcin is a very thermostable protein with only 37% of \u03b1-helices denaturation at 90\u2009\u00b0C, and that the mutations did not alter the temperature stability of the protein (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2B). Guanidine denaturation monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence showed complete protein denaturation at [Gnd-HCl] of 3 M (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2C). When comparing the susceptibility to guanidine of hippocalcin wild-type with the mutants, no significant difference was observed. Altogether, these data suggest that the disease-causing mutations T71N and A190T are not affecting the stability of the proteins. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to examine whether the mutations in hippocalcin were causing secondary structure modifications. CD spectra were collected for hippocalcin and the mutants in either apo- or calcium-bound form (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3A). After protein secondary structure prediction using the CDSSTR method, the helical content of hippocalcin was estimated to \u223c75% of \u03b1-helices and only 9% of \u03b2-sheets (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3B). The conformational change that occurs upon calcium binding did not affect the secondary structure content, neither did the mutations. Crystal structures were obtained for wild-type human hippocalcin (PDB 5G4P), hippocalcin(T71N) (PDB 5M6C) and hippocalcin(A190T) (PDB 5G58) at a resolution of the 2.42, 3.00 and 2.54 \u00c5, respectively. Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Supplementary Material, Table S1. The structure of hippocalcin is similar to all NCS proteins and contains 4 EF-hands (helix-loop-helix motifs) and 10 \u03b1-helices (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4A). Electron density revealed three calcium ions in EF-2, EF-3 and EF-4 binding sites (Fig. 2A) in all structures. Cryptic EF-hand 1 did not bind any calcium ions, as expected. The regions involved in calcium binding showed complete preservation and high order. As many NCS proteins, hippocalcin has two lobes, N-lobe is formed by EF-1 and EF-2, while C-lobe is formed by EF-3 and EF-4. The crystal structure contained two copies of hippocalcin in the asymmetric unit connected by insertion of C-terminal helix of chain E (residues 181\u2013190) into the hydrophobic groove of chain A. This packing is facilitated by salt bridge between guanidinium group of Arg181 and carboxyl group of Asp37, and hydrogen bond between OE1 Gln184 and NE1 Trp30 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4B). Interestingly, the same fragment is expected to be involved in target binding. PISA analysis of the oligomeric states for all three proteins has confirmed that they are monomeric in solution. Alignment of C\u03b1 atoms of hippocalcin with other calcium-binding proteins such as rat NCS-1 (PDB 5AEQ) and bovine neurocalcin delta (PDB 1BJF) showed significant variability in the orientation of the C-terminal part of the molecule, region expected to be involved in specificity of target binding (Fig. 2B). In addition, significant variability was observed in the loop regions, with exception of the EF-hand loops (Fig. 2C). Comparison of hippocalcin with the dimeric crystal structure of bovine neurocalcin delta (PDB 1BJF), suggest a key role of the calcium EF-hands for oligomerisation as they seem to be located at the dimerization interface and are structurally identical in 3 proteins (Fig. 2C). The crystal structure of hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) did not show any significant conformation difference when compared to the wild-type protein and they have identical crystal packing (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4C). Mutation site in hippocalcin T71N is located on the interface between N-lobe and C-lobe close to the area of interaction with peptides in NCS-1 (26), change from Thr to Asn strengthens inter-lobe interface by creating additional hydrogen bond between ND2 Asn71 and OG Ser106 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4D). Mutation A190T is located at the end of the flexible C-terminal helix (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4E), which is predicted to interact with hippocalcin target protein. Change from Ala to Thr does not decrease C-terminus flexibility.This part has no electron density in chain A. Absolute molar masses of hippocalcin wild-type and mutants were accurately determined by SEC-MALS, overcoming the limitation of column calibration. MALS data indicated that in the absence of calcium, hippocalcin was 99% monomeric (23.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009kDa) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Material, Table S2). However, in the presence of 1\u2009mM calcium, hippocalcin formed a mixture of monomers (25.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\u2009kDa) and oligomers with a molar mass consistent with dimer (46.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009kDa), trimer (68.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009kDa) and tetramer (91.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9\u2009kDa) molecules. The oligomeric fraction represented more than 57% of the total proteins. As with the parent protein hippocalcin, the hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) proteins were monodisperse in the absence of calcium with a size consistent with a monomer (23.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009kDa on average) and formed oligomers in a calcium-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). The calcium-dependent oligomerisation was also observed in in vitro crosslink (BS3 or DSP) experiments (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5A\u2013C). Indeed, densitometry quantification after DSP crosslinking on hippocalcin purified protein showed that calcium significantly increased the polydispersity of the sample (from 24\u2009\u00b1\u20093% oligomers in the absence of calcium, to 52\u2009\u00b1\u20091% oligomers in the presence of calcium). Treatment with DTT after DSP crosslinking cleaved the oligomers back into monomers, as expected (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5B). Oligomerisation also occurred at low calcium concentrations (50\u2009\u03bcM) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5C). Intracellular crosslink in N2A cells using DSP reproduced the calcium-dependent oligomerisation of hippocalcin, in a physiological context (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5D). Oligomerisation upon calcium binding was also observed for the disease-causing mutants hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Material, Fig. S5A,B,D). However, the mutations significantly decreased the oligomer formation when compared to the wild-type protein (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5B). Indeed, the fraction of oligomers measured by MALS was reduced from 57% for the wild-type protein to 19\u201328% for the mutants (Fig. 3B). Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques, we demonstrated the calcium-dependent oligomerisation of hippocalcin and a strong defect in oligomer formation for the dystonia-causing mutants. Hippocalcin wild-type has been shown to affect cellular response to membrane depolarisation and it has been suggested that hippocalcin might play a role in regulating voltage-dependent calcium channels (5). However, there is yet no direct evidence of hippocalcin interacting with VGCCs. In this study, we investigate the interaction of hippocalcin with P/Q- and N-type channels as other NCS family members have been shown to bind to these channel subtypes (27\u201329), thought to be drivers of synaptic transmission (30). We demonstrate, using purified proteins and western blots, that hippocalcin wild-type and mutants bound to both P/Q- (residues 1898-2035) and N-type (residues 1836-1983) VGCC fragment proteins whereas no significant binding to the SUMO protein control was detected (Fig. 4A). In addition, after densitometry quantification using biotinylated BSA as loading control, we observed that both mutants also bound to the channel fragments and that hippocalcin(A190T) interaction with VGCCs was altered (Fig. 4B). Indeed in the absence of calcium, hippocalcin(A190T) presented increased interaction with N-type channels when compared to the wild-type. In the presence of low \u03bcM calcium hippocalcin(A190T) showed significantly enhanced binding to both P/Q- and N-type calcium channels, compared to the parent protein. We have been unable to confirm this interaction for native channel subunits using immunoprecipation techniques as an effective anti-hippocalcin antiserum is currently not available. Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with mCherry-tagged hippocalcin constructs and loaded with Fluo-4 calcium dye. Expression levels were verified by Western blot using actin, calnexin and tubulin as loading controls and did not show any difference between the wild-type and the mutants (Supplementary Material, Fig. S6). After 50\u2009mM KCl stimulation to depolarise the cells, calcium signals were monitored on a spinning-disk confocal microscope (Fig. 5). Cells transfected with hippocalcin wild-type showed 27% increase in intracellular fluorescence after KCl depolarisation. For the dystonia-causing mutants hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T), calcium influx upon stimulation significantly increased to 51% and 62%, respectively, compared to hippocalcin wild-type (Fig. 5B). We set out to determine which type of calcium channel mediated the increased calcium influx by testing the effect of calcium channel blockers on cells expressing wild type hippocalcin or hippocalcin(A190T). For both hippocalcin- and hippocalcin(A190T)-transfected cells, incubation with \u03c9-agatoxin IVA (P/Q-type channel blocker) did not significantly affect calcium influx upon KCl-induced depolarisation (Fig. 5C). However, we observed a large decrease of the calcium response in the presence of \u03c9-conotoxin MVIIC (P/Q- and N-type channel blocker) and \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA (N-type channel blocker). For both hippocalcin and hippocalcin(A190T), fluorescence calcium signal decreased by \u223c60% in the presence of \u03c9-conotoxin MVIIC and \u223c50% in the presence of \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA. These results suggest that the increased calcium response due to hippocalcin(A190T) expression was predominantly due to calcium entry through N-type calcium channels. After rapid calcium photorelease, hippocalcin translocation to the preinuclear region of the cells was observed (Supplementary Material, Fig. S7A). This was, as previously demonstrated by O\u2019Callaghan and coworkers, to be due to translocation to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (10,31). Time-courses of Fluo-4 (calcium indicator) and hippocalcin fluorescence revealed that translocation is calcium-dependent and that it occurred rapidly after calcium rise (Supplementary Material, Fig. S7B). Photocleavage of NP-EGTA to rapidly release intracellular calcium also induced translocation of hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) mutants to the TGN. Dysregulation in calcium homeostasis and signalling have been implicated in many aspects of neuropathology, neurodegeneration and psychiatric disorders (32\u201336). In this paper, we investigated the role of mutations in hippocalcin, a neuronal calcium sensor involved in DYT2 dystonia disease. Using a combination of biophysical, structural biology and cell biology techniques, we demonstrated that the disease-causing mutations T71N and A190T have an effect on key functional properties of hippocalcin. In many cases disease-causing mutations can affect protein folding and/or reduce protein stability leading to a loss of expression levels. This was not the case for the DYT2 hippocalcin mutations. Biophysical experiments showed that all hippocalcin mutants had similar CD spectrum with no altered protein stability when compared to the wild-type protein. Heat-denaturation studies revealed that hippocalcin is a very thermostable protein, as observed for other calcium-binding protein such as VILIP-1 with unfolding temperature Tm\u2009>\u2009110\u2009\u00b0C (37), Calmodulin and Troponin C (Tm\u2009>\u200990\u2009\u00b0C) (38). The Ca2+-binding data were performed using unmyristoylated hippocalcin. There is no evidence available on whether myristoylation affects the Ca2+ binding to hippocalcin. While we cannot exclude minor effects, analysis of the unmyristoylated hippocalcin proteins should allow us to detect any differences in the intrinsic Ca2+ affinity of the wild-type compared to the mutants. Equilibrium calcium-binding titrations showed that hippocalcin has a high affinity for calcium binding (Kd\u2009=\u200965\u2009nM) with positive cooperativity (n\u2009=\u20091.4) as observed for other NCS proteins such as VILIP-1 (37), recoverin (39,40) and neurocalcin delta (39,41). Surprisingly, mutation hippocalcin(T71N), located within the second EF-hand, did not alter the overall calcium- binding affinity but significantly reduced the calcium-binding cooperativity. Previous studies on VILIP-1 and recoverin revealed that two calcium ions bind sequentially, first at EF-3 (high affinity) to facilitate cooperative calcium binding at EF-2 (low affinity) (37,40). Because EF-2 has low affinity for calcium (\u03bcM), mutations in this domain in hippocalcin may not have any significant effect on the overall dissociation constant. The equilibrium calcium-binding titrations for hippocalcin and hippocalcin(A190T) show that a calcium concentration of \u223c1\u2009\u03bcM is sufficient to get the protein fully Ca2+-bound. However, the decrease in cooperativity observed for hippocalcin(T71N) suggests that at low \u03bcM [Ca2+], hippocalcin(T71N) will only be partially Ca2+-bound which then could affect regulation of downstream calcium signalling cascades in stimulated cells. Hippocalcin shares common structural features of NCS proteins of \u223c200 residue chain containing 4 EF-hand motifs and an N-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence. The three dimensional structures are known for NCS-1 (42,43), recoverin (11,44) and neurocalcin delta (45). Here we provide the first crystal structure for calcium-bound hippocalcin, hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin(A190T) with a resolution of 2.4\u20133.0 \u00c5. There is no significant difference between the three structures. However, comparison of hippocalcin crystal structure with neurocalcin delta and NCS-1 revealed a different orientation of the C-terminus part of the protein. In NCS-1 the C-terminal tail appears to be able to sit in the hydrophobic groove in the absence of ligand and there is evidence to show that this tail acts as an auto-regulatory mechanism to control target binding (46\u201348); it is not clear at this stage if the C-terminal tail of hippocalcin serves the same function but it also sits in the hydrophobic groove in observed crystal packing (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4C). We demonstrated that hippocalcin oligomerises upon calcium binding with molar masses consistent with dimers, trimers and tetramers. We showed by in vitro crosslinking experiments that 50\u2009\u03bcM Ca2+ were sufficient to trigger oligomer formation. In addition, we demonstrated that hippocalcin oligomerises in cells stimulated with ionomycin, which raises the intracellular calcium to \u223c1\u2009\u03bcM (49,50). Calcium concentration at a mouth of an open calcium channel is predicted to be tens to hundreds of micromolar (51,52), suggesting that hippocalcin may bind to the channel as an oligomer. VILIP-1 and neurocalcin delta, neuronal calcium sensors from the same family, also forms an equilibrium mixture of monomeric and dimeric protein species (37,53,54), in contrast to NCS-1 which is a monomeric protein (26). Disease-causing mutants of hippocalcin showed a marked oligomerisation defect suggesting that EF-2 and the C-terminus domain are important for dimerization. In addition, crystal structure of dimeric neurocalcin delta (PDB 1BJF) suggest an important role of the EF-hands in the oligomerisation of the protein, which we cannot confirm from our crystal structures. Upon intracellular calcium elevation, calcium sensor proteins undergo a conformational change enabling interactions with partners and regulation of various calcium signalling pathways (28). Hippocalcin exhibits a dynamic calcium association in response to calcium increase and neuronal activity through a Ca2+/myristoyl switch mechanism (11). The change in conformation induces its binding to cellular membranes where it can interact with target proteins (10\u201312,55). Even though the bulk of hippocalcin becomes translocated to the TGN, a proportion also translocates to the plasma membrane (10,31), where it can interact with VGGCs. The dystonia-causing mutation T71N and A190T did not alter the translocation process. Entry of extracellular calcium into synaptic terminals through VGCCs is the driving force for exocytosis of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles. Hippocalcin has been implicated as a calcium sensor in long-term depression and the gating of channels underlying a slow after-hyperpolarisation current (16,21,56). However, no direct interaction with VGCCs channels has been shown. In this paper, we demonstrated that hippocalcin directly binds to the \u03b1-subunit of VGCCs of P/Q- and N-type, which suggest a role of hippocalcin in neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Hippocalcin(A190T) showed increased binding to both channels compared to the wild-type protein, suggesting that the mutation in the C-terminus region is important for target interaction, as previously shown for other NCS proteins (46,57). We demonstrated that hippocalcin can bind to the VGCCs in the absence of calcium, suggesting a pre-association to the pore-forming \u03b1-subunit of VGCCs as observed for apo-CaM (58\u201360). In cells transfected with hippocalcin mutants, we observed a significant increase in the calcium response to KCl depolarisation, compared to wild-type hippocalcin. Application of N-type calcium channel blockers (\u03c9-conotoxins MVIIC and GVIA) dramatically reduced calcium influx and the increased calcium signal due to hippocalcin(A190T), whereas the P/Q channel blocker \u03c9-agatoxin IVA had no effect. These findings suggest that the effect of hippocalcin mutants on calcium signalling is driven by interaction and regulation of N-type calcium channels. Similarly, other calcium-binding proteins such as CaM, CaBP1 and the NCS family members NCS-1 and VILIP-2 have been reported to associate with the \u03b1-subunit cytoplasmic regulatory domain of VGCCs of P/Q-, N- and L-type to modulate channel opening and therefore synaptic plasticity (27\u201329,61). The binding to VGCCs of the mutants and the increased intracellular calcium influx in stimulated cells could contribute to a dysregulation of subsequent signalling pathways and result in dramatic physiological alterations. In summary, we demonstrated that hippocalcin forms oligomers upon calcium binding and directly interacts with VGCCs. The dystonia-causing mutations did not affect protein stability or folding. In common for both T71N and A190T mutants was an impaired calcium-dependent oligomerisation and increased intracellular calcium influx after KCl depolarisation. These functional alterations suggest that the observed defect in hippocalcin-dependent calcium signalling would have important physiological consequences that contribute to the onset of the disease. A series of site-directed mutations were performed on pHippo-EYFP expressing human hippocalcin following the QuikChange protocol (Agilent Technologies) to generate pHPCA-EYFP constructs using the following primers: T71N, 5\u2019-CGAGCATGTCTTCCGCAATTTTGACACCAACAGCG-3\u2019; A190T, 5\u2019-GCGATCCCAGCAGCACTTCCCAGTTCTCG-3\u2019; and confirmed by DNA sequencing (DNA sequencing and Services, University of Dundee). For multi-color imaging, hippocalcin genes were subcloned from pHPCA-EYFP into pEGFP-N1 or pmCherry-N1 vectors by restriction-ligation (NheI/XmaI), generating pHPCA-EGFP and pHPCA-mCherry constructs. For protein expression and purification, hippocalcin genes were amplified by PCR from pHPCA-EYFP vectors using the following primers: sense, 5\u2019-CTATGAATTCATGGGCAAGCAGAATAGC-3\u2019; antisense: 5\u2019-CTATCTCGAGTCAGAACTGGGAAGCGCTGCTG-3\u2019, and cloned by restriction-ligation into pGEX-6P1 (EcoRI/XhoI). Residues 1898-2035 from rat P/Q-type calcium channel \u03b1\u2212subunit (NM_012918) were amplified by PCR from GST-PQ (62) using the following primers: sense, 5\u2019-GGTCTCTAGGTAAGTCCACGGCCTGACAG-3\u2019; antisense, 5\u2019-ATATCTCGAGCTAGGGGAGGTAGTGTTCGCT-3\u2019; and subcloned into pE-SUMO by restriction-ligation (BsaI/XhoI). DNA fragment encoding residues 1836-1983 from mouse N-type calcium channel \u03b1\u2212subunit (NM_001042528) were obtained from GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the following primers: sense, 5\u2019-GGTCTCTAGGTAAACCTGACGAGATGACAG-3\u2019; antisense, 5\u2019-ATATCTCGAGCTACCCAGGCTGGGGCTCCCC-3\u2019; and cloned into pE-SUMO by restriction-ligation (BsaI/XhoI). The P/Q- fragment was chosen according to previous work (62) and the N-type fragment was designed as the region with greatest sequence homology to the P/Q- fragment. Cells were cultured in DMEM containing non-essential amino-acids (Life Technologies), penicillin/streptomycin (100\u2009U/ml, 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml, respectively), at 37\u2009\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in. Mouse N2A neuroblastoma culture medium was supplemented with 5% Heat inactivated FBS (Life Technologies) whereas SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% Heat inactivated FBS (Life Technologies). SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were differentiated in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 1% Heat inactivated FBS (Life Technologies) and 10\u2009\u03bcM retinoic acid for 3\u20135 days. Cells were plated on 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek) and allowed 24\u2009h to adhere before transfection with FuGENE HD (Promega) following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Cells were maintained for 12\u201324\u2009h before being used in experiments. Hippocalcin. Hippocalcin wild-type and mutant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) STAR cells overnight at 20\u2009\u00b0C after addition of 0.5\u2009mM IPTG. Cells were resuspended in 50\u2009mM Na+-HEPES, 200\u2009mM NaCl, pH 7.5 containing EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and lysed by 1-h incubation with 1\u2009mg/ml of lysosyme and sonication on ice (VibraCell, Jencons PLS). Lysates were incubated with benzonase 1\u2009h on ice and clarified by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000g. Clarified lysates were purified using 5\u2009ml of GST resin (GST agarose, ThermoFisher Scientific) equilibrated with 50\u2009mM Na+-HEPES, 200\u2009mM NaCl and GST-tag was cleaved using the PreScission protease. The purified cleaved protein was further purified on an AKTA Purifier using a Superdex 200 (26/60) gel filtration column equilibrated with 50\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5. Elution fractions were concentrated on Centricon 10\u2009kDa and aliquots were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. VGCCs. SUMO, SUMO-P/Q- and SUMO-N-type fragment proteins were expressed as described above. Clarified lysates were purified using 1\u2009ml of Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) equilibrated with 50\u2009mM Na+-HEPES, 200\u2009mM NaCl and eluted with 500\u2009mM imidazole. Fractions were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Purity of the eluted fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris, NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer, Life Technologies) and concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at 280\u2009nm (\u03b50 (hippocalcin)\u2009=\u200920\u2009065 M\u22121 cm\u22121), (\u03b50 (P/Q)\u2009=\u200927\u2009515 M\u22121 cm\u22121), (\u03b50 (N)\u2009=\u200928\u2009028 M\u22121 cm\u22121), (\u03b50 (SUMO)\u2009=\u200912\u2009010 M\u22121 cm\u22121) (Nanodrop Lite, Thermo Scientific). Molar extinction coefficient was calculated from the amino acid composition using ExPASy/ProtParam program (10,63). Hippocalcin proteins or BSA (200\u2009\u03bcg/ml\u2009=\u200910\u2009\u03bcM) were incubated with 100-fold molar excess of 6-(biotinamidocaproyamindo) N-hydroxysuccimide ester (Sigma) for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Excess biotin reagent was removed by extensive dialysis against 20\u2009mM Na+-HEPES, 100\u2009mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Biotinylated proteins were aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Hippocalcin proteins (1\u2009\u03bcM) were titrated with increasing CaCl2 concentrations in 50\u2009mM K+-HEPES, 100\u2009mM KCl, 2\u2009mM MgCl2, 5\u2009mM EGTA, pH 7.5. Intrinsic fluorescence was measured at 280\u2009nm excitation and 340\u2009nm emission wavelengths in a 1\u2009ml quartz cuvette using a JASCO FP-6300 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco) at 20\u2009\u00b0C. All titrations were performed at least in triplicates and expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. Data were corrected for dilution, normalised and Ca2+ dissociation constant (Kd) and cooperativity (n) were obtained by fitting to the Hill equation (Prism GraphPad 6). [Ca2+] were calculated using the two-chelators Maxchelator program (25) and verified by OGB-1 titration. Data were fitted to a one-site specific binding equation using Prism GraphPad 6 software, giving a Kd for OGB-1 for Ca2+ of 132\u2009\u00b1\u200911\u2009nM, similar to the value reported by Molecular Probes (Kd\u2009=\u2009170\u2009nM, in the absence of Mg2+). Crystals for hippocalcin, hippocalcin(T71N) and hippocalcin (A190T) proteins were grown at 20\u2009\u00b0C using the sitting drop vapour diffusion method at a concentration of 50\u2009mg/ml. Wild-type protein crystallised in 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate pH 5.5, 18% v/v 2-propanol, 16% w/v PEG 4000. Hippocalcin(A190T) crystallised in the same condition but with 20% w/v PEG 4000. Crystals were cryo-protected using paratone-N and diffraction data were collected at Diamond synchrotron, beamlines IO2, IO4-1 and IO4, data were processed by iMOSFLM (64) and scaled by Aimless (65). Structure for wild-type protein was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (66), using NCS-1 (PDB 5AEQ) as a search model, structures of mutants were refined starting from wild-type structure using REFMAC5 (67) in the CCP4 (68) programme suite with isotropic B-factors, NCS restrains. TLS refinement was used during the last stages. Rebuilding of the model between refinement cycles and adding water molecules was performed in COOT (69). The quality of the models was assessed on MolProbity (70) server. For wild-type protein, residues from 6-188/7-189 for A190T mutant from 6-189/7-190; for T71N mutant from 6-188/7-190, were clearly visible for both chains A and E, respectively, in spite of high Wilson B-factor for all three data sets. Summary of diffraction data, refinement statistics and the quality indicators for the structures are given in Supplementary Material, Table S1. Size Exclusion Chromatography Multiangle Laser Light Scattering (SEC-MALS). Hippocalcin proteins (100\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on a Superdex 200\u200910/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated in 50\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing either 1\u2009mM CaCl2 or 5\u2009mM EGTA at 0.75\u2009ml/min (AKTA Pure, GE Healthcare). Protein elution was monitored by a Wyatt HELEOS-II 18-angle laser photometer (DAWN8+\u2009for light scattering measurement, Wyatt Technology) and an Optilab rEX refractive index detector. Molar masses were obtained using the Astra software (version 6.1.2.84) (Wyatt Technology). P/Q- (residues 1898-2035), N-type (residues 1836-1983) fragments and SUMO (negative control) proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris, NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer, Life Technologies) were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes for analysis. Biotinylated BSA was added to the samples as loading control. Membranes were incubated in blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1\u2009h and then incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C with biotinylated probes at 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml in 5% BSA in 50\u2009mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 (with or without the addition of 5\u2009mM EGTA). Membranes were washed 3 times in 50\u2009mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009mM EGTA and incubated with Streptavidin-HRP conjugate (Amersham) peroxidase at 1:400 in blocking solution for 1\u2009h. The membranes were washed 3 times as above, and bound biotinylated proteins were detected using Pierce ECL western blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific) on a ChemiDoc XRS+\u2009(Biorad). Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with hippocalcin-mCherry constructs and loaded with 1\u2009\u03bcM Fluo-4-AM (Molecular Probes) for 30\u2009min in the absence or in the presence of 0.4\u2009\u03bcM \u03c9-agatoxin IVA (Abcam, P/Q-type calcium channel blocker), 10\u2009\u03bcM \u03c9-conotoxin MVIIC (Sigma, P/Q- and N-type calcium channel blocker) or 1\u2009\u03bcM \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA (Abcam, N-type calcium channel blocker). Cells were examined at 37\u2009\u00b0C (OKO lab incubation chamber) in a 35-mm glass bottom dish (MatTek) with a 3i Marianas spinning-disk confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1, a 40x/1.3 oil immersion objective and a 3i Laserstack as excitation light source (488\u2009nm, for Fluo-4; 561\u2009nm, for hippocalcin-mCherry). Emitted light was collected through single bandpass filters (Yokogawa CSU-X filter wheel) onto a CMOS camera (Hamamatsu, ORCA Flash 4.0; 1152x1656 pixels). Cells were stimulated with 50\u2009mM KCl and images were collected every 5\u2009s for 1\u2009min. The time course for intracellular calcium influx was monitored over an elliptical region of interest (ROI) in the cell body using ImageJ program. Data obtained from 9 to 22 cells was plotted and analysed on GraphPad Prism. Results are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM unless indicated otherwise. Biophysical experiments were performed at least in triplicates and analysed using GraphPad Prism software. Cell experiments were carried out on three independent preparations each.

From 1999 through 2002, the median prevalence of MDR TB in new case-patients was at critical levels (>6.5%) in specific regions of the world, including the Baltic states and other eastern European countries (2). In 2004, the Russian Federation, China, and India accounted for 62% of the estimated global MDR TB cases (3). The increases in prevalence and incidence of MDR TB are most likely caused by inadequate treatment regimens (4). Recently, public health awareness about MDR TB has been reenforced by the occurrence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB outbreaks associated with HIV, particularly in South Africa (5,6). Surveillance of drug resistance, based on annual case reporting of drug susceptibility tests, has been ongoing in Europe since 1998 and includes annual reporting of MDR TB cases after the start of treatment (7). In the 1990s, molecular methods became available and have allowed researchers to study issues in the epidemiology of TB (8). Strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing genotype, which constitute a group of genetically closely related strains (9), have been associated with high levels of drug resistance in countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU), including Latvia (10) and Estonia (11); these strains have been of low prevalence (6%\u20137%) in Western Europe (12). Public health officials are concerned about possible emergence and transmission of MDR TB strains across Europe (cross-border migration), but no system is in place to identify whether MDR TB strains are shared (clustered) among European countries. Risk factors for possible clustering have yet to be determined. When the drug resistance surveillance project began, data on MDR TB cases were reported in aggregated format at the European level and could not be linked to molecular data identified from individual MDR TB cases. Also, a need existed to further identify the association between Beijing genotype strains or M. tuberculosis strains of other genotypes and MDR TB in Europe. Molecular surveillance of MDR TB was developed in Europe in recent years, first, in a pilot phase as part of the European Concerted Action on Tuberculosis project and, prospectively, since 2005, with the MDR TB project presented in this paper (13). The objectives of this project were to identify molecular clusters of MDR TB cases reported in >1 European country, to describe epidemiologic risk factors associated with MDR TB cases, and to initiate cluster investigations at the national level to prevent cross-border transmission. In this article, based on surveillance data, we describe the main epidemiologic and demographic characteristics of MDR TB cases reported from January 2003 through June 2007 in 24 European countries. We also describe characteristics of the main European clusters and identify risk factors for clustering and association with the Beijing strain of M. tuberculosis. In 2005, all 53 countries of the World Health Organization\u2019s European region were invited to participate in the MDR TB surveillance project by Euro TB and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Countries were encouraged to provide both epidemiologic and genotyping data on MDR TB cases reported since January 1, 2003. However, countries that could provide only epidemiologic data were also included in the surveillance project. National surveillance institutions sent quarterly updates of individual and anonymous data on MDR TB cases reported since 2003 to EuroTB, according to a standardized data file specification (www.eurotb.org/mdr_tb_surveillance/pdf/DFS_NSI_short.pdf). Each patient had a unique record identifier by country. Common definitions of variables were used by participating countries, including demographic, clinical, and genotyping information. In 18 countries, the country of origin was defined as the country of birth. Because of confidentiality constraints, country of birth was not reported for some countries. Country of citizenship was used to qualify the origin of patients for 2 countries. Either country of birth or country of citizenship was used in 3 countries, and information on geographic origin was unavailable in 1 country. A patient had to be reported again (with a new identifier) when a new MDR M. tuberculosis isolate was obtained >24 months after the previously reported MDR TB isolate. However, the possibility of a case being reported twice in the same country or in 2 countries was low. National laboratories sent insertion sequence (IS) 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns from available MDR TB strains collected since 2003 to the RIVM every 3 months, either as a Bionumerics bundle (Applied Maths, Sint-Maartens-Latem, Belgium) or as a scanned image (14). To be included in the project, laboratories had to perform drug susceptibility testing and participate in an international quality assurance program. For quality assurance, either participating laboratories represented supranational reference laboratories of the World Health Organization and the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and participated in the yearly proficiency testing for isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ethambutol (15,16), or laboratories had their external quality assurance conducted by such a reference laboratory. For 1 country, drug susceptibility testing was performed in a laboratory abroad. More details (e.g., on drug susceptibility test methods) can be found in the 2006 EuroTB report (17). European cluster information was communicated by the RIVM (Bilthoven, the Netherlands) to EuroTB on a quarterly basis. The final database was maintained by EuroTB and included 3 sections: A) demographic and clinical variables, B) cluster information on the basis of molecular patterns at the country level, and C) European cluster information. Data from sections A and B were matched according to a patient code; data from sections B and C were matched using the strain code attributed at the national level. IS6110 RFLP was the recommended genotyping method (18) to report IS6110 RFLP patterns to RIVM. For most countries, genotyping was performed locally; for 2 countries, genotyping was performed at RIVM. A European cluster was defined as >2 MDR TB cases with M. tuberculosis isolates that shared identical IS6110 RFLP patterns in >2 countries (18). A national cluster included cases diagnosed in a single country. Determination of a national cluster (a cluster including MDR TB cases diagnosed in 1 participating country) could be based on 3 typing methods: IS6110 RFLP typing (18), spoligotyping (19), and/or typing that used mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units with variable numbers of tandem repeats (20). In each laboratory, quality control of the molecular typing practices and computer-assisted analysis was included as described in the standardized methods (14). The DNA fingerprint patterns of MDR TB strains received at the RIVM were submitted to the molecular database managed by the RIVM (MDRTBase) by using the Bionumerics software (Applied Maths), and the database manager performed a quality check. The IS6110 RFLP patterns newly added to the MDRTBase were then compared with all other patterns stored in this database. The MDR TB strains were classified as clustered (included in a European cluster) or \u201cunique\u201d (not included in a European cluster). In addition to specifying European cluster reports, the database manager also specified strains belonging to the Beijing genotype family of M. tuberculosis by compariing them with the 19 reference RFLP patterns of Beijing strains described by Kremer et al. (21). Factors associated with clustering or infection with a Beijing genotype strain were determined by the unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression model using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The explanatory variables were demographic (sex, age, origin) and clinical (pulmonary vs. extrapulmonary TB, TB history) characteristics of MDR TB cases. XDR TB was studied as an explanatory variable for patients with drug susceptibility results meeting the definition of XDR TB (22) in both cluster and strain analyses. The proportion of clustering among Beijing strains was compared with the proportion of clustering among strains of other genotypes. Because of the limited numbers per category, \u201cunknown\u201d categories were removed from all variables included in the model, as was the age category \u201c<15 years\u201d and the category \u201cother\u201d for the variable country of origin. Analyses, including clustering and the XDR variable, were performed in the univariate model only because of the variables\u2019 strong association with origin in the Baltic states (\u03c72 97.1, p<0.001) and other countries of the FSU (\u03c72 20.5, p<0.001). Twenty-four countries from the European Union and western Europe plus Croatia and Macedonia participated in the MDR TB project (Table 1). Epidemiologic data on 2,494 MDR TB cases reported from January 2003 through July 2007 were sent to EuroTB. The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) reported 1,616 cases, representing 65% of total cases. In some countries, epidemiologic data were reported for <3 years (Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Spain). Laboratories from 19 countries sent 672 IS6110 RFLP patterns to the RIVM, 593 of which also had epidemiologic information and were linked to the epidemiologic database maintained by EuroTB (Table 1; Figure 1). Linkage of molecular and epidemiologic data was not possible for data from the United Kingdom and for data on a few cases from 6 other countries. The average proportion of MDR TB cases documented with both epidemiologic and genotyping data in 18 countries was 593/1,523 (39%), varying from 9% to 100%. After we removed data from 2 countries with low data completeness for genotypes (Germany and Lithuania), we found that the average proportion of MDR TB cases with both epidemiologic and genotyping data was 68%. Individual data on second-line drug tests for 2 to 5 second-line drugs included in the XDR TB definition (22) were reported for 1,302 cases by 16 countries from January 2003 through July 2007 (Figure 1). Of the 672 MDR TB strains with IS6110 RFLP patterns reported, 288 (43%) were identified as belonging to European clusters (Table 2; Figure 1). The proportion of MDR TB strains included in European clusters was <20% in 7 countries (Croatia, France, Italy, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). A large proportion (38%) of the RFLP patterns submitted to the molecular database originated from Estonia, where 80% (183/228) of the strains clustered. The number of MDR TB strains identified in national clusters was 170 among 330 strains (51%) reported in 13 of the 19 countries with genotyping data. In these 13 countries, the proportion of intercountry clustering was 28%. Eighteen distinct European clusters (range 2\u2013175 cases) were identified in 16 countries (Table 3). Clusters E0051, E0054, E0055, E0057, E0063, E0066, and E0069 were characterized by Beijing genotype strains, comprising 242/288 (84%) clustered MDR TB cases. The characteristics of the 4 largest clusters are described below. The largest cluster, E0051, consisted of 175 MDR TB cases reported in 12 countries. Of these 175 cases, 148 (85%) were reported in Estonia. No significant differences were found between case-patients included in cluster E0051 and those included in other clusters for sex, age category, TB history, and XDR TB (\u03c72 test, p>0.05). A large proportion (119/148, 81%) of the case-patients reported in Estonia also originated from this country (Figure 2). The proportion of case-patients who had never had TB (either no diagnosis or no treatment) was high (90/148, 61%). Thirty-three cases (22%) were identified as XDR TB. Eight of the 175 case-patients in cluster E0051 were reported in Israel, and all 8 originated from FSU countries (6 from the Russian Federation, 1 from Georgia, and 1 from Kazakhstan); all were pulmonary patients and alive at the time of diagnosis. No information was available on previous TB diagnosis or treatment. None of the 8 MDR TB cases reported in Israel were XDR. The 6 case-patients reported in Lithuania also originated from that country. Five of these case-patients were known to have had a previous diagnosis of TB; XDR TB was not diagnosed in these case-patients. The 3 case-patients reported in Belgium originated from the Russian Federation (n = 2) and from Georgia. Their TB history was unknown. For the 2 case-patients reported in Finland, origin was unknown. One of the 2 case-patients reported in Switzerland was from Armenia; the origin of the other case-patient was unknown. The 2 case-patients reported in the Netherlands and Sweden originated from the Russian Federation. Twenty-eight of the 33 case-patients included in the second largest cluster, E0054, had a known origin. All but 1 (from Israel) originated from FSU countries (17 originating and reported in Estonia). Eighteen of the 22 case-patients included in cluster E0055 had a known origin; 13 were reported in Estonia, 2 in Israel, 1 in Lithuania, 1 in the Netherlands, and 1 in Sweden. All originated from FSU countries, except the case-patient in the Netherlands, who originated from Sri Lanka. Cluster E0053 (non-Beijing) included 10 cases with known origin. Five case-patients originated from the country of report, and 5 others originated from Africa (2 from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, 2 from Nigeria, and 1 from Mali). Because this cluster was characterized by an M. tuberculosis strain containing 4 copies of IS6110, it could possibly be subdivided if additional DNA typing methods are used. As indicated in Table 3, two other clusters were also caused by low\u2013copy-number strains: clusters E0070 (4 cases) and E0067 (3 cases). Risk factors for clustering were analyzed for 521 cases documented with both molecular and epidemiologic data reported by 16 countries. Lithuania and Germany were excluded from this analysis due to incomplete genotyping data. Among these 521 cases, 250 (48%) belonged to European clusters and 271 (52%) had isolates with unique DNA fingerprint patterns (Figure 1). The results of univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with clustering are presented in Table 4. Univariate analysis showed that origin from the Baltic states or other FSU countries, age category 45\u201364 years, and pulmonary tuberculosis were significantly associated with clustering. Among these variables, only origin from the Baltic states (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 25.1, confidence interval [CI] 9.9\u201364.0) or other FSU countries (adjusted OR 8.7, 95% CI 3.2\u201323.2) remained strongly associated with clustering in the multivariate model. The proportion of XDR TB cases was significantly higher among clustered strains than among unique strains (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.9\u20138.7). Analysis to identify Beijing genotype strains was possible for 500 of the 521 MDR TB strains with both epidemiologic and genotyping data (data from Germany and Lithuania were excluded). Of these 500 strains, 284 (57%) were identified as the Beijing genotype and 216 (43%) were non-Beijing genotypes (Figure 1). Univariate analysis demonstrated that origin from the Baltic states or other FSU countries, age categories 45\u201364 years and >65 years, and pulmonary TB were significantly associated with strains of the Beijing genotype (Table 5). Among these variables, origin from Baltic states and other FSU countries remained strongly associated with Beijing genotype strains in the multivariate analysis. Proportions of clustering and XDR TB were significantly higher among Beijing strains than among other genotype strains, (OR 19.6, 95% CI 12.3\u201331.2, and OR 5.5, 95% CI 2.1\u201314.3, respectively). After exclusion of the largest cluster, E0051 (n = 166 cases with epidemiologic data), characterized by a Beijing strain, the association between clustering and the Beijing genotype was 5\u00d7 less but still quite strong for 334 MDR TB cases with genotyping data (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.7\u20137.6). Molecular surveillance of MDR TB cases in Europe showed several large molecular clusters (also including XDR TB cases). The largest cluster (175 cases) was mainly localized in Estonia (information to be completed for Lithuania and Latvia). Origin from the Baltic states and other FSU countries was strongly associated with clustering. The proportion of XDR TB was high among clustered strains. The high proportion of MDR TB case-patients without reported TB history suggests circulation of primary MDR strains in these countries. Three of the 18 European clusters were caused by low-copy strains and may represent false clustering. However, because these clusters consisted of only a few cases, the proportion of European clustering found in this project (43%) is probably only slightly (<3%) overestimated. A high proportion (55%) of genotyped MDR TB strains belonged to the Beijing genotype family. Strains of the Beijing genotype family were mainly reported for case-patients originating from the Baltic states and other FSU countries, where the prevalence of this genotype is also high in the general population (12). The 3 largest clusters were characterized by strains of the Beijing genotype family (84% of the clustered MDR TB cases). Two hypotheses may explain the occurrence of the large clusters in Europe that were detected in this project. The first hypothesis is direct person-to-person transmission. This hypothesis can be verified by cluster investigation of the cases (by using contact-tracing data if available) in countries with cases reported in clusters. Verifying that the isolates, especially of the largest clusters, represent a single strain is important and can be done by contact investigations and application of an additional typing method such as the newly standardized 24-loci variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing (23). The second hypothesis is that genetically highly related strains are responsible for most MDR TB cases in Europe and that only a part of the cases in these clusters is associated with direct person-to-person transmission. In both scenarios, conditions could be improved by reinforcing case management (including healthcare access), following up on treatment (especially drug compliance), and increasing social support. Adequate infection control measures should also be ensured in healthcare facilities. The second scenario underlines that more fundamental research (including detailed research on DNA repair, fitness, and transmissibility) is needed to better understand changes in the bacterial population structure of TB, including the drug-susceptible bacterial population and the ongoing evolutionary development of M. tuberculosis. This study was limited by a lack of completeness of the genotyping information and, to a lesser extent, of epidemiologic information. Data completeness varied by country. For some countries (Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany), the molecular data reported represent only a fraction of the molecular data available because these countries also used alternative DNA typing methods, which were not included in this project. Other countries have not yet implemented genotyping. Low data completeness in some countries could have affected the proportion of clustered versus unique strains, possibly introducing a bias in the interpretation of the risk factor analysis. However, the proportion of MDR TB cases submitted with both epidemiologic and genotyping information from 16 (68%) countries is promising, considering that IS6110 RFLP typing is technically demanding. This proportion could probably be improved in the future with the implementation of the recently standardized VNTR typing (23). Another limitation of this study was that the identification of MDR TB clusters was based on genotype clustering. Therefore, person-to-person transmission could not be proven. Ideally, transmission dynamics should be confirmed by conventional contact investigations to link patients to contact persons (24). For the main clusters, EuroTB correspondents (from the countries where these clusters have been identified) have received the identification numbers of the clustered MDR TB cases and were able to communicate with colleagues from other countries concerned by the same cluster and exchange information on case histories. However, for the largest MDR TB cluster (E0051), a special field investigation of cases would be necessary and would require international support and coordination. With the limitations of this study, the findings represented here may not be representative of all MDR TB cases in Europe. MDR TB cases included in clusters should be investigated (including contact-tracing data) in countries where they have been identified to increase knowledge about cross-border transmission of MDR TB and XDR TB and to identify routes of transmission and additional risk factors for these transmission pathways. The outputs of the investigations will enable interventions that prevent further transmission of MDR TB and XDR TB caused by increasing migration between European countries. Standards should be developed to conduct these investigations, including mechanisms to inform concerned national authorities when a molecular cluster is detected and a method for linking epidemiologic and genotyping data at the European level. Delays between diagnosis of MDR TB cases and cluster detection should be reduced to facilitate appropriate actions in the concerned countries and to avoid international transmission of these strains. International collaboration in cluster investigations should be encouraged Results of this project are preliminary because data are not complete for all countries. Since March 2008, European surveillance of MDR TB has been undertaken by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. A molecular component has been added in this surveillance program. Ideally, this project should be extended to other European Union countries and neighboring countries that could provide genotyping data."}, "30836660": {"pmid": "30836660", "pmcid": "PMC6429495", "title": "Salidroside Ameliorates Renal Interstitial Fibrosis by Inhibiting the TLR4/NF-\u03baB and MAPK Signaling Pathways", "abstract": "\nSalidroside (Sal) is an active ingredient that is isolated from Rhodiola rosea, which has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activities and a renal protective effect. However, the role of Sal on renal fibrosis has not yet been elucidated. Here, the purpose of the current study is to test the protective effects of Sal against renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF), and to explore the underlying mechanisms using both in vivo and in vitro models. In this study, we establish the unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) or folic acid (FA)-induced mice renal interstitial fibrosis in vivo and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21-stimulated human proximal tubular epithelial cell (HK-2) model in vitro. The levels of kidney functional parameters and inflammatory cytokines in serum are examined. The degree of renal damage and fibrosis is determined by histological assessment. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting are used to determine the mechanisms of Sal against RIF. Our results show that treatment with Sal can ameliorate tubular injury and deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components (including collagen \u0428 and collagen I). Furthermore, Sal administration significantly suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by a decreased expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, TGF-\u03b21, snail, slug, and a largely restored expression of E-cadherin. Additionally, Sal also reduces the levels of serum biochemical markers (serum creatinine, Scr; blood urea nitrogen, BUN; and uric acid, UA) and decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1). Further study revealed that the effect of Sal on renal interstitial fibrosis is associated with the lower expression of TLR4, p-I\u03baB\u03b1, p-NF-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, Sal treatment improves kidney function, ameliorates the deposition of the ECM components and relieves the protein levels of EMT markers in mouse kidneys and HK-2 cells. Furthermore, Sal treatment significantly decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines and inhibits the TLR4/NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways. Collectively, these results suggest that the administration of Sal could be a novel therapeutic strategy in treating renal fibrosis.\n", "fulltext": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a leading public health issue, being the third highest cause of premature mortality (82%), behind AIDS and diabetes mellitus. It has been predicted that about 160 million individuals will be affected by CKD by 2020. Despite the seriousness of this problem, there are not enough therapeutic options for CKD in the clinical setting. Therefore, there is a need for people to find more effective therapeutics to treat CKD and reduce healthcare expenditure. Meanwhile, understanding the mechanisms behind renal interstitial fibrosis is essential for developing therapies to prevent or reverse the progression of CKD. Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) is the final common outcome of CKD and ultimately end-stage renal failure. The histopathology of renal interstitial fibrosis features deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components, loss of tubular cells, accumulation of fibroblasts, and rarefaction of the peritubular microvasculature. The ECM components include collagen I and collagen \u0428. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the most important cause of renal interstitial fibrosis and is characterized by renal tubular epithelial cells that acquire mesenchymal phenotypes and myofibroblast functions. The transition of EMT induces kidney epithelial cells to decrease the expression of adherens junction proteins such as E-cadherin, and strongly induces the expression of fibroblast markers, including vimentin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). TGF-\u03b21, snail, and slug are important profibrotic mediators for EMT. Renal fibrosis is almost always evolved by the infiltration of inflammatory cells, including increased inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2). Although inflammation is an integral part of the host defense mechanism response to injury, nonresolving inflammation is a major driving force in the development of fibrotic disease. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an important mediator of inflammation in the kidney. It has been reported that TLR4 mediates both pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways in renal fibrosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a primary ligand for the TLR4 receptor and studies have shown that LPS induces the aggregation of TLR4 on HK-2 cells, promoting an inflammatory response. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) is also known to be important in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and treatment with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) shows attenuated renal injury and inflammation in animal models of CKD. These findings reveal that NF-\u03baB plays a pivotal role in the progression of chronic renal inflammation. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, including JNK, Erk, and \u03a138, is involved in the production of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators. The MAPK pathway is activated by multiple stimulations, including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, which cause the translocation of cytoplasmic nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) from nucleus to active NF-\u03baB. In addition, MAPK activation has been reported to be involved in the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 and ECM proteins. Salidroside (Sal, p-hydroxyphenethyl-bD-glucoside, C14H20O7, structure shown in Figure 1A), one of the bioactive compounds extracted from Rhodiola rosea L., has many pharmacological effects, such as anti-cancer, anti-depressive, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-ulcer and cardioprotective. However, there have been no reports on Sal in the context of renal interstitial fibrosis. Therefore, this study aims to provide insight into the therapeutic effects of Sal in the context of renal interstitial fibrosis and attempts to explore the molecular mechanisms. The serum levels of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and uric acid (UA) are the classical indicators of renal function. The serum concentrations of UA, Scr, and BUN were significantly increased in the folic acid (FA) mice. Sal reduced the serum levels of UA, Scr, and BUN in renal fibrotic mice (Figure 1B). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed renal structural damage, inflammatory cell infiltration and extracellular matrix deposition in the unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) and FA mice, which was significantly restored by Sal (Figure 1C,D). Additionally, Masson\u2019s staining showed a large number of collagen fiber streaks, staining blue with prominent collagen fiber hypertrophy in the UUO and FA mice. However, fewer collagen fiber streaks (blue stained area) were observed when the mice were treated with Sal (Figure 1C,D). These results indicated that Sal ameliorated renal damage and fibrosis in the fibrotic mice. In order to investigate the inflammatory alterations in RIF, we detected the levels of inflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in the UUO and FA mice. As expected, all factors notably increased in the serum of UUO and FA mice, indicating that inflammation plays an important role in the development of renal fibrosis. Consistently, Sal remarkably decreased the levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in the serum of the UUO and FA mice (Figure 1E,F), indicating that Sal could inhibit the inflammatory response in RIF. To evaluate whether Sal could affect the levels of ECM and fibrosis markers, we performed western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis on the kidney tissue. The primary feature of renal interstitial fibrosis is the accumulation of ECM components. Collagen I and collagen \u0428 are the main components of ECM. The levels of collagen I and collagen \u0428 were notably enhanced in the UUO mice, whereas these alternations were significantly inhibited by Sal (Figure 2A). Myofibroblasts are considered to be a primary renal interstitial cell, responsible for production of ECM during fibrosis. Furthermore, EMT activation has been associated with myofibroblast production. In the present study, Sal was found to downregulate \u03b1-SMA and vimentin protein levels, and upregulate E-cadherin protein levels in UUO mice (Figure 2A). TGF-\u03b21, snail, and slug are key regulators of the EMT program and RIF, whereas Sal attenuates the UUO-induced upregulation of TGF-\u03b21, snail, and slug in UUO mice. In the immunohistochemistry analysis, the effect of Sal on the expressions of collagen I, vimentin, and E-cadherin in the kidney tissue was further examined (Figure 2B). Sal downregulated the collagen I and vimentin protein levels and upregulated the E-cadherin protein level in UUO mice. The same effect of Sal was observed in the FA mice (Figure 3A,B). The results indicated that Sal could prevent the expression of ECM components and EMT markers. Inflammation contributes to the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis, as TLR4 induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines. As the promoter of a signaling pathway, TLR4 activates NF-\u043aB and MAPK and also stimulates pro-inflammatory reactions. In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Sal on renal interstitial fibrosis, western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments were conducted. In the western blotting, Sal significantly suppressed the expression of TLR4, p-I\u043aB\u03b1, p-NF-\u03baB, p-\u03a138, p-ERK, and p-JNK in UUO mice (Figure 4A). The immunohistochemistry experiment also was used in our study. The results of the experiment showed that Sal treatment significantly suppressed the expression of TLR4 in UUO mice (Figure 4B). The same effect of Sal was observed in the FA mice (Figure 5A,B). In conclusion, the TLR4/NF-\u043aB and MAPK signaling pathways might play a role in RIF, and Sal ameliorates RIF by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-\u043aB and MAPK signaling pathways. First, we assessed the cytotoxicity effect of salidroside on HK-2 cells. The results showed that Sal (2, 10, and 50 uM) treatment did not affect the viability of HK-2 cells (Figure 6A). We used a TGF-\u03b21-induced HK-2 cell to detect the effect of Sal in vitro. TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/mL) obviously increased the protein expression level of collagen I, collagen \u0428, \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, TGF-\u03b21, snail, and slug in the model group, while E-cadherin was downregulated when compared with the control group. In agreement with the in vivo results, Sal (2, 10, 50 \u03bcM) significantly restored these alterations (Figure 6B). The results showed that Sal could prevent the expression of fibrosis markers and the ECM in TGF-\u03b21-activated HK-2 cells. In order to investigate the anti-EMT mechanism of Sal in TGF-\u03b21-induced HK-2 cells, western blotting was conducted. The results demonstrated the upregulation of TLR4, p-I\u043aB\u03b1, p-NF-\u03baB, p-\u03a138, p-ERK, and p-JNK when compared with the control group, while the Sal treatment group effectively restored these alterations (Figure 6C). These results revealed that Sal suppresses the inflammatory response of TGF-\u03b21-induced HK-2 cells by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways. In order to verify that salidroside works by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a TLR4 receptor agonist) to stimulate the HK-2 cells. We detected the levels of inflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in an LPS-induced HK-2 cell (Figure 7A). The results showed that inflammatory cytokines were notably increased in the model group and that Sal remarkably decreased the levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in the culture supernatant of the HK-2 cells. In immunofluorescence, the effect of Sal (50 \u03bcM) on the nuclear transport process of NF-\u03baBp65 in LPS-induced HK-2 cells was examined further (Figure 7B). As expected, Sal significantly suppressed the nuclear transport process of NF-\u03baBp65 in LPS-induced HK-2 cells. The results of the western blot experiment showed that the expression of TLR4, p-I\u043aB\u03b1, p-NF-\u03baB, p-\u03a138, p-ERK, and p-JNK were significantly increased in the LPS group, while the salidroside (50 uM) treatment group effectively suppressed the expression of these proteins (Figure 7C). These results revealed that Sal suppresses TLR4-mediated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways. In summary, Sal could protect against RIF both in vivo and in vitro. These results confirm that Sal could inhibit the accumulation of the ECM and reduce the inflammatory response via the TLR4/NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that Sal has many pharmacological activities. Specifically, Sal exhibits anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, both in vitro and in vivo. Our research reveals the anti-fibrosis effect of Sal and its potential mechanisms. The new findings are as follows: (1) Sal effectively inhibits the accumulation of the ECM and the EMT process in RIF. (2) Sal ameliorates renal fibrosis, both in vitro and in vivo. (3) Sal inhibits the inflammatory response and EMT process by suppressing the TLR4/NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways, as illustrated in Figure 8. Animal models of RIF provide an opportunity to explore underlying mechanisms and novel therapies. The UUO-induced RIF model has been widely used to mimic the pathological alterations of chronic obstructive nephropathy which are commonly observed in patients with CKD. Complete ureteral obstruction is not a common cause of human renal disease. However, the UUO model is useful to examine the mechanisms of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in vivo. This model can be induced in either rats or mice and shows no specific strain dependence. Complete UUO rapidly reduces renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate in the obstructed kidney within 24 h. The subsequent responses arise during the 7 days thereafter, which include interstitial inflammation (peak at 2 to 3 days), tubular dilation, tubular atrophy and fibrosis. The obstructed kidney reaches the end stage by around 2 weeks. Folic acid induces RIF, and high dosages of folic acid (250 mg/kg) are given to mice to rapidly induce folic acid crystals, leading to tubular necrosis in the acute phase (1\u201314 days) and patchy interstitial fibrosis in the chronic phase (28\u201342 days). RIF is induced both by the crystal obstruction and the direct toxic effect to the tubular epithelial cells. Most renal disorders result in renal fibrosis, so there is great interest in identifying the underlying factors behind this issue to prevent or reverse renal fibrosis. The proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts with myofibroblast transformation leads to excess deposition of the extracellular matrix and renal fibrosis. The majority of CKDs are characterized by excessive ECM accumulation, including collagen I, collagen \u0428 and fibronectin. In the tubulointerstitium of the kidneys, many cells are capable of producing the ECM, but fibroblasts are the principal matrix-producing cells that generate a large amount of interstitial matrix components. Fibroblasts in the kidneys are different, with SMA-positive myofibroblasts and express vimentin. Snail is a key transcription factor that induces EMT, fibroblast migration and renal fibrosis. It is required for the development of fibrosis in renal epithelial cells. The reactivation of snail induces a partial EMT in tubular epithelial cells and promotes fibrogenesis, myofibroblast differentiation, and inflammation. A large number of studies have shown that TGF-\u03b21 is a key mediator and is highly upregulated in renal fibrosis in both experimental models and human kidneys. TGF-\u03b21 can promote extracellular matrix (ECM) production and inhibit its degradation to mediate progressive RIF. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 has been identified to be the most potent inducer of EMT, which can induce tubular epithelial cells (TECs) to transform into myofibroblasts. In our study, TGF-\u03b21 was used to induce the transformation of HK-2 cells into myoblasts. Our results show that TGF-\u03b21 can successfully induce EMT via activation of the TLR4/MAPK/NF-\u043aB signaling pathways. Our results indicated that salidroside treatment significantly decreased the deposition of ECM and EMT markers, both in vivo and in vitro. The correlation between fibrosis and inflammation has been established and supported by morphological evidence. A large number of studies have shown that the inflammatory response is necessary in the process of RIF. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate immune receptors that respond to endogenous danger factors and promote the activation of immune and inflammatory responses in RIF. TLR4 is involved in systemic chronic diseases associated with inflammation, such as chronic kidney diseases, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. TLR4, as the promoter of a signaling pathway, activates nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and stimulates pro-inflammatory responses. Some studies have revealed that the knockdown of the TLR4 significantly reduces the risk of fibrosis. Renal fibrosis could be effectively ameliorated through inhibition of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. In addition, findings have also indicated that direct contact between tubular and monocytes cells might be required to induce tubular EMT via a NF-\u03baB-dependent pathway. Activating the NF-\u03baB pathway could directly contribute to fibroblast activation and renal fibrosis. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are intracellular signaling molecules that elicit diverse pro-inflammatory and profibrotic effects, both in vitro and in vivo. The anti-fibrosis effect has been reported recently in experimental models of RIF, showing that the blockade of the MAPK pathway ameliorated renal fibrosis. Several MAPK inhibitors have been developed and even applied in various stages of clinical trials. The JNK and \u03a138 pathways play important roles in the production of pro-inflammatory and profibrotic mediators, which are activated by various cellular stresses. The administration of JNK and \u03a138 pharmacological inhibitors has been shown to suppress the development of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in various animal models. Activated JNK and p38 also increase TGF-\u03b21 gene transcription and induce enzyme expression that activates the latent form of TGF-\u03b21. Many inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) can induce JNK, \u03a138, and NF-\u03baB activation. Tubular apoptosis is a typical feature of renal fibrosis. The ERK pathway can ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis through the suppression of tubular EMT. The present study shows that Sal obviously suppresses the expression of TLR4, p-I\u043aB\u03b1, p-NF-\u03baB, p-\u03a138, p-ERK, and p-JNK, relieving the inflammatory response and ameliorating renal fibrosis. In our study, we confirmed that Sal ameliorates renal interstitial fibrosis by inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration and reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, Sal ameliorates renal fibrosis by reducing ECM accumulation and blocking the TLR4/NF-\u043aB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results of this study provide new insights into reversing renal fibrosis through the anti-inflammatory effects of Sal. More studies are needed to further clarify the underlying mechanisms and enhance the performance of Sal in protecting RIF.

All male C57BL/6 mice (age, 8\u201310 weeks; weight, 20\u201322 g) were purchased from the Jiangning Qinglongshan Animal Cultivation Farm (Nanjing, China) and were acclimated for 1 week before the experiment in the standard laboratory animal facility (25 \u00b0C, 12 h light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water. All studies were carried out in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the ethical guidelines of China Pharmaceutical University. Forty male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 10): (1) Sham group, (2) UUO group, (3) UUO + Sal (40 mg/kg) group, and the (4) UUO + Sal (80 mg/kg) group. The UUO or sham surgery was carried out under anesthesia with 3% chloral hydrate. Left proximal ureteral ligation was performed with 4-0 silk at two points and a cut was made between the points of ligation. The sham group had their ureters exposed and manipulated without ligation. Mice were given Sal at the corresponding dose by daily gastric gavage, beginning the first day after the surgical procedure. The sham and UUO groups were given identical volumes of saline. The mice were sacrificed on day 14 post-surgery for renal tissue and blood sampling. The blood was centrifuged (4000\u00d7 g) for 10 min to obtain the serum, and the kidneys were harvested and then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C or fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Forty male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 10): (1) Control group, (2) FA group, (3) FA + Sal (40 mg/kg) group), and the (4) FA + Sal (80 mg/kg) group. The mice were injected with a single dose of folic acid (250 mg/kg, dissolved in 300 mM NaHCO3, i.p.), while the control group was injected with an identical voluminal vehicle (300 mM NaHCO3, i.p.). Mice were given Sal (40 and 80 mg/kg) at the corresponding dose by daily gastric gavage, beginning the first day after they were injected with FA. The kidney and blood samples were collected at 34 days post-FA injection. The mice were sacrificed by spinal dislocation. Kidney samples were excised immediately, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), then paraffin-embedded. The paraffin sections were dewaxed in xylene and dehydrated with ethanol, then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess renal injury and Masson\u2019s trichrome stains to assess collagen deposition. The observations were made under light microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at a 200\u00d7 magnification. The levels of creatinine (Scr), uric acid (UA) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the serum were measured by commercial kits according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in the serum were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Elabscience, Wuhan, China). The expressions of collagen I, E-cadherin, vimentin and TLR4 in the kidney were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Briefly, the kidneys were fixed with 4% PFA, embedded in paraffin and sliced into 5 \u00b5m thick sections. The sections were dewaxed and hydrated in graded ethanol, then microwaved in a sodium citrate buffer. The endogenous peroxidase activity was reduced using 3% H2O2 for 10 min. Each sample was blocked with 5% goat serum for 10 min and then treated with primary antibodies collagen I (1:100), E-cadherin (1:200), vimentin (1:200) and TLR4 (1:50) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The next day, the sections were incubated with the goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 10 min. Then, the sections were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin. After dehydrating and drying, the sections were mounted with neutral gum and observed under a microscope. The HK-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/F-12 nutrient mixture (DMEM/F12, NanJing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Grand Island, NE, USA), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 IU/mL streptomycin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. The HK-2 cells were seeded on 6-well-plate at a density of 2 \u00d7 105 cell/well for 24 h. Afterwards, 5 ng/mL TGF-\u03b21, with or without Sal (2, 10, 50 \u03bcM), stimulated the cells for 48 h. For further verification, LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) and LPS plus Sal (50 \u03bcM) also stimulated the cells for 24 h. All the cells were then collected for the various analyses. The kidney tissues and HK-2 cells were homogenated in an ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 2 mM PMSF. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and the total protein was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Nanjing, China). The protein was separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and then transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim dried milk for 2 h and incubated with primary antibodies collagen I (1:1000), collagen \u0428 (1:1000), E-cadherin (1:1000), \u03b1-SMA (1:1000), vimentin (1:1000), TGF-\u03b21 (1:200), snail (1:1000), slug (1:1000), TLR4 (1:200), I\u03baB\u03b1 (1:1000), p-I\u03baB\u03b1 (1:1000), p-NF-\u03baB (1:1000), NF-\u03baB (1:1000), Erk (1:1000), p-Erk (1:2000), JNK (1:1000), p-JNK (1:1000), \u03a138 (1:1000), p-\u03a138 (1:1000), and GAPDH (1:1000) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After that, the membranes were incubated with the second antibodies (1:1000) for 2 h. The membranes were visualized using an ECL advanced kit and detected with a gel imaging system (Tanon Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The HK-2 cells (1 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h, then treated with salidroside (0, 2, 10, 50 uM) for 24 h. Viability was assessed by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Beyotime Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) assay. The data were evaluated as the percentage of the average absorbance to control group. Cell viability (%) = (A Treated / A Control) \u00d7 100%. The expressions of NF-\u03baBp65 in the HK-2 cells were evaluated by immunofluorescence. Briefly, the cell was washed three times with PBS, then fixed with an immunol staining fix solution (Beyotime Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) for 30 min and then blocked for 2 h with a blocking reagent. The cell was incubated with the primary antibody NF-\u03baBp65 (1:200) overnight at 4 \u2103, then washed three times with PBS and incubated with the goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody, the Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 conjugate (1:500), for 2 h. After washing three times with PBS and then with DAPI for 5 min, fluorescence images were captured with fluorescence microscopy. The experimental results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The statistical significance of differences between the means of each groups was analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test. Differences in p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant."}, "27993978": {"pmid": "27993978", "pmcid": "PMC5394759", "title": "CenpH regulates meiotic G2/M transition by modulating the APC/CCdh1-cyclin B1 pathway in oocytes", "abstract": "\nABSTRACT\nMeiotic resumption (G2/M transition) and progression through meiosis I (MI) are two key stages for producing fertilization-competent eggs. Here, we report that CenpH, a component of the kinetochore inner plate, is responsible for G2/M transition in meiotic mouse oocytes. Depletion of CenpH by morpholino injection decreased cyclin B1 levels, resulting in attenuation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation, and severely compromised meiotic resumption. CenpH protects cyclin B1 from destruction by competing with the action of APC/CCdh1. Impaired G2/M transition after CenpH depletion could be rescued by expression of exogenous cyclin B1. Unexpectedly, blocking CenpH did not affect spindle organization and meiotic cell cycle progression after germinal vesicle breakdown. Our findings reveal a novel role of CenpH in regulating meiotic G2/M transition by acting via the APC/CCdh1-cyclin B1 pathway.\n", "fulltext": "Fully grown mammalian oocytes remain arrested at prophase I within antral follicles before gonadotropin signals induce the resumption of meiosis I (MI) and progression to meiosis II (MII). Prophase I arrest, also termed the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, is the result of low maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity. The resumption of meiosis, referred to as germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), is similar to the G2/M transition of mitosis in being associated with the activation of MPF. MPF is a complex of the catalytic subunit cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1; also known as Cdc2) and the regulatory subunit cyclin B1 (Doree and Hunt, 2002). Activation of Cdk1 requires the association with cyclins as well as the dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 residues by Myt1 and Wee1 protein kinases (Morgan, 1995; Nurse, 1990). Depletion of Myt1 causes partial meiotic resumption in mouse oocytes. Wee1B (Wee2), a key Cdk1 inhibitory kinase, is located in the GV-stage oocytes and depletion of its expression enhances meiotic resumption. Wee1B inhibits Cdk1 phosphatase activity, whereas the cell division cycle 25B (Cdc25B) phosphatase releases Cdk1 activity by dephosphorylating Wee1B-phosphorylated Cdk1. Knockdown of Cdc25B in GV stage oocytes inhibits meiotic resumption and causes low activity of MPF. Cyclin B1 is continuously degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) during prophase I arrest. In GV stage mouse oocytes, Cdh1 (also called Fzr1) is required for APC/C-mediated cyclin B1 destruction to arrest at prophase I. Early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1; also known as Fbxo5), an inhibitor of APC/CCdh1, is responsible for cyclin B1 destruction and inactivation of MPF. Reduction of Emi1 can delay resumption of meiosis by preventing the accumulation of cyclin B1, whereas Emi1 overexpression leads to GVBD. Interestingly, BubR1 (a spindle assembly checkpoint protein; also known as Bub1b) has been shown to affect prophase I arrest in mouse oocytes. BubR1-depleted oocytes spontaneously undergo GVBD in the presence of the chemical inhibitor IBMX. BubR1 knockdown can decrease the expression level of Cdh1. However, the GVBD rate in BubR1-depleted oocytes is reduced by injecting Cdh1 cRNA into the oocyte. Significantly, a subunit of the NDC80 complex, Hec1 (which itself is also known as Ndc80), has also been shown to regulate meiosis resumption in mouse oocytes. Depletion of Hec1 in mouse oocytes severely affects the G2/M transition because of impaired activation of Cdk1. Unexpectedly, impaired meiosis resumption is due to instability of cyclin B2, because Hec1 can protect cyclin B2 from APC/CCdh1-mediated destruction (Gui and Homer, 2013). It is widely known that CenpH localizes to kinetochores in mammals. The kinetochore plays a fundamental role in accurate chromosome segregation in eukaryotes. It is a multi-protein structure that associates with centromeric DNA and binds spindle microtubules to the chromosomes, which is required for chromosome movement. In particular, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CenpA forms the platform for kinetochore assembly. Several additional components of the constitutive centromere-associated network, including CenpC, CenpH, CenpI, and CenpK through to CenpU, have been identified to associate with CenpA. In vertebrates, a subgroup of proteins, including CenpH, CenpI and CenpK, play essential roles in kinetochore structure and function. The CenpH and CenpI complex is a direct regulator of kinetochore-microtubule dynamics and is required for faithful chromosome segregation, and as a marker directing CenpA deposition to centromeres. Absence of CenpH causes severe mitotic phenotypes, including misaligned chromosomes and multipolar spindles in human cells. Indeed, CenpH also has at least one other function involving modulation of the cell cycle through an interaction with CenpC. Interestingly, however, it is not yet known whether CenpH has other relevant roles beyond the binding of spindle microtubules to chromosomes or the chromosome segregation machinery. Here, we investigated the role of CenpH protein in regulating the meiotic cell cycle in mouse oocytes. Unexpectedly, we show that depletion of CenpH inhibits G2/M transition by continuous degradation of cyclin B1, while the prophase I arrest induced by CenpH knockdown can be rescued by injecting exogenous cyclin B1 mRNA. Finally, we show that CenpH-dependent effects on meiotic resumption require the presence of Cdh1, thereby demonstrating that CenpH-dependent regulation of APC/CCdh1 is essential for regulating prophase I arrest. To investigate the role of CenpH during meiosis, its expression and subcellular localization were examined. Oocytes were collected after having been cultured for 0, 4, 8 or 12\u2005h, corresponding to GV, GVBD, MI and MII stages, respectively. Immunoblotting analysis showed that CenpH protein was expressed from GV to MII stages (Fig.\u00a01A). CenpH was more concentrated in the germinal vesicle at the GV stage (Fig.\u00a01B). Shortly after GVBD, clear staining was observed at the kinetochores. When oocytes reached the MI and MII stages, CenpH signal was still obvious at the kinetochores of chromosomes. Subcellular CenpH localization during oocyte meiosis was similar to that in mitosis, suggesting that it might contribute to kinetochore-microtubule attachment in meiosis. For depleting CenpH in mouse oocytes, we used a morpholino (MO) antisense microinjection approach. CenpH MO was microinjected into GV stage oocytes followed by a 24\u2005h incubation in IBMX to deplete the protein. We found that CenpH protein was knocked down by 60-70% by MO injection compared with the control group (Fig.\u00a02A). Unexpectedly, only \u223c37% of CenpH-depleted oocytes underwent GVBD by 3\u2005h following release from IBMX. The percentage of oocytes at GVBD stage was significantly lower in the CenpH knockdown group than in control or wild-type oocytes (36.96\u00b113.32% versus 86.15\u00b111.09% or 89.82\u00b14.75%; P<0.05; Fig.\u00a02B). This indicated that CenpH-depleted oocytes had a reduced capacity for meiotic resumption. Furthermore, we examined Cdk1 activity by determining its Tyr15 phosphorylation state. We found that Cdk1 activity in CenpH-depleted oocytes was less than that of control oocytes by 1\u2005h following release from IBMX (Fig.\u00a02C,D). In mouse oocytes, cyclin B1 is indispensable for Cdk1 activation during the G2/M transition. We therefore examined the cyclin B1 level in CenpH-depleted oocytes and found that it was reduced (Fig.\u00a02A). This suggested that the prophase I arrest following CenpH depletion was due to reduced cyclin B1 levels and the activity of MPF. We next examined whether exogenous cyclin B1 expression could rescue the G2/M transition defect. Overexpression of cyclin B1-GFP in CenpH-depleted oocytes increased GVBD dramatically after injecting exogenous cyclin B1 mRNA (Fig.\u00a02B, Fig.\u00a0S1E). These data suggested that CenpH is required to stabilize cyclin B1, which in turn plays an indispensable role in the G2/M transition. To further confirm that CenpH depletion causes decreased levels of cyclin B1, we monitored the dynamics of cyclin B1-GFP accumulation after microinjection of exogenous cyclin B1-GFP mRNA in GV stage oocytes injected with control or CenpH MO. Loss of CenpH caused a 50% decrease in cyclin B1-GFP accumulation compared with controls (Fig.\u00a03A,B). Decreased cyclin B1-GFP accumulation in CenpH-depleted oocytes indicates that the effects of CenpH depletion are caused by cyclin B1 destabilization rather than defects in translation. Cyclin B1 translocation into the nucleus is a prerequisite for MPF activation and the occurrence of GVBD. Live cell imaging following injection of exogenous cyclin B1-GFP mRNA demonstrated the ability of the cyclin B1-GFP to accumulate in the nucleus. By contrast, in CenpH-depleted oocytes, cyclin B1-GFP failed to accumulate in the nucleus (Fig.\u00a03A,C). In mouse oocytes, APC/CCdh1-mediated destruction of cyclin B1 is indispensable for prophase I arrest. Consequently, alterations in Cdh1 levels characterize the conditions that perturb cyclin B1 accumulation and meiotic resumption. When we examined Cdh1 in CenpH-depleted oocytes using an antibody we found that levels were increased (Fig.\u00a03D). This suggested that the prophase I arrest following CenpH depletion was due to increased APC/CCdh1 activity. CenpH, as a component of the kinetochore inner plate, contributes to kinetochore-microtubule attachment in mitosis. As mentioned above, \u223c37% of CenpH MO-injected oocytes underwent GVBD by 3\u2005h following release from IBMX. These oocytes were used for subsequent observations. These MO-injected CenpH-depleted oocytes showed normal spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and polar body extrusion (Fig.\u00a0S1A,B). As this might be caused by insufficient knockdown of CenpH protein, we further examined the effect of blocking CenpH on MI spindle formation and meiotic cell progression after GVBD. First, CenpH antibody was microinjected into GV stage oocytes. Blocking of CenpH protein function by antibody injection caused prophase I arrest similar to that in the CenpH MO-injected oocytes (Fig.\u00a0S1C). This result suggested that this antibody could be used to disrupt protein function to determine the role of CenpH in mouse oocytes. The CenpH antibody was microinjected into GVBD stage oocytes. Interestingly, oocytes injected with CenpH antibody extruded the first polar body at a rate similar to those of control oocytes (Fig.\u00a0S1D). In mouse oocytes, shortly after GVBD, the earliest stage of spindle assembly is characterized by a spherical spindle with clumped chromosomes. Subsequently, at 4-8\u2005h, the spindle becomes molded into a barrel-shaped bipolar structure with the chromosomes aligned on the metaphase plate (Fig.\u00a04A). Strikingly, after blocking CenpH, we found that indexes of spindles were not significantly affected after oocyte GVBD (Fig.\u00a04B). In addition, there was no significant difference in interkinetochore distance, as revealed by anti-centromere antigen (ACA) immunostaining, between control and CenpH antibody-injected oocytes (Fig.\u00a04C). We also examined MII spindle morphology and found that indexes of MII spindles were not significantly affected in CenpH antibody-injected compared with control oocytes (Fig.\u00a05A,B). Overall, these data show that, unlike in mitosis, CenpH does not play key roles in spindle formation and the MI/MII transition during mouse oocyte meiosis. CenpH is an important member of the family of kinetochore proteins that play a crucial role in regulating the mitotic cell cycle. Here, we provide the first definitive evidence that CenpH has a role in regulating the meiotic G2/M transition via APC/CCdh1-cyclin B1 in oocytes, differing distinctly from the effects observed in mitosis. In mouse oocytes, CenpH was expressed throughout meiotic maturation (Fig.\u00a01A). Inherently, the subcellular localization of CenpH is not very different from that of mitosis: the signal was still obvious at the kinetochores at meiotic metaphase (Fig.\u00a01B). Furthermore, at the GV stage, it is more concentrated in the germinal vesicle, suggesting that CenpH might play an important role at this stage. We knocked down CenpH in GV stage oocytes by MO microinjection. Unexpectedly, \u223c63% of CenpH-depleted oocytes still maintain prophase I arrest by 3\u2005h following release from IBMX (Fig.\u00a02B). This indicates that the expression of CenpH at the GV stage is essential for oocyte meiotic resumption. The mouse oocyte provides an ideal model for studying G2/M transition, since the oocyte is arrested at the prophase of MI for an extensive period before being released from the inhibitory microenvironment. It is well known that MPF is a key regulator of G2/M transition in mouse oocytes (Jones, 2004). The Cdk1-activating cyclin at the boundary of G2/M in mouse oocytes is cyclin B1, the APC/CCdh1-mediated destruction of which is indispensable for preventing MPF activation during G2 arrest. Consequently, alterations in cyclin B1 and/or Cdh1 levels characterize many conditions that perturb Cdk1 activity and meiotic resumption. Our results show that reduction in cyclin B1 levels following CenpH depletion is due to increased APC/CCdh1activity (Fig.\u00a02A, Fig.\u00a03D), indicating that the CenpH-dependent inhibition of APC/CCdh1 in mouse oocytes is important for the control of G2/M transition. Thus, G2/M transition is critically poised by the competing actions of APC/CCdh1 and CenpH. Analogously, prophase I arrest in mouse oocytes is controlled by Emi1-dependent regulation of APC/CCdh1. By contrast, in mouse oocytes, BubR1 sustains Cdh1 levels in prophase I arrest. The physiological regulation of APC/CCdh1 by kinetochore proteins that allows for a timely meiotic resumption is a topic for future investigation. The importance of CenpH in balancing the G2/M transition is shown by the effects of CenpH depletion on the timing of meiotic resumption. APC/CCdh1 is apparently the target of CenpH in mediating meiotic resumption because CenpH depletion leads to a reduction in the APC/CCdh1 substrate cyclin B1 (Fig.\u00a02A). Live cell imaging following injection of exogenous cyclin B1-GFP showed that loss of CenpH causes a 50% decrease in the rate of cyclin B1-GFP accumulation (Fig.\u00a03A,B), indicating that the effects of CenpH depletion are caused by cyclin B1 destabilization rather than any defect in translation. This increase in cyclin B1 instability is likely to explain the much-attenuated increase in MPF activity during the meiotic resumption progression of CenpH-depleted oocytes. Cyclin B1 accumulation in the nucleus is a prerequisite for MPF activation and meiotic resumption. Furthermore, APC/CCdh1 protects the oocyte from precocious GVBD by preventing nuclear accumulation of cyclin B1. In CenpH-depleted oocytes, cyclin B1-GFP failed to accumulate in the nucleus and thus inhibited MPF activity, which explains the severely compromised meiotic resumption, together with an increased level of Cdh1 (Fig.\u00a03C,D). Significantly, impaired GVBD could be restored in CenpH-depleted oocytes by co-expressing exogenous cyclin B1 mRNA (Fig.\u00a02B). A recent observation has shown that APC/CCdh1 is necessary for maintaining cyclin B1 stabilization in mouse oocytes. Our results show that meiotic resumption is critically poised by the competing actions of APC/CCdh1 and CenpH. Thus, CenpH is required to stabilize cyclin B1, which in turn plays an indispensable role in the MPF activation required for meiotic resumption. Our observations might have wider implications for the role of CenpH in mammalian somatic cells. CenpH has been shown to contribute to kinetochore-microtubule attachment and accurate chromosome segregation in the mitotic cell cycle. We found that meiotic resumption is impaired by CenpH antibody injection in GV stage oocytes (Fig.\u00a0S1C), indicating the availability of an antibody that inhibits CenpH protein function. However, in contrast to mitosis, we found that blocking CenpH protein function in GVBD stage oocytes by antibody injection did not influence cell cycle progression (Fig.\u00a0S1D). Interestingly, early-stage spindle assembly and MII spindle morphology were not affected by inhibiting CenpH at GVBD stage (Figs\u00a04 and 5). Similarly, upon MO injection, 37% of CenpH-depleted oocytes underwent GVBD by 3\u2005h following release from IBMX, and these oocytes could still extrude the first polar body (Fig.\u00a0S1A). Yet, it is not clear whether the CenpH level is actually reduced in these GVBD oocytes. Subsequently, CenpH MO was injected into GV stage oocytes followed by 24\u2005h incubation in IBMX to deplete the protein. When the CenpH protein level in control and CenpH MO-injected oocytes (GV or GVBD) was assessed by western blot 2\u2005h following release from IBMX, it was found to be significantly decreased in the GV or GVBD oocytes compared with the control (Fig.\u00a0S1F). This indicates that, unlike mitosis, CenpH is not required for spindle assembly and meiotic cell cycle progression after GVBD. An alternative interpretation of these results is that pre-existing trace amounts of CenpH in GVBD oocytes are sufficient for meiotic spindle assembly and further cell cycle progression. Our data uncover a major feature of CenpH in mouse oocytes that is not shared with mitosis. It is involved in APC/CCdh1-mediated cyclin B1 proteolysis during prophase (Fig.\u00a06). CenpH is necessary for cyclin B1 stabilization, which in turn plays an indispensable role in MPF activation. Moreover, APC/CCdh1 is apparently the target of CenpH in mediating meiotic resumption. Thus, CenpH deficiency could have significant consequences for fertility by increasing the propensity for prophase I-arrested oocytes. Mouse polyclonal anti-CenpH antibody used for western blot and immunofluorescence was purchased from Abcam (ab88593); mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b1-tubulin-FITC antibody and mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b3-tubulin antibody were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (F2168 and T6557); human polyclonal anti-ACA antibody was purchased from Antibodies Incorporated (15-234); mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin B1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (sc-245); rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc2 (Cdk1) p34 (Tyr15) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (sc-12340-R); mouse polyclonal anti-\u03b2-actin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (sc-8432); FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology (ZF-0312 and ZF-0313). Care and handing of 6- to 8-week-old ICR mice was conducted in accordance with the policies of the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Oocytes were cultured in M16 medium (M7292, Sigma) supplemented with 200\u2005\u03bcM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to maintain them at GV stage. After specific treatments, oocytes were washed thoroughly and cultured in M2 medium (M7167, Sigma) to specific stages. Microinjections were performed using a Narishige microinjector and completed within 30\u2005min. For CenpH knockdown in mouse oocytes, CenpH MO (5\u2032-ACGCCACAGAAAATAACCCAGCAGT-3\u2032) (Gene Tools) was diluted with nuclease-free water (Sigma) to obtain a 2\u2005mM stock. The same amount of negative control MO was used for the control. Each oocyte was microinjected with 5-10\u2005pl of MO. After microinjection, GV oocytes were cultured for 24\u2005h in M2 medium supplemented with 200\u2005\u03bcM IBMX for the depletion of CenpH. For cyclin B1-GFP overexpression, 1\u2005\u03bcg/\u03bcl cyclin B1 mRNA solution was injected into the cytoplasm of GV oocytes. For cyclin B1-GFP dynamic analysis, 20\u2005ng/\u03bcl cyclin B1 mRNA solution was injected into the cytoplasm of the GV oocytes. For protein expression, oocytes were arrested at GV stage in M2 medium supplemented with 200\u2005\u03bcM IBMX for 1\u2005h. The same amount of GFP mRNA was injected as control. For blocking of CenpH protein function, GV or GVBD stage oocytes were microinjected with 5-10\u2005pl CenpH antibody (0.5\u2005mg/ml). After antibody microinjection, oocytes were cultured in M2 medium to specific stages. Immunofluorescence was performed as described. For immunofluorescent staining, oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30\u2005min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20\u2005min, they were blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 1\u2005h at room temperature. For staining of CenpH, ACA and \u03b3-tubulin, oocytes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with anti-CenpH (1:100), anti-ACA (1:40) or anti-\u03b3-tubulin (1:200) antibodies. After three washes in washing buffer, oocytes were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:100) or cy5-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:500) or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100) for 2\u2005h at room temperature. For \u03b1-tubulin staining, oocytes were incubated with anti-\u03b1-tubulin-FITC antibodies for 2\u2005h at room temperature, oocytes were then washed three times in wash buffer and co-stained with Hoechst 33342 (10\u2005mg/ml in PBS) for 15\u2005min. These oocytes were mounted on glass slides and examined with an LSM 780 META confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss). Immunoblotting was performed as described. Briefly, a total of 100 mouse oocytes were collected in 7\u2005\u03bcl 2\u00d7SDS buffer and heated for 5\u2005min at 100\u00b0C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes. Following transfer, the membranes were blocked in TBST containing 5% BSA for 2\u2005h at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C with mouse polyclonal anti-CenpH (1:500), mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin B1 (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc2 (Cdk1) p34 (Tyr15) (1:1000) or mouse polyclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (1:1000) antibody. After three washes in TBST for 10\u2005min each, the membranes were incubated with 1:1000 HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG for 1\u2005h at 37\u00b0C. Finally, the membranes were processed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Bio-Rad). The CenpH antibody recognized two bands on the western blot: a 28\u2005kDa band close to the expected molecular weight for CenpH; and a higher molecular weight band that might represent some form of post-translational modification. Cyclin B1-GFP dynamics were filmed on a Perkin-Elmer Ultra VIEW VOX confocal imaging system. A narrow band pass EGFP filter set and a 30% cut neutral density filter from Chroma were used. Exposure time ranged between 300 and 800\u2005ms depending on cyclin B1-GFP fluorescence levels. The acquisition of digital time-lapse images was controlled by IP Lab (Scanalytics) or AQM6 (Andor/Kinetic imaging) software packages. Confocal images of cyclin B1 in live oocytes were acquired with a 10\u00d7 oil objective on a Zeiss spinning disk confocal microscope (Perkin-Elmer). Images were acquired using the LSM 780 META confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a C-Apochromat 40\u00d7 water-immersion objective. Data analysis was performed using ZEN 2012 LSM software (Zeiss) and ImageJ (NIH). Data (mean\u00b1s.e.m.) were generated from replicates that were repeated at least three times per experiment and analyzed by ANOVA using SPSS Statistics (IBM) followed by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant."}, "20046642": {"pmid": "20046642", "pmcid": "PMC2763228", "title": "Metallothionein induction reduces caspase-3 activity and TNF\u03b1 levels with preservation of cognitive function and intact hippocampal neurons in carmustine-treated rats", "abstract": "\nHippocampal integrity is essential for cognitive functions. On the other hand, induction of metallothionein (MT) by ZnSO4 and its role in neuroprotection has been documented. The present study aimed to explore the effect of MT induction on carmustine (BCNU)-induced hippocampal cognitive dysfunction in rats. A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (15/group): The control group injected with single doses of normal saline (i.c.v) followed 24 h later by BCNU solvent (i.v). The second group administered ZnSO4 (0.1 \u00b5mol/10 \u00b5l normal saline, i.c.v, once) then BCNU solvent (i.v) after 24 h. Third group received BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) 24 h after injection with normal saline (i.c.v). Fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO4 (0.1 \u00b5mol/10 \u00b5l normal saline, i.c.v) then BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) after 24 h. The obtained data revealed that BCNU administration resulted in deterioration of learning and short-term memory (STM), as measured by using radial arm water maze, accompanied with decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Also, BCNU administration increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents as well as caspase-3 activity in addition to histological alterations. ZnSO4 pretreatment counteracted BCNU-induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of MDA and TNF\u03b1 as well as the activity of caspase-3. The histological features were improved in hippocampus of rats treated with ZnSO4 + BCNU compared to only BCNU-treated animals. In conclusion, MT induction halts BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity as it prevented GR inhibition and GSH depletion and counteracted the increased levels of TNF\u03b1, MDA and caspase-3 activity with subsequent preservation of cognition.\n", "fulltext": "It is increasingly apparent that neurological disorders including disruption of brain functions associated with the systemic delivery of chemotherapeutic agents used for treatment of central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS tumors.1,2 There is a growing evidence that standard-dose chemotherapy can impact cognitive function.3 Previous studies suggested that 18% of all breast cancer patients receiving standard-dose chemotherapy show cognitive defects on post-treatment evaluation,4 and such problems were reported in more than 30% of patients examined two years after treatment with high-dose chemotherapy.5,6 In addition, Vardy and Tannock7 have reported impaired cognitive functions during treatment of solid brain tumors in animal models and in humans. It has been concluded that administration of methotrexate and 5-FU in combination induced impairments in tests of spatial memory and other cognitive tasks in mice.8 Also, a single dose of cyclophosphamide produced a transient acute memory impairment in mice.9 Moreover, adriamycin has been demonstrated to increase oxidative stress in the brain, which may lead to cell dysfunction or cell death and thus contribute to cognitive dysfunction.10 Furthermore, it has been reported that long-term exposure to 13-cis-retinoic acid, which is often used in chemotherapy regimens, was associated with decreased neurogenesis and cell proliferation in the hippocampus and subventricular zone and impaired spatial learning and memory in young and adult mice.11 Vardy et al.12 reported that the etiology of cognitive impairment after chemotherapy remains unknown although a number of mechanisms have been postulated.13 Candidate mechanisms include: direct neurotoxic effects (e.g., injury to neurons or surrounding cells, altered neurotransmitter levels),14 oxidative stress and DNA damage,15 immune dysregulation and/or release of cytokines13,16 and blood clotting in small CNSvessels.12 Carmustine (BCNU) is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of brain tumors, myeloma, and both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.17 The ability of BCNU to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB) may explain its neurotoxicity.18 Studies on the incidence and the mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction after BCNU administration are rare. Among these studies, Dietrich et al.17 explained that the cognitive dysfunction induced by the three widely used chemotherapy agents (carmustine, cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside) is due to their toxic effects on CNS progenitor cells and non-dividing oligodendrocytes in vitro.19 They also found that these agents caused increased cell death and decreased cell division in the subventricular zone, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the corpus callosum in mice. Metallothioneins (MTs) are a family of low molecular weight cysteine-rich, proteinsthat are associated with transition metal cations including Zn, Cd, Cu and Hg.20 Previous studies have indicated the role of MT in protecting cells, tissues and organisms from environmental toxicant-induced damage.21,22 Three isoforms of metallothioneins (MT-I, MT-II and MT-III) are expressed in the central nervous system.23 Previous studies reported that brain MT-I/II are upregulated by different stressful stimuli including psychogenic stress,24 administration of bacterial endotoxin,25 glutamate analogues,26 metal toxicity27 and stroke/ischemia.28 In particular MT I and II could protect neuroglial cells from oxidative damage.29 The authors conclude that lack of this protection has been found to potentiate excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. A common feature seen in a number of studies is that MT-I, II reduces delayed cerebral damage and cell death, as well as promotes brain repair, angiogenesis and functional recovery.30 Interestingly, MT-I, II were shown to act directly as neurotrophic agents after treatment of neurons with exogenous MT-I, II proteins, which enhance neuronal survival and axonal outgrowth in both cortical, hippocampal and dopaminergic cultures.31,32 Regulation of metallothionein gene expression by zinc has been documented.33 Free zinc induces the accumulation of large amount of zinc-containing metallothioneins.34 A number of studies have suggested that zinc status affects metallothionein concentration and its mRNA synthesis in the various tissues of growing and adult rats and mice.35 It has been reported that metallothionein induced by zinc exhibits protective effects on the cardiac apoptosis of doxorubicin,36 anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity37 and adriamycin-induced myocardial injury.38 Increased MT expression in some tissues after in vivo treatment with DNA alkylating agents has been reported.39 It was found that rat hepatocytes with elevated MT levels are resistant to N-methyl-N'-nitro-nitrosoguanidine cytotoxicity.40 Also, overexpressed human MT-IIA gene protects Chinese hamster ovary cells from killing by alkylating agents.34 Moreover, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with ZnSO4 increased hepatic, renal and tumor MT and protected them from cytotoxic actions of cisplatin.35 However few studies have been carried out to explore the role of MT in neurocognitive functions,41,42 the relationship between MT induction and cognition deficits by chemotherapeutic agents is still not clear. The current study aimed to address the effect and mechanism of centrally-induced MT on the impact of BCNU on learning and memory in rats. Data in Figure 1 explains that injection of ZnSO4 markedly increased hippocampal MT content (53%) when compared to the corresponding control group. Also, administration of BCNU significantly increased MT level in the hippocampus of control rats by an extent of 29% but still at a lower significant level in comparison with ZnSO4-treated group. The group of rats pretreated with ZnSO4 then 24 hours later with BCNU show marked increases in the level of hippocampal MT content up to110%, 36.5% and 61% if compared to the control, ZnSO4-treated or BCNU-treated groups respectively (Fig. 1). Immunohistochemical staining of MT in brain sections by using specific antibodies revealed that the level of brain MT was obviously increased in the tested groups of rats in the order of ZnSO4-pretreated-BCNU-treated (D) >ZnSO4-treated (B) >BCNU-treated (C) >control (A) groups (Fig. 2). Behavioral tests in the present study show that there is direct correlation between the good learning and short-term memory (STM) of rats on one hand and the number of learning trials on the other hand where the number of errors were decreased as the number of trials increased in all tested groups (Fig. 3). BCNU administration deteriorated both learning and memory when compared to the corresponding control groups. However, ZnSO4 administration before BCNU obviously improved both learning and memory (Fig. 3). Statistical analysis of data (Fig. 4) explain that the group of rats injected with BCNU showed a markedly impaired learning behavior by the extents of 32% from the control group and 39% from ZnSO4-treated group. Administration of ZnSO4 before BCNU normalized the decreased learning behavior (Fig. 4). Also, BCNU administration significantly reduced STM in rats to be 31% and 35% of control and ZnSO4-treated rats respectively (Fig. 5). Rats pretreated with ZnSO4 then BCNU showed significant improvement in STM if compared to rats treated with BCNU without ZnSO4 preadministration as it was increased to reach 81% of the control group and 85% of ZnSO4-treated rats (Fig. 5). The present data explain that the activity of GR (Fig. 6) and the level of GSH (Fig. 7) in rat hippocampus was aggressively reduced by administration of BCNU to the extents of 49% and 53% of the control group; and 47% and 51% of ZnSO4-treated rats respectively. Treatment of rats with ZnSO4 before BCNU resulted in marked increases in the activity of GR (to the extents 76% and 72% of the control and ZnSO4-treated groups respectively) and GSH content (to the extents of 73% and 71% of the control and ZnSO4-treated groups respectively). In Figure 8 MDA showed 2.5 fold increase in the hippocampus BCNU-treated animals when compared to either control or ZnSO4-treated groups. In the group of rats preinjected with ZnSO4 then BCNU there was up to 60% reduction in the level of MDA compared to BCNU-treated rats but still at a higher level of significance in comparison with either control or ZnSO4-trated animals. Evaluation of serum TNF\u03b1 revealed that BCNU produced significant increases in the level of TNF\u03b1 up to 44% and 39% when compared with control or ZnSO4-trated animals respectively. On the other hand, this level showed a marked reduction (15%) in ZnSO4-pretrated-BCNU-treated rats in comparison with only BCNU-treated animals although it was still at a significant higher level if compared to control or ZnSO4-trated groups (Fig. 9). Figure 10 explains that the activity of caspase-3 enzyme was markedly increased in the hippocampus of rats treated with BCNU compared to either control (by 31%) or ZnSO4-treated (by 34%) animals. In ZnSO4-pretreated-BCNU-trated rats, the activity of caspase-3 was significantly decreased to the extents of 12% and 15% from of the control and ZnSO4-treated groups respectively. Figure 11 explains that administration of BCNU resulted in massive neuronal damage manifested as an apparent decrease (45%) in the number of normal-appearing neurons in the middle hippocampus CA1 in which most pyramidal cells died (Fig. 11C) compared with either control (Fig. 11A) or ZnSO4-treated animals (Fig. 11B). Animals pretreated with ZnSO4 and 24 hours later with BCNU (Fig. 11D) showed an obvious increase (30%) in the number of intact neurons as compared to BCNU-treated animals. A photomicrograph of rat brain sections stained with Hx & E (X 40) shows CA1 region of the hippocampus from control (A), ZnSO4-treated (B), BCNU-treated rats (C) and ZnSO4-pretreated-BCNU-treated rats (D). Impaired cognitive functions after administration of chemotherapeutic agents have been reported in animal models and in humans.7 The present data revealed that injection of BCNU into rats resulted in impairment of learning and STM. This effect is in consistence with the previous study of Reiriz et al.9 who reported that a single dose of cyclophosphamide produced a transient acute memory impairment in mice. Also, it was found that adriamycin produced cognitive dysfunction in experimental animals.10 In addition, exposure to13-cis-retinoic acid, impaired spatial learning and memory in mice.11 Moreover, the present data are in close agreement with the study of Dietrich et al.17 who reported cognitive dysfunction after administration of carmustine, cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside in mice. The relationship between the integrity of hippocampus and normal learning and memory pattern has been documented.17 The present study showed that BCNU induced oxidative stress in the hippocampus of rats as indicted by aggressive inhibition of GR enzyme activity, reduction of GSH content and increased hippocampal content of MDA in comparison with the control groups. In addition, serum TNF\u03b1 and the activity of caspase-3 showed significant higher hippocampal levels in BCNU-treated animals compared to corresponding control values. Moreover, microscopic examination of hippocampal sections showed deteriorated histological features in rats treated with BCNU if compared to control groups. These data are in harmony with the previous investigations that reported BCNU as a potent GR inhibitor and GSH depletor in several tissues.43,44 It has been explained that depletion of GSH, as a consequence of GR inhibition will increase cellular oxidative damage.45 The increased extent of lipid peroxidation and apoptosis (as indicated by increased caspase-3 activity) in the hippocampus as well as the level of serum TNF\u03b1 after BCNU administration in the present study is supported by previous studies on various tissues. In this respect, it was found that incubation of BCNU with rat brain slices for two hours produced marked depletion of GSH (up to 70%) accompanied with increased extent of lipid peroxides.46 Also, BCNU was found to inhibit the activity of GR and promoted the oxidative damage in the nigrostriatal system.47 In addition, BCNU could inhibit GR, depleted GSH and induced apoptosis in PC12 cells.48 It has been reported that BCNU administration, as one of common breast cancer regimen, resulted in apparent inhibition of lung GR activity and GSH content with increased levels of TNF\u03b1 and lipid peroxidation with marked histological alterations.49 Moreover, the interrelation between oxidative stress and release of inflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1 and subsequent tissue damage has been proved.50 GSH depletion was reported to be associated with augmentation of an oxidative stress-mediated proinflammatory state in alveolar epithelial cells by an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism.51 Recently, it has been concluded that BCNU induced lung fibrosis in rats, an effect mediated by increased oxidative stress and induction of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1.52 On the other hand, Ali-Osman et al.53 explained that, BCNU metabolites are very reactive electrophiles capable of depleting GSH and inducing apoptosis. It was also stated that the cognitive dysfunction induced by the three widely used chemotherapy agents (carmustine, cisplatin and cytosine arabinoside) is due to their toxic effects on CNS progenitor cells and nondividing oligodendrocytes of in vitro.19 In addition, BCNU was found to increased cell death and decreased cell division in the hippocampus of mice.17 Since neurotoxicity, DNA damage, Oxidative stress and release of cytokines were reported as mechanisms of impairment of cognitive functions after chemotherapy,12 it could be suggested that BCNU administration resulted in hippocampal toxicity in the form of apoptosis, increased level of lipid peroxidation and histological alterations with subsequent impairment of learning and memory. The involvement of MT in protection against various stress insults has been reported.33,39,54 Imuunohistochemical and biochemical techniques in the present study showed that BCNU administration markedly increased the level of MT in the hippocampus of rats. Also, i.c.v injection of ZnSO4 into either control animals or 24 hours before administration of BCNU resulted in significant increase in the level of MT in the hippocampus of both groups in the order of BCNU-ZnSO4-pretreated >control. It is generally accepted that the expression of MT-I/II proteins is highly inducible in response to a range of stimuli, including metals, hormones, cytokines, oxidative agents, inflammation and stress.22 The induced MT in response to BCNU administration is in harmony with the reported role of MT in resistance to alkylating agents during treatment of cancers such as bladder cancer55 and esophageal cancer.56 Also, recent studies strongly suggested a significant role of MT during neurodegenerative diseases and in response to brain injury.57 In addition, Schroder et al.39 have considered that tissue induction of MT as a mechanism of resistance to oxidative stress produced by alkylating agents. Therefore, the increased level of MT in BCNU-treated animals may represents an acute phase response to act against increased oxidative stress produced by BCNU. It has been stated that, metal-induced synthesis of MT is mediated by activation of metal response element-binding transcription factor (MTF-1), a zinc-sensitive trans-acting factor.57,58 The increased level of MT after ZnSO4 injection in the present work is in close agreement with the early study of Ebadi and Swanson59 who found that i.c.v injection of zinc induced brain MT. In addition, several studies have suggested that zinc status affects metallothionein concentration and its mRNA synthesis in the various tissues of growing and adult rats and mice.60 Recently, it has concluded that administration of Zn2+ (i.v) during reperfusion phase of cerebral ischemia could pass BBB and induced hippocampal MT.28 Although MT has been documented to protect against neuronal injury,61 its role in neurobehavioral function have not been well characterized.57 Behavioral tests in the present study showed marked potentiation of learning and memory in rats pretreated with ZnSO4 (i.c.v), 24 hours before BCNU, compared to those without ZnSO4 preadministration. These data may explain the decisive role of MT induction in the improvement of cognition during BCNU administration. In this respect, West et al.57 believed that alterations in MT function could alter neural function in ways that would impair behavioral function. The authors explained that MTs play a significant role in zinc homeostasis in the hippocampus which is essential in maintenance of normal cognitive functions. Also, it was concluded that the hippocampus, which plays a central role in cognitive functions such as memory depends on correct physiological actions of zinc, which is heavily concentrated in the hippocampal mossy fiber system.41 In addition, MT-I/II were found to protect against the adverse effects of both zinc under and overload.62 Moreover, metallothionein-null mice showed learning deficits in passive avoidance and water maze escape learning.63 The obtained data revealed that pretreatment of rats with ZnSO4 (i.c.v) before BCNU conferred protection of the hippocampus against BCNU-induced damage as the levels of caspase-3 and MDA were markedly reduced but the contents of MT and GSH as well as the activity of GR in the hippocampus were significantly higher if compared to only BCNU-treated rats. Also, serum TNF\u03b1 showed apparent reduction in rats preinjected with ZnSO4. This protection was further confirmed by histological examination. These data are in line with the previous studies in which neuronal injury was reported to be implicated in cognitive dysfunction.17 On the other hand, MT-I, II were shown to enhance neuronal survival and axonal outgrowth in both cortical, hippocampal and dopaminergic cultures.30,32 In addition, MT was found to protect against neuronal damage via its powerful antioxidant and antiapoptic properties.9,64 Moreover, MT counteracted oxidative stress and apoptosis in animals treated with DNA alkylating agents.39 Furthermore, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with ZnSO4 increased hepatic, renal and tumor MT and protected them from cytotoxic actions of cisplatin.35 It is important to note that MT-I, II are powerful scavengers of free radicals, likely as a function of their cysteine residues.30 In addition, it was concluded that MT induction creates a new pool of thiol groups in the cell cytosol that can attenuate damaging effects of GSH depletors in rat hepatocytes.65 Further studies indicated that the released Zn+2 from MT might suppress free radical-mediated damage by its ability to induce the metalloenzyme superoxide dismutase or to stabilize the cell membrane function.66 In addition, it has been shown MT induced by zinc exhibited protective effects from doxorubicin-induced myocardial apoptosis36 and adriamycin-induced myocardial injury by inhibition of oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3.38 On the other hand, the oxidative stress-dependent pathway for increased levels of TNF\u03b1 and other cytokines and their implication in neuronal injury has been reported.30,51 MT-I, II were reported to inhibit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF\u03b1 with subsequent suppression of the inflammatory responses of leukocytes.30 It was found that exogenous administration of metallothionein reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 and apoptotic cell death during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.67 Herein, it could be proposed that among the key mechanisms for improvement of BCNU-induced learning and memory deficits after induction of brain MT by administration of ZnSO4 is the buffering effect of MT against BCNU-induced hippocampal damage through rebalancing of oxidant/antioxidant equilibrium (as the levels of GR activity and GSH content were preserved), anti-inflammatory effect (as the level of TNF\u03b1 was markedly reduced) and antiapoptotic effect (as it produced marked reduction in caspase-3 activity). In conclusion, the obtained data may suggest that MT induction can act against BCNU-induced hippocampal cognitive deficits. This effect is mediated at least in part by antioxidant, antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms as well as maintenance of zinc homeostasis. This may help to understand the role of metallothionein in chemotherapy-induced neurocognitive dysfunction which may be considered for the improvement of behavioral pattern during administration of anticancer agents. Adult male Wistar albino rats weighing 150\u2013180 g were obtained from the Animal Care Center, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The animals were housed in metabolic cages under standard laboratory conditions (12 h light/dark cycle at 25 \u00b1 2\u00b0C) with free access to pulverized standard rat pellet food and tap water. A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (15/group): The first group served as a control group in which the animals received a single intracerbrovenricular (i.c.v) dose of normal saline (10 \u00b5l) followed 24 h later with an i.v injection of BCNU solvent (normal saline containing 10% ethanol). The second group administered a single dose of ZnSO4 (0.1 \u00b5mol/10 \u00b5l normal saline, i.c.v) followed 24 h later with an injection of BCNU solvent (i.v). Rats in the third group received a single dose of BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v) 24 h after an injection (i.c.v) of normal saline (10 \u00b5l). Fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO4 (0.1 \u00b5mol/ 10 \u00b5l normal saline, i.c.v) followed 24 h later with an injection of BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v). After three weeks, animals in all groups were subjected to behavioral tests for learning and short-term (STM) memory using radial arm water maze then anaesthetized with ether and sacrificed where five rats from each group were used for histological analysis. The remaining ten rats were used for biochemical analysis where BCNU toxicity was evaluated by measuring MDA (as a marker for lipid peroxidation), caspase-3 activity (as a marker for apoptosis) as well as the possible mechanisms for this toxicity by measuring GR activity and GSH content in the hippocampus as well as serum TNF\u03b1 level. The ability of MT to counteract BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity was evaluated by measuring the previous parameters after MT induction by ZnSO4. In each group, blood samples from each animal were collected separately, centrifuged and used for determination of TNF\u03b1. The two lobes of hippocampus in each animal were rapidly dissected out on ice, washed with saline and cut into small pieces and used for biochemical analysis. Hippocampal pieces from each animal in each group were homogenized and used for determination of the activity of hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) and the contents of MT, reduced glutathione (GSH), malodialdehyde (MDA) as well as total protein. Another portion of pieced was dissociated into free cells by trypsinization where the activity of caspase-3 was assessed in the cell lysate. Rats were anaesthetized by administration of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p) then placed gently in a stereotaxic apparatus68 with the tooth bar 5 mm above the ear bar. Sagittal incision was made and the scalp was exposed. By using brain map and stereotaxic coordinates, the bony calcaneum was penetrated with dental drill to allow access into the brain. ZnSO4 solution was slowly infused using Hamilton microsyringe where the syrnge was left in place for 5 min. After removal of the syringe, the wounds were sutured. The radial arm water maze consisted of a black circular water tub with six V-shaped stainless steel structures arranged to form a swimming field of an open central area and six arms.69 The water temperatures was maintained at 25\u00b0C. A goal arm is one that has a black platform submerged 1cm below the water level. Starting from a start arm (any arm other than the goal arm), the rat must find the submerged platform by swimming to the end of the goal arm. Each rat was allowed 12 consecutive training trials (learning phase) followed by a short-term memory (STM) test trial (30 min delay periods). Rats were allowed to take rest for 5 min to avoid exhaustion at the end of the 6th trial. Rats were allowed 1 min per trial to find the submerged platform. A trial ended when the rat located the submerged platform, where it was allowed to stay trial 15 sec on the platform before removal to begin the next trial in a different start arm. If the rat did not find the submerged platform in the goal arm after one min, it was guided the goal arm and allowed to stay on the platform for 15 sec before removal to begin the next trial. A correct selection occurred when the rat swam directly to the goal arm, while error was registered when the rat entered into an arm other than the goal arm. All experiments were done in dimly lit room and the rat had to use cues in the room to spatially memorize the location of the platform. After the last trial the mean umber of errors was calculated for each group to indicate the learning behavior. Rats were anaesthetized with ether and brains were dissected out on ice and fixed in 10% formalin saline solution then embedded in paraffin. The 5 \u00b5m sections were stained on glass slides by Hx & E and examined under light microscope for histological alterations in the hippocampus. The mean number of 10 microscopic fields of normally-appeared hippocampal neurons was calculated. Expression of brain MT was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of brain tissues using monoclonal mouse anti-MT antibody (Dako, Carpentaria, CA, USA) and vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). After deparaffinization, brain sections on glass slides were subjected to quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity using 3% H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature. Non-specific binding sites were blocked by 5% normal rabbit serum for 1 h, then washed with PBS buffer for 10 min. Sections were incubated with primary MT antibodies (diluted 1:500 in 10 mmol/L PBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C and then washed with PBS buffer for 10 min. Sections were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse Ig G (secondary antibodies) for 1 h and then washed with PBS buffer for 10 min, followed by the addition of vectastain ABC reagent and incubation for 1 h, with a final wash using PBS buffer. The substrate solution in the kit, diaminobenzedine (DAB), was added and the color was produced within 2\u20137 min. Stained sections were washed under tap water, air dried and photographed under a light microscope. Hippocampal content of MT was measured by ELISA.23 Briefly, in a microtiter plate, 150 \u00b5l of 10% tissue homogenate from each sample in coating buffer (0.015 M Na2CO3, 0.023 M NaHCO3, 0.02% Na azide in 80 ml H2O, pH 9.8) added to the wells and left at 4\u00b0C overnight. The wells were then washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 1% Tween (pH, 7.4). To each well 150 \u00b5l of MT primary antibodies (diluted 1:500 in PBS-Tween solution) and incubated on a shaker for 2 h. Anti-mouse Ig G secondary antibodies diluted in PBS-Tween were added (150 \u00b5l/well) and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 h followed by washing of the wells with PBS-Tween three times. The substrate solution (p-nitrophenol) was added (150 \u00b5l/well) and incubated in dark at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 \u00b5l 3N NaOH solution to each well. The absorbance of produced color was read at 405 nm in ELISA reader where MT concentration (\u00b5g/g protein) was calculated from a standard calibration curve of MT protein. GR activity was measured by the method of Carlberg and Mannervick.70 Briefly, 100 \u00b5l of 0.2 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.6 (containing 1 mM EDTA), 25 \u00b5l 20 mM GSSG and 25 \u00b5l 2 mM NADPH were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 10 min. 50 \u00b5l of 5% hippocampus homogenate sample (in 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 containing 0.1 mmol/L EDTA) were added into a reaction cuvette, and the rate of change of absorbance at 340 nm was measured for 3 min. The activity of GR was expressed as mU/mg protein. Tissue levels of acid soluble thiols, mainly reduced glutathione (GSH), were determined calorimetrically at 412 nm according to Ellman.7 In briefl, 0.5 ml of previously prepared homogenate was added to 0.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged at 1,000 xg for 5 min. The supernatant (200 \u00b5l) was added to a tube contains 1,750 \u00b5l of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8) and 50 \u00b5l of 5,5 dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) reagent. The tubes were mixed and the developed yellow color was measured against standard curve of reduced glutathione. Protein thiols (protein-SH) were expressed as \u00b5mol/g tissue. Serum TNF\u03b1, was assayed by using ELISA kit purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, in a microplate, 50 \u00b5l of the assay diluent added to each well. Then 50 \u00b5l of the diluted serum sample (2-fold dilution in the calibrator diluent) were added to each well and mixed gently by tapping the plate frame for 1 min then the plate was covered and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, each well in the plate was then aspirated and washed five times with the kit washing buffer followed by addition of 100 \u00b5l substrate solution and incubated in dark for 30 min at room temperature. The optical density was then read at 450 nm using a 96-well plate spectrometer (Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). TNF\u03b1 level (pg/ml) was calculated from a standard curve and multiplied by the dilution factor. Hippocampal cell suspension was prepared from hippocampal tissue following the method described by Sameto.72 Briefly, hippocampi from each animal were dissected out, cut into small pieces and suspended in 10 mL sterile saline solution (12.38 mmol/L NaCl, 5.4 mmol/L KCl, 1.1 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 1.1 mmol/L KH2PO4, 22 mmol/L glucose and 0.9 CaCl2), containing 0.25% v/v trypsin, in a Petri dish. The suspension was then aspirated two to three times using glass pipette and transferred to a screw-capped Erlenmeyer flask and shaken on a rotary shaker (80 r.p.m. for 15 min at 37\u00b0C). Trypsinization was then halted by the addition of 10 mL serum supplemental medium (SSM) containing 10% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the disrupted tissue was then gently aspirated three times using a 10 ml glass pipette. The aspirated suspension was carefully filtered through Nitex 210 then Nitex 130 filters (TetKo, Elmeford, NY, USA) by gravity. The entire filtrate was then centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min at room temperature and the pellet was resuspended in fresh SSM. Viable cells were counted using a haemocytometer and trypan blue 0.4% diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mmol/L EDTA (1:16). Hippocampal caspase-3 activity was measured by using Caspase-3/CPP32 activity Colorimetric Assay Kit (Biovision Incorporate, USA) according the procedure supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, the prepared cell suspension was centrifuged. Then cells were resuspended in chilled cell lysis buffer (1\u20135 \u00d7 106 cells/50 \u00b5l) and incubated on ice for 10 min, centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge (10,000 xg). To each sample pellet, 50 \u00b5l cell lysis buffer was added followed by addition of 50 \u00b5l of 2X reaction buffer (containing 10 mM DTT). 5 \u00b5l of the 4 mM DEVD-pNA substrate (200 \u00b5M final conc.) was added and to each sample and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Samples were read at 405-nm in a microtiter plate ELISA reader. The absorbance of the produced color (pNA) from treated animals was compared with control animals to determinate the percentage of caspase-3 activity changes. Hippocampal lipid peroxides were determined colorimetrically using thiobarbituric acid (TBA), as described by Uchiyama and Mihara,73 where lipid peroxides expressed in terms of MDA concentration (nmol/mg protein). In brief, hippocampus lobes were homogenized separately in 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mmol/L EDTA to obtain a 5% homogenate. In a Teflon-stoppered test tube, 2.5 ml of 20% acetic acid and 1 ml TBA solution were added to the tissue homogenate and allowed to boil at 100\u00b0C for 30 min in a water bath. After cooling to room temperature under tap water, 4 ml n-butanol was added and samples were shaken vigorously and centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min. The absorbance of the upper colored layer was measured at 532 nm and the concentration of MDA was calculated from a standard calibration curve and expressed as nmol/g protein. Total protein was determined according to the method of Lowery et al.74 In brief, 1.0 ml of alkaline copper solution (prepared by mixing 50 ml of 2% Na2CO3 in 0.10 N NaOH with 1.0 ml of 0.50% CuSO4. 5 H2O in 1% sodium tartrate) was added to a test tube containing 0.20 ml of 10% hippocampus homogenate (w/v), mixed well and allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature. Then, 0.10 ml of Folin's reagent (phospho-molybdic-phosphotungstic reagent diluted 1:1 in H2O before use) was added and thoroughly mixed. After 30 min the optical density was measured against blank at 500 nm. Protein concentration was calculated from a standard calibration curve in which bovine albumin was used in different concentrations. Data were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and analyzed using Graph Pad Instat software by one way ANOVA followed by Tukey Kramer post-test at p < 0.05."}, "28650467": {"pmid": "28650467", "pmcid": "PMC5658664", "title": "Genome-wide loss-of-function genetic screening identifies opioid receptor \u03bc1 as a key regulator of L-asparaginase resistance in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "abstract": "\nL-asparaginase is a critical chemotherapeutic agent for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It hydrolyzes plasma asparagine into aspartate and NH3, causing asparagine deficit and inhibition of protein synthesis and eventually, leukemic cell death. However, patient relapse often occurs due to development of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which ALL cells acquire resistance to L-asparaginase is unknown. Therefore, we sought to identify genes that are involved in L-asparaginase resistance in primary leukemic cells. By unbiased genome-wide RNAi screening, we found that among 10 resistant ALL clones, six hits were for opioid receptor mu 1 (oprm1), two hits were for carbonic anhydrase 1 (ca1) and another two hits were for ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (ube2c). We also found that OPRM1 is expressed in all leukemic cells tested. Specific knockdown of OPRM1 confers L-asparaginase resistance, validating our genome-wide retroviral shRNA library screening data. Methadone, an agonist of OPRM1, enhances the sensitivity of parental leukemic cells, but not OPRM1-depleted cells, to L-asparaginase treatment, indicating that OPRM1 is required for the synergistic action of L-asparaginase and methadone, and that OPRM1 loss promotes leukemic cell survival likely through downregulation of the OPRM1-mediated apoptotic pathway. Consistent with this premise, patient leukemic cells with relatively high levels of OPRM1 are more sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment compared to OPRM1-depleted leukemic cells, further indicating that OPRM1 loss has a crucial role in L-asparaginase resistance in leukemic patients. Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time, a novel OPRM1-mediated mechanism for L-asparaginase resistance in ALL, and identifies OPRM1 as a functional biomarker for defining high-risk subpopulations and for the detection of evolving resistant clones. Oprm1 may also be utilized for effective treatment of L-asparaginase-resistant ALL.\n", "fulltext": "The 2013 SEER Stat Fact Sheets from the National Cancer Institute1 indicate that there were ~78\u2009000 people with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the United States alone, roughly 66% of those affected are youths, making ALL the most widespread pediatric cancer. L-asparaginase is one of the central components of current combination chemotherapy against ALL. Normally, L-asparagine is synthesized from L-aspartic acid and NH3 by L-asparagine synthetase whose level is critically downregulated in leukemic cells.2, 3 Thus, leukemic cells heavily depend on the availability of plasma asparagine for their protein synthesis and survival. L-asparaginase in the ALL treatment regimen depletes plasma asparagine by hydrolyzing the latter into aspartic acid and NH3, thereby causing cellular asparagine deficit, inhibition of protein synthesis and eventually, leukemic cell death. Although the outcome in childhood leukemia has improved significantly in the recent past, challenges arise as ALL patients treated with L-asparaginase relapse due to development of resistance, resulting in refractory disease. It would stand to reason that L-asparaginase-resistant cells have generated a mechanism that provides access to asparagine. One proposed mechanism involves the upregulation of L-asparagine synthetase activity, as elevated L-asparagine synthetase level was detected in resistant primary samples and cell lines.4 Indeed, cellular L-asparagine synthetase level correlates with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) obtained following asparaginase treatment.5 However, there have also been reports where no correlation between L-asparagine synthetase level and L-asparaginase resistance was observed,6, 7 suggesting that other unknown factors may contribute to L-asparaginase resistance. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ALL cells acquire resistance to L-asparaginase, we sought to identify genes that are involved in L-asparaginase resistance. In this study, we employed an unbiased genome-wide loss-of-function screening against L-asparaginase-sensitive pediatric ALL cells. We found that among randomly selected resistant clones, a significant majority has shown loss of the opioid receptor mu 1 (OPRM1). We present further analyses of this finding and demonstrate that, indeed, L-asparaginase refractory ALL coincides with downregulation of OPRM1. To identify genes that are involved in L-asparaginase resistance, we utilized an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screening8 that targets 24\u2009000 unique shRNAs covering 8\u2009000 vital genes in continuously growing leukemia cells (POETIC2) established from a pediatric leukemia patient. These cells were prepared by high-density culture of blast cells of a 14-year-old patient diagnosed with pre-B ALL with p16 deletion that maintained growth and survival in vitro. Initially, cells were infected with retrovirus carrying pRS-shRNA library and infected cells were selected by treatment with puromycin (2\u2009\u03bcg/ml) for 3 weeks. Cells infected with pRS-shRNA were then cultured in the presence of L-asparaginase (10\u2009mIU/ml) for an additional 2 weeks. To isolate individual resistant colonies in soft agar, an additional 1-week culture in the presence of puromycin and L-asparaginase was performed and a total of 10 single colonies were formed and isolated. Isolated clones were amplified individually and as a pool of the 10 clones. Cell were fed with fresh media containing L-asparaginase (10\u2009mIU/ml) every 3 days. As shown in Figure 1a, parental (designated as *) and control retroviral vector-infected cells are sensitive (IC50=50.7\u2009mIU/ml) to L-asparaginase treatment. In contrast, the pooled shRNA library-infected cells are resistant to L-asparaginase treatment. To test whether cell survival after puromycin and L-asparaginase treatments is due to infection of retrovirus carrying shRNAs, genomic DNA isolated from the pooled resistant cells was isolated and used to perform PCR using primers that flank the shRNA inserts. The presence of the 642\u2009bp PCR product after the first (puromycin) and the second (L-asparaginase) screening of pRS-shRNA library-infected cells indicate that these cells, indeed, harbor the retroviral shRNA insert (Figure 1b). Sequencing of bar codes for each individual clone was then performed to identify the target genes that account for L-asparaginase resistance. Our data show that among the 10 resistant clones, six hits were for opioid receptor mu 1 gene (oprm1) and two hits each for carbonic anhydrase 1 (ca1)9 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (ube2c)10 genes (Figure 1c). Next, we tested whether OPRM1 is expressed in our model cell system and other leukemic cells. As shown in Figure 2, OPRM1 is expressed in our model cell system (*) and all four other leukemic cells tested. To validate our data from the genome-wide retroviral shRNA library screening, we infected the leukemic cells with retrovirus carrying shOPRM1 and tested whether specific knockdown of OPRM1 confers L-asparaginase resistance. Indeed, shOPRM1-infected cells that show reduced levels of OPRM1 mRNA (Figure 3a, left panels) and protein (Figure 3a, right panels) are resistant to L-asparaginase treatment (Figure 3b). Interestingly, a previous study11 showed that stimulation of the opioid receptor leads to activation of inhibitory Gi-proteins which block adenylyl cyclase activity, which in turn, reduces cellular cAMP level and subsequently induces apoptosis by caspase activation in leukemic cells. A separate study12 also showed that activation of opioid receptor reduces cAMP level and increases sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to doxorubicin. Together, these findings suggest that leukemic cells utilize the OPRM1-cAMP-caspase pathway to acquire L-asparaginase resistance. Since methadone, an \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist, was found to sensitize leukemic cells to doxorubicin treatment,13 and the OPRM1-cAMP-caspase pathway may be utilized by leukemic cells for both methadone sensitization and L-asparaginase resistance, we investigated L-asparaginase sensitivity in both parental and OPRM1-depleted cells with and without methadone treatment. If the OPRM1-cAMP-caspase pathway is utilized by leukemic cells for both methadone sensitization and L-asparaginase resistance, parental cells will show synergistic sensitivity when the cells are treated with L-asparaginase+methadone compared to cells treated with L-asparaginase or methadone alone. However, leukemic cells resistant to L-asparaginase due to OPRM1 loss will be insensitive to L-asparaginase+methadone treatment. As shown in Figure 4a, methadone enhances the sensitivity of parental cells, but not OPRM1-depleted cells, to L-asparaginase treatment, indicating that OPRM1 is required for the synergistic action of L-asparaginase and methadone. Our findings also suggest that depletion of OPRM1 promotes leukemic cell survival through downregulation of the OPRM1-mediated apoptotic pathway. Thus, our data demonstrate that the OPRM1-mediated pathway may have a critical role in L-asparaginase sensitivity and development of resistance. Consistent with this finding, all leukemic cells with relatively high level of OPRM1 are significantly (P<0.05) sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment compared to our model leukemic cells depleted of OPRM1 (Figure 4b). To investigate the clinical relevance of our findings, a panel of additional leukemic cells isolated from ALL patients were assessed to determine whether reduced level of OPRM1 is linked to L-asparaginase resistance. To do so, primary leukemic cells from five ALL patients were analyzed for OPRM1 levels and L-asparaginase sensitivity. As shown in Figure 4c, leukemic cells with higher levels of OPRM1 are more sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment compared to those with lower levels of OPRM1. This finding further demonstrates the link between loss of OPRM1 and the development of L-asparaginase resistance. In accord with our observations, further examination of the data at the cBioportal for Cancer Genomics,14 that offers large-scale cancer genomics data set analysis, revealed the connection of oprm1 deletions and mutations to hematopoietic and other cancers. OPRM1 is deleted in 10% of adenoid cystic carcinoma and 6.3% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. OPRM1 is mutated in 15% of desmoplastic melanoma, 2.1% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1.7% of adenoid cystic carcinoma and 0.6% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time a novel molecular apparatus for L-asparaginase resistance in ALL, and identifies OPRM1 as a functional biomarker for defining high-risk subpopulations and for the detection of evolving resistant clones. Absence of sufficient data sets in publicly available databases (for example, cBioportal and Oncomine) prevented us from further acquiring a significant relationship between OPRM1 and ALL. Nonetheless, we propose that oprm1 can be targeted for effective treatment of L-asparaginase-resistant ALL. Characterization of L-asparaginase resistance due to loss of carbonic anhydrase 1 or ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C in ALL is underway."}, "26102294": {"pmid": "26102294", "pmcid": "PMC4825594", "title": "Role of stress-activated OCT4A in the cell fate decisions of embryonal carcinoma cells treated with etoposide ", "abstract": "\nTumor cellular senescence induced by genotoxic treatments has recently been found to be paradoxically linked to the induction of \u201cstemness.\u201d This observation is critical as it directly impinges upon the response of tumors to current chemo-radio-therapy treatment regimens. Previously, we showed that following etoposide (ETO) treatment embryonal carcinoma PA-1 cells undergo a p53-dependent upregulation of OCT4A and p21Cip1 (governing self-renewal and regulating cell cycle inhibition and senescence, respectively). Here we report further detail on the relationship between these and other critical cell-fate regulators. PA-1 cells treated with ETO display highly heterogeneous increases in OCT4A and p21Cip1 indicative of dis-adaptation catastrophe. Silencing OCT4A suppresses p21Cip1, changes cell cycle regulation and subsequently suppresses terminal senescence; p21Cip1-silencing did not affect OCT4A expression or cellular phenotype. SOX2 and NANOG expression did not change following ETO treatment suggesting a dissociation of OCT4A from its pluripotency function. Instead, ETO-induced OCT4A was concomitant with activation of AMPK, a key component of metabolic stress and autophagy regulation. p16ink4a, the inducer of terminal senescence, underwent autophagic sequestration in the cytoplasm of ETO-treated cells, allowing alternative cell fates. Accordingly, failure of autophagy was accompanied by an accumulation of p16ink4a, nuclear disintegration, and loss of cell recovery. Together, these findings imply that OCT4A induction following DNA damage in PA-1 cells, performs a cell stress, rather than self-renewal, function by moderating the expression of p21Cip1, which alongside AMPK helps to then regulate autophagy. Moreover, this data indicates that exhaustion of autophagy, through persistent DNA damage, is the cause of terminal cellular senescence.\n", "fulltext": "The relationship between cancer cells, normal stem cells, and cancer stem cells represents a question of substantial current interest.1 It has been proposed that transcription networks that confer stem cell properties such as self-renewal, plasticity, or an increased resistance to genotoxic stimuli in normal stem cells may perform a similar function in cancer cells.2 This hypothesis is supported by the growing clinical evidence that expression of key embryonal stem cell (ESC) transcription factors POU1F5 (OCT4A), NANOG and SOX2, are associated with poorer prognosis through tumor resistance, recurrence and progression in a wide variety of cancers.3-9 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated by several groups that ESC transcription factors can be upregulated in response to DNA damage where they likely play a role in regulating survival.10-12 Conversely, accelerated cellular senescence is a phenomenon that has also been shown to be induced by genotoxic treatments of cancer cells.13 Cellular senescence has traditionally been considered a terminal cell fate.13,14 However, more recently it has been shown to be reversible at early stages, at least in tumor cells.15-18 Furthermore, a direct link between senescence and \u201cstemness,\u201d essential cytological characteristics of a stem cell that distinguishes it from ordinary somatic cells, emerged in experiments where pluripotency is induced in normal cells.19,20 The molecular regulators of these processes in normal embryonal development, such as p21Cip1, are slowly becoming discerned.21 One intriguing observation is that embryonal cellular senescence is associated with upregulation of the same pathways which govern the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).22 This, apparently paradoxical, link between opposites in cell fate provides a challenge for scientific reasoning. We have previously observed in IMR90 fibroblasts that a pre-senescent phenotype is associated with the appearance of self-renewal and senescence markers coupled to DNA damage.23 We also demonstrated co-incident p53-dependent upregulation of 2 opposing cell fate regulators, p21Cip1 and OCT4A in embryonal carcinoma PA-1 cells treated with Etoposide (ETO).24 We hypothesized that this bi-potential state favors DNA damage repair (DDR) while preventing full commitment to either senescence or self-renewal. In this system, p53 silencing promoted terminal senescence and premature mitosis. Together these data support the presence of a pre-senescent cell state which can arise in response to both senescence and stemness programmes being coactivated in response to genotoxic damage. In the present study, we asked how key regulators of stemness (OCT4A, SOX2 and NANOG) and senescence (p16inka4a) behave in individual PA-1 cells during the response of ETO-induced DNA damage. Using siRNA silencing approaches we addressed the effect of OCT4A and p21Cip1 expression on each other and subsequent cell fates, determining the role of autophagy and how OCT4A activation impacts on the energy and genomic stress sensor and master metabolic regulator and activator of autophagy AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Following ETO treatment many PA-1 cells undergo gradual cell apoptosis and anoikis, while the remainder arrest in G2M and upregulate p53 and p21Cip.24 G2M arrest and nuclear swelling were evident on day 3 after ETO treatment, with restoration of normal cell cycle and nuclear size 4\u00a0d later (Fig.\u00a01A and B). Concurrent nuclear area assessments and DNA content measurements demonstrate that the nuclei of ETO treated cells increased in size irrespective of the stage of the cell cycle, but was most evident in G2M and polyploid cells (Fig.\u00a01C and D). Increased nuclear area and DNA content were also accompanied by an increase in cellular granularity, as determined by an increase in side scatter detected by flow cytometry analysis (Fig.\u00a01E), and autophagy (see below). The majority of cells displayed flattened morphology (Fig.\u00a01F), but only a proportion displayed p16Ink4a nuclear positivity (Fig.\u00a01\u00a0G, H). Furthermore, p16Ink4a expression was largely confined to the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a01\u00a0G). All of these features are indicative of senescence. We previously showed that the senescence marker p21Cip1 and the stemness marker OCT4A simultaneously increase and co-exist in the same cells following ETO treatment.24 After confirming the pre-senescent phenotype of these cells, we next wished to explore how these critical factors for cell fate were dynamically regulated, integrated and diversified. As judged by flow cytometry \u02dc60% of the cells become positive for both markers at the peak of the response (day 5), thereafter the expression of both markers and the proportion of double positive cells gradually decreases (Fig.\u00a02A) as clonogenic, mitotic division ensues. To exclude the possible impact of the senescence-associated cytoplasmic and nuclear area changes on the flow cytometry measurements, semi-automatic image cytometry was undertaken, measuring the expression of both factors in the cell nucleus (apoptotic cells possessing very high p21Cip1 positivity lacking OCT4A were deliberately excluded from this analysis as distorting stoichiometry of measurements). Both the expression and variation of expression of OCT4A and p21Cip1 increased on day 3 after ETO treatment; and increased further on day 5 (Fig2B and C, Fig.\u00a0S1) and a high number of double-positive cells confirmed (Fig.\u00a02B). In its function as a master regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal, OCT4A cooperates with SOX2 and NANOG whose expression are therefore required for maintaining the embryonic stem cell phenotype.25 We thus explored the expression of these transcription factors in the DNA damage response of PA-1 cells. Immunoblotting confirmed that p53 increased in response to ETO from day 1, resulting in the induction of p21Cip1, which reached its maximum on day 5 (Fig\u00a03A). As documented previously, OCT4A expression was present in control cells and increased following ETO treatment, coincident with p53 upregulation.24 Weak expression of SOX2 was found in untreated cells but did not alter following ETO-treatment (Fig.\u00a03A); a result confirmed by image cytometry measurements in individual cells (Fig3B, Fig.\u00a0S1). NANOG was not detected in PA-1 cells by immunoblotting (Fig\u00a03A) although rare NANOG positive cells (less than 5%) were found in control and ETO-treated samples by 3 different antibodies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). Intriguingly, SOX2 failed to show unambiguous antagonism with p21Cip1, which has previously been reported as directly inhibiting SOX2 in neurodifferentiation.26 Furthermore, SOX2 expression did not show significant correlation with its self-renewal partner OCT4A (data not shown). Together, these data suggest a dissociation of OCT4A from its self-renewal capacity when it is induced by p53 (in the presence of p21Cip1) in response to DNA damage. Given its potential lack of self-renewal capacity, we next investigated the role of OCT4A in PA-1 cells following ETO treatment using siRNA. Prior to this analysis, we first established which OCT4 isoforms were expressed in PA-1 cells. Using a panel of specific mAb, immunoblotting revealed that OCT4B was undetectable in these cells both before and after ETO treatment (Fig.\u00a0S2), consistent with published previously RT-PCR data.24 Having established that OCT4B was not expressed in PA-1 cells, siRNA silencing was used to assess the role of OCT4A in their response to ETO treatment. Efficient (80\u201395%) knock-down of OCT4A was confirmed with 3 different siRNA, in addition to a 3 siRNA pool (Fig.\u00a0S3) and the molecular response to ETO was then examined by immunoblotting (Fig\u00a04A) for key regulators of DNA damage, (pCHK2, p53, p21Cip1, and RAD51). These experiments revealed p53, RAD51 and pCHK2 were all upregulated from day 1 independently of OCT4A expression. p21Cip1 expression rose gradually from day 1 throughout the course of experiment as seen in previous experiments. Silencing of OCT4A resulted in a marked increase in p21Cip1 expression from day 1. These results imply that the presence of OCT4A induced by DNA damage suppresses p21Cip1 expression despite comparable levels of p53 expression and equivalent DNA damage as judged by RAD51 and pCHK2 expression. When investigating the cell cycle response, loss of OCT4A caused an almost identical phenotype to that previously reported with p53 silencing24 i.e. OCT4A-silenced cells underwent a profound G2M arrest with apoptosis being greatly reduced (Fig.\u00a04B and C). The cells displayed the large, flattened morphology and Sa-\u03b2-gal staining associated with senescence on day 5 (Fig.\u00a04D), identical to that previously reported when silencing p53. Thus, the increase in G2M arrest and increased accelerated senescence previously observed with p53 silencing appears to be entirely due to the loss of the induction of OCT4A. Prolonged loss of OCT4A lead to the polyploidisation of these senescent cells and a reduction in clonal recovery (Fig.\u00a05). The absence of off target effects was confirmed by repeating silencing and cell cycle analysis experiments with 3 separate siRNA molecules targeting different sequences of OCT4A mRNA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Having established that OCT4A suppresses p21Cip1 and a senescent phenotype we sought to investigate the possibility of a reciprocal suppression of OCT4A by p21Cip1. To do this p21Cip1 was silenced using siRNA. Silencing of p21Cip1 was efficient as judged by immunoblotting but was not found to affect the expression of OCT4A in the presence or absence of ETO treatment (Fig.\u00a06). Furthermore, we detected no difference in the cell cycle profiles of p21Cip1-silenced cells compared to control siRNA treated cells following ETO treatment. In summary, we found that OCT4A tempers p21Cip1 upregulation, restricting entry into senescence, indicating that co-expression defines the pre-senescent state. While p21Cip1 did not regulate OCT4A expression or change the cell cycle, depletion of OCT4A profoundly impacted it. We also found that p53-activated OCT4A does not support the pluripotency network in pre-senescent cells (owing to the lack of SOX2/NANOG co-ordination), leaving its biological role unclear. We, therefore, interrogated its possible role as a stress responder where one of these stresses may be metabolic. AMPK is a key sensor of metabolism and energy status.27 Therefore, we next explored the activation of AMPK by virtue of its phosphorylation at Threonine 172 (pAMPKThr172), in relation to OCT4A expression. The results of this comparative study are shown in Fig.\u00a07. Microscopy of control, untreated, cells revealed heterogeneous pAMPKThr172 activation with expression in some cell nuclei and also in centrosomes, central spindle and mid-bodies of mitotic cells as described previously,28 and rarely ( <1% cells), in the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a07A, upper row). In ETO-treated cells the staining for AMPK increased and strikingly coincided with the localization and intensity of staining for OCT4A in most cells (Fig.\u00a07A, second row) as also confirmed by IF measurements, where clear correlation was shown (Fig.\u00a07B). However, while OCT4A is seen homogenously throughout the nucleus pAMPKThr172 staining revealed a fine (euchromatic) nuclear pattern, which indicates binding to chromatin, unlike OCT4A. Intense staining of pAMPKThr172 was also found in apoptotic cell nuclei and bodies, while OCT4A was not (Fig.\u00a07C). In arrested metaphases appearing after ETO on day 4, pAMPKThr172 was localized to multiple centrosomes, while OCT4A was not (Fig.\u00a07A, second row). This difference in staining was confirmed by co-staining for \u03b3-tubulin and AURORA B kinase (not shown). Together, these data indicate that OCT4A is co-ordinately regulated alongside pAMPKThr172 in interphase cells but that in apoptotic cells their functions may differ. Moreover, the concordant expression of OCT4A and pAMPKThr172 in interphase cells suggests that the p53-dependent OCT4A induction is a result of a stress response following ETO treatment. As a part of its role as a central metabolic regulator, AMPK is directly involved in the regulation of autophagy.29 In this regard, previous studies have shown that autophagy is implicated in the chemo-resistance to ETO and this effect is reversed by inhibition of AMPK, which led to cell death by apoptosis.30 Conversely, cellular senescence is also associated with autophagy30 representing another potential cell fate phenotype following ETO-treatment.24 p16ink4a is believed to drive irreversible senescence. 31 Therefore, we next decided to explore the relationship of p16ink4a and macroautophagy. Autophagy was verified using immunofluorescence for p62 as a marker of autophagy. Post ETO treatment, an increase in the number of p62 foci/cell was observed by immunofluorescence (Fig.\u00a08A and B) and mean number of p62 foci/cell in 3 independent experiments was shown to increase > 5-fold (Fig\u00a08C). Bafilomycin A (Baf) halted autophagic flux in ETO-treated cells (shown as an accumulation of LC3B in relation to LC3A), confirming functional autophagy and its suppression (Fig.\u00a08D). Baf treatment also enhanced cell death preventing clonogenic recovery only in ETO-treated cells (Fig.\u00a0S5), which indicates the importance of autophagy for cell survival after DNA damage. We then assessed immunostaining for p16ink4a and LAMP2 in the presence and absence of Baf post ETO treatment. LAMP2 is an important regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, required for the maturation of functional autophagosomes. In control, untreated cells, p16ink4a was observed in \u02dc5% of cells as small aggresomes, surrounded by LAMP2-positive foci (data not shown). In ETO-treated cells (day 4), the cytoplasm was highly enriched with LAMP2, while p16ink4a-positive aggresomes (larger and more numerous than in control) were sequestered in autophago-lysosomes (Fig.\u00a09 A and B). Approximately 30% of cells were seen to accumulate large amounts of p16ink4a in multiple aggresomes, as measure by >3 aggresomes and/or diffusely detected within cytoplasm, or in large vacuoles (Fig.\u00a09A-C), and often showed DNA in cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a09C). The proportion of such cells, with high levels of p16ink4a, increased fold2- (29 \u00b1 6 .5 and 58 \u00b1 3 .5, +/\u2212 Baf, respectively) as measured on day 4. These observations indicate the important role of autophagy in sequestering and degrading p16ink4a in ETO-treated PA-1 cells, thus preventing senescence. They also show that a considerable proportion of ETO-treated cells suffer from exhaustion of autophagy. In ETO-treated samples counterstained with DAPI, we noted that the failure of macroautophagy to control and sequester p16ink4a in the cytoplasm coincided with prominent changes in cell nuclei, particularly following Baf treatment. Nuclei became thinner, less intensely DAPI-stained (e.g. Fig.\u00a09C), or, more frequently, displaced to one of the cell poles by large autophagic vacuoles (Fig.\u00a09B). Twisting, thinning, and disintegrating cell nuclei were the main phenotypes of ETO+Baf-treated cells. As detailed above, in their extreme distortions, the cell nuclei were displaced and squeezed by large autophagic vacuoles and attained a sickle-like shape (Fig.\u00a09D). It remains possible that the loss of sequestration of p16ink4a, distortion of cell nuclei and loss of DNA are all linked, belonging to a related series of processes associated with exhausted autophagy, which is further exaggerated by Baf where full disintegration of the cell nucleus and alveolar LC3-positive cytoplasm are evident (Fig.\u00a010 A). Trying to understand how the penetrability of the cell nuclei was related to DNA damage we stained with an antibody (PL2\u20136) which detects a unique epitope involving a ternary complex of histones H2A and H2B and DNA at the site of the chromatin attachment to lamin B1.32 We applied it to ETO-treated cell nuclei (day 4) combining it with a label for DNA damage (pCHK2). The result shows (Fig.\u00a010B) bright nuclear staining with PL2\u20136 in cell nuclei without DNA damage and its reduction in cell nuclei containing DNA damage, possibly suggesting that binding to lamin B receptors in compromised. In view of this data, we decided to use detailed stoichiometric DNA image cytometry following ETO treatment in the presence or absence of Baf. Typical histograms from one representative experiment are shown in Fig.\u00a010C, while in Fig.\u00a0S6 comparative DNA histograms of selected normal- and sickle-shaped cell nuclei from ETO+Baf treatment are presented. Measurements from ETO-treated cells revealed a peak of delay in late S-phase, which was augmented after Baf treatment showing apparent redistribution from G2 (4C) into <4C, which was exaggerated in selected sickle-type nuclei of ETO+Baf-treated cells (Fig.\u00a0S6). These data support our microscopic observations that DNA is preferentially lost from the sickle-like shape nuclei in the cells as a result of failed autophagic processing with the proportion of sickle-like nuclei cells with sickle-like nuclei in ETO-treated samples increased more than 2-fold (2.38 \u00b1 0.2) following Baf treatment (n = 3). In this study, we expanded our investigation of the response of PA-1 embryonal carcinoma cells to DNA damaging chemotherapy. We previously observed,24 a concurrent p53-dependent increase in OCT4A and p21Cip1 protein expression after ETO-treatment, with the resulting cells transiting through an apparently bi-potential state with hallmarks of both premature multi-centriolar mitoses and senescence. Herein, we extended our analysis and highlight a hitherto unobserved DNA damage response (DDR) function of OCT4A following ETO treatment, which is different from its established pluripotency and self-renewal functions. This p53-dependant DDR-induced OCT4A is not coordinated with SOX2 or NANOG activity, but does serve to suppress p21Cip1. This finding is in accord with the previously shown observation that OCT4A can directly repress p21Cip1 expression by binding its promoter in the absence of SOX2 and NANOG. 33 Although not yet confirmed in other cell types or following different stimuli, this phenomenon likely relates to properties evidenced during embryonal \u2018stemness\u2019, as similar nuclear accumulation of OCT4A was similarly recently reported following laser beam damage of live ESC cells.34 Our measurements of OCT4A and p21Cip1 expression in individual cells revealed that cell fate, in response to extensive DNA damage, occurs with high levels of heterogeneity. Both factors increase coordinately with huge variations in expression, covering (at day 5) a wide spectrum of p21Cip1 and OCT4A expression.35 These observations demonstrate a typical characteristic of self-organizing, adapting systems, using heterogeneity over time to provide bifurcations of cell fate choice.36,37 The increased variance in both factors \u2013 from day 3 until day 7 \u2013 corresponds to the period with most prominent cell death (99% cells will die and only <1% has the chance to survive, likely representing the degree of challenge that they must overcome).24 When OCT4A is silenced the level of p21Cip1 increases, more cells enter senescence and mitotic recovery is reduced, abrogating fragile balance in bifurcation point and removing the possibility for rare cells to choose survival as their fate. It is worth noting that this response was phenotypically identical to that seen when silencing p53.24 We hypothesize that the loss of p53 or OCT4A in silencing experiments causes the loss of the embryonal G2M checkpoint leading to increased mitotic slippage, ultimately ending in terminal senescence rather than executing the G2M checkpoint function via apoptosis. Continued silencing of OCT4A inhibited clonogenic recovery post ETO treatment highlighting the importance of the pre-senescent G2M arrest for clonogenic recovery of the small percentage of cells that are able to repair their DNA damage. Silencing of OCT4A also leads to endoreplication in senescent cells further eluding to the presence of mitotic slippage.38 p21Cip1 silencing experiments demonstrated that the observed G2M arrest was independent of p21Cip1 expression. Mitotic survival of the ETO-treated cells ultimately originates from metastable pre-senescence. Theoretically, this means that the self-renewal function of OCT4A is finally restored. The attractor of self-renewal fate in individual cells is high NANOG,39 released from direct suppression by p5340 and activated by OCT4A-SOX2 heterodimer. Although NANOG is only found in a very small number of PA-1 cells, its role requires further exploration. This moderator function of DDR-induced OCT4A occurs alongside activation of AMPK. AMPK is an evolutionary conserved low-energy checkpoint that operates as a master regulator of cellular metabolism and activator of autophagy. AMPK also acts as a genomic stress sensor that is required for the adaptation of metabolism switches and the DDR for efficient repair of DNA.41 We previously observed a bidirectional relationship between AMPK and ATM/CHK2 pathways that integrates both the metabolic and DNA damage stress signaling.42 AMPK activation was previously shown as necessary for maximal stress-induced transcription of p53-dependent genes that promote cell survival.43 Interestingly, AMPK has also been shown to activate and stabilize p53.44,45 Thus, the energetic stress-response of AMPK is tightly linked to the DDR of p53. The role of AMPK in the autophagy and cell death response after ETO has previously been reported.30 We previously revealed the p53-dependant DDR-induced elevation in OCT4A in PA-1 cells following ETO treatment. Therefore, it was not unexpected that DDR-induced OCT4A and AMPK activation should be coordinately regulated by ETO as we observed here. We found that while autophagy apparently remains functional, cells retaining both AMPK and DDR-induced OCT4A in cell nuclei are capable of preventing terminal senescence. This data are in accordance with the report by Chitikova and colleagues, 46 who demonstrated that silencing mTOR (the antagonist of AMPK suppressing autophagy) in irradiated, apoptosis-resistant cells caused a reversal of senescence. Thus OCT4A moderating p21Cip1 in collaboration with pAMPKThr172, supporting cells with metabolites and energy through autophagy and other means, channel cells through disadaptation chaos caused by high DNA damage toward a survival phenotype. ETO-treated PA-1 cells struggle against terminal senescence in particular by autophagic sequestration and removal of its regulator p16ink4a. There is much controversy regarding markers of terminal senescence and even what the process really is. It has become recently apparent that terminal senescence is not only growth arrest,47 moreover, it is intrinsically associated with the origin of EMT22 and predicts poor clinical outcome after cancer treatment.48 In our previous and current article we have partly unravelled a mechanism showing that in response to DNA damage p53 induces 2 regulators of opposite cell fates. The setting is interesting: although they both are positively regulated by the same up-stream inducer, OCT4A suppresses p21Cip1, while the latter does not directly suppress OCT4A. Nevertheless, the scattering of the cells in expression of both through the phase space ending up in one of 2 cell fates presumes their reciprocity. The observation of cell-to-cell variability can also be a result from biological oscillations in time.49 The best documented example of this is the p53-mdm2 oscillating system in which p53 oscillations are, indeed, crucial for cell recovery after DNA damage.50 It is, therefore, possible that heterogeneity in p53 due to oscillations results in downstream heterogeneity of both OCT4A and p21Cip1 in PA-1 cells. Senescence is intrinsically associated with macroautophagy induction (regulated by AMPK and persistent DNA damage). 51 Here, we found that persistent DNA damage was associated with destruction of the ternary complex of histones (H2A and H2B) and DNA in their attachment to nuclear lamin B1 using a unique antibody reagent.32 This observation is in keeping with data of the thinning and disassembly of lamin B1 and leakage of DNA from cells as a feature of terminal senescence.52 Our DNA cytometric observations revealed a delay in late S-phase after ETO, augmented by BafA1. The consequence of this delay would be under-replication of heterochromatin,53 appearance of single strand DNA breaks, demethylation and activation of the transposable elements (TE) ALU/LINE 1, whose mobility after ETO has already been described.54 As sequestering ALU mRNA and LINE 1 by autophagy in the cytoplasm has been reported as a mechanism for protecting against transposition,55 it therefore remains possible, (although purely speculative) that functional autophagy prevents terminal senescence in this manner also. The model with the scenario of terminal senescence occurring due to activation of TE as discussed in several other studies.56-58 It follows then that terminal senescence may in fact be mainly triggered by several mechanisms, which potentiate each other and result from failure of autophagy. Thus, autophagy should be a key target for preventing resistance of cancer stem cells to genotoxic therapies, a supposition supported by others.59,60 PA-1 is an ovarian teratocarcinoma (a germline tumor) cell-line, obtained from ATCC, with a stable near-diploid karyotype.61 It possesses functional p53, in spite of possible acquisition of one mutated allele reported at passages over 407.62 Importantly it retains the ability to differentiate into all 3 tissue types, thus possessing the features of embryonal carcinoma.61 The NTera 2 (NT2) cell line, obtained from ATCC and used as a positive control for pluruipotency genes OCT4A, SOX2 and NANOG. Primary antibodies and their uses are detailed in Table\u00a01. Secondary antibodies and their uses are detailed in Table\u00a02. PA-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) if not otherwise stated. NT2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown without antibiotics in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. Exponentially growing PA-1 cells were incubated with 4\u20138\u00a0\u03bcM ETO for 20\u00a0h. Following ETO treatment, cells were maintained by replenishing culture medium every 48h. Bafilomycin A (Baf A, Cayman Chemicals) 50\u00a0nM was added to the culture medium for 24h between day 3 to 4 after 20h treatment with 8\u00a0\u00b5M ETO. Cells were harvested at relevant time points, washed in cold PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol for 20\u00a0min at room temperature. After two washes in tris buffered saline (TBS), cells were permeabilised with TBS/4% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.1% Triton X-100 for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-OCT4 antibody solution (Santa Cruz) and rabbit polyclonal p21Cip1 (Pierce) in TBS/4% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100 for 1h at room temperature. Following two washes in TBS, cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit- IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (A31627, Invitrogen) and Chicken anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 647 (A21463, Invitrogen) (1:200) in TBS/4% BSA/0.1% Triton \u00d7 100, for 30\u00a0min in the dark. DNA was counterstained with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml propidium iodide (PtdIns) in PBS, and assessed by flow cytometry using a FACS Aria (BD Biosciences) using Cell Quest Pro Software). Data was analyses using FlowJo analysis software. Cells were suspended in warm FBS and cytospun onto glass slides. Cytospins were fixed in methanol for 7\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0C and dipped 10\u00a0times in ice cold acetone. Slides were then washed thrice in TBS 0.01% Tween 20 (TBST) for 5\u00a0min. Slides were subsequently blocked for 15\u00a0min in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20%, 1% BSA at room temperature. Samples were covered with TBS, 0.025% Tween 20%, 1% BSA containing primary antibody and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber. Samples were then washed thrice in TBST and covered with TBST containing the appropriate secondary antibodies (Goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (A31619, Invitrogen) and Goat anti-rabbit- IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (A31631, Invitrogen)) and incubated for 40\u00a0min at room temperature in the dark. Slides were washed thrice for 5\u00a0min with TBST and once for 2\u00a0min in PBS. Samples were then counterstained with 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml DAPI for 2\u00a0min, and finally embedded in Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). When staining for p-AMPK\u03b11/2 (alone or in combination with the antibody for OCT4), fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u00a0min was used, followed by washing thrice in PBS 0,1% glycine. Primary antibodies and their source are listed in Table\u00a01. Slides were evaluated using a Leitz Ergolux L03\u201310 microscope equipped with Sony DXC 390P color video camera, for microscopic observations; in addition to separate optical filters, a 3-band BRG (blue, red, green) optical filter (Leica) was used. Image cytometry was carried out by semi-automatic measuring fluorescence values for each cell nuclei in all 3 channels and analyzed using Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics). Apoptotic cells, determined by nuclear morphology, were omitted from measurements. For DNA cytometry measurements, stoichiometric toluidine blue DNA staining was performed as previously.63 In brief, cytospins were fixed in ethanol:acetone (1:1) for >30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and air dried. Slides were then treated with 5N HCl for 20\u00a0min at room temperature, washed in distilled water (5 \u00d7 1\u00a0min) and stained for 10\u00a0min with 0.05% toluidine blue in 50% citrate-phosphate McIlvain buffer pH 4. Slides were rinsed with distilled water, blotted dry and dehydrated in butanol for 2\u00d73\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. Samples were then incubated twice in xylene for 3\u00a0min each at room temperature and embedded in DPX (Sigma). DNA content was measured as the integral optical density with a calibrated Sony DXC 390P video camera in the green channel. Nuclear area was calculated using Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics). Apoptotic cells were omitted from measurements. The stoichiometry of DNA staining was verified using the values obtained for metaphases compared to anaphases and telophases (ratio 2.0); the summary error of the method and device was estimated to be less than 5%. Cells (including those in media) were harvested at indicated time points, washed in PBS and re-suspended in hypotonic fluorochrome solution [50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml propidium iodide (PI), 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100] and stored for at least 1\u00a0h in the dark at 4\u00b0C. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) or Accuri\u2122 C6 Cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data was analyses using FlowJo analysis software. The senescence \u03b2-galactosidase (sa-\u03b2-gal) staining kit (Cell Signaling Technology, UK) was used to detect sa-\u03b2-gal activity in cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. For whole-cell lysates, cells were harvested, washed once with PBS and lysed using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P8340). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Thermo Scientific), with 10\u201330\u00a0\u03bcg of total protein separated on 20% SDS polyacrylamide gels followed by electrophoretic transfer onto BA85 nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell GmbH) overnight. Equal protein loading in each lane was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. Blots were probed with appropriate antibodies primary and secondary detected using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce\u2122, 32106). For comparison of OCT4 isoforms protein was transferred onto immobilon-FC transfer membrane and probed with primary antibodies. Blots were then probed with fluorescent secondary antibodies and the signal was visualized using a LICOR Odyssey imaging system. FlexiTube siRNA (SI04950274, SI04950267, SI04153835 and SI00690382; Qiagen) was used to silence OCT4A expression, and FlexiTube siRNA (SI00604905, SI00604898 and SI00299810; Qiagen) was used to silence p21Cip1 expression. ON-TARGET plus non-targeting siRNA #1 (Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. Cells were transfected with siRNA using HiPerfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad (GraphPad Software Ltd). Student t-test was used to calculate the statistical significance of difference of means where appropriate. Statistical significance was accepted when p < 0.05.

The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor, which is involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis, regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, and so on. In our previous study, we found that CaSR expression, intracellular calcium levels and cardiac function were all significantly decreased in DCM rats; however, the exact mechanism are not clear yet. The present study revealed the protective role of CaSR in myocardial energy metabolism disorder induced by high glucose (HG) as well as the underlying mechanism. Here, we demonstrated that HG decreased the expression of CaSR, mitochondrial fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2), cell gap junction related proteins (Cx43, \u03b2-catenin, N-cadherin), and intracellular ATP concentration. In contrast, HG increased extracellular ATP concentration, the expression of gp78, mitochondrial fission proteins (Fis1, Drp1), and the ubiquitination levels of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43. Moreover, CaSR agonist and gp78-siRNA significantly reduced the above changes. Taken together, these results suggest that HG induces myocardial energy metabolism disorder via decrease of CaSR expression, and activation of gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system. In turn, these effects disrupt the structure and function of the mitochondria and the cell gap junction, result in the reduced ATP synthesis and the increased ATP leakage. Stimulation of CaSR significantly attenuates HG-induced abnormal myocardial energy metabolism, suggesting CaSR would be a promising potential therapeutic target for DCM.\n", "fulltext": "Myocardial diastolic and systolic dysfunction is main characteristic of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM),1 which is mainly related to abnormal synthesis and utilization of ATP.2 The abnormal myocardial energy metabolism will inevitably impair myocardial structure and function, eventually increasing the risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure.3 Mitochondria are well established as the organelles responsible for cellular energy production, such that cellular ATP production is dependent on normal mitochondrial structure and function. Mitochondrial fusion-related proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2) and mitochondrial fission-related proteins (Fis1, Drp1) maintain the dynamic balance of mitochondrial structure together.4, 5 Cardiac energy demand is very large, requiring myocardial cell to produce more ATP by the fusion of the mitochondria.6, 7 Obviously, the decreased expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2 will result in the decrease of ATP synthesis. So, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of Mfn1 and Mfn2 expression is critical to understanding and treating DCM. The ubiquitin proteasome pathway is the predominant protein degradation pathway,8 and its activation is regulated by various proteins, such as gp78.9 This protein also forms a specialized tubule between the closely adjacent endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and facilitates the rapid transfer of calcium from the former to the latter.10 Besides, gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) consists of hemichannel, which can quickly transmit the materials, energy and electrical signals between adjacent cells.11, 12 Impaired GJIC will result in the leakage of intracellular ATP. Therefore, the abnormal energy metabolism is not only related to the decrease of ATP synthesis, but also to the increase of ATP leakage. It is reported that DCM can cause the decrease expression of mitochondrial fusion protein and gap junction protein,13, 14 although the mechanisms underlying these effects are not established. In addition, whether the activation of the gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system is involved in DCM is not clear. Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptors that is widely expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Early study found that the function of CaSR is to regulate the release of parathyroid hormone and maintain the body's calcium homeostasis.15 Furthermore, CaSR is also closely related to cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, apoptosis, brain development, wound healing, and so on.16, 17, 18 The increase of extracellular calcium concentration can directly activate CaSR, and some amino acids are also involved in the regulation of CaSR activation.19 Our previous study found that CaSR is involved in myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction and pulmonary hypertension, and so on.20, 21, 22 And we recently observed that the cardiac function and the expression of CaSR were decreased in the rat diabetic myocardium.23 Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the observed association between the CaSR and ATP remains unclear. In present study, by using high glucose (HG)-induced energy metabolism disorder model in the primary cultured cardiomyocytes, we studied the effect of CaSR in maintaining ATP content and protecting the structure and function of mitochondria and gap junction. The underlying mechanisms were also explored. We detected the expression of CaSR in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes by immunoblotting with \u03b2-actin as a reference. The results showed that compared with the control group, the expression of CaSR in HG group was significantly decreased. Furthermore, the expression of CaSR in HG group was increased or decreased by the pretreatment of CaSR agonist (NPS R568) or CaSR antagonist (Calhex231), respectively (Figures 1a and b). The results of chemiluminescence showed that the content of intracellular ATP in HG group was significantly lower than in control group. NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment could significantly reduce or enhance the changes above (Figure 2a). Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is generally regarded as a marker of stress response. We firstly detected Hsp70 expression by immunoblotting with VDAC as a reference. The results showed that the expression of Hsp70 was significantly upregulated in HG group (Figure 2b), indicating that HG induces the stress response. The proton-transferring ability of mitochondrial respiratory chain is crucial to produce ATP.24 We observed that the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I\u2013V) related proteins (ND1, SDHA, UQCRQ, COX5A, ATP5F1) and the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I\u2013V) were decreased in HG group. NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment could weak or enhance the above-mentioned effect induced by HG (Figures 2b and c). Calcein-AM cobalt technology was used to detect the status (i.e., open versus closed) of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP).25 The fluorescence intensity in the control group was set as 100%, the fluorescence intensity in the HG group was significantly lowered to 28.34\u00b12.49%. NPS R568 increased the fluorescence intensity from 28.34\u00b12.49% to 67.95\u00b12.36%, while Calhex231 pretreatment further decreased the fluorescence intensity from 28.34\u00b12.49% to 25.25\u00b11.72% (Figure 2d). An open mPTP has been previously shown to decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m).26 In the present study, the red/green fluorescence ratio in the control group was set as 100%. The ratio was significantly decreased to 39.61\u00b14.98% in HG group. NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can increase or decrease the ratios from 39.61\u00b14.98% to 95.11\u00b16.34% or 28.81\u00b14.40% (Figure 2e). To elucidate the mechanism underlying the observed HG-induced mitochondrial respiratory chain disruption, immunoblotting was used to analyze the mitochondrial structure associated proteins in vitro. The results showed that the expression of mitochondrial fusion-related proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2) was decreased and the expression of mitochondrial fission-related proteins (Fis1, Drp1) was increased in HG group. NPS R568 attenuated the changes induced by HG, but no significant changes were observed after pretreatment with Calhex231 (Figure 3a). The mitochondrial morphology was detected with the Mito-Tracker (red) staining.27 In the control group, the red dye was found to be widely distributed, and exhibited a \u2018clubbed\u2019 pattern, while in contrast, it was sparsely distributed, and assumed a \u2018dotted\u2019 pattern in HG group. (Figure 3b). NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can reduce or increase the changes caused by HG (Figure 3b). Then the mitochondrial length of the control group was standardized as 100%, the mitochondria length in the HG group was decreased to 32.37\u00b12.79% (Figure 3c). NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can increase or decrease the mitochondria length from 32.37\u00b12.79% to 98.75\u00b15.95% or 28.02\u00b14.41% (Figure 3c). These data clearly indicate that HG can damage the function and structure of mitochondria in cardiomyocytes, decrease the synthesis of ATP. In contrast, activation of CaSR provides protective effect. We first detected the cell membrane associated gap junction protein by immunoblotting with Na+ K+-ATPase as a reference. The results showed that the expression level of \u03b2-catenin, N-cadherin and Cx43 were significantly decreased in the HG group, while the expression level of Cx43 phosphorylation at Ser368 was significantly upregulated in HG group. NPS R568 lightened the changes induced by HG, but no significant changes occurred after pretreatment with Calhex231 (Figure 4a). Previous study have demonstrated that the downregulation of \u03b2-catenin and N-cadherin expression hinders both the complexes formation and cell adhesion, which then destroys GJIC ultimately.28 In the present study, the results of immunocoprecipitation showed that the expression level of complex was significantly decreased in the HG group. NPS R568 and Spermine (a non-specific agonist) pretreatment could significantly enhance the complex level in HG group, while Calhex231 pretreatment could reduce the complex level (Figure 4b). The effect of HG on the gap junction function was further observed using the scrape-loading dye transfer technique (SLDT).29 The green fluorescence was widely distributed in the control group, but only concentrated at the scratch marks in the HG group. Although we detected the extracellular ATP content using the chemiluminescence method. The results showed that the extracellular ATP content was significantly increased in the HG group (Figure 4d). NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment could reduce or increase the effect of HG (Figure 4c and d). Our results also showed that \u03b2-catenin (in cytoplasm and nucleus) and the p-GSK-3\u03b2 were significantly increased in HG group, but the phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin at Ser33 and Ser37 were decreased in HG group. NPS R568 or Calhex231 led to a similar effect as mentioned above (Figure 5). We firstly detected the gp78 expression. The results showed that gp78 expression increased significantly in the HG group and Calhex231 group, while NPS R568 and Spermine obviously inhibited the action of HG (Figure 6a). These results suggested that activation of CaSR can inhibit gp78 expression. We then utilized the gp78-siRNA to investigate the role of gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system in HG-induced cardiomyocyte injury. The results showed that the gp78-siRNA significantly inhibited the expression of gp78, but con-siRNA had little effect (Figure 6b). Compared with the control group, the ubiquitination levels of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43 were markedly increased in HG group and Calhex231 group, which will inevitably decrease the Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43. CaSR agonists and gp78-siRNA can weaken the influence of HG (Figure 6c). Obviously, activated CaSR could protect cardiomyocytes by inhibiting the HG-induced activation of gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system. In recent years, the morbidity and mortality of diabetes are increasing.30, 31 The major complication of diabetes is DCM,32, 33 which specific mechanism has not been clarified. In the previous study, we found that the cardiac contraction and relaxation in diabetic rats was decreased,23 which is related to the unbalanced calcium homeostasis caused by downregulation of CaSR expression. In present study, we, for the first time, explored that ATP flux disorder (the decrease of ATP synthesis and the increase of ATP leakage) is a crucial mechanism of DCM. We observed the effects of HG on ATP content, the expression of CaSR, mitochondria, gap junction and other related protein in primary cultured cardiomyocytes, and analyzed the role and mechanism of CaSR expression change in abnormal myocardial energy metabolism. Myocardial contraction and relaxation both require a large amount of ATP, which is mainly generated in mitochondrial respiratory chain in vivo.34 Our results showed that both the CaSR expression and the ATP content of cardiomyocytes was significantly decreased in HG group, suggesting that the two effects may be associated. We also observed that the expression and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I\u2013V) related proteins were decreased in HG group, and the pretreatment of NPS R568 or Calhex231 could reduce or further aggravate the above changes. These results implicate the downregulated expression of CaSR is involved in the cardiac energy metabolism dysfunction induced by HG. To explore the interaction of the downregulation of CaSR expression and the decreased expression and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I\u2013V) related proteins under HG treatment, the mitochondrial related structural proteins were further examined. The results showed that the expression of Fis1 and Drp1 were upregulated in HG group. By contrast, the expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2 were downregulated in HG group. Undoubtedly, the above-mentioned expression changes of Drp1, Fis1, Mfn2 and Mfn1 induced by HG will inevitably lead to the decrease of expression and activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex (I\u2013V) protein, which certainly result in the decrease of ATP synthesis. Mitochondria synthesize ATP by the oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transfer of mitochondrial respiratory chain.24, 35, 36 The later depends on the proton pump to maintain normal \u0394\u03c8m.37 Thus, when the intracellular ATP content is reduced, the proton pump failure will inevitably lead to the decrease of \u0394\u03c8m which will further reduce the production of ATP by affecting the electron transfer.37, 38 Therefore, the decrease of intracellular ATP content and \u0394\u03c8m could form a vicious circle. Our present study observed that the mPTP was significantly open and the \u0394\u03c8m was decreased in the HG group. NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can alleviate or aggravate the changes induced by HG. Obviously, the downregulation of CaSR expression is a critical mechanism leading to energy metabolism disorder induced by HG. To analyze the reason for decrease of intracellular ATP content further, we simultaneously detected the extracellular ATP content (in cell culture medium). The results showed that the content of extracellular ATP was increased. As a water-soluble substance, ATP is difficult to pass the cell membrane. As reported, GJIC in the pathological state can form an open hemichannel, releasing ATP and other small molecules into the extracellular fluid.39 So, we observed the altered expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) and other related proteins in HG condition. Connexin (Cx) is a basic protein of GJIC, which allows rapid transfer of inorganic ions, ATP and other small molecules between the cells.12, 40 Among the Cx superfamily members, the Cx43 is abundantly expressed in myocardium,41 and is critical to maintain the structure and function of cardiac gap junction. Clustered N-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin complexes at the plasma membrane appear to be a prerequisite for GJIC formed by Cx43.28 Furthermore, phosphorylation of Cx43 at Ser368 has been previously shown to cause GJIC dysfunction.42 Our experimental results showed that the expression of Cx43, N-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin protein were downregulated, the N-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin complexes were decreased, and p-Cx43 was significantly upregulated in HG group. CaSR agonists or inhibitor pretreatment can reduce or aggravate the above-mentioned changes. To further prove that the abnormal expression of Cx43 can cause the dysfunction of GJIC, SLDT was used. Our results showed that yellow lucifer (green fluorescence) were widely distributed among cells in control group, but only existed in scratch in HG group. NPS R568 pretreatment can lead the green fluorescence widely spread among cells in HG group. These results collectively suggest that cardiac energy metabolism disorder caused by HG, not only related to the reduction of ATP synthesis induced by downregulating CaSR expression, but also with the increase of ATP leakage by dysfunction of GJIC. The classical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is involved in the early development of the embryo, organ formation, tissue regeneration and other physiological processes.43, 44, 45 Under pathological conditions, this pathway is also involved in the occurrence of cancer and metabolic syndrome.46, 47 We observed that the expression of \u03b2-catenin was downregulated on the cardiomyocytes membrane, but was upregulated in the cytoplasm and nucleus in HG group. At the same time, the expression of p-GSK-3\u03b2 protein was increased, the p-\u03b2-catenin was decreased in HG group. NPS R568 or Calhex231 pretreatment can significantly inhibit or aggravate the above changes. The decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin protein on the cell membrane could inhibit the complex formation of N-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin, which will damage the integrity of the hemichannel,48 resulting in the increase of ATP leakage. Grol et al.49 found that increase of extracellular ATP could abnormally activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Remarkably, the downregulation of CaSR expression have a crucial role in this process. Why the activation of CaSR can reduce the adverse effects of HG on mitochondria and cell gap junction? We speculated that increase of intracellular calcium induced by activation of CaSR inhibit gp78 expression. As mentioned earlier, gp78 can degrade some corresponding proteins by ubiquitin proteasome pathway.9, 50 Present study found that the expression of gp78 was significantly upregulated, while the expression of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43 were markedly downregulated in the HG group. CaSR agonist pretreatment could significantly reduce the changes above. Therefore, the activation of CaSR protect mitochondria and cell gap junction by inhibiting gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system. To verify our speculation, we used siRNA to disrupt the synthesis of gp78 protein and detected the ubiquitination level of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43 by immunoprecipitation. The results showed that the ubiquitination level of Mfn1, Mfn2 and Cx43 were significantly increased in HG group. The CaSR agonist and the gp78-siRNA both reduced the ubiquitination level of these proteins, and the CaSR inhibitor enhance the level of ubiquitination. Goetz JG et al reported that the expression of gp78 protein decreased with the increase of intracellular Ca2+.10 The activated CaSR can increase the intracellular Ca2+ by activating the G protein-PLC-IP3 pathway, which inhibit the abnormal protein ubiquitination induced by gp78. Based on the results and discussion of the present study, we suggest that HG induces downregulation of CaSR expression, which causes the activation of gp78-ubiquitin proteasome system. On the one hand, activated ubiquitin proteasome promotes the degradation of Mfn1 and Mfn2, resulting in the decrease of ATP synthesis. On the other hand, it degrades Cx43, causing ATP leakage (Figure 7). These changes destroy the ATP homeostasis (ATP flux). Therefore, the downregulation of CaSR expression is probably a crucial cause and mechanism of myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction in DCM. Primary cultures of cardiomyocyte from neonatal Wistar rat aged 1\u20133 days were prepared, as previously described method.51 All the experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee for the Use of Experimental Animals at Harbin Medical University (Heilongjiang, China). Briefly, in the super-clean worktable, the hearts were cut into pieces, digested with trypsin (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) for 8\u2009min, then DMEM culture medium was added to terminate the digestion. After 8 times of the same process, the cells were collected by 10\u2009min centrifugation with 600\u2009g at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Two hours after incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, the attached cells were discarded and the unattached cells were continuously cultured. The cardiomyocytes were plated in collagen-coated 35\u2009mm petri dish and maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin or streptomycin. The media was changed two times per week. The cultured cardiomyocytes were randomly divided into four groups: (1) Control group (Control): cardiomyocytes cultured with DMEM (glucose 5.5\u2009mM, 10% FBS); (2) High glucose group (HG): cardiomyocytes cultured with DMEM containing high glucose (glucose 40.0\u2009mM); (3) HG+NPS R568 group (HG+NPS R568): 5\u2009\u03bcM NPS R568 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the medium for 30\u2009min before HG incubation. (4) HG+Calhex231 group (HG+Calhex231): 3\u2009\u03bcM Calhex231 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the medium for 30\u2009min before HG incubation. The cardiomyocytes were incubated for 48\u2009h. The mitochondria were isolated using previous method with slight modifications.52, 53 Briefly, cardiomyocytes were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with PBS at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Cells were resuspended with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.6) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. The cell suspension was homogenized on ice using a glass homogenizer. The number of strokes was optimized by inspecting homogenate under the microscope for unintact cells. The cell homogenate was then gently passed twenty times through a 26 G 1/2 needle using a 1\u2009ml syringe and centrifuged at 800\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected in a 1.5\u2009ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged again at 800\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The supernatant, which containing the crude mitochondria, was transferred to a new tube with 1.5\u2009M sucrose solution which final concentration was 180\u2009mM, then centrifuged at 14\u2009000\u2009g for 10\u2009min to get the precipitation of mitochondrial. Finally, the specific lysis solution for mitochondria (Beyotime Biotechnology) was used to get the mitochondria related proteins. The cellular membrane was extracted by the Membrane and Cytosol Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). Briefly, Primary cardiac myocytes were inoculated into the 35\u2009mm Petri dish. After drug treatment, the cells were scraped off by a cell scraper, centrifuged at 600\u2009g for 5\u2009min, put into a pre-cooled EP 1.5\u2009ml tube with cell membrane extraction reagent A containing PMSF for 15\u2009min. The cell suspension was homogenized on ice using a glass homogenizer. The number of strokes was 120 times. After centrifuged at 700\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C, the supernatant was carefully collected into the new 1.5\u2009ml EP tube. To precipitate cell membrane fragments, 14000\u2009g centrifugation for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C was used. The supernatant was discard and 200\u2009\u03bcl cell membrane extraction reagent B was added into this tube. After vortex shock 5\u2009s and ice bath 10\u2009min were repeated 4 times, the tube was centrifuged at 14000\u2009g for 5\u2009min, the cell membrane proteins in supernatant were collected. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology) was used to isolate the cellular nucleus. The experimental procedure was carried out per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The process is similar with the process for isolation of cellular membrane, except relevant reagent, centrifugal time and speed. Finally, the supernatant which containing the nuclear proteins was collected. Mitochondrial-enriched supernatants were prepared from neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes samples, as previously described.52, 53 The activity of respiratory chain enzyme complexes I, II, III, IV and V (C-I, C-II, C-III, C-IV, C-V) in supernatants were assayed using the respiratory chain complex assay kit (GENMED, USA) and UV\u2013VIS spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU, Japan) as the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For C-I, reaction time was 3\u2009min. For C-IV, reaction time was 1\u2009min. For C-II, C-III and C-V, reaction time was 5\u2009min. All assays were performed in at least three times. The protein content of each sample was determined using a BCA assay (Beyotime Biotechnology). All activities were normalized to the total protein content. \u0394\u03c8m was tested with a mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit (Santa Cruz, Bergheimer, Germany). Briefly, the cells soaked in JC-1 (1 \u00d7) were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, then were washed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline. The fluorescence intensity was measured with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus IX81, Olympus Corporation) at the excitation wavelength of 488\u2009nm. Furthermore, JC-1 monomer emits the green fluorescence at 530\u2009nm emission wavelengths and JC-1 aggregate emits the red fluorescence at 590\u2009nm emission wavelengths. At last, the ratio of JC-1 (red/green) was calculated on pictures. The decline or rise of ratio represents the decrease or increase in \u0394\u03c8m. All experiments were repeated three times independently. Co-incubating Calcein-AM (Santa Cruz) and cobalt chloride (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was utilized to mensurate the changes of mPTP opening. Cardiomyocytes were plated in 35\u2009mm petri dish (2 \u00d7 106 cells/dish). After different treatments, the cells were stained with 2\u2009\u03bcM Calcein-AM in the presence of 5\u2009mM cobalt chloride in the dark for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The fluorescence intensity was examined using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX81, Olympus Corporation) at 488\u2009nm excitation and 525\u2009nm emission wavelengths. Experiments were repeated three times independently. Cardiomyocytes (1 \u00d7 105) were cultured in a 35\u2009mm petri dish. After treatments, the cells were stained with 300\u2009nM Mito-Tracker Deep Red FM (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Eugene, OR, USA) for 20\u2009min. Mitochondria were imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX81, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and the average length of mitochondria was measured using Image J (National Institutes of Health, USA). Experiments were repeated three times independently. ATP concentration in primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was measured using ATP Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology) and the Luminoskan\u2122 Ascent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the instructions of manufacturer. The amount of ATP for each sample was determined using an ATP calibration curve and normalized expressed as pmol of ATP. SLDT was utilized to evaluate the gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) activity.29 Briefly, the cells of each group were grown in 35\u2009mm petri dish and rinsed three times with PBS containing 0.01% Ca2+ and 0.01% Mg2+ (Ca2+, Mg2+- PBS). After that, 15\u2009ml PBS containing 0.05% Lucifer yellow CH (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to cover the dish bottom and several cuts were made on the bottom of dish using a scalpel. The cells were incubated in the dye solution for 5\u2009min then rinsed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. Finally, the cells were fixed with 1\u2009ml of 4% paraformaldehyde and photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX81, Olympus Corporation). Experiments were repeated three times independently. Cardiomyocytes were seeded at equal number of cells (2.0 \u00d7 105 per dish) in 35\u2009mm petri dish and maintained in the absence of antibiotic culture medium for 24\u2009h before transfection, then washed three times with PBS. Cardiomyocytes were transfected with Control siRNA (Con-siRNA) and gp78-siRNA (Santa, Dallas, TX, USA) using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 transfection reagent from Invitrogen\u2122 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Scotland, UK). siRNA and the transfection reagent complex were added to the reduced serum media (Gibco\u2122 Opti-MEM\u2122, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) for 8\u2009h, the transfection continued for another 24\u2009h in serum-containing regular medium. After that, the cells were subjected to research. Cardiomyocytes were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer containing PMSF. Proteins concentration was quantified using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Equal amounts of proteins were boiled and then separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred into an aperture of 0.45\u2009\u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Merck Millipore, Massachusetts, USA).

Thereafter, they were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C along with specific primary antibodies. CaSR, Mfn1, Mfn2, Cx43, P-Cx43 were purchased from Santa (Dallas, TX, USA); Drp1, \u03b2-catenin, p-\u03b2-catenin, N-cadherin, GSK-3\u03b2, p-GSK-3\u03b2 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA); gp78, Hsp70, UQCRQ, ND1, ATP5F1, COX5A, SDHA, \u03b2-actin were purchased from Proteintech (Wuhan, China). The membrane was washed three times with 1 \u00d7 Tris-Buffer Saline-Tween 20 (TBST) buffer and then incubated in TBST solution with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 2\u2009h at room temperature. Finally, the membrane was washed thrice with TBST solution. The signals were detected by the Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) kit (HaiGene, Harbin, China) and the Multiplex Fluorescent Imaging System (ProteinSimple, California, USA). VDAC was used to confirm equal mitochondria loading. Na+-K+-ATPase was used as an equal cellular membrane control and Histone 3 as an equal nucleus loading. \u03b2-actin was employed to confirm equal cytosol loading. The intensities of protein bands were quantified by a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc\u2122 EQ densitometer and Bio-Rad Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Cardiomyocytes were seeded in 35\u2009mm petri dish. After treatments, cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer plus PMSF (Roche) for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After 14000\u2009g centrifugation for 20\u2009min, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2\u2009\u03bcg specific antibody of anti-N-cadherin (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C before coupled to Protein A/G Magnetic Beads (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA) for 2\u2009h according to the instructions of Protein A/G Magnetic Beads for IP (Biotool). After that, SDS-PAGE and other protocal were performed using the above methods of immunoblotting. After transfection, cardiomyocytes were treated with 10\u2009\u03bcM MG132 (proteasome inhibitor, Selleckchem) for 6\u2009h before collection. Then they were harvested and lysed in 1% SDS buffer (Tris pH 7.5, 0.5\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM DTT). The samples undergone the pull-down assays using anti-ubiquitin antibody and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Mfn1, anti-Mfn2 and anti-Cx43.

Although congenital malformations, such as anorectal malformations (ARMs), are frequently observed during this process, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. \u03b2-Catenin is a critical component of canonical Wnt signaling and is essential for the regulation of cell differentiation and morphogenesis during embryogenesis. The expression of \u03b2-catenin is observed in endodermal epithelia, including URS epithelia. We modulated the \u03b2-catenin gene conditionally in endodermal epithelia by utilizing tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver line (ShhCreERT2). Both \u03b2-catenin loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF) mutants displayed abnormal clefts in the perineal region and hypoplastic elongation of the URS. The mutants also displayed reduced cell proliferation in the URS mesenchyme. In addition, the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants displayed reduced apoptosis and subsequently increased apoptosis in the URS epithelium. This instability possibly resulted in reduced expression levels of differentiation markers, such as keratin 1 and filaggrin, in the perineal epithelia. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) genes, such as Bmp4 and Bmp7, was also ectopically induced in the epithelia of the URS in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants. The expression of the Msx2 gene and phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8, possible readouts of Bmp signaling, was also increased in the mutants. Moreover, we introduced an additional mutation for a Bmp receptor gene: BmprIA. The ShhCreERT2/+; \u03b2-cateninflox(ex3)/+; BmprIAflox/\u2212 mutants displayed partial restoration of URS elongation compared with the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants. These results indicate that some ARM phenotypes in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants were caused by abnormal Bmp signaling. The current analysis revealed the close relation of endodermal \u03b2-catenin signaling to the ARM phenotypes. These results are considered to shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of human ARMs.\n", "fulltext": "During embryonic development, the cloaca is a temporal structure that is subsequently divided into the urogenital sinus and rectum by the urorectal septum (hereafter referred to as the URS).1, 2, 3 The URS develops from the proximal umbilical mesenchyme (the rostral portion of the cloaca) around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) (Figure 1a, asterisk)3, 4, 5 and subsequently extends caudally along the cloaca reaching the cloacal membrane. Part of the cloacal membrane degrades with the approximation of the URS tip. As a result, the cloaca is divided into the urogenital sinus and rectum, and the tip of the URS (endodermal epithelia) contributes to forming the ectodermal epithelia of the perineum and external genitalia.6 The contribution of these cells and growth factors expressed in the endodermal epithelia are essential for the proper morphogenesis of the perineal region, based on the phenotypes of several mutants. For instance, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in the endodermal epithelia and has an essential role in both URS formation and GT protrusion by affecting neighboring mesenchymal cells.7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Apoptotic cells are observed in the urogenital tract during URS formation, being distributed primarily in the epithelial layers of the URS, cloacal membrane and mesenchyme of the dorsal surface of the caudal hindgut at E11.5 and E11.75.5, 12 From E12.5, apoptotic cells are also observed in the URS mesenchyme and are thought to be involved in the transformation of the URS and disintegration of the cloacal membrane.5 Several congenital anomalies are frequently observed during urogenital organ development. These abnormalities are usually accompanied by deficient excretory and copulatory functions, influencing the quality of life of the patient. In particular, the incidence of anorectal malformations (ARMs) is approximately 1 in 5000 human births;13 however, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of this condition are currently unknown. ARM phenotypes are observed in several diseases, including Currarino syndrome, Townes Brocks syndrome and VACTERL complex.14, 15, 16, 17 Affected patients often display other malformations, such as anal fistulas, sacral malformations and renal malformations. Human and mouse genetic analyses have shed light on the possible genetic causes of some of these abnormalities. Several mouse mutants for hedgehog signaling genes, ephrin-Eph signaling genes, fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling genes and Wnt signaling genes are reported to display ARM phenotypes.18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Another causative factor for the development of ARM is all-trans retinoic acid (RA), a teratogen and active form of vitamin A. RA treatment in pregnant mice results in imperforate anus in embryos.23, 24 Although these reports have identified causative factors for ARM phenotypes, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of ARM and URS remain elusive. The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for embryonic development, and its dysregulation has been implicated in developmental disorders and human diseases. Wnt signaling is transmitted primarily via three divergent pathways: the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, the planner cell polarity pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway.25, 26 \u03b2-Catenin is a key factor for the canonical Wnt pathway and also acts as a subunit of the cadherin protein complex, which controls cell\u2013cell adhesion. Owing to the early lethality of \u03b2-catenin-deficient mice,27 analyses of the function of \u03b2-catenin in organogenesis have been performed using conditional mutants. Previous reports have revealed that \u03b2-catenin induces the differentiation of hair follicles during hair/skin development according to loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF) approaches.28, 29 The ectopic activation of canonical Wnt signaling results in the ectopic induction of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling, which is essential for hair follicle formation.30, 31 With respect to genital tubercle (primordia of external genitalia: GT) development, region-specific (ectodermal, endodermal and mesenchymal) modulation of the \u03b2-catenin gene has revealed essential functions, such as regulation of cell proliferation, epithelial integrity and protrusion/elongation of GT.8, 32, 33 However, the regulatory functions of the \u03b2-catenin gene during the development of the URS have not been investigated. The current study aimed to investigate the function of the \u03b2-catenin gene in URS development. We modulated the \u03b2-catenin activity in the endodermal epithelia and studied the phenotypic consequences of dysregulated endodermal \u03b2-catenin signaling for urorectal development. Both \u03b2-catenin LOF and GOF mutations resulted in ARM phenotypes. The \u03b2-catenin GOF mutation led to the ectopic induction of Bmp signaling. Moreover, the ARM phenotypes in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants were restored by additionally introducing the BmprIA gene mutation. These results suggest that adequately controlled \u03b2-catenin signaling and its downstream growth factor signaling are essential for proper URS formation. We first studied the kinetics of the contribution of URS epithelial cells. We utilized ShhCreERT2 mice, which are knock-in mice of the tamoxifen (TM)-inducible form of Cre recombinase to the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) locus.34 The Shh gene was expressed in the endodermal epithelia at E10.5\u201313.5 (Figures 1a\u2013d). We crossed ICR female mice with ShhCreERT2/+; R26LacZ/LacZ male mice. The pregnant females were subsequently treated with TM at E8.5\u201313.5, and the embryos were analyzed at E15.5 (Figures 1e\u2013j). There were few LacZ-positive cells in the perineal epithelia, urethra and rectum in the embryos upon TM treatment at E8.5 (Figure 1e). In contrast, numerous LacZ-positive cells were observed in the perineal epithelia, urethra and rectum in the embryos with E9.5 or E10.5 treatment (Figures 1f and g, red arrows). We observed a reduced number of LacZ-positive cells in the perineal ectodermal epithelia following later stage TM treatment, such as at E11.5 and E12.5 (Figures 1h and i). Following E13.5 TM treatment, the perineal epithelia were not positive for LacZ signals (Figure 1j). These results indicate that the Shh-positive endodermal epithelia labeled by E9.5\u201310.5 TM treatment can primarily contribute to the perineal epithelium. We then asked whether \u03b2-catenin regulates URS formation. We first analyzed the expression of \u03b2-catenin using immunohistochemistry. The \u03b2-catenin expression was detected in the endoderm, including the URS epithelia, in the wild-type embryos at E11.5 (Figure 1k). We next used the ShhCreERT2 system to either constitutively activate or inhibit the \u03b2-catenin activity in the endodermal epithelia and studied the effects of dysregulated endodermal \u03b2-catenin signaling on URS development. \u03b2-Catenin floxed mutant mice (\u03b2-cateninflox), which contain two loxP sites flanking exons 3\u20136,28 were crossed to ShhCreERT2, and conditional deletion of \u03b2-catenin in the URS epithelia was achieved with TM treatment. ShhCreERT2/+; \u03b2-cateninflox/\u2212 (\u03b2-catenin LOF) mutants were analyzed at E18.5 subsequent to TM treatment at E9.5, E11.5 or E13.5 (Figures 2b\u2013d and b\u2032\u2013d\u2032). The formation of the URS was perturbed by early-stage TM treatment. The mutants treated with TM at E9.5 displayed cleft-like phenotypes in the perineal region (Figures 2b and b\u2032, red arrowheads). In addition, anal stenosis was observed in the E9.5-TM-treated mutants (Figure 2b\u2032). TM treatment at E11.5 resulted in hypospadias-like phenotypes, although no perineal clefts were observed (Figures 2c and c\u2032). The perineal region in the E13.5-TM-treated embryos appeared to be normal (Figures 2d and d\u2032). We further analyzed the differentiation of the perineal epithelial cells in the E9.5-TM-treated mutants. The expression of keratin 1 (a marker of prickle cells) and filaggrin (a marker of granule cells) was analyzed (Figures 3a\u2013e). The perineal epithelia of the wild-type embryos expressed both markers at E18.5 (Figures 3a and d, red arrowheads). The expression of these markers was also observed in the perineal epithelia of the E9.5-TM-treated \u03b2-catenin LOF mutants (Figures 3b and e, blue arrowheads), indicating that the differentiation of the URS epithelial cells in the \u03b2-catenin LOF mutants proceeded normally. Next, a constitutively active \u03b2-cateninflox(ex3) mutant allele was analyzed to determine whether the enhanced \u03b2-catenin activity affects the formation of the URS. The Cre activity derived from the ShhCreERT2 allele regulated by TM treatment at E9.5, E11.5 or E13.5 induced a constitutively active \u03b2-catenin lacking the N-terminal domain phosphorylation sites essential for its degradation (Figures 2e\u2013g and e\u2032\u2013g\u2032). An augmentation of \u03b2-catenin expression and its activity as a component of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in E9.5-TM-treated \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants were assessed by immunohistochemistry and transgenic reporter, respectively (Supplementary Figures S1a\u2013f). Similar to that observed in the \u03b2-catenin LOF mutants, early TM treatment resulted in hypoplasia during URS/perineal formation in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants (Figures 2e, f, e\u2032 and f\u2032, red arrowheads). The URS in the E9.5-TM-treated mutants did not reach to the cloacal membrane, leading to incomplete cloacal division of the urogenital sinus and rectum (Figures 2e and e\u2032). This phenotype was slightly milder in the E11.5-TM-treated mutants and was not observed in the E13.5-TM-treated mutants (Figures 2f, g, f\u2032 and g\u2032). The expression of keratin 1 and filaggrin was also examined in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants (Figures 3c and f). Expression of these markers was not detected in the perineal epithelial region in the E9.5-TM-treated mutants (Figures 3c and f, demarcated by blue squares). These results suggest that the GOF \u03b2-catenin mutation perturbs the cell differentiation of the URS epithelium and that the proper dose of \u03b2-catenin activity in the URS epithelium at early embryonic stages is essential for the formation of the URS. To analyze cellular mechanisms inducing mutant phenotypes, we next performed cell proliferation and death analyses in the E9.5-TM-treated \u03b2-catenin LOF and GOF mutants. The \u03b2-catenin LOF mutants displayed hypoplastic URS and markedly reduced cell proliferation of the URS mesenchyme at E11.5 (Figure 3h). Decreased mesenchymal cell proliferation was also observed at E13.5 using phosphohistone H3 (pHH3) immunostaining (Supplementary Figure S2). However, the cell proliferation of the URS epithelia was comparable with that observed in the controls (Figure 3h). On the other hand, the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants displayed hypertrophy and an increased number of cell proliferation in the URS epithelia at E11.5 (Figure 3i). This hypertrophic layer was confirmed to be derived from endodermal epithelia using labeling with the ShhCreERT2 system (Supplementary Figure S3). As for the mesenchymal cell proliferation in the URS, the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants did not display marked alteration at E11.5 (Figure 3i); however, cell proliferation was decreased at E13.5 (Figure 3k). Moreover, we also analyzed the cell death status to judge whether the apoptotic cells were prominent enough to induce elongation defects of the URS in both mutants. The distribution of apoptotic cells in the URS mesenchyme was not increased in either the \u03b2-catenin LOF or GOF mutants at E11.5 and E13.5 (Figures 4f and h; Supplementary Figure S4). These results suggest that the reduced cell proliferation of the URS mesenchyme observed in both the \u03b2-catenin LOF and GOF mutants possibly contributes to defective URS elongation. Of note, the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants displayed less apoptotic cells in the URS epithelia compared with the controls at E11.5 and E12.5 (Figures 4a, b, f, g, k, l, p and q, red arrows and surrounded by red dotted line). This reduced amount of cell death and increased level of cell proliferation possibly resulted in hypertrophy of the URS epithelia at E11.5 (Figure 3i). Subsequently, at E13.5 and later embryonic stages, augmented apoptotic cells were observed in the hypertrophic URS epithelia of the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants (Figures 4c\u2013e, h\u2013j, m\u2013o and r\u2013t, blue arrows and surrounded by blue dotted line). Such elevated URS epithelial apoptosis may contribute to the lack of differentiation of perineal epithelial cells in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants (Figures 3c and f). Next, we investigated possible causes of the ARM phenotype in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants. Several previous reports have demonstrated the ectopic activation of Bmp signaling in ectodermal \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants.31, 32 We therefore analyzed the expression of several Bmp signaling-related molecules in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants. The expression of the Bmp4 gene was observed in the mesenchyme of the URS in the wild-type embryos at E13.5 (Figure 5a). The Bmp4 gene expression was ectopically observed in the URS epithelia, in addition to the URS mesenchyme, in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants (Figure 5e, red arrowheads). The ectopic expression of Bmp7 was also observed in the URS epithelia (Figures 5b and f, red arrowheads). We also analyzed the downstream molecules of Bmp signaling. One of the downstream genes of Bmp signaling, Msx2, was ectopically expressed in the URS epithelia (Figures 5c and g, red arrowheads). Moreover, the expression of phosphorylated Smad (pSmad)1/5/8 was increased in both the epithelia and mesenchyme of the mutant URS (Figures 5d and h, red arrowheads). To further ascertain the contribution of ectopic Bmp signaling in the abnormal development of the URS in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants, we analyzed the URS development in compound mutants for the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutation and one of the Bmp receptors (BmprIA). Although the compound mutants (ShhCreERT2/+; \u03b2-cateninflox(ex3)/+; BmprIAflox/\u2212) displayed the perineal cleft, URS elongation was substantially reversed in these mutants compared with that observed in the ShhCreERT2/+; \u03b2-cateninflox(ex3)/+ mutants under E9.5-TM administration (Figures 5i\u2013k and k\u2032, blue arrowhead). These results may suggest that the ectopically induced endodermal Bmp signaling by augmented \u03b2-catenin signaling partly contributes to the ARM phenotypes of \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants. ARM is one of the most frequently observed congenital diseases in humans. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of ARM, including the developmental mechanisms of the URS, a key structure for the formation of the urogenital sinus and rectum, have not been elucidated. The current analysis demonstrated perineal clefts and deficient URS elongation phenotypes in both \u03b2-catenin LOF and GOF mutants. In the case of human ARMs, there are several types of symptoms.35 Focusing on the location of the anal opening, the phenotype of \u03b2-catenin LOF mutants may be similar to perineal fistulas, a benign type of ARM. In contrast, the phenotype of \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants may be similar to a severe type of ARM, namely rectourethral bulbar fistulas, abnormal communications or fistulas, between the rectum and urinary tract. These classifications are usually thought to reflect the severity of symptoms, presumably because of the different pathogenic causes. \u03b2-Catenin is expressed in the normal URS epithelia. \u03b2-Catenin LOF mutants displayed decreased cell proliferation in the URS mesenchyme. This is considered to affect directly to the size of the URS. \u03b2-Catenin is essential for inducing the expression of several growth factors in the gut endoderm, including the small intestine.36, 37 Likewise, the \u03b2-catenin expressed in the URS epithelium may affect downstream growth factor signals. The regulation of mesenchymal development is known to occur via the actions of endodermally derived growth factors, such as Shh. It has also been suggested that Shh positively regulates the cell proliferation of URS mesenchymal cells.7 The level of \u03b2-catenin in the endodermal epithelia is reduced in Shh-null mutants, and the Shh expression is reduced in \u03b2-catenin conditional mutants.8 These previous results suggest the possibility of the reduction of downstream growth factor signaling associated with reduced cell proliferation in \u03b2-catenin LOF mutants. The current results suggest that growth factor signaling, including \u03b2-catenin, can regulate URS elongation by affecting URS mesenchymal cell proliferation. On the other hand, the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants also displayed ARM phenotypes. In this study, we focused on the ectopic induction of Bmp signaling in the URS epithelia and mesenchyme and found that the ARM phenotypes of the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants were partly restored by the additional mutation of Bmp signaling. In addition, previous reports have suggested that the ectopic induction of \u03b2-catenin signaling can induce the ectopic Fgf8 expression in the cloacal endoderm.8, 11, 32 These findings may indicate that the ectopic induction of several growth factors perturbs proper URS development. We also observed transiently reduced apoptosis and subsequently increased apoptosis in the URS epithelium in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants. Such continuous cell death may affect the maturation of the URS epithelia and contribute to phenotypic differences between \u03b2-catenin LOF and GOF mutants. In support of these findings, null mutants of the Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1) gene, which is primarily expressed at the apical URS endoderm and cloacal membrane, displayed urorectal defects, and the exogenous addition of Wif1 proteins in an urorectal culture caused cloacal membrane disintegration. Our results demonstrate that spatiotemporally and properly controlled levels of URS epithelial \u03b2-catenin signaling are essential for cloacal septation and that dysregulation of endodermal \u03b2-catenin signaling leads to abnormal downstream growth factor activity. The current results are considered to contribute to the better understanding of the pathogenesis of ARM. The mutant mice used in this study were ShhCreERT2, Rosa26R (R26LacZ), \u03b2-cateninflox, \u03b2-cateninflox(ex3), BmprIAflox, TopGAL and CAG-Cre.28, 34, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42 The genotypes of each strain were determined as reported previously. To obtain ShhCreERT2/+; R26LacZ/+ mice, ShhCreERT2/+; R26LacZ/LacZ male and Jcl:ICR (CLEA Japan, Osaka, Japan) female mice were crossed. The BmprIA-null allele (BmprIA+/\u2212) was generated using BmprIAflox and CAG-Cre driver mice.41 The mouse embryos were processed for X-gal or immunohistochemical staining. Noon of the day on which the vaginal plug appeared was designated as E0.5. All experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the Committees on Animal Research at Wakayama Medical University and Kumamoto University. The mouse embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) with PBS, dehydrated with methanol and embedded in paraffin. Then, 6-\u03bcm serial sections were prepared. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed using standard procedures. X-gal staining was carried out as described previously.43 The X-gal-stained samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned. The immunohistochemical analysis was performed according to standard procedures using anti-\u03b2-catenin antibodies (1\u2009:\u2009100; BD Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) antibodies (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signaling Technology, Tokyo, Japan), anti-keratin 1 antibodies (1\u2009:\u2009200; Covance, Tokyo, Japan), anti-filaggrin antibodies (1\u2009:\u2009300; Covance), anti-pSmad1/5/8 antibodies (1\u2009:\u2009300; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-pHH3 (Ser10) antibodies (1\u2009:\u20091000; Merck Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). Signal amplification was performed using the appropriate VECTASTAIN ABC IgG Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), and the immunocomplexes were detected with DAB staining. For the cell proliferation assays, pregnant females were injected with 100\u2009mg of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich) per kg of body weight. One hour after injection, the embryos were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry with anti-BrdU antibodies (1:300; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). For the cell death analyses, a TUNEL assay was performed with the In situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan). Section in situ hybridization for the gene expression analyses was performed as described previously.44 The antisense riboprobe templates have been described previously: Shh (kindly provided by Dr. C Shukunami, Hiroshima, Japan), Bmp4,45 Bmp7 (kindly provided by Dr. M Yoshida, Kobe, Japan) and Msx2 (kindly provided by Dr. Hill RE, Edinburgh, UK and Dr. I Satokata, Niigata, Japan). The TM-inducible Cre recombinase system removes the floxed sequence from the target genome.46, 47, 48 A 10\u2009mg/ml stock solution of TM (T-5648; Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in sesame oil.8 The pregnant females received 0.1\u2009mg of TM per g of maternal body weight intraperitoneally at the indicated time points. No overt teratological effects were observed under these conditions.8, 43, 49"}, "27172902": {"pmid": "27172902", "pmcid": "PMC5085117", "title": "Cisplatin induces tolerogenic dendritic cells in response to TLR agonists via the abundant production of IL-10, thereby promoting Th2- and Tr1-biased T-cell immunity\n", "abstract": "\nAlthough many advantageous roles of cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II), CDDP) have been reported in cancer therapy, the immunomodulatory roles of cisplatin in the phenotypic and functional alterations of dendritic cells (DCs) are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of cisplatin on the functionality of DCs and the changes in signaling pathways activated upon toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Cisplatin-treated DCs down-regulated the expression of cell surface molecules (CD80, CD86, MHC class I and II) and up-regulated endocytic capacity in a dose-dependent manner. Upon stimulation with various TLR agonists, cisplatin-treated DCs showed markedly increased IL-10 production through activation of the p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways without altering the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12p70, indicating the cisplatin-mediated induction of tolerogenic DCs. This effect was dependent on the production of IL-10 from DCs, as neither DCs isolated from IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice nor IL-10-neutralized DCs generated tolerogenic DCs. Interestingly, DCs that were co-treated with cisplatin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibited a decreased immunostimulatory capacity for inducing the proliferation of Th1- and Th17-type T cells; instead, these DCs contributed to Th2-type T cell immunity. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed a unique T cell population, IL-10-producing CD3+CD4+LAG-3+CD49b+CD25\u2212Foxp3\u2212 Tr1 cells, that was significantly increased without altering the Foxp3+ regulatory T cell population. Taken together, our results suggest that cisplatin induces immune-suppressive tolerogenic DCs in TLR agonist-induced inflammatory conditions via abundant IL-10 production, thereby skewing Th cell differentiation towards Th2 and Tr1 cells. This relationship may provide cancer cells with an opportunity to evade the immune system.\n", "fulltext": "Cisplatin (cis-DDP, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)), a platinum-based anti-tumor drug, is one of the most commonly used metal-containing compounds in medicine [1\u20133]. Cisplatin and its analogues (i.e., carboplatin and oxaliplatin) are among the most potent chemotherapy drugs used for cancer treatment [1, 3]. The discovery of cisplatin as an anti-cancer drug in the 1960s by Rosenberg and colleagues ushered in a new paradigm in cancer treatment [3, 4]. Cisplatin is thought to damage rapidly growing tumor cells via the induction of apoptosis following the inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G1, S, or G2-M phase [1, 5, 6]. Cisplatin has clinical benefits for several types of solid tumors. However, cisplatin treatment is frequently accompanied by toxic side effects and tumor resistance, which in turn leads to secondary malignancies [1\u20133]. In recent years, medical research has focused on elucidating the mechanisms underlying cancer drugs. The development of new techniques to identify perturbations in cellular functions has increased knowledge of the molecular, physiological and pathological mechanisms of cancer drugs. In particular, emerging evidence has revealed the complex interplay that exists between the host immune system and many anti-cancer drugs. However, little information is available regarding how cisplatin interacts with immune cells. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which cisplatin induces and suppresses immunological responses is needed to develop and optimize new therapeutic strategies using cisplatin. In particular, cisplatin has been shown to induce immunosuppressive effects through the inhibition of T cell activity [7, 8]. However, little is known about how cisplatin suppresses innate and adaptive immunity. Immunological interventions for tumor therapy have focused on two aspects: 1) immune cell-based tumor therapy such as dendritic cell (DC)-based tumor immunotherapy, and 2) immune checkpoint inhibition such as blocking PD-1/PD-L1. Although these two approaches differ, both enhance tumor-targeted Th1-type T cell immunity by harnessing immunological power or by overcoming tolerance and suppression [9\u201312]. In this regard, DCs are the most potent cell type involved in both strategies. In fact, DCs are the most important cell population for activating anti-tumor T cell responses. However, tumors can also directly or indirectly induce DCs to both functionally and phenotypically favor the tumor environment [12\u201314]. DC activation leads to a cascade of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine production, migration to secondary lymphoid tissues, and priming of na\u00efve T cells. Therefore, these cells regulate immune homeostasis and the balance between tolerance and immunity [12, 13]. Most importantly, DCs play a critical role in regulating CD4 and CD8 T cell immunity by controlling Th1, Th2, and Th17 commitment; generating inducible Tregs; and mediating tolerance or immunostimulation [12, 13, 15]. It is believed that distinct DC subsets have evolved to control these different immune outcomes. However, how these DC subsets mount different responses to inflammatory and/or tolerogenic signals to accomplish their divergent functions remains unclear. The effects of anti-cancer drugs on the immune system remain controversial. However, select chemotherapeutic agents primarily suppress DCs, and the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs on DC function requires further investigation in various inflammatory settings. In this context, we characterized the effect of cisplatin on the function of DCs, which play crucial roles in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. This study describes for the first time the key mechanisms involved in the switch to a tolerogenic DC phenotype that is induced by cisplatin following toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist activation of inflammation and the resulting consequences on T cell polarization. Cisplatin at concentrations \u2265 25 \u03bcM or \u226510 \u03bcg/ml induces cell death of cancer cell lines and primary cultured cells, such as macrophages, via DNA fragmentation [16, 17]. Prior to conducting the current study, the viability of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) exposed to cisplatin was investigated to determine a cisplatin concentration that does not cause cell death and could therefore be used in subsequent experiments. As expected, a cisplatin concentration over 10 \u03bcg/ml showed a cytotoxic effect on BMDCs when measured by MTT assay (Supplementary Figure S1A). Therefore, cisplatin concentrations \u2264 10 \u03bcg/ml were used for subsequent experiments, as these concentrations did not reduce cell viability. In addition, no significant decrease in DC viability following co-treatment with 10 \u03bcg/ml of cisplatin and 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was observed by MTT assay (Supplementary Figure S1B) or Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Supplementary Figure S1C). This finding suggests that cisplatin is not cytotoxic to DCs when used at concentrations below 10 \u03bcg/ml. Therefore, concentrations of 1 and/or 5 \u03bcg/ml of cisplatin were used for further investigation. Elevated expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 as well as MHC class I and II following TLR agonist stimulation is a key feature of mature DCs. However, the immunological actions of cisplatin, especially on DC maturation and function, remain unknown. We therefore investigated whether treatment with cisplatin resulted in phenotypic alteration in DCs upon stimulation with LPS. To accomplish this, CD11c+ DCs were identified using the gating strategy shown in Figure 1A. The DCs were cultured for 8 days in OptiMEM supplemented with GM-CSF under standard conditions and then treated with LPS (100 ng/ml), cisplatin (5 \u03bcg/mL), or LPS (100 ng/mL) and cisplatin (1, 2, and 5 \u03bcg/mL) for one day. The cisplatin treatment significantly decreased the LPS-induced expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 and MHC class I and II in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that cisplatin can alter the DC maturation phenotype. However, the DCs that were treated with cisplatin alone did not show any increases or decreases in these markers (Figure 1B). Importantly, the DCs that were co-treated with cisplatin (5 \u03bcg/mL) and LPS (100 ng/mL) showed significant reductions in the levels of the above surface molecules in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S2A). The above findings suggest that cisplatin is involved in phenotypic alteration during TLR agonist-induced DC maturation. Thus, we hypothesized that cisplatin influences DC function by regulating cytokine production. To validate this hypothesis, we analyzed cytokine production in cisplatin-treated DCs following stimulation with various TLR ligands, including Pam3-CSK (TLR2), polyI:C (TLR3), LPS (TLR4), IMQ (TLR7), and ODN (TLR9). Surprisingly, for all of the tested TLR agonists, cisplatin dramatically increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in activated DCs. Furthermore, none of the tested TLR agonists inhibited or increased the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S3). These results indicate that cisplatin conditions DCs to produce a high amount of IL-10, independent of the specific TLR pathway being activated. Next, we confirmed that cisplatin strongly induced intracellular IL-10 production in LPS-activated DCs. We found that DCs co-treated with cisplatin and LPS exhibited a significantly higher percentage of IL-10-positive cells and that this percentage increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no changes were observed in the numbers of TNF-\u03b1-positive or IL-12p70-positive cells (Figure 2B). Additionally, the co-treated DCs showed increased production of IL-10 in a time-dependent manner, whereas no changes were observed in the production of TNF-\u03b1 or IL-12p70 (Supplementary Figure S2B). A decrease in endocytosis is a hallmark of mature DCs, whereas tolerogenic DCs maintain higher endocytic ability. To evaluate whether the antigen uptake ability of LPS-activated DCs is increased or decreased by cisplatin treatment, DCs were activated by LPS in the absence or presence of cisplatin and then assessed for their ability to uptake antigens by endocytosis using FITC-conjugated dextran. A significantly lower percentage of FITC-positive DCs were observed among the LPS-stimulated DCs, while the cisplatin and LPS co-treatment enhanced the endocytic activity of DCs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C). These results, together with the reduction of mature DC surface markers and the remarkable enhancement in IL-10 production, strongly suggest that cisplatin endows DCs with a tolerogenic property upon TLR stimulation. Activation of the MAPK, cyclooxegenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and NF-\u03baB signaling cascades increases IL-10 secretion in DCs [20, 21]. To examine whether these pathways are involved in increased IL-10 production following treatment with cisplatin, the expression and phosphorylation levels of MAPKs, including p38, ERK, and JNK; the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1; and the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 were investigated by Western blot analysis (Figure 3). In DCs co-treated with cisplatin and LPS, rapid and prolonged p38 phosphorylation and slightly activated JNK phosphorylation was observed compared to DCs treated with LPS alone. Furthermore, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was decreased in the co-treated DCs compared to the DCs treated with LPS alone (Figure 3A). Importantly, treatment with cisplatin alone had no effect on MAPK expression and phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S4A). Additionally, COX-2 activation and PGE-2 expression were not changed by cisplatin treatment (Supplementary Figure S4B). Cisplatin induced the phosphorylation and degradation of IkB-\u03b1 and the nuclear translocation of p65 from the cytosol (Figure 3B and 3C). To confirm the involvement of p38, JNK, and NF-\u03baB in the above phenotypes, we next treated cells with specific pharmacological inhibitors (SB203580 for p38, SP600125 for JNK, and Bay11-7082 for NF-\u03baB) and cisplatin and then evaluated IL-10 production following the cisplatin treatment. These pharmacological inhibitors, particularly the p38 inhibitor, significantly abrogated cisplatin-induced IL-10 production in LPS-activated DCs (Figure 3D), suggesting that the p38 and NF-kB signaling cascades are the main pathways responsible for the cisplatin-induced production of IL-10 in LPS-activated DCs. IL-10 induces the maturation and phenotypic alteration of DCs towards a tolerogenic state [22, 23]. Thus, we hypothesized that if cisplatin-induced increases in IL-10 production cause LPS-activated DCs to adopt a tolerogenic phenotype, the absence of IL-10 should restore an activated DC phenotype even in the presence of cisplatin. To investigate whether the IL-10 increase stimulated by cisplatin induces DC phenotypic and functional changes, DCs isolated from IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice were treated with cisplatin, LPS or a combination of cisplatin and LPS (Figure 4). The IL-10\u2212/\u2212 DCs displayed the LPS-activated DC phenotype, including elevated levels of surface molecules (Figure 4A) and reduced endocytic activity (Figure 4C). However, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12p70) and decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were observed in the IL-10\u2212/\u2212 DCs compared to WT DCs following co-treatment with LPS and cisplatin (Figure 4B). We further confirmed that IL-10 induces LPS-activated DCs to become tolerogenic following cisplatin treatment through experiments in which we blocked the IL-10 cascade with an anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Figure 5). Incubation of the co-treated DCs with an anti-IL-10 mAb, but not with control rat IgG, for 18 h restored their surface molecule expression levels (Figure 5A) and IL-12p70 production (Figure 5B) and decreased their endocytic activity (Figure 5C). Collectively, these results indicate that the cisplatin-induced tolerogenic DC phenotype requires IL-10. Cisplatin treatment in LPS-activated DCs induced them to adopt a tolerogenic phenotype. Thus, we hypothesized that cisplatin treatment in LPS-activated DCs may reduce Th1 cell proliferation and alter T cell polarization. To precisely characterize the role of cisplatin in DC and T cell interactions, we performed a T cell proliferation assay for antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using OT-I T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic CD8+ T cells and OT-II TCR transgenic CD4+ T cells (Figure 6). LPS-treated or untreated DCs in the presence or absence of cisplatin were incubated with OVA257-264 or OVA323-339 peptides, and CFSE-labeled CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were co-cultured. As shown in Figure 6A, the cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs reduced the proliferation of both na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to the LPS-treated DCs. Furthermore, na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells primed with cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs produced significantly lower levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A and IL-2 than those primed with LPS-activated DCs in a cisplatin dose-dependent manner (Figure 6B). These results were confirmed by intracellular staining (Figure 6C). Interestingly, IL-4, which is mainly produced by Th2-polarized T cells, was highly produced in CD4+ T cells primed with cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs compared to those co-cultured with LPS-treated DCs in a cisplatin dose-dependent manner (Figure 6B and 6C). We then investigated the differentiation and polarization of CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells, Th2 cells, Th17 cells, regulatory T cells (Treg) and T regulatory type 1 cells (Tr1) after priming with LPS-activated DCs in the presence or absence of cisplatin by analyzing transcription factor expression levels. Cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs induced Th2 type cells (CD3+CD4+GATA-3+) and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells (CD3+CD4+CD25\u2212CD49b+LAG-3+Foxp3\u2212IL-10+) but decreased the numbers of Th1 (CD3+CD4+T-bet+), Th17 (CD3+CD4+RoR\u03b3t+) and Treg cells (CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127\u2212Foxp3+) (Figure 6D and 6E). Additionally, cisplatin treatment produced the same proliferation and differentiation pattern for allogeneic T cells (Supplementary Figure S6). These results suggest that cisplatin induces the differentiation of Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells and decreases the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to LPS-activated DCs. IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs potently induce the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells towards Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells [22, 24]. In the same context as the results shown in Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S6, we hypothesized that if IL-10 is a primary factor for inducing tolerogenic DCs and consequently polarizes CD4+ T cells towards Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, the absence of IL-10 in DCs may prime the differentiation of CD4+ T cells towards Th1 and Th17 cells. Thus, we evaluated the capacity of IL-10\u2212/\u2212 DCs to induce T cell proliferation, differentiation, and polarization using the same experimental conditions described in Figure 6 (results shown in Figure 7). IL-10\u2212/\u2014derived DCs co-treated with cisplatin and LPS induced the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 7A) and polarized na\u00efve CD4+ T cells towards Th1 and Th17 cells instead of Th2 and Tr1 cells (Figure 7B) compared with DCs derived from wild-type (WT) mice. Finally, we confirmed that IL-10-producing Tr1-type T cells were not induced by IL-10\u2212/\u2014derived DCs in the presence of cisplatin (Figure 7C). Collectively, these results indicate that cisplatin functionally and phenotypically induces DCs towards an IL-10-producing tolerogenic phenotype upon TLR stimulation. These tolerogenic DCs consequently contribute to the development of Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, suggesting that IL-10 is a primary factor responsible for these cascades. Based on the above in vitro results, we next examined whether cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs could suppress Th1-cell proliferation and induce the differentiation of Th2 and Tr1 cells in vivo (Figure 8 and Figure 9). Briefly, Ly5.1+ OT-I and OT-II T cells were transferred to Ly5.2+ recipient mice. The mice were intravenously injected with OVA protein-pulsed, LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs or OVA protein-pulsed, LPS-activated DCs one day after the T cell transfer. At 5 and 7 days after the DC injections, we evaluated the frequencies and types of Ly5.1+ T cells induced by the LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs (Figure 8 and Figure 9) using flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 8, significantly reduced frequencies of Ly5.1+CD44+CD4+ cells and Ly5.1+CD44+CD8+ cells were found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) (Figure 8A and 8B) and splenocyte (Figure 8C) populations isolated from the LPS/cisplatin-primed DC group compared to the LPS-activated DC group. Importantly, the spleen cells isolated from the LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs group showed significantly reduced frequencies of Th1-type cells (IFN-\u03b3-producing Ly5.1+CD4+ T cells) and IFN-\u03b3-producing Ly5.1+CD8+ T cells compared with the LPS-primed DCs group in response to stimulation with OVA peptides (Figure 9A). Additionally, the LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs group showed significant induction of Th2-type cells (IL-4-producing Ly5.1+CD4+ T cells) and Tr1 cells (IL-10-producing Ly5.1+CD25\u2212Foxp3\u2212CD4+ T cells) (Figure 9A and 9B). Culture supernatants containing secreted cytokines were collected from the splenocytes following stimulation with OVA peptides and analyzed by ELISA. The results showed that the LPS/cisplatin-primed DCs group robustly secreted both Th2-related cytokines and Tr1-related cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, whereas they secreted significantly low levels of Th1-related (IFN-\u03b3) and Th17-related (IL-17A) cytokines (Figure 9C). These results indicate that cisplatin-treated DCs have in vivo tolerogenic activity by inducing the differentiation of Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells and decreasing the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Although cisplatin is a common treatment for a broad spectrum of cancers, few studies have evaluated the effect of cisplatin treatment on the immune system. In the present study, we described the molecular mechanisms that are required for the immunosuppressive effect of cisplatin, including the phenotypic alteration of DCs and their interactions with T cells, thereby improving our understanding of the immunological aspects of this cancer chemotherapy. Cisplatin induced IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs upon TLR agonist treatment by activating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and these cisplatin-induced tolerogenic DCs promoted the generation of two distinct T cell subsets in vivo as well as in vitro: Th2-type T-cells and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells. Several cancer drugs are also used as immunosuppressants for the treatment of severe systemic autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, cisplatin has shown therapeutic potential for treating inflammation-mediated diseases under different pathophysiological conditions [25, 26]. For example, cisplatin was shown to ameliorate the symptoms of excessive inflammation-mediated diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), in vivo. EAE is a prototypic Th1-mediated autoimmune inflammatory disease, and Th17 cells are assumed to be crucial effector cells that drive central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and damage [25, 27]. In addition, low-dose cisplatin administration in a murine cecal ligation and puncture-induced polymicrobial sepsis model was found to attenuate inflammation and lethality. Thus, cisplatin might be considered a candidate drug for the control of inflammatory and autoimmune processes. However, it remains unclear how cisplatin ameliorates excessive inflammation. Our findings help explain the immunomodulatory activities of cisplatin observed in these disease models. The nature of DCs determines the quality of T cell responses and the establishment of either immunity or tolerance. In a previous study, Dijkgraaf et al. showed that cisplatin treatment increased the PGE2-secreting potency of tumor cells to promote monocyte differentiation into IL-10-producing M2 macrophages. These authors proposed a chemotherapy-induced increase in tumor-promoting M2 macrophages may provide an indirect mechanism for chemoresistance and that concomitant therapy with COX inhibitors might enhance the anti-tumor effect of cisplatin. Similarly, our data showed that cisplatin directly skewed the phenotype and function of DCs towards IL-10-producing-tolerogenic DCs upon TLR ligand stimulation (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S3). However, the COX-2-PGE2 pathway did not induce tolerogenic DCs and IL-10 production in our study (Supplementary Figure S4). In addition, MyD88 or TRIF deficiency abrogated IL-10 production in cisplatin and LPS co-treated DCs, indicating that TLR signaling is a prerequisite for the generation of IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs (Supplementary Figure S5). Although it remains debatable whether the clinical success of cisplatin relies primarily on its ability to trigger apoptosis, cisplatin induces cell death mainly via apoptosis and eventually secondary necrosis, and endogenous TLR ligands are released during cell death. Along with the recognition of microbial TLR ligands called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), an increasing number of endogenous TLR stimulators have been reported. These endogenous molecules activate TLR signaling and are involved in many pathological processes. For example, HMGB1 and heat shock proteins are either passively released from injured/inflamed tissues and dying cells or actively secreted by activated cells under pathological conditions. Furthermore, even apoptotic cells may release these endogenous TLR ligands. In addition, a single endogenous molecule, such as HMGB1, has the potential to interact with several TLRs. Thus, these endogenous TLR ligands may participate in tumor progression. In addition, evidence indicates that dying tumor cells release endogenous TLR ligands [30\u201332]. In fact, HMGB1 released following chemotherapy-induced cell death activates DCs via the TLR4-MyD88 axis, which leads to the induction of anti-tumor T-cell immunity. IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs are potent inducers of na\u00efve T cell differentiation towards Th2 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells. During sterile inflammation caused by the exposure of normal cells to anti-cancer drugs, an enormous number of cells undergo apoptosis and/or necrosis in different organs and tissues. These dying cells release endogenous ligands, such as intracellular proteins and nucleic acids, which can bind to pattern recognition receptors, particularly those on tissue-resident innate immune cells such as DCs. In response to activation signals, these cells can inhibit tissue damage by producing anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10. However, because the large amounts of IL-10 that are present in the tumor microenvironment play a major role in suppressing the anti-tumor immune response, strategies to break tolerance by neutralizing the function of IL-10 are important for tumor treatment. In a recent study, renal DCs attenuated cisplatin-induced kidney inflammation by producing a high level of IL-10 in response to cisplatin treatment. In addition, in vivo cisplatin treatment directly caused a 10-fold increase of IL-10 production in renal DCs, but not in whole kidneys, indicating that DCs are the major source of IL-10 after cisplatin treatment. However, little is known about the signaling pathways through which cisplatin triggers the generation of tolerogenic DCs after encountering inflammatory environments and their roles in preserving the tolerogenic properties of DCs. Our current study is the first to perform a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the induction of tolerogenic DCs by cisplatin in the inflammatory environment. We found that a large amount of IL-10 was produced after cisplatin treatment and that this production was stimulated through the MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways (Figure 3). Without an IL-10 signal, cisplatin-treated DCs did not differentiate into tolerogenic DCs, indicating that induction of tolerogenic DCs by cisplatin requires IL-10 production (Figure 4 and Figure 5). There are several studies showing that p38 MAPK activation in immunosuppressive CD25\u2212 regulatory T cells and tolerogenic DCs [39, 40] is a central pathway to induce IL-10 production. Our finding that cisplatin activates p38 MAPK may explain why cisplatin treatment leads to the generation of IL-10-producing tolerogenic DCs. Moreover, the inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling in DCs has been suggested as a way to break immunological tolerance and redirect T cell responses to enhance anti-tumor immunity. The importance of IL-10 production by DCs in the induction of tolerance has been demonstrated, as DCs genetically modified to express IL-10 exhibit suppressive effects in models of alloreactivity and autoimmunity [41, 42]. Jarnicki et al. further demonstrated that the inhibition of p38 MAPK-dependent IL-10 secretion by DCs led to stronger Th1 responses and reduced Tr1 induction, indicating that the immune tolerance that is induced by cisplatin can be overcome by inhibiting p38 signaling in DCs. Thus, p38 is an important therapeutic target and provides a mechanism to enhance the efficacy of TLR agonists as vaccine adjuvants together with anti-cancer drugs. One provocative finding of our study was the induction of IL-10-producing CD3+CD4+LAG-3+CD49b+CD25\u2212Foxp3\u2212 Tr1 cells by cisplatin/LPS-primed DCs both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 6, Figure 8, Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure S6). Tr1 cells are induced in the periphery and play a pivotal role in promoting and maintaining tolerance. IL-10-secreting Tr1 cells were first defined by their specific cytokine production profile, which includes the secretion of high levels of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), and by their ability to suppress antigen-specific effector T cell responses via a cytokine-dependent mechanism. In other words, the induction of IL-10-secreting T-cell populations with regulatory activity is IL-10 dependent. In contrast to the naturally occurring Tregs that emerge directly from the thymus, Tr1 cells are induced by antigen stimulation via an IL-10-dependent process in vitro and in vivo. Thus, specialized IL-10-producing DCs may play a key role in this process. However, we cannot completely exclude the secondary effect of IL-10 produced from T cells in accelerating the differentiation of Tr1 cells, indicating that further study of the induction of Tr1 differentiation via interactions between IL-10-producing DCs and IL-10-producing T cells is required. Many studies have suggested that chemotherapy resistance is associated with a strong immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment, and our data suggest a possible underlying mechanism for systemic tumor progression in cases of relapse after chemotherapy. Although current treatment protocols, including surgery and chemotherapy, can achieve local control of a tumor, patients who relapse after long-term cisplatin treatment may develop systemic disease due to the cisplatin-induced generation of tolerogenic DCs, which limit the Th1 immune response. In summary, we demonstrated that cisplatin reprograms TLR agonist-induced activation of DCs via p38 MAPK-induced IL-10 production to generate tolerogenic DCs, which in turn promote the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells into IL-10-producing Tr1 cells. A better understanding of the different effects of cisplatin on immune cells compared to cancer cells may lead to the design of more successful anti-tumor drugs and may also provide new therapeutic strategies based on cisplatin-induced immunological modulation.

The cells were fixed and permeabilized with a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences or eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, anti-IL-12p70, anti-IL-10, anti-TNF-\u03b1, anti-IFN-\u03b3, anti-IL-4, anti-IL-17A, anti-T-bet, anti-GATA-3 and anti-RoR\u03b3t mAbs were stained with fluorescein-conjugated secondary Abs in a permeation buffer. BMDCs were equilibrated at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C for 45 min and then pulsed with fluorescein-conjugated dextran (40,000 Da) from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. After several washes with cold phosphate-buffered solution, the cells were stained with a PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD11c mAb and then measured with a FACS LSRII to reveal antigen uptake. Nonspecific binding of dextran to DCs was determined by incubating DCs with FITC-conjugated dextran at 4\u00b0C, and the resulting background value was subtracted from the specific binding values. After stimulation with LPS, cisplatin, or LPS and cisplatin, DCs were lysed in 100 \u03bcl lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X100, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 30 mM Na4PO7, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM pervanadate. Whole-cell lysate samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for 1 h at 60 V. The membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk and incubated with primary Abs for 2 h, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary Abs for 1 h at room temperature. Target protein epitopes were labeled with primary Abs against total MAPKs and I\u03baB-\u03b1 (1:1,000 diluted in blocking solution) and polyclonal Abs against p-ERK 1/2, p-JNK 1/2, p-p38, p-I\u03baB-\u03b1 and p65 (1:5,000, 1:2,000, 1:5,000, 1:2,000 and 1:3,000 dilutions, respectively), and the results were visualized using an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection kit (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, U.K.). BMDCs were treated with 150 \u03bcl lysis buffer [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM KCL, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM PMSF] on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 3 min, the pellet was resuspended in 100 \u03bcl extraction buffer [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF] and incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant containing nuclear extracts was collected. All pharmacological inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem; reconstituted in sterile, cell-culture grade DMSO; and used at the following concentrations: SP600125 (1, 5 and 10 \u03bcM), SB203580 (1, 5 and 10 \u03bcM) and Bay-117082 (5, 10 and 20 \u03bcM). A 0.1% DMSO solution was used as the vehicle control. For the experiments with inhibitors, cells were treated with pharmacological inhibitors for 1 h prior to treatment with a combination of LPS and cisplatin for 18 h. T cell proliferation and differentiation were assayed in vitro and in vivo using a modified previously described protocol [45, 46]. Responder T cells, which participate in naive T cell reactions, were isolated using a MACS column from total mononuclear cells prepared from OT-I, OT-II and naive BALB/c mice. For the in vitro experiment, OVA-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, both responders, were obtained from the splenocytes of OT-I and OT-II mice, respectively. These T cells were stained with 1 \u03bcM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Invitrogen). DCs (2\u00d7105 cells/well) treated with OVA peptide in the presence of LPS (100 ng/ml), cisplatin or a combination of LPS and cisplatin for 18 h were co-cultured with CFSE-stained CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (2\u00d7106) at a DC:T-cell ratio of 1:10. Naive BALB/c (allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)) T cells (2\u00d7106) were co-cultured with DCs (2\u00d7105 cells/well) treated with LPS, cisplatin or LPS and cisplatin. On day 3 or day 4 of co-culture, T cells were stained using an intracellular staining method. Culture supernatants were harvested, and IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-17A levels were measured by ELISA. For the in vivo experiment, Ly5.1+ OT-I and OT-II T cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells per population) were transferred intravenously into the lateral tail veins of Ly5.2+ recipient mice. The next day, BMDCs from Ly5.2+ recipient mice were pulsed with ovalbumin protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 2 h, and then the cells were washed with wash buffer (RPMI 1640 plus 2% FBS). After washing twice with wash buffer, the DCs were stimulated by LPS with or without cisplatin for 18 h. These DCs (5 \u00d7 106 cells) were transferred intravenously into the lateral tail veins of Ly5.2+ recipient mice. At day 5 and day 7 after the DC transfer, PBMCs were isolated from blood samples collected from each mouse, as previously described. To analyze the populations of Ly5.1+ OT-I and OT-II T cells, single-cell suspensions of PBMCs and splenocytes from each mouse were stained with anti-CD4, anti-CD8\u03b1, anti-CD44, and anti-Ly5.1 mAbs. Dead cells were excluded using a Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stain kit (Invitrogen). Data were collected on a FACS Canto II (BD) and a FACSverse (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). Additionally, single-cell suspensions prepared from the spleens of each group were stimulated with OVA257-264 (0.2 \u03bcg/ml) and OVA323-339 (5 \u03bcg/ml) for 12 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of GolgiPlug 7 days after DC transfer. At 12 h after stimulation, the types and populations of T cells (Ly5.1+ T cells) present were analyzed by intercellular staining and flow cytometry. Supernatants were harvested, and IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-17A and IL-10 levels were measured by ELISA. Significant differences between samples were determined with Tukey's multiple comparison test and unpaired t-tests using statistical software (GraphPad Prism Software, version 5; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The data in the graphs are expressed as the means. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 were considered statistically significant."}, "28747658": {"pmid": "28747658", "pmcid": "PMC5529431", "title": "A single amino acid substitution confers B-cell clonogenic activity to the HIV-1 matrix protein p17", "abstract": "\nRecent data highlight the presence, in HIV-1-seropositive patients with lymphoma, of p17 variants (vp17s) endowed with B-cell clonogenicity, suggesting a role of vp17s in lymphomagenesis. We investigated the mechanisms responsible for the functional disparity on B cells between a wild-type p17 (refp17) and a vp17 named S75X. Here, we show that a single Arginine (R) to Glycine (G) mutation at position 76 in the refp17 backbone (p17R76G), as in the S75X variant, is per se sufficient to confer a B-cell clonogenic potential to the viral protein and modulate, through activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, different molecules involved in apoptosis inhibition (CASP-9, CASP-7, DFF-45, NPM, YWHAZ, Src, PAX2, MAPK8), cell cycle promotion and cancer progression (CDK1, CDK2, CDK8, CHEK1, CHEK2, GSK-3 beta, NPM, PAK1, PP2C-alpha). Moreover, the only R to G mutation at position 76 was found to strongly impact on protein folding and oligomerization by altering the hydrogen bond network. This generates a conformational shift in the p17 R76G mutant which enables a functional epitope(s), masked in refp17, to elicit B-cell growth-promoting signals after its interaction with a still unknown receptor(s). Our findings offer new opportunities to understand the molecular mechanisms accounting for the B-cell growth-promoting activity of vp17s.\n", "fulltext": "HIV-1-associated lymphomas have not decreased after the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) represents the most common type of cancer1, 2 and the most frequent cause of death3, 4 in HIV-1-infected (HIV+) individuals. The HIV-1 genome is not integrated in the malignant B cells as seen for the oncogenic retrovirus HTLV-1. For this reason, the most shared assumptions rely on the indirect role of HIV-1 in lymphomagenesis. HIV-1-driven immune dysfunction with overproduction of B-cell stimulatory cytokines5 or loss of immune control, that promotes the reactivation of potentially oncogenic herpesviruses6, 7, are the most credited hypotheses up to date. However, novel findings support the possibility that HIV-1 may directly contribute to lymphomagenesis through mechanisms involving the biologic effects mediated by its gene products. The HIV-1 matrix protein p17 (p17) is a 132 amino acid (aa)-long structural protein, composed of five major \u03b1-helixes and a highly basic platform consisting of three \u03b2 strands8, 9. Four helixes are centrally organized to form a compact globular domain and a fifth helix (H5) in the COOH-terminus is slightly destabilized, due to the flexible C-terminal tail10, 11. The matrix protein is continuously released in the extracellular space from HIV-1-infected cells12. It has been detected in the plasma13 and in tissue specimens, such as brain14, liver15, bone marrow16 and lymph nodes of HIV+ patients17. In lymph nodes p17 accumulates and persists even during cART and in the absence of any HIV-1 replicative activity17, thus suggesting that it may be persistently expressed in the tissue microenvironment, even during pharmacological therapy, and promote chronic B-cell stimulation18, 19. Latest data show that p17 expression in mice transgenic for a defective HIV-1 provirus is associated with lymphoma development20, 21. Moreover, p17 variants (vp17s), characterized by scattered mutation along the entire protein sequence22 or by specific aa insertions in the C-terminal region, display a potent B-cell growth-promoting activity triggering the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway22, 23, which is known to be crucial in lymphoma development24. Therefore, specific mutations within refp17 could induce a different pathogenetic potential to the viral protein. All these findings call for defining the structure-function relationship in clonogenic vp17s as compared to their wild-type counterpart. In this study, we investigated the aa substitutions, the structural bases and the molecular mechanisms responsible for opposite effects in modulating B-cell growth between a vp17 derived from a Ugandan HIV-1 strain (subtype A1), named S75X22, and the wild type p17 (reference p17, refp17; from clone BH10 of the clade B isolate). Here, we demonstrate that a single arginine (R) to glycine (G) mutation at position 76 in the refp17 backbone, as in S75X, is sufficient to induce dramatic changes in protein folding and stability, making p17 mutant capable of activating Akt and promoting B-cell proliferation. We performed in silico studies to elucidate if aa mutations in S75X were responsible for changes in folding and stability of the viral protein as compared to refp17. Since mutated residues in S75X (Fig.\u00a01A) are donors and acceptors of hydrogen bonds, we first performed long Molecular Dynamics simulation (MD) (500\u2009ns) of refp17 to evaluate its hydrogen bond network. Side chains of mutated residues in S75X and involved in hydrogen bonds are shown in Fig.\u00a01B. In order to identify key residues involved in interaction network, we evaluated hydrogen bonds during the entire refp17 MD and set the threshold of essential hydrogen bonds in the frames of all the trajectory to 75%25. The identified hydrogen bonds were E73-R76 (88%), N80-T84 (83%) and R58-E107 (81%) and the identification of E73-R76 as the most frequent hydrogen bond suggested us to further investigate its role in protein structure. In S75X the residue R76 results mutated in a G and this aa substitution leads to the loss of the E73-R76 hydrogen bond. Therefore, in order to investigate the role of this hydrogen bond in the stability and folding of the matrix protein, we modeled S75X and p17R76G, a p17 mutant with R76 replaced by a G, and performed long MD (500\u2009ns). The stability of refp17, S75X and p17R76G was defined on the basis of these conditions along the dynamics: the total energy less than \u221240000\u2009kcal/mol, RMSD of the structure in a range of 1 Angstrom around the centre of oscillations, the formation of hydrogen bonds, and the size of nonpolar surface area. Refp17 showed a higher stability than S75X and p17R76G, exhibiting a higher average number of hydrogen bonds (58 versus 48.5 and 55, respectively) and lower nonpolar surface areas (31.3% versus 33, 87% and 34, 23%, respectively). In addition, the MD frames of p17s were clustered (% of the frames): two clusters (42% and 43%) in refp17, five clusters (29%, 26%, 15%, 9% and 7%) in the S75X and three clusters (25%, 23% and 22%) in p17R76G were obtained. The dispersion indices were 12.39, 31.65 and 20.00 for refp17, S75X and p17R76G, respectively. All these results suggest that S75X and p17R76G are less structured as compared to refp17. In addition, using the DSSP software and calculating the average of helix propensities of each aa along the trajectory, we assessed whether mutations in S75X and p17R76G induce any changes in secondary structure26. Interestingly, S75X and p17R76G showed a disorganization in the N-terminal region of H3 and H4, and in the C-terminal region of H3 (Fig.\u00a02). This was not observed in refp17, whose helices of globular domain were stable during simulation. A greater stability of H5 is observed in S75X and p17R76G as compared to refp17 (Fig.\u00a02). The stability of H5 in S75X is due to the formation of the new hydrogen bond R91-E106 and in p17R76G of the R58-Q108 and Y86-E107 bonds. On the contrary, after 140\u2009ns of MD in refp17 we observed a break in the middle of H5 (residue 105) resulting in displacement of structured C-terminal region towards the N-terminal region of H3. This shift allows the formation of a hydrogen bond R76-A112, obtaining a new interaction region. In all three proteins, fluctuations from helix to turn or coil structures were observed in the C-terminal region of H5 (Fig.\u00a02). Overall, these findings show that changes in the hydrogen bond network, due to the insurgence of even a single point mutation (R76G), are responsible for changes in the secondary structure of refp17. In order to confirm conformational shifts evidenced by MD, the structural conformation of refp17, S75X and p17R76G was investigated. To this aim we generated the three recombinant viral proteins and analyzed them in aqueous solution (each at 2.5\u2009\u03bcM), using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. All proteins displayed alpha-helical secondary structures at room temperature, as evidenced by a strong positive maximum at 195\u2009nm and two negative minima at 208 and 222\u2009nm (Fig.\u00a03A), consistent with the known structural features of p178, 9. However, S75X and p17R76G were noticeably less helical than refp17, as indicated by the reduction in ellipticity, suggesting a partial unfold of proteins (Fig.\u00a03A). In order to evaluate the impact of mutations on protein structure, we subjected refp17, S75X and p17R76G to heat-induced denaturation and monitored them at 222\u2009nm by CD spectroscopy. As temperature was raised from 25\u2009\u00b0C to 90\u2009\u00b0C, all three proteins exhibited a co-operative unfolding with a single transition, typical of a compact globular protein (Fig.\u00a03B). Data normalization based on a two-state protein denaturation model gave rise to a characteristic melting temperature (Tm at which 50% of protein is denatured or unfolded) for each protein. S75X and p17R76G had similar Tm values, approximately 10\u2009\u00b0C lower than refp17 (Table\u00a01). These results show that mutations in vp17s destabilize the matrix protein, corroborating findings from CD spectroscopy. Since temperature-induced unfolding is usually accompanied by protein aggregation27, we examined the ability of vp17s to oligomerize in solution by dynamic light scattering techniques (Table\u00a01). In solution refp17 exists as monomer or trimer depending on protein concentration28. At 10\u2009\u03bcM refp17 existed as a monomer (Fig.\u00a03C), while S75X and p17R76G displayed a molecular weight 10 and 170 fold higher than refp17 (Fig.\u00a03C), respectively. These data suggest that a single aa mutation occurring in the refp17 backbone can induce a massive self-association, indicating that some refp17 buried hydrophobic residues become exposed in S75X and p17R76G. Then, we analyzed the three p17 proteins using 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and their amide-amide Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra. As shown in Fig.\u00a03D, refp17 displayed a large number of well-dispersed amide-amide Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) signals, which are characteristic of a well-folded alpha-helical protein. On the contrary, S75X and p17R76G showed very few amide-amide NOE signals in the same region of the spectrum, consistent with dampened signals arising from the formation of soluble aggregates. Overall, our data suggest that a single R76G mutation in refp17 backbone can destabilize the viral protein with a reduction of alpha-helical secondary structures, thermal stability and soluble aggregates formation. Destabilization of refp17 with changes in the secondary structure, induced by aa mutations, are known to confer conformational changes sufficient to endow the viral protein with B-cell growth-promoting activity23. Since in refp17 the E73-R76 hydrogen bond was identified by MD as an essential interaction for hydrogen bond network and CD and NMR spectroscopy confirm a destabilization of viral protein (Fig.\u00a03), we aimed at determining whether p17R76G, a mutant bearing a G at position 76 instead of an R, as in S75X, could acquire a B-cell clonogenic activity. Then, we tested the p17R76G capability of modulating B-cell growth by soft agar clonogenic assays. As shown in Fig.\u00a04A, refp17 inhibited the colony-forming ability of Raji B cells as compared to untreated cultures, while S75X and p17R76G enhanced their clonogenic activity. These results confirm that the rupture of the E73-R76 hydrogen bond generates significant structural changes conferring to the matrix protein a S75X-like B-cell clonogenic activity. The PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway represents the major intracellular signaling cascade known to regulate proliferation and malignant transformation29, 30. Refp17 was shown to enhance PTEN activity and down-modulate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, exerting an anti-proliferative effect on B cells, while S75X was shown to block PTEN and activate Akt, thus promoting B-cell growth22. Due to clonogenic activity of p17R76G (Fig.\u00a04A), we explored its capability to modulate the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, Raji cells stimulated with refp17 showed a significant Akt inhibition, as expected, while S75X and p17R76G phosphorylated Akt kinase (Fig.\u00a04C and D). Since Akt can be modulated by PTEN30, we also evaluate the Ser/Thr phosphorylated PTEN inactivation form. As shown in Fig.\u00a04C and D, cells treated with S75X and p17R76G showed an increased PTEN phosphorylation as compared to unstimulated cells, whereas treatment of cells with refp17 resulted in a reduced PTEN phosphorylation level (Fig.\u00a04B). Overall, these data show that p17R76G, like S75X, activates the proliferative PI3K/Akt pathway in B cells through PTEN down-modulation. Assessment of protein phosphorylations is essential for understanding intracellular activities controlling cell functions. To further investigate the intracellular mechanisms involved in the B-cell growth-promoting activity of S75X and p17R76G, we assessed how these proteins modulate intracellular phosphorylations by employing a high-throughput antibody array technology. The lysates of Raji cells, stimulated or not with refp17, p17R76G or S75X (0.1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) were processed by Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation for Kinex\u2122 KAM-850 Antibody Microarray. Then, in order to rule out false positive array signals, all the protein modulated by S75X and p17R76G were confirmed by a multi-immunoblotting analysis performed by Kinexus. The signals relative to the 23 proteins modulated by S75X and p17R76G, verified by densitometric analysis and normalized to refp17, are reported in Table\u00a02. Literature data mining and GO biological process database highlighted that most of modulated proteins, as expected, are involved in cell cycle regulation (CDK1, CDK2, CDK8, CHEK1, CHEK2, GSK-3 beta, NPM, PAK1, PP2C-alpha) and apoptosis (CASP-9, CASP-7, DFF-45, NPM, YWHAZ, Src, PAX2, MAPK8). In Fig.\u00a05 we established the known and experimentally verified molecular interactions among the proteins reported in Table\u00a02 using STRING database31 of Protein-Protein Interaction Network and literature data mining. Those molecules not displaying confirmed interactions (CaMKK2, CDK8, Lyn, PP2C-delta, SOCS-4, Src, CHEK1, GSK-3 beta, PP5, PKC-beta) were kept out from the signaling network, even if we cannot completely rule out their involvement in vp17s-induced B-cell growth. As shown in Fig.\u00a05, S75X and p17R76G trigger the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which in turn could activate MAPK832 and YWHAZ33, thus creating a positive feedback loop further strengthening Akt activation34. In addition, MAPK8, besides its ability to activate PAX2 and promote cancer cell proliferation35, can trigger YWHAZ and inhibit DNA fragmentation process during apoptosis by interacting with DFF-4536. PP2C-alpha up-regulation can also concurs likely to further activate PI3K/Akt pathway37. Moreover, Akt activation can modulate the activity of PAK138, 39, CASP-940, DFF-4536, 41, NPM42, 43, CDK1 and CDK244, 45. Among these factors, a central role can be exerted by NPM, which is known to be directly activated by Akt, but also by YWHAZ and CDK1/246\u201348. Finally, CHEK2 activation can be involved in cytoprotection and cell survival49. These data highlight that the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in B cells by clonogenic S75X and p17R76G can orchestrate the function of several molecules involved in promoting tumor survival and proliferation. The function of a globular protein is governed by its 3D structure, while different biological functions can be performed by a protein that lacks the ordered secondary structure and thermal stability50\u201352. As several cancer-associated proteins, p17 possesses high levels of predicted intrinsic disorders53, 54, which subtend to a partially unfolded status of specific regions. Previously, we showed that in S75X, which contains aa mutations scattered throughout the p17 protein sequence, specific hydrogen bonds stabilizing the refp17 structure are lost, giving rise to a partially unfolded - B-cell growth-promoting - protein18. However, it is known that different aa residues can be mutated in vp17s without loss or change in their refp17-like functional activity, suggesting that the clonogenic activity of vp17s do not depend from protein sequence, but only from specific mutations capable of endowing p17s with a B-cell growth-promoting activity23. MD simulations showed that S75X displays a single aa mutation (R76G) that is likely to be the most responsible for protein destabilization, with reduction of alpha-helical secondary structures and for shifting the equilibrium toward a partially unfolded conformation. CD and 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy confirmed this prediction using a recombinant p17 mutant carrying the single R76G replacement in the refp17 backbone (p17R76G). As expected, clonogenic assays showed that the replacement of R to G at position 76, as in S75X, is sufficient to endow refp17 with a B cells growth-promoting activity. Therefore, aa mutations, which alter the hydrogen bond network and contribute to an even partial unfolding process of refp17, confer to vp17s different functional outcomes compared to refp17. Unfolding and subsequent self-assembly of proteins into various aggregates are common molecular mechanisms involved in important human diseases55, 56. Our data show that the partially unfolded conformational ensemble of vp17s favors specific intermolecular interactions and protein aggregation. Indeed, vp17s exhibit higher nonpolar surface areas than refp17, probably due to the exposure of some buried hydrophobic residues, which induces them to massively self-aggregate. Further studies will address if some of the p17 cell toxic activities57 are dependent on this aggregation status. The p17R76G protein, similarly to S75X22, was also found to activate Akt kinase, modulating PTEN activity. High-throughput phosphoproteomic and bioinformatics analysis highlighted a central role of Akt kinase in the proliferative signaling pathways induced by S75X and p17R76G in B cells. Indeed, Akt can modulate the function of several molecules as PP2C-alpha, YWHAZ, MAPK8, PAX2, PAK1, CASP-9, CASP-7, DFF-45, NPM, PAX2, CDK1, CDK2, CHEK2, involved in apoptosis inhibiton, cell cycle promotion and cancer progression. All these findings were not unexpected since the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway represents the major signaling cascade known to play a central role in tumorigenesis58, 59. All molecules modulated by S75X and p17R76G, used as input for the Cytoscape ClueGO functional analysis tool60 to cluster them according to the KEGG biological pathway, result to be related to several known biological pathways. As shown in Fig.\u00a06, most of the identified signaling pathways are related to cancer development and progression, as PI3K/Akt, p53, MAPK and ErbB. It is important to underline that molecules modulated by S75X and p17R76G are also involved in signaling triggered by oncogenic viruses, like EBV, HTLV-1 and HBV. This latter observation suggests that different viruses, and among them HIV-1, may exploit common paths to promote cell proliferation. Moreover, EBV infection was recently shown to up-regulate p17Rs expression on primary B lymphocytes, thereby making these cells permissive to the biological effects mediated by p17s19. Interestingly, molecules modulated by S75X and p17R76G were also related to the prolactin signaling pathway, supporting previous data showing the presence of higher serum prolactin in HIV+ patients than in healthy individuals and the capability of prolactin to influence normal lymphocyte mitogenesis and lymphoid tumor growth61\u201363. Finally, some molecules modulated by clonogenic vp17s result to be related to chemokine signaling pathway and this finding is not surprising, since p17 is known to act as a viral chemokine15, 64\u201366. Recently, we showed that vp17s derived from HIV+ NHL patients were characterized by specific aa insertions in the C-terminal region, tempting to ascribe this activity to the C-terminus of the protein interacting directly with its putative receptors23. Nevertheless, we previously described that the presence of H5 in p17 is not necessary for protein clonogenic activity22, highlighting the intrinsic capability of p17 to exert B-cell clonogenic activity following protein unfolding. Indeed, truncation of the last 36 aa residues of p17 resulted in a protein (p17\u039436) capable of promoting B-cell clonogenicity through PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, the different biological activity of S75X and p17R76G compared to refp17, underlines how the matrix protein binding to and signaling through p17R(s) can potentially involve distinct determinants of structure or conformations. For these reasons, we hypothesize that a specific clonogenic epitope responsible for B-cell clonogenic activity, located probably in N-terminal or in the core of matrix protein, is masked in the properly folded monomeric p17, but exposed in misfolded, aggregated B-cell vp17s. Therefore, the molecular reasons for the opposite mechanisms among mutated proteins and wild-type p17 may depend on the exposure or not of a clonogenic epitope and from the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is specific for the mutated clonogenic proteins. This downstream signaling pathway might be ascribed to the interaction of the viral mutated proteins, in their unfolded or aggregated form, with a different p17R(s) from the ones known engaged by refp17. Up to date, the direct interactor of clonogenic mutated proteins is still unknown and its identification will be sure matter of further investigations. In conclusion, our study represents the first molecular and structural characterization of a single point mutated p17 displaying B-cell clonogenic activity. Our findings open the way for a better understanding of the structure-function relationship underlying the B-cell clonogenic activity of some vp17s. Moreover, demonstration that clonogenic vp17s exert their action on B cells through activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway, which represents a critical driver of lymphoma development and metastasis, may offer new opportunities to identify novel treatment strategies in combating HIV-related B-cell lymphoma. Finally, our results provide the rational background for further studies aimed to assess the possible molecular signatures identifying vp17s with B-cell clonogenic activity and recognition of HIV+ individuals at risk to develop lymphoma. Human lymphoblastoid cell line (Raji) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1\u2009mM L-glutamine and 1mM sodium pyruvate. Purified endotoxin-free recombinant HIV-1 matrix protein p17, S75X and p17R76G were produced as previously described22. The mutated matrix protein p17R76G, in which the arginine in position 76 was replaced by a glycine, was generated from p17 sequence by using Quick Change Site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The structures of refp17 were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1TAM, whereas homology modeling (Modeler) was used to obtain the structures of S75X and p17R76G. The PDB code 1TAM, which corresponds to the refp17 studied experimentally, was used as a template. The models were optimized with AMBER program67 and checked using PROCHECK68. MD simulations were performed with AMBER 12 software package67 and AMBER ff99SB force field. The system was solvated in a truncated octahedron periodic box by using TIP3P and counter ions were added to neutralize the system. The minimizations were performed keeping the position of protein restrained for tree minimization steps, by a force constant of 5000\u2009Kcal/mol/\u00c5\u00b2 in the first, 100\u2009Kcal/mol/\u00c5\u00b2 in the second, 10\u2009Kcal/mol/\u00c5\u00b2 in the third and without protein restrained in the fourth. Next, the system was heated to 300\u2009K using position restraints on entire protein with force constant of 10\u2009kcal/mol/\u00c5\u00b2, from 0\u2009K to 100\u2009K at constant volume in 3\u2009ns, from 100 to 300 at constant pressure in 2\u2009ns. Bond lengths involving hydrogens were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm and the equations of motion were integrated with a 2-fs time step. The non-bonded cutoff distance was 8\u00c5 and the Particle Mesh Ewald method was used to calculate long-range electrostatics interactions. The temperature of the system was regulated using the Langevin thermostat. Equilibration was reached in constant NPT ensemble for 7\u2009ns. After equilibration, production MD was performed at 300\u2009K using constant pressure without restraints for 500\u2009ns. DSSP program was used to assign secondary structures26. The convergence was evaluated calculating the time point beyond which the RMSD of the structure stayed in a range of 1 Angstrom around the centre of oscillations. The RMSD was calculated considering only the alpha carbon in the not flexible regions (RMSF\u2009<\u20093 Angstrom). To assess the different conformations of p17s we performed cluster analysis using the default hierarchical agglomerative algorithm implemented in the cpptraj tool (AmberTools). The distance matrix was computed using RMS distance between each pair of frame. The dispersion of conformations along the dynamics within of the clusters was evaluated considering a dispersion index that takes into account the fraction of frames (FR i) and the average of RMSD within each cluster: \u2211i=1NcRMSDi\u22c5(1\u2212FRi), where N c is the number of considered clusters. The non-polar surfaces area was calculated using the software MDTraj69. CD spectra of p17s at 2.5\u2009\u03bcM in 10\u2009mM PBS (pH 7.4) were obtained at room temperature on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm quartz cuvette. Protein thermal denaturation was carried out in PBS on the Jasco spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature controller. 2.5\u2009mL of protein solution (approximately 10\u2009\u03bcM) prepared in PBS (pH 7.4) was aliquoted into a 3\u2009mL cuvette. Under constant stirring, CD measurements at 222\u2009nm were made at one degree interval between 25\u2009\u00b0C and 90\u2009\u00b0C, at a heating rate of 1\u2009\u00b0C per minute. After each 1-minute heating, the solution in the cuvette waited for 20\u2009s before signals were sampled over a 16\u2009sec period. Heating and data acquisition were fully automated with control software provided by Jasco. Denaturation data were fitted to the following six-parameter equation derived from a two-state protein denaturation model as previously described23, 70, 71:S\u03b8=(\u03b1n1T+\u03b1n2)+(\u03b1d1T+\u03b1d2)e\u0394HmRT(Tm\u2212T)Tm1+e\u0394HmRT(Tm\u2212T)Tmwhere Tm is melting temperature at which 50% of protein is denatured, \u2206Hm is the enthalpy of denaturation, \u03b1n1, \u03b1n2, \u03b1d1, and \u03b1d2 are parameters for the parabolic equations defining native and denatured states, and the gas constant R\u2009=\u20098.314\u2009J\u2009mol\u22121\u2009K\u22121. The experiments for each protein were repeated three times. Concentrated protein solutions were filtered using a Whatman Anotop 10 filter (0.22\u2009\u03bcm) and, after UV quantification, diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 10\u2009\u03bcM each. Protein size measurements were carried out at 25\u2009\u00b0C, pH 7.4, with a total ionic strength of 0.1\u2009M, on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument. Twenty runs of 30\u2009s each were taken and averaged, and the data were processed using the manufacturer provided software. NMR spectra were recorded at 25\u2009\u00b0C on an 800\u2009MHz (800.27\u2009MHz for protons) Bruker Avance-series NMR spectrometer equipped with four frequency channels and a 5\u2009mm triple-resonance z-axis gradient cryogenic probehead. A one-second relaxation delay was used and quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions was obtained with states-TPPI phase cycling; initial delays in the indirect dimensions were set to give zero- and first-order phase corrections of 90\u00b0 and \u2212180\u00b0, respectively72, 73. Data were processed using the processing program nmrPipe on Mac OS X workstations74. 2D NOESY experiments with a 150\u2009ms mixing time were collected to monitor changes in the backbone and side-chain 1H protein resonances75. Typical NMR samples contained 3\u2009mg/ml protein in a 10\u2009mM sodium phosphate and 25\u2009mM sodium chloride buffer (pH 7.4) to which 10% D2O (v/v) was added. Raji cell clonogenic activity was evaluated in soft agar assays as previously described18, 22, 23. Raji cells, starved for 24\u2009hours by serum deprivation, were stimulated or not with refp17, p17R76G and S75X (0.05, 0.1, 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) for 5\u2009min, then lysed and prepared for KinexTM Antibody Microarray (KAM-850) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation). Then, the samples were checked for pAkt and pPTEN levels by western blot analysis, as previously described23. In particular, the blots were incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C with 1) mAb to pAkt (Cell Signaling Technology), 2) mAb to total Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), 3) mAb pPTEN (Ser380/Thr382/383) (Cell Signaling Technology), 3) mAb to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). The lysates of cells stimulated with refp17, p17R76G and S75X (0.1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) for 5\u2009min were sent to Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation for processing by Kinex\u2122 KAM-850 Antibody Microarray, which contains 517 pan-specific and 337 phoshpo-site-specific probes, which recognize different epitopes on 466 proteins. The raw data, processed by Kinexus with the ImaGene software, were filtered according to company criteria. Only probes matching these criteria where considered for further analysis: signal to noise ratio >1.6; or signal to noise ratio <1.6 and noise inferior than the average noise of the array; maximum variation coefficient <0.2. The analysis was led with custom R, Visual Basic and MySQL procedures. Z-scores for normalization and z-ratios for comparisons were calculated as previously described76, according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, and a significativity threshold of 1.1 was adopted for the z-ratios. In order to rule out false positive array signals, a subsequent multi-immunoblotting verification step was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Therefore, on the 54 most relevant selected probes a pre-screening step was performed by Kinexus to select the reactive antibodies and rule out the false positive array signals due to antibody cross-reactivity. After pre-screening, 36 selected antibodies were used for a multi-immunoblotting analysis by Kinexus. Blot raw quantification data were processed by log transformation and normalization to either not treated or p17 treated samples for the interpretation of the results. STRING database was used to identify known and experimentally verified molecular interactions among proteins modulated by p17s31. Literature data mining was also performed by PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), PhosphoSite (http://www.phosphosite.org/), Uniprot (http://www.uniprot.org) and Genecards (http://www.genecards.org). The modulated proteins were also used as input for the Cytoscape ClueGO functional analysis tool50 to cluster the proteins according to the KEGG pathways database. Data obtained from multiple independent experiments are expressed as the means\u2009\u00b1\u2009the standard deviations (SD). The data were analyzed for statistical significance using one-way ANOVA. Bonferroni\u2019s post-test was used to compare data. Differences were considered significant at P\u2009<\u20090.05. Statistical tests were performed using Prism 5 software (GraphPad)."}, "24587916": {"pmid": "24587916", "pmcid": "PMC3920649", "title": "Antioxidant Effects of Bovine Lactoferrin on Dexamethasone-Induced Hypertension in Rat", "abstract": "\nDexamethasone- (Dex-) induced hypertension is associated with enhanced oxidative stress. Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein with antihypertensive properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic administration of LF on oxidative stress and hypertension upon Dex administration. Male Wistar rats were treated by Dex (30\u2009\u03bcg/kg/day subcutaneously) or saline for 14 days. Oral bovine LF (30, 100, 300\u2009mg/kg) was given from day 8 to 14 in a reversal study. In a prevention study, rats received 4 days of LF treatment followed by Dex and continued during the test period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using tail-cuff method. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity. Plasma hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value were determined. Dexamethasone significantly increased SBP and plasma H2O2 level and decreased thymus and body weights. LF lowered (P < 0.01) and dose dependently prevented (P < 0.001) Dex-induced hypertension. LF prevented body weight loss and significantly reduced the elevated plasma H2O2 and increased FRAP values. Chronic administration of LF strongly reduced the blood pressure and production of ROS and improved antioxidant capacity in Dex-induced hypertension, suggesting the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another mechanism of antihypertensive action of LF.\n", "fulltext": "Chronic administration of glucocorticoid, especially at supraphysiological doses, leads to elevated systolic blood pressure, in man and animals. Increased vascular sensitivity to glucocorticoids has been also demonstrated in patients with essential hypertension. Dexamethasone- (Dex-) induced hypertension is associated with decreased antioxidant levels, enhanced oxidative stress and reduced nitric oxide (NO) level [3, 4]. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurs in this model of hypertension like many other forms of hypertension. Interaction between ROS and NO leads to reduced NO availability and vasoconstriction. An increasing body of evidence has shown the role of antioxidants in preventing increased oxidative stress and blood pressure in Dex-induced hypertension [6\u20138]. Lactoferrin (LF) is a multifunctional iron-binding glycoprotein. Different biological fluids especially milk and also neutrophilic granules contain LF. LF receptors are found in various cell types such as lymphocytes, platelets, macrophages, dopaminergic neurons, megacaryocytes, and endothelial cells. Some of these receptors are involved in LF uptake. In the cerebral endothelial cells, LF is transported through a receptor-mediated process without any intraendothelial degradation. LF acts as the first-line defense against bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. It has anti-inflammatory effect and its production is increased during inflammatory circumstances. LF is a regulator of organ morphogenesis and promotes wound healing and bone growth. It has enzymatic activities in some reactions and also some anticancer activities. LF has been identified as an antioxidant protein with ability to increase antioxidant capacity and decrease ROS formation [14\u201316]. Recently, some studies have demonstrated antihypertensive effects of this food-derived peptide and its hydrolysate in normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) [17, 18]. The NO-dependent vasodilation, inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and inhibition of endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) activity have been suggested as the mechanisms responsible for antihypertensive effects of LF [19\u201321]. The present study aimed to evaluate blood pressure lowering effects of chronic LF in Dex-induced hypertension and to determine the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another probable mechanism of action of LF in prevention of hypertension. Male Wistar rats (200\u2013230\u2009g) were obtained from the animal house of the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. They were kept in standard laboratory conditions with free access to food and water. Rats were acclimated to the laboratory conditions for at least one week before the experiments. Animals were weighed on alternate days. All experiments were performed according to the internationally accepted guidelines for laboratory animal use and care. Bovine lactoferrin (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA), dexamethasone (Raha Pharmaceutical Co., Iran) and captopril (Tehran Darou, Iran), were used in this study. Plasma lipid hydroperoxides measurement and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay were performed using standard assay kits (East Sage Research Co., Iran). Animals were treated by subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of Dex (30\u2009\u03bcg/kg/day) for induction of hypertension as the Dex control group or saline (1\u2009mL/kg) as the saline control group for 14 days. In a prevention study, rats received oral LF (30, 100, 300\u2009mg/kg) or captopril treatment (40\u2009mg/kg; a known angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, as the positive control) using an intragastric tube for 4 days followed by Dex administration and continued during the test period (14 days). In the reversal study, LF or captopril was administered from day 8 to day 14. Six animals were used in each group. At the end of the experiment, all groups of animals were sacrificed under ether anesthesia. Blood samples were collected into heparinized tubes and plasma was separated. The thymus gland was also isolated. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured every week using noninvasive tail-cuff method (AD Instrument PowerLab Data Acquisition System, Australia) in conscious rats. The animals were individually restrained in a clear acrylic restrainer at an ambient temperature of 37-38\u00b0C for 15\u2009min. Five blood pressure values were recorded for each rat and the average of them was taken as the SBP. To assure the reliability of the measurements, a training period of one week was established before the experiment time for adaptation of rats to the method. The thymus gland was weighed and expressed as milligrams per 100\u2009g body weight. The thymus weightwas used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity. Plasma hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration was measured based on the ferrous ion oxidation by xylenol orange (FOX) assay using a standard assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, FOX reagent was mixed with plasma samples and incubated for 30\u2009min in 37\u00b0C. The absorbance of colored samples was read at 540\u2009nm with ELISA/spectrophotometric reader. Plasma H2O2 concentration was calculated against the hydrogen peroxide standard curve absorption values. The antioxidant capacity of plasma samples was determined by FRAP assay based on the reduction of ferric-tripyridyltriazine complex to ferrous form using a standard assay kit. Briefly, the FRAP reagent was added to plasma samples and incubated for 40\u2009min in 40\u00b0C. The absorbance of colored samples was read at 570\u2009nm using an ELISA/spectrophotometric reader. The values were calculated against the standard curve of FeSO4.7H2O concentration and absorption values were expressed as micromole of ferrous ion equivalents per liter. The data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was made by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test using SPSS 16.0 software and GraphPad-Prism 5 software. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Dexamethasone significantly increased SBP from 118.9 \u00b1 4.7 to 140.44 \u00b1 10.3\u2009mmHg on day 7 (P < 0.01) and to 150 \u00b1 7.4\u2009mmHg on day 14 (P < 0.001) in comparison with saline control group (116.6 \u00b1 2.4\u2009mmHg). The oral administration of LF (30\u2013300\u2009mg/kg) lowered and dose dependently prevented Dex-induced hypertension in reversal and prevention studies (Figures 1 and 2). The body weight significantly decreased in Dex-induced hypertensive rats when compared to saline control group (P < 0.001). These changes were modified by LF administration (300\u2009mg/kg) but not by captopril (Figure 3). Dex significantly decreased thymus weight (P < 0.001) but LF and captopril had no effect on it (Figure 4). Dex treatment significantly raised the level of plasma H2O2when compared with saline control rats (P < 0.001). LF administration significantly (P < 0.001) prevented the rise in H2O2 concentration at all doses in prevention study and reduced the elevated plasma H2O2 concentration at dose of 300\u2009mg/kg in reversal study (P < 0.05). Administration of captopril also prevented and reversed the elevated plasma H2O2 concentration in Dex-induced hypertensive rats (Figure 5). Dex-induced hypertensive rats exhibited significant increase in the plasma FRAP values compared with saline control rats (P < 0.001). LF administrations also significantly increased FRAP values in Dex-induced hypertensive group at all doses of prevention study (P < 0.001) and at doses 100 and 300\u2009mg/kg of reversal study (P < 0.05). In the captopril prevention study, FRAP values were also significantly increased (Figure 6). The results of this study showed antihypertensive effect of LF in Dex-induced hypertension. LF treatment dose dependently prevented and reversed a rise in SBP upon Dex administration. These LF effects were obtained in spite of the fact that dose of Dex used in the current study was 3-fold higher than that of dose used in most studies (10\u2009\u03bcg/kg/day). The exact mechanism of Dex-induced hypertension has not been fully understood. The role of augmented vascular pressor responsiveness, increased vasoconstrictor system activity including renin-angiotensin, endothelin, and sympathetic system, deficiency in vasodilators such as NO and prostanoids, hemodynamic alterations, and oxidative stress have been proposed as the mechanisms of Dex in induction of elevated blood pressure. Structural, functional, and mechanical disruption in vessels have important role in Dex hypertensive effect. Dex results in increased sensitivity of vascular smooth muscles to vasoconstrictors and also increased vasoconstrictor release including angiotensin II, endothelin, and catecholamines [26, 27]. NO deficiency occurs during Dex treatment by downregulation of endothelial NO synthase expression and also through increased NO removal by oxidative stress. Dex enhances superoxide free radical production through NAPDH oxidase pathway in vasculature when given chronically. It also causes significant alterations in antioxidant status. Some antioxidants such as tempol, apocynin, and N-acetylcysteine have been shown to prevent Dex-induced hypertension [6, 26, 29]. LF as a food-derived peptide is believed to be safer than the drugs currently used for hypertension treatment. Previous studies have reported blood pressure lowering effects of LF [19\u201321]. LF may cross and be internalized via a specific low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein in some capillary endothelial cells and it acts as an antioxidant factor. The antihypertensive effects of LF may be attributed to the ACE and ECE inhibitor action and also endothelium-dependent relaxant action of LF [19\u201321]. It has been suggested that the vasodilatory action of LF is strongly mediated by NO production because of complete blockade of this effect by a NO synthase inhibitor. Ikeda and coworkers have reported significant phosphorylation of Src, Akt, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) after treatment with LF suggesting a Src Akt eNOS-dependent pathway in promotion of vascular endothelial cell function by LF. Furthermore, our results exhibited antioxidant effect of LF in Dex-induced hypertension. Hypertension of Dex was accompanied by increased plasma hydrogen peroxide level. LF administration dose dependently prevented and reversed H2O2 overproduction during Dex injection. Our finding showed significant increases in plasma ferric reducing antioxidant power upon Dex administration. It has been reported that glucocorticoids may activate the antioxidant enzymes in some tissues due to the state of oxidative stress and in a tissue specific manner. However, the antioxidant capacity was higher in LF pretreated rats than that of rats treated with Dex alone. The potent antioxidant action of LF has been reported in other studies. Two weeks LF supplementation has been able to increase the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity in healthy humans. LF has protective effect on pathological circumstances associated with iron-catalysed ROS based on its metal ions-binding capacity. It has been suggested that LF contributes in oxidoreductive reactions at the cell membrane. An antioxidant effect of LF on erythrocytes through inhibition of lipid peroxidation and hemolysis has been reported. LF is an important specialized iron scavenger and its antioxidant activity is most likely linked to its ability to bind ferrous and ferric ions. Thus, LF may inhibit the iron-catalyzed formation of hydroxyl radicals through Fenton reaction\u2014an important source of ROS [11, 33]. Overproduction of ROS and their interaction with NO may contribute to reduction of NO bioavailability and therefore antioxidant effect of LF would prevent NO deficiency. The result of this investigation suggested the antioxidant effect as another mechanism responsible for antihypertensive effects of LF. Our results showed effectiveness of LF in both prevention and reversal studies. Although some antioxidants such as tempol have been effective only in the prevention study LF with potent antioxidant effect could normalize the SBP even in Dex-induced hypertensive rats. Metabolic consequences such as muscle and fat catabolism result in decreasing the rate of body weight gain during Dex administration. LF could prevent the body weight loss effect of Dex. Wakabayashi et al. have also reported protective effect of LF in preventing weight loss during infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 in mice. This effect of LF may be mediated through immune modulation and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines production. In conclusion, chronic LF treatment strongly reduced production of ROS and improved antioxidant capacity and reduced SBP in Dex-induced hypertension. These findings confirm the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of Dex-induced hypertension and provide evidence that antioxidant effect may play a role in the antihypertensive effect of LF. With regard to high antihypertensive activity with safety, LF could be suggested for clinical trial studies for prevention and/or treatment of hypertension."}, "28259923": {"pmid": "28259923", "pmcid": "PMC5367359", "title": "Pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human colorectal adenocarcinoma", "abstract": "\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step in the acquisition of metastatic and invasive power for tumor cells. Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) is a common cancer where metastasis is directly linked to patient survival. Recent studies show that pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 (PLAGL2) could induce tumor EMT and is an independent predictive factor associated with poor prognosis in cancer. In the present study, we confirmed the role of PLAGL2 in the prognosis of CRC patients and provide molecular evidence of PLAGL2 promoted EMT in CRC cell line SW480. We found that PLAGL2 expression was upregulated in the paraffin-embedded CRC tissues compared to borderline or benign tissues. Experimental EMT induced by PLAGL2 plasmid transfection proved PLAGL2 protein overexpression could enhance the cell scratch wound-healing and Transwell ability and significantly upregulated mesenchymal marker proteins, N-cadherin and vimentin and concurrently downregulated epithelial marker of E-cadherin. Subsequently, through western blot assay, we found that PLAGL2 could activate the Wnt-signaling component \u03b2-catenin in the nuclei. More CRC cell metastasis to the lungs was observed when the PLAGL2 overexpressing SW480 cells were injected into the tail vein of rats, compared with the cell control and PLAGL2 silence group. Our findings indicated that PLAGL2 might be a very upstream key molecule regulating EMT involved in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.\n", "fulltext": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancer and ranks second in cancer related deaths worldwide (1,2). Although mortality from colorectal cancer has been progressively declining over the past two decades, a large number of colorectal cancer patients present with regional or distal metastatic cancer (3). Among multiplex mechanisms, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the most important one to bestow metastatic potential to epithelial cancer cells enabling them to invade, migrate and subsequently disseminate to distant metastases (4,5). EMT is a reversible multi-step process by virtue of which epithelial cells lose their apical polarity and adhesion with other cells and/or extracellular matrix (ECM) and acquire mesenchymal traits of plasticity, mobility and stem cell-like properties (6). EMT is an essential physiological and patho-physiological process which is active during numerous embryogenesis processes and wound healing (7); but unfortunately, EMT can also occur during cancer progression when tumor cells exploit this mechanism to gain invasive and metastatic potential (8). EMT is the dominant program in human colon cancer, because robust EMT biology is highly prognostic for colon cancer recurrence (9). The EMT process also can induce autocrine signaling involving VEGF and Flt-1 that enable invasive cells to become \u2018self-sufficient\u2019 for survival (10). Induction of EMT in transformed colorectal epithelial cells could induce cells with circulating tumor cell (CTC) properties (10) suggesting that EMT may play a critical role in progression and metastases of colorectal cancer. EMT changes will cause some signaling pathways activation, thus, some special biomarkers could be detected in the procedure. Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is thought to be the initiation of tumor cell EMT (11\u201313). Binding of Wnt proteins to their trans-membrane cell receptors can activate the downstream pathway known as the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. The \u03b2-catenin protein is the pivotal molecule in this pathway, and is stabilized by the ligand molecule T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (TCF/LEF-1) to form a functional transcription factor that mediates the activation of target genes involved in tumor generation, invasion and metastasis (12,14). The activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway can increase the expression of mesenchymal cell marker vimentin, which is also considered to be an EMT marker (15). Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament protein that is normally expressed in mesenchymal cells and in migratory epithelial cells, such as during embryogenesis and wound healing (16). Vimentin is the cytoskeletal component playing a significant role in anchoring the position of the organelles, such as nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, in the cytosol for maintaining cell integrity (17). Vimentin is also overexpressed in some malignant diseases (18\u201320). Vimentin gene is methylated in colorectal cancer and has been established as a biomarker of colon cancer (21). Because the promoter has been identified to be a target of the \u03b2-catenin-TCF/LEF-1 transcription factor, vimentin now is regarded as an EMT marker (16). When EMT occurs, tumors upregulate mesenchymal protein marker N-cadherin and the concurrent loss of the epithelial protein marker E-cadherin (22,23). E-cadherin downregulated expression is frequently observed in many different types of cancer (24\u201327); while N-cadherin in various cancer cell lines enhances their invasion and metastasis even in the presence of E-cadherin (28). Interaction between N-cadherin the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) leads to activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway which might promote tumor cell survival and get into the circulation (29,30). E-cadherin, also called CD324, encoded by the CDH1 gene, is a major calcium-dependent glycoprotein adhesion molecule mediating cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells (31\u201333). E-cadherin functions as a tumor suppressor contributing to make tumor cells lose or decrease function of proliferation, invasion and/or metastasis (33). Pleomorphic adenoma gene-like 2 (PLAGL2) is a class zinc finger protein derived from PLAGL gene family and with the structures of the seven C2H2 zinc finger domain on the N-terminal (34). Human PLAGL2 gene expression is rich in fetal period (34). The relationship between PLAGL2 and malignant tumor was first studied in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer (35,36). Zheng et al (37) reported enhanced expression of PLAGL2 in neural stem cells (NSC) and glioma initiating cells (GIC) in cell lines and found that PLAGL2 gene overexpression strongly inhibits cell differentiation as well as enhance their ability of self-renew. The mechanism may be related to the regulation on the Wnt signaling pathway to prevent cell differentiation (37). Overexpression of PLAGL2 resulted in the combination of ligand and receptor in Wnt signaling pathway and subsequently Axin/APC/GSK3-\u03b2 diamorph disrupted, thus, promoting the stability of \u03b2-catenin activation and its transfer into the nucleus. This functionally contributes to PLAGL2 mediated NSC stop of differentiation and maintain self-renewal ability (37). In addition, recent research results show that PLAGL2 can regulate the actin cytoskeleton structure and cell migration, therefore, plays an important role in cell transformation and apoptosis (38). In the two ovarian cancer cell lines, ES-2 and HEY, knockout of PLAGL2 results in RhoA activation and Rac1 inactivation; subsequently, RhoA-ROCK (Rho-associated coil-containing protein kinase) pathway activation considerably increases invasive properties of the cells and significantly promote the organization of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in a RhoA-dependent manner; to the contrary, exogenous overexpression of PLAGL2 in the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, results in RhoA inactivation and Rac1 activation (39). A previous study revealed that PLAGL2 is a transcription factor that correlated with the development, progression and prognosis of gastrointestinal cancer (40). In the study, 225 cases of colorectal cancer specimens and 66 cases of carcinoma adjacent non-tumor tissue were detected and the immunohistochemical analysis reveal that PLAGL2 is expressed significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissues and closely related to the depth of the tumor invasion (40). In the present study, based on the theories and research findings above, the PLAGL2 was selected to explore its expression occurring in colorectal cancer oncogenesis, development and transfer. Furthermore, the mechanism of PLAGL2 action at the cellular level was investigated to clarify the mechanism of influence of the PLAGL2 on the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer and to provide a new theoretical basis for the treatment of colorectal cancer. All 44 CRC cases from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 were collected in this study and they were included according to the following criteria: i) First-time diagnosed CRC patients without any chemo, radio, bio-immune or hormone therapy; and ii) without other tumors. The age of the patients ranged from 51 to 87 years (mean, 60.6 years). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before sample and data collection. The malignant and borderline tissues were extracted from the surgical pathology archives in the Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute. Follow-up data were conducted using hospital medical records. The protein expression of PLAGL2 in the tissue samples were detected using immunohistochemistry. In brief, tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene and gradually rehydrated in descending grades of ethanol. Antigen was retrieved by pressure cooking in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 20 psi, 121\u00b0C for 30 sec and 90\u00b0C for 10 sec. Endogenous peroxidase activities were blocked with endogenous peroxidase blocking agent (Dako, Kyoto, Japan) for 10 min followed by washing with 0.05% Tween-20/phosphate-buffered saline (PBST). The sections were then incubated with 1:40 dilution of rabbit polyclonal primary antibody against PLAGL2 (ab121239; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 37\u00b0C for 35 min. Sections were treated with secondary antibodies at 37\u00b0C for 30 min by Dako ChemMate Detection kit peroxidase/DAB+, rabbit/ mouse kit (Dako). Finally, tissue sections were counterstained using haematoxylin. Primary malignant tissue grade 4 was applied as positive control of PLAGL2; negative control was performed using the normal tissue and the same condition. The strength of cell positive-staining was estimated in a semi-quantitative method. The score of the staining intensity was classified as colorless (0), buff (1), brownish yellow (2), and dark brown (3) and the score of the positive cell percentage was classified as no positive cells (0), 15% positive cells or less (1), 16\u201350% positive cells (2), 51\u201375% positive cells (3), and >75% positive cells (4). The staining index was calculated by multiplying the staining intensity score to the positive cell percentage score. Finally, we applied the mean optical density (MOD) to evaluate the staining intensity of each slide for the consistencies in IHC staining intensities. The MOD of each slices were determined by randomly selecting 6 representative fields, which were used to represent the whole tissue concentration of the stain or proportion of positive pixels. The human cDNA template was preserved in our laboratory. The PCR condition was 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 55 V for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 1 min plus a final extension period at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The PCR products were confirmed by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into pUM-T simple vector (Beijing Bioteke Biotechnology, Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Positive clones were sequenced by ABI 3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Subsequently, the plasmid of T-PLAGL2 and pcDNA3.1 (Beijing Bioteke Biotechnology) were extracted using a plasmid preparation kit (Beijing Bioteke Biotechnology) and the nucleotides digested with BamHI (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) and EcoRI (Fermentas) enzymes. The gel purified segments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas). The constructed vector was transformed into E. coli and positive colons labeled pcDNA3.1- PLAGL2 were identified by colony PCR. SW480, human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, was obtained from the Cell Bank of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Science (SIBS; Shanghai, China) and cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and kept in a humidified incubator (Heracell 150i; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Langenselbold, Germany) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. After reaching 90\u201395% confluency, SW480 cells were transfected with the vector pcDNA3.1- PLAGL2 using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturers instructions. Forty-eight hours later, G418, 200 mg/l (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium for cell selection. Single or mixed clonal populations of stably transfected cells were grown under G418 selection for 1\u20132 weeks and followed by routine DMEM culture for 2 weeks. The expression level of PLAGL2 in G418-resistant clones was thereafter evaluated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis. The human PLAGL2 gene nucleotide sequence NM-002657.2 was found in GeneBank, then PLAGL2 siRNA target sequence: AAGTGGGCTGGAAACTAGTTC was selected applying siRNA Target Finder (Ambion\u00ae; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX, USA) and the gene alignment analysis was performed using NCBI's BLAST to confirm the specificity of the gene silence. According to the selected siRNA target sequence, synthetic two single stranded template DNA, 5\u2032-AAAGCAGGAGGAGGAAGTGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAGCTATATGGTCTCTGCTC-3\u2032, were designed and synthetized. Positive sense oligonucleotide 3 \u00b5l and antisense oligonucleotide 3 \u00b5l were mixed and incubated at 90\u00b0C for 3 min and then slowly cooled to 37\u00b0C for 60 min. The annealing fragment was inserted into pSilencer 2.0-U6 vector between the enzyme cut sites of BamHI and HindIII. The plasmid was transformed into XL1-Blue TSS ultra-competent cells. Six to eight clones were selected for plasmid extraction and colony PCR. Finally, siRNA insert fragment was identified by a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing. SW480 cells ~2\u00d7104 each well was cultured in 24-well plate, 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, overnight. After the cells grew to 90\u201395% confluent monolayer, the recombinant plasmid and liposome FuGENE 6 to 1:2 mixing ratio were transfected into the cells. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were diluted with 1:10 and then cultured in the fresh medium. After 48 h, the cells were replaced with medium with G418 400 mg/l for the selection of culture medium. The resistant clones were obtained approximately 3 weeks later, and the cells were cultured with maintenance medium containing G418 of 200 mg/l culture. In the present study, the siPLAGL2 expression in SW480 cell line was selected as the experimental group, and the wild-type SW480 cell line was used as the control group. All operations were performed using RNase free instruments treated with DEPC. Total RNA of the tissues or cells were extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcription PCR kit, SuperScript\u2122 III First-Strand Synthesis system for RT-PCR (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), according to the manufacturers instruction. PLAGL2 gene expression at the mRNA level was tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) using Exicycler\u2122 96 Real-Time Quantitative Thermal Block from Bioneer (Shanghai, China). All samples were run in triplicate in a total volume of 20 \u00b5l, which contains cDNA templet 1 \u00b5l, 10 \u00b5M forward primers 0.5 \u00b5l, 10 \u00b5M reversed primer 0.5 \u00b5l, SYBR-Green Master Mix 10 \u00b5l and nuclease-free water. Amplification was carried out with polymerase activation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C 10 sec, 60\u00b0C 20 sec and 72\u00b0C 30 sec. Human \u03b2-actin was used as the reference gene. The relative expression analysis was performed using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct relative quantification (RQ) method by comparing Ct values of PLAGL2 mRNA expression relative to the reference gene. Cell motility was evaluated using scratch wound-healing and Transwell assays. For the scratch wound-healing assay, SW480 cells (2.5\u00d7105/ml) were seeded in 6-well plates and grown to 80\u201390% confluence. After aspirating the growth medium, cell monolayers in each group were scratched with a sterile pipette tip to generate a denuded zone. Subsequently, the well plate was washed with PBS to remove the cellular debris and the cells left were cultured in the DMEM medium again. The images were taken using a Olympus microscope (CH-BI45-T; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 0 and 24 h of incubation. The widths of the wound were counted in 10 randomly screened fields and the same procedure was repeated three times. For the Transwell assay, Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)-coated Transwells (8-\u00b5m pore PET membrane; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was applied. Briefly, 2\u00d7105 cells were seeded into the top chamber of a Corning chamber (polycarbonate filter with 8-\u00b5m pore size inserts; Corning Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA) in serum-free medium containing 0.3% BSA. Medium containing 10% serum was placed in the lower chamber. After 24 h, cells that migrated to the underside of the membrane were detected using a 0.1% crystal violet solution the assay was repeated three times with three replicates each. Cells that migrated to the underside of the membrane were quantified using light microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Crystal violet was dissolved using a 33% acetic acid, and the OD ratio at 570 nm was determined using a microplate reader. The results are representative of three independent experiments. The nuclear plasma protein isolation and extraction kit and the protease inhibitor cocktail were purchased from Fermentas, Thermo Fisher Scientific. Briefly, Lamin B1 was used as loading control for nuclear proteins western blot analysis. After digestion of the cells, the samples were centrifuged 250 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min and then the supernatant was discarded, then 10 volumes of cell lysis buffer with added protease inhibitor and DTT was added and the mixture was shaken for 10 sec and then placed on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged 250 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 7 min. The supernatant was collected carefully into the new EP tube and the remaining precipitate was placed on ice. The supernatant in the new EP tube was centrifuged 20,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min and the supernatant, which contained the plasma proteins, was transferred into the new EP tube and stored at \u221270\u00b0C. To the previous remaining precipitate was added 500 \u00b5l nuclei washing buffer containing protease inhibitor and DTT and then shaken gently and placed on ice for 2 min. The samples were centrifuged 500 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 7 min and the supernatant was removed carefully. Nuclei storage buffer, 150 \u00b5l, containing protease inhibitor and DTT was added and mixed 5\u201310 times. Nuclei lysis reagent 1/10 volume was added and shaken 900\u20131,200 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged 20,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min and transferred to the supernatant, which contained the nuclear proteins, into a new EP tube and stored at \u221270\u00b0C. For western blotting, total protein was extracted from cultured cells by lysis in RIPA buffer (Akron Biotechnology, Boca Raton, FL, USA) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The protein concentration was measured using a standard BCA assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins (40 \u00b5g) were disassociated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 5% stacking gel and gradient separating gel with 6, 8, 10 and 13%, then blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking solution and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. The primary antibodies used were against E-cadherin 1:1,000; N-cadherin 1:1,000; PLAGL2 1:500; vimentin 1:500; \u03b2-catenin 1:1,000. All antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Membranes were washed six times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 5 min and incubated with secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit (1:5,000; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing six times in TBST for 5 min, the protein bands were visualized using electro-generated chemiluminescent (ECL) reagents (EMD Millipore). The optical density of bands was analyzed by reflectance densitometry on a Gel-Pro Analyzer (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). Lung are the most common organ for colorectal cancer metastasis. Intra-vital video microscopy (IVVM) can directly observe the situation of tumor metastasis. In this study, the SW480 cells expressing recombinant green fluorescent protein were injected into rats and then the colonization and growth of colorectal cancer cells in lung tissue were observed and analyzed using the IVVM technique. The tumor cell staining was performed in accordance with the manual of CellTracker\u2122 Green CMFDA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and the protocol was outlined below: Prepared 1 mM CMFDA working solution was stored in the dark. For the SW480 cells with good growth state, the culture medium was drained and washed 3 times with PBS. CMFDA working solution (10 \u00b5l) was added as well as culture media 2 ml and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 30\u201345 min. After washed 3 times with PBS, the cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and cell suspension was prepared. The cells were counted using a hemocytometer and the cell viability was determined with the trypan blue exclusion method (living cells in >95% could be applied to the next step of the experiment). Ninety healthy Wistar rats, 4\u20135 weeks old, weighing ~110-130 g, were purchased from the China Medical University Experimental Animal Center and were divided into 5 groups, each group of 18, using random number table method. All the experiments on animals were performed follow internationally recognized guidelines on animal welfare and the national regulations. The experimental protocol was conducted in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines for Investigations in Laboratory Animals and was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of China Medical University (Shenyang, China). CMFDA-labeled SW480 cells were injected into the tail vein of the rats, 1\u00d7106 cells/rat and 6 animals of each group were sacrificed at 2 h, days 3 and 8, respectively, and the lungs were excised. After ventilated perfusion, intact rat lung tissue was placed under a fluorescence microscope (glass plate 0.12 mm thick as slide) immediately and the number of metastatic cells or the fluorescence intensity on the surface of the pulmonary pleura was observed. The images were recorded with CCD camera Sony ICX205, CoolSNAP cf\u2122 (Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed using software of application of image analysis and processing, MetaMorph (Beijing Pioneer Technology, Beijing, China). When the cell number was counted, 50 view fields were selected under the visual field of 10 (ocular) \u00d7 10 (objective) magnifications. The actual number of tumor cells on 1-cm2 pulmonary pleura was estimated by the following formula: The average cell number per view field/32.5 (each view field area is 0.325 mm2). The SPSS version 20 statistical software package was used to optimize the image quality analysis. The \u03c72 test was used to assess the correlation between the PLAGL2 protein expression and various clinicopathological parameters. The enumeration data values are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and analyzed by one-way ANOVA. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. In general, the PLAGL2 immunohistochemistry staining intensity gradually increased from benign, early stage to advanced stage (Fig. 1A). To further identify the differential expression of PLAGL2 between CRCs and their corresponding adjacent benign colorectal tissues, immunohistochemistry analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed in primary CRC and corresponding adjacent colorectal tissue samples from 44 patients. As shown in Fig. 1B and C, both immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR detection found that PLAGL2 expression in primary CRC tissues was significantly higher than that observed in adjacent non-tumor tissues (P<0.001); in addition, compared with the 14 cases in clinical stage I\u2013II, the PLAGL2 expression was significantly higher in the samples in clinical stage III\u2013IV (P<0.001). These results suggested that upregulation of PLAGL2 was correlated with the benign tissue canceration. The PLAGL2 expression level is represented with immunohistochemistry staining index evaluated by multiplying the staining intensity score to the positive cell score. Based on a measure of heterogeneity, a staining index of 3 or greater was defined as high expression, and 2 or lower as low expression. In the univariate statistical analysis, the results in Table I show that the PLAGL2 expression level was correlated with tumor size (P=0.006), metastasis status (P<0.001) and clinical stage (P=0.034); while, there was no association with the patients age or the tumor pathological subtype. These data indicated that the upregulation of PLAGL2 expression predicated advanced clinicopathological features and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. To confirm the role of PLAGL2 in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis of colorectal cells and to the mechanisms, the full-length coding sequence (CDS) encoding PLAGL2 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 and the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 was digested with BamHI + EcoRI. At the same time, siRNA for PLAGL2 was designed and synthesized by Guangzhou Ribobio, Co., Ltd., (Guangzhou, China) and the effect of siRNA was identified by qRT-PCR. The in vitro transcription of PLAGL2 gene and PLAGL2 silencing in the SW480 cells were analyzed by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. The cycle number of PLAGL2 at which the amplification reached the threshold was normalized against \u03b2-actin cycle number to determine the relative copy numbers between SW480 cell line, pcDNA3.1 transfected SW480 cell line, PLAGL2 silenced cell line and pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 transfected cell line. The PLAGL2 exhibited significantly higher level of transcription in the pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 transfected cell line compared with PLAGL2 silencing cell line, pcDNA3.1 transfected cell line and SW480. The results suggested that PLAGL2 gene transcription was upregulated in pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cell line (Fig. 2A). Expression of PLAGL2 protein in SW480 cells was detected by western blot analysis. The results confirmed that PLAGL2 protein was significantly highly expressed in the pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cells, whereas, very weak expression was seen in other cells (Fig. 2B). The results showed that the colorectal cancer cell line stably overexpressing exogenous PLAGL2 and PLAGL2-silence were successfully established. Since the expression change of PLAGL2 in pcDNA3.1 vector and empty vector of PLAGL2 silence was similar, in the subsequent results, only one set of vectors was used to represent both vector controls. Promotion effect of PLAGL2 on SW480 cell migration was evaluated by scratch wound healing assay (Fig. 3A). At time-point 0 h, scraped cells were photographed. After 24 h, migration of cells into wounded areas was effectively increased in the PLAGL2 group. This result suggests that PLAGL2 promoted migration of the SW480 cells. PLAGL2 promoting invasion of SW480 cell invasion was determined by Transwell invasion assay. PLAGL2 significantly promoted invasion of the cells (Fig. 3B). Quantitative data derived from three independent experiments supported that PLAGL2 high expression effectively prevented invasion characteristics of tumor cells. The expression level of EMT markers, N-cadherin and vimentin and epithelial marker, E-cadherin, were compared between the PLAGL2 silenced SW480 cells and PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cells by western blot assay. The results of this analysis confirmed that the SW480 cells (low expressed PLAGL2) and PLAGL2 silenced cells produced N-cadherin and vimentin in substantially lower amounts than the SW480 cells highly expressing PLAGL2 and with opposite E-cadherin changing in the cells (Fig. 3C). The results also revealed that the vectors had no effect on the protein expression. Subsequently, to verify whether the PLAGL2 promoted CRC cell EMT through the wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, we analyzed the \u03b2-catenin protein levels of the cell lysates. The results showed that the whole protein level of \u03b2-catenin in the PLAGL2 cells were significant increased compared with the control cells, vectors transected cells and the PLAGL2-silenced cells (Fig. 4A). Then, 20 mM FH535, the \u03b2-catenin inhibitor, was used to co-incubate the PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cells for 48 h. The \u03b2-catenin expression was activated after PLAGL2 decreased significantly, but PLAGL2 expression was not affected, after FH535 co-incubation. This suggested that PLAGL2 is an upstream protein inducing EMT through activating the \u03b2-catenin pathway (Fig. 4B). \u03b2-catenin is a nuclear transcription factor; therefore, we further used nuclei plasma separation technique to detect the regulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin in colorectal cancer cell line PLAGL2. The results showed that the overexpression of PLAGL2 increased the expression of \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus significantly; while the cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin increased but the change was not obvious. After overexpression of PLAGL2, the increase of \u03b2-catenin expression in the nucleus was ~2-3 times higher than that in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C). In the course of tumor metastasis, the adhesion of metastatic tumor cells to vascular endothelium is one of the key steps in the transfer process. Lung is the most common organ for tumor metastasis occurrence of colorectal cancer. To determine whether downregulation of PLAGL2 is capable of suppressing metastasis in lung cancer, the PLAGL2 introduced SW480 cells, PLAGL2 silenced SW480 cells and SW480 cells were injected into rats and evaluated for metastatic colonization capacity in a tail-vein assay. Since the in vitro experiments showed that the empty vectors did not affect the expression of PLAGL2, in order to reduce the number of experimental animals as much as possible, the vector controls were not set, but only PLAGL2 high expression, PLAGL2 low expression and cell control group were set in the in vivo experiments. The rats were dissected after 2 h of the cell injection into the caudal vein and the intact lung tissues were observed under fluorescence microscope. Retention of metastatic tumor cells in pulmonary capillaries could be seen and the knockdown of PLAGL2 genes led to significant suppression of metastatic cell number in the lungs. The reduction in the cell numbers had statistical significance (Fig. 5). Three days later, due to excessive colonization of the cells on the lung pleural surface forming cell clusters that could not be counted, the fluorescence intensity was applied for cell metastasis assessment. The rats were dissected on days 3 and 8, respectively. The lung tissue was taken for observation and image acquisition. MetaMorph software was used to measure the area and the fluorescence intensity of each group. With the increase of the number of days, the total fluorescence area and the fluorescence intensity of the cell clusters formed on the lung surface was also significantly increased. The statistical comparison between PLAGLA group with cell control group and comparison between PLAGLA group with PLAGL2 silenced group were all significant (P<0.01) (Fig. 5). PLAGL2 is a member of the polymorphic adenoma gene zinc finger protein family, the other members include PLAGl and PLAGLl. The PLAG family protein, mainly as a nuclear transcriptional regulator, is important to regulate various gene expressions, including physiological cell proliferation and pathological tumorigenesis. Some previous studies have demonstrated that PLAGL2 is a transcription factor that overexpress and has active function in cancer progression (41\u201343). In the present study, we started with an overview of 44 colorectal patients data for analyzing the relationship between the PLAGL2 expression and the clinicopathological manifestation. Here, we report the overexpression of PLAGL2 at the invasive and high grade cases. Thus, the PLAGL2 genes may be a new severity hallmark of the CRC patients. In this context, we also confirmed the significant upregulation of PLAGL2 by immunohistochemistry in the tumor samples from clinical stage III\u2013IV patients. PLAGL2 was stained in both cytoplasm and nuclei. Because of these finding, we initially confirmed the tumor metastasis promoting role of PLAGL2. It showed clear and consistent role on CRC cell proliferation, invasion, migration and evident through both pathological tests and the clinicopathological data retrospective analysis. We also found that the malignant level of CRC has a correlation in an PLAGL2 expression-dependent manner. Our results further validated and confirmed a previous study (40). In the present study, PLAGL2 overexpression is necessary for EMT as demonstrated by the pcDNA3.1-PLAGL2 vector transfection and stable silencing via PLAGL2-silence vector transfection, respectively. The results indicated that PLAGL2 upregulation may facilitate CRC tumor cell invasion and metastasis by regulating multiple EMT molecular expression parallel or dependent, including \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin, vimentin and N-cadherin with in vitro CRC model and these promote the ability of tumor cell migration and invasion; in contrast, the SW480 cells with low expression of PLAGL2 showed more epithelial characteristics. Therefore, the current studies consistently suggest that PLAGL2 is a key protein and might have potential to effectively induce cell EMT by itself. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation was necessary for EMT, although it might not be required for the final effects. Previously it was reported that tumor cells undergo EMT in response to Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activation and inhibition of the pathway could induce a reversal in the expression of epithelial to EMT markers with the restoration of the epithelial marker in carcinoma (44). The results of the present study showed that PLAGL2 upregulation modulates Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity in SW480 cells so that tumor cells may obtain the ability of migration and invasion by this pathway activity. Whether PLAGL2 is an indispensable molecule or just facilitate cell EMT is still unclear, its overexpression represents an important initiation step for tumor cells to gain a migration and/or invasion advantage. Intriguingly, when the PLAGL2 transfected SW480 cells were co-cultured with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibitor FH535, the \u03b2-catenin protein expression was significantly prohibited but the PLAGL2 expression maintaining the normal. Therefore, it can be postulated that PLAGL2 overexpression was necessary and initiation for induction of tumor cell EMT progression and PLAGL2 acts as the upstream molecule in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in favor of EMT rather than directly acting EMT itself. This observation indicated that PLAGL2 may be an essential bio-factor in tumor cell migration and invasion that is upregulated in CRC, and its depletion might be accompanied by profound inhibition of EMT and thus could be a novel therapeutic target in metastatic carcinoma. We further defined the relationships of \u03b2-catenin in nucleus and plasma using nucleus plasma isolation techniques. It can be seen that with the overexpression of the PLAGl2, the expression level of \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus increased and the change in plasma was not obvious. These results clearly told us that PLAGL2 mainly regulates the expression of \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus. Finally, to confirm that PLAGL2 acts as a tumor EMT promoter during colorectal cancer lung metastasis in vivo. The intra-vital video microscopy (IVVM) technique was used to show an early and constant enhanced tumor metastasis and growth progression. PLAGL2 overexpressing SW480 cell injection into rats led to an increase of tumor colony formation on the pulmonary pleura in both very early and late stage, compared with the SW480 cell control group and the PLAGL2 silenced group. In conclusion, the present study characterized PLAGL2 as a key regulator of EMT in SW480 cells, because increased migration and invasion activities of SW480 cells observed with PLAGL2 transfection. Additionally, the findings of this study also indicate that EMT activity contributed to the overexpression of PLAGL2 molecule influencing several EMT relative protein expression alteration. These data suggested that, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be involved in the EMT and PLAGL2 might contribute substantially to the basic role of procession. However, the accurate mechanism of PLAGL2 function on Wnt/\u03b2-catenin will have to be addressed in our follow-up study."}, "28260110": {"pmid": "28260110", "pmcid": "PMC5364834", "title": "Inhibitory effect of emodin on fatty acid synthase, colon cancer proliferation and apoptosis", "abstract": "\nFatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key anabolic enzyme for de novo fatty acid synthesis, which is important in the development of colon carcinoma. The high expression of FASN is considered a promising molecular target for colon cancer therapy. Emodin, a naturally occurring anthraquinone, exhibits an anticancer effect in various types of human cancer, including colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The apoptosis rate of cells was quantified via flow cytometry following Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. FASN activity was measured by monitoring oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate at a wavelength of 340 nm, and intracellular free fatty acid levels were detected using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification kit. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect target gene and protein expression. The present study was performed to investigate whether the gene expression of FASN and its enzymatic activity are regulated by emodin in a human colon cancer cell line. Emodin markedly inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells and a higher protein level of FASN was expressed, compared with that in SW480, SNU-C2A or SNU-C5 cells. Emodin significantly downregulated the protein expression of FASN in HCT116 cells, which was caused by protein degradation due to elevated protein ubiquitination. Emodin also inhibited intracellular FASN enzymatic activity and reduced the levels of intracellular free fatty acids. Emodin enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The combined treatment of emodin and cerulenin, a commercial FASN inhibitor, had an additive effect on these activities. Palmitate, the final product of the FASN reaction, rescued emodin-induced viability and apoptosis. In addition, emodin altered FASN-involved signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2. These results suggested that emodin-regulated cell growth and apoptosis were mediated by inhibiting FASN and provide a molecular basis for colon cancer therapy.\n", "fulltext": "Colon cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide, as >1,000,000 individuals are diagnosed with colorectal cancer annually, resulting in a mortality rate of ~715,000 in 2010, compared with 490,000 in 1990 (1,2). It is more common in developed countries, in which >65% of cases are found (3). Colon cancer treatment options include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy; however, options are limited for patients with advanced colon cancer. Therefore, the identification of novel therapeutic targets is important to develop a therapeutic strategy, which may improve survival rates. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a multifunctional enzyme, which catalyzes fatty acid synthesis from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a cofactor. FASN is the key enzyme for de novo long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis. In normal human tissues or cells, FASN is downregulated following the ingestion of a sufficient level of dietary fatty acids. However, several solid tumor and cell lines derived from these tumors overexpress FASN (4). The different expression levels of FASN between cancer and normal tissues suggest that FASN may be a potential target for cancer therapy (5). FASN relies on enzymatic activity for survival and proliferation in various types of human cancer (6). The pharmacological or genetic inhibition of FASN induces growth arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells (7\u20139). Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone found in certain plants and has been evaluated for its antiproliferative and apoptotic activities in various cancer cell lines, including breast (10), liver (11), lung (12), prostate (13) and cervical cancer (14), leukemia (15) and colon cancer (16). Emodin has an anticancer effect based on the suppression of migration, invasion and angiogenesis (17,18). The underlying mechanism of the anticancer activities of emodin includes generating reactive oxygen species (12) and inhibiting the expression of casein kinase II (19), protein kinase C (20), extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 (21), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor phosphorylation (22) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)/neu tyrosine kinase (23). However, the function of emodin in the FASN-induced toxicity of human colon cancer cells remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effects of FASN on intracellular fatty acid biosynthesis in emodin-induced cytotoxicity. The findings suggested that emodin may be a novel FASN inhibitor and may assist in formulating a therapeutic strategy for colon cancer.

The HCT116 and SW480 human colon cancer cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA), and cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS (v/v) and penicillin (100 U/ml)/streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml). The SNU-C2A and SNU-C5 cell lines were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea) and were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The cells were seeded at a density of 5\u00d7103 cells/ml in 96-well microplates and allowed to attach for 24 h. Following treatment of emodin (10\u201350 \u00b5M) and/or cerulenin (100 \u00b5M) for 6\u201324 h, cell cytotoxicity and/or proliferation were assessed using CCK8. Briefly, water-soluble tetrazolium salt, WST-8[2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt], produces an orange water-soluble product, formazan. The quantity of formazan dye generated by dehydrogenases in the cells is directly proportional to the number of living cells. CCK8 (10 \u00b5l) was added to each well and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C, following which cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were assessed by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Three replicate wells were used for each experimental condition. The cells were harvested using Trypsin-EDTA, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed with lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM PI, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF, and placed on ice for 1 h with occasional vortexing. Centrifugation followed at 13,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to collect the supernatant. A Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was used to determine the protein concentration. The cell lysate (50 \u00b5g) was subjected to 6 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in Tris-Glycine buffer (25 mM Tris, 200 mM Glycine and 20% methanol) for 2 h (60 V). The blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 h at 25\u00b0C and were then incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:3,000) for 2 h at room temperature and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Following drug treatment, the cells were subjected to total RNA isolation using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentrations were determined by measuring the absorption at 260 nm in a spectrophotometer. Aliquots of 1 \u00b5g total RNA from each sample were reverse transcribed into cDNA in a total volume of 20 ul using AccuPower\u00ae CycleScript RT PreMix (dT20) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR primers (10 pM) used in the present study were as follows: FASN, forward 5\u2032-CTTGCAGGAGTTCTGGGACA and reverse 5\u2032-CCGTCCACGATGGCTTCATA; GAPDH, forward 5\u2032-TAGACGGGAAGCTCACTGGC-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-AGGTCCACCACCCTGTTGCT-3\u2032. The PCR reactions were subjected to the following amplification conditions: denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 sec and extension at 68\u00b0C for 60 sec. FASN and GAPDH were incubated for 40 cycles. The PCR products (10 \u00b5l) were separated on a 1% agarose gel and detected using ethidium bromide staining. Following exposure to emodin and/or cerulenin, cells were harvested and suspended with cold PBS. The cells were sonicated at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min to obtain particle-free supernatants. FASN activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the decrease of absorption at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH, as previously described (24). Particle-free supernatant (20 \u00b5l), 25 mM KH2PO4-K2HPO4 buffer, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, 30 \u00b5M acetyl-CoA and 350 \u00b5M NADPH (pH 7.0) in a total volume of 200 \u00b5l were monitored at 340 nm for 5 min to measure background NADPH oxidation. Following the addition of 100 \u00b5M of malonyl-CoA, the reaction was assayed for an additional 3 min to determine FASN-dependent oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm again. Following treatment of cells with emodin and/or cerulenin at the corresponding concentration and for the indicated durations, the cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS. The levels of intracellular free fatty acids were measured in the cells using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification Colorimetric kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The samples were measured against a standard of varying concentrations of palmitic acid (provided by the kit) and the optical density was measured at 570 nm in a 96-well microplate reader (VersaMax ELISA microplate reader; VersaMax; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The levels of free fatty acid in the samples were calculated using the slope of the standard curve, with the concentration expressed as nmol/\u00b5l. The cells were cultured at a 106 density and treated with emodin and/or or cerulenin for 24 h. The cells were centrifuged and washed three times with PBS. The supernatant was discarded and resuspended in 0.5 ml of cold PBS. The cells were processed and labeled according to the EzWay Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit used for this assay. The labeled cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto\u2122 II; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The cells (1\u00d7105 cells/ml) were suspended in 300 \u00b5l PBS to which 700 \u00b5l ethanol was added. The cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, washed with PBS and suspended in 250 \u00b5l of 1.12% sodium citrate buffer (pH 8.4) together with 12.5 \u00b5g RNase. Incubation was continued at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The cellular DNA was stained by applying 250 \u00b5l propidium iodide (50 \u00b5g/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. The stained cells were analyzed by fluorescent activated cell sorting on the BD FACSCanto\u2122 II flow cytometer using BD FACSDiva\u2122 Software v. 6. 1. 3 (BD Biosciences) to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells. Several colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480, SNU-C2A and SNU-C5) were treated with emodin for 24 h to determine its effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 1A). Emodin exerted a significant dose-dependent antiproliferative effect in the HCT116 cell line (30.4 and 24.2% reduction at concentrations of 25 and 50 \u00b5M, respectively; Fig. 1A). Among the cell lines, HCT116 cells expressed the highest protein level of FASN, whereas SW480, SNU-C2A and SNU-C5 cells expressed lower protein levels of FASN (Fig. 1B). The results of the western blot analysis showed that emodin downregulated the protein expression of FASN, particularly in the HCT-116 cells, moderately downregulated expression in the SNU-C5 cells, and had no effect in the SW480 or SNU-C2A cells (Fig. 1C). Cell proliferation decreased and the expression of FASN was downregulated in SW480 cells following exposure to emodin for 48 h (data not shown). This result showed that emodin-induced cell death may be associated with the overexpression of FASN. Emodin (25 and 50 \u00b5M) significantly downregulated the protein expression of FASN in HCT116 cells (Fig. 1C). The HCT116 cells were then treated with emodin and the expression of FASN was measured over time (0\u201324 h). The protein levels of FASN decreased following exposure to emodin for 6 h and were significantly decreased at 24 h (Fig. 2A). The mRNA level of FASN also decreased following emodin treatment; however, the effect on protein was more marked, compared with that on mRNA (Fig. 2A). CHX, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis, was added during emodin (25 \u00b5M) exposure to examine whether emodin regulates degradation of the FASN protein in HCT116 cells. Degradation of the FASN protein increased with an additive effect in the presence of emodin and CHX (Fig. 2B). Protein degradation is usually triggered by ubiquitin moieties attaching to protein. Therefore, the present study examined whether emodin induced protein ubiquitination in the HCT116 cells. The results showed that emodin induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 2C), and MG-132 was used as a potent proteasome inhibitor. Whether emodin stimulated lysosomal activity was also examined. Emodin did not convert LC3-I to the smaller form, LC3-II, which is an autophagy marker (Fig. 2D). This result suggested that emodin induced the degradation of FASN protein caused by increased protein ubiquitination activity. A high expression level of FASN is a molecular change associated with colon cancer. In the present study, the cells were incubated with 25 \u00b5M emodin and/or the FASN inhibitor cerulenin (100 \u00b5M) for 24 h to evaluate cellular FASN activity. Emodin reduced cellular FASN activity in the HCT116 cells to 39.2%, cerulenin reduced FASN activity to 60.4% and the two in combination reduced FASN activity to 53.8% (Fig. 3A). The overexpression of FASN in several types of cancer markedly induces de novo lipogenesis, including phospholipids, which are necessary for de novo synthesis of the cell membrane (25). Thus, inhibiting FASN can reduce the levels of phospholipids and free fatty acids required (26). The present study measured free fatty acids using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification lit, as the primary function of FASN is to catalyze long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis. Emodin treatment reduced the level of intracellular free fatty acids (Fig. 3B). The emodin-induced (25 \u00b5M) FASN inhibitory activities were more marked, compared with those of cerulenin (100 \u00b5M) in HCT116 cells. These results indicated that emodin inhibited FASN function. To assess whether the FASN inhibitor, cerulenin, enhances the emodin-induced expression of FASN in HCT116 cells, the cells were incubated with emodin (25 \u00b5M) and/or cerulenin (100 \u00b5M) for 24 h. The combined treatment of emodin and cerulenin decreased the protein expression of FASN, compared with either treatment alone (Fig. 4A). To determine whether cerulenin enhanced emodin-induced anticancer effects in HCT116 cells, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of emodin (10 and 25 \u00b5M) for various durations (6, 12 and 24 h), with or without cerulenin (100 \u00b5M), and performed a CCK8 assay. Emodin exhibited cytotoxic effects in a dose-and time-dependent manner. The combination of emodin and cerulenin induced higher antiproliferative effects, compared with those of emodin or cerulenin alone (Fig. 4B and C). The induction of apoptosis by emodin and/or cerulenin was concordant with the cell viability results. Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining (Fig. 4D) and caspase cleavage (Fig. 4E) following exposure of emodin (25 \u00b5M) and/or cerulenin (100 \u00b5M) for 24 h. The apoptotic effect of emodin and cerulenin in combination was higher, compared with apotosis induced by emodin or cerulenin alone. These results suggested that the emodin-induced inhibition of FASN enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis. In the present study, cells were also treated with emodin and palmitate (75 \u00b5M), the end product of the FASN reaction, to determine whether the emodin-induced cell death activities were associated with inhibiting FASN. In the presence of palmitate, emodin-induced decreased cell viability was increased (Fig. 5A). Propidium iodide staining was used to measure the number of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. Addition exogenous palmitate reduced the level of emodin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). These results suggested that emodin-stimulated cytotoxicity was regulated by fatty acid synthesis. The PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 cascades are involved in cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis associated with FASN regulation in cancer (27\u201329). The present study examined the effect of inhibiting FASN by emodin on PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibiting FASN caused a time-dependent decrease in PI3K/Akt phosphorylation and increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the HCT116 cells (Fig. 6A). The combined treatment with cerulenin enhanced these activities (Fig. 6A). LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) were added with the emodin to determine whether these two pathways regulated the emodin-induced inhibition of FASN. The inhibitors altered the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and ERK modulated by emodin (Fig. 6B and C). These data indicated that the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways regulated the reduced expression of FASN induced by emodin. Different expression levels of FASN between cancerous and normal cells have been suggested as a potential target for anticancer drug development (4). FASN has been implicated in breast cancer predominantly through its connection with the activity of HER2 in transcriptional, proteomic and functional analyses (8,30,31). The expression of FASN also appears to be important in cell growth and pathogenesis in colon cancer (32). FASN is expressed in all colorectal neoplasms and there is a concomitant increase in fatty acid synthesis (32). The overexpression of FASN by tumors is associated with improved survival rates of patients with colon cancer (33), and high serum levels of FASN in patients with colorectal cancer are associated with tumor events, lymph node metastasis status, distant metastasis and tumor clinical stage (5). It has been suggested that inhibiting FASN pharmacologically reduces cell growth and survival, and induces the apoptosis of colon cancer cells (34). For example, cerulenin, a natural FASN inhibitor, enhances antitumor activity when combined with oxaliplatin in human colon cancer cells (35) and suppresses liver metastasis of colon cancer (36). C75, a stable synthetic small molecule developed specifically for inhibiting FASN, produces a cytotoxic effect modulated by p53 in colon carcinoma cells (37). Naturally occurring olive oil polyphenols have the ability to suppress FASN, providing a well-tolerated novel colon cancer therapy (38). However, no studies have reported that emodin has FASN inhibitory activity in cancer. It has been suggested that emodin may be a fat-reducing drug by inhibiting FASN (39). The findings of the present study revealed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that emodin suppressed the protein expression of FASN and reduced its activity in human colorectal cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, the HCT116 cell line had significantly elevated expression levels of FASN, compared with levels in the other colon cancer cell lines. This elevated expression of FASN in HCT116 cells was more effective in reducing cancer cell death following emodin treatment, compared with cells with a low expression level of FASN (Fig. 1A). Emodin only downregulated the expression of FASN in HCT116 cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that emodin-induced cell death may be regulated by FASN-involved de novo fatty acid synthesis. These data suggested that inhibiting FASN may be an effective strategy for treating colon cancer overexpressing FASN. Previous studies have demonstrated that emodin suppresses tumor growth in LS1034 human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (40), induces apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress in colon cancer cells (16) and inhibits colon cancer cell growth by inhibiting VEGFR signaling (22). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying emodin-induced cell death in colorectal cancer cells have not been investigated in detail. Until now, no studies have reported the effect of emodin on the expression of FASN or its activity in cancer, including colorectal cancer. The present study found that emodin suppressed the expression of FASN by degrading FASN protein, which was caused by elevated protein ubiquitination, in HCT116 cells (Figs. 1C and 2). Tomek et al (9) reported that inhibiting FASN with C75 results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, including PI3K and MAPK signaling proteins, in ovarian cancer (9). Emodin also induces the proteosomal degradation of EGFR/EGFR variant III in glioma stem cells (41). However, no previous study has reported that emodin induces the degradation of FASN protein. In the present study, emodin concomitantly inhibited FASN activity and downregulated the protein expression of FASN (Fig. 3A and B). FASN is a key lipogenic enzyme. The overexpression of FASN in several types of cancer induces de novo lipogenesis, which is involved in cell survival, proliferation, migration and invasion (27). Therefore, downregulating the activity of FASN in cancer cells is necessary for tumor cell death. The present study determined concentrations of free fatty acids using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification kit (Fig. 3B). Emodin reduced the concentration of fatty acids, indicating that emodin inhibited the function of FASN in HCT116 cells. FASN is essential for the proliferation and survival of human colorectal carcinoma cells, as demonstrated by the FASN inhibitor, which reduces the cell growth and promotes apoptosis (42). The present study hypothesized that emodin induces colorectal cancer apoptosis by inhibiting the expression and function of FASN. It was shown that emodin produced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in HCT116 cell viability (Fig. 4B and C) and induced apoptosis, as shown by Annexin/propidium iodide double staining and caspase cleavage (Fig. 4D and E). It was also observed that cell viability and apoptosis were partially rescued following the addition of palmitate, which is the final product of FASN activity (Fig. 5A and B). Palmitate-induced toxicity has been reported in various cell lines; however, the present study demonstrated that exogenous palmitate and emodin treatment increased HCT116 cell viability. These results suggested that inhibiting FASN was a direct contributor to the anticancer effects of emodin on HCT116 colon cancer cells, and that fatty acid synthesis was closely associated with colon cancer cell death. The PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways promote cell proliferation, survival and the anti-apoptotic response, and have been implicated in regulating the expression of FASN in cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer (28,43). The level of FASN and activity of Akt are higher in HER2-positive cancer, and inhibiting fatty acid synthesis affects the HER2 and PI3K/Akt pathways (42). FASN is regulated in malignancies by growth factor-dependent signaling, which activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways (44). The downregulation of PI3K/Akt phosphorylation can attenuate the expression of FASN (27). The FASN inhibitor, C75, inhibits pAkt, but increases pERK1/2 in ovarian cancer cells (7); the \u03b1-mangostin-induced inhibition of FASN decreases pAkt, but increases active pERK1/2 in breast cancer cells (27). In the present study, it was found that emodin downregulated pPI3K and pAkt in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Emodin upregulated active levels of pERK1/2 in HCT116 cells (Fig. 6A). These data demonstrated that the emodin-induced inhibition of FASN may be associated with the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in colorectal cancer. The findings of the present study suggested that emodin downregulated the expression of FASN, inhibited intracellular FASN activity and fatty acid biosynthesis, and induced antiproliferation and apoptosis in HCT116 human colon cancer cells. Therefore, the results showed that emodin has therapeutic potential as a colon cancer treatment, and may provide a novel method in developing target-directed anticancer drugs for further investigations."}, "28204828": {"pmid": "28204828", "pmcid": "PMC5360358", "title": "TIEG1 deficiency confers enhanced myocardial protection in the infarcted heart by mediating the Pten/Akt signalling pathway", "abstract": "\nThe transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1) plays a crucial role in modulating cell apoptosis and proliferation in a number of diseases, including pancreatic cancer, leukaemia and osteoporosis. However, the functional role of TIEG1 in the heart has not been fully defined. In this study, we first investigated the role of TIEG1 in ischaemic heart disease. For in vitro experiments, cardiomyocytes were isolated from both TIEG1 knockout (KO) and wile-type (WT) mice, and the apoptotic ratios were evaluated after a 48-h ischaemic insult. A cell proliferation assay was performed after 7 days of incubation under normoxic conditions. In addition, the angiogenic capacity of endothelial cells was determined by tube formation assay. For in vivo experiments, a model of myocardial infarction (MI) was established using both TIEG1 KO and WT mice. Echocardiography was performed at 3 and 28 days post-MI, whereas the haemodynamics test was performed 28 days post-MI. Histological analyses of apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis and infarct zone assessments were performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining, BrdU immunostaining, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)/CD31 immunostaining and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. Changes in the expression of related proteins caused by TIEG1 deficiency were confirmed using both reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Our results demonstrated that the absence of TIEG1 prevented cardiomyocytes from undergoing apoptosis and promoted higher proliferation; it stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Improved cardiac function and less scar formation were observed in TIEG1 KO mice, and we also observed the altered expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), Akt and Bcl-2/Bax, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). On the whole, our findings indicate that the absence of TIEG1 plays a cardioprotective role in ischaemic heart disease by promoting changes in Pten/Akt signalling.\n", "fulltext": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and extended ischaemia leads to irreversible myocardial damage (1,2), which results in pathological ventricular remodelling (3). Therefore, strategies with which to reduce the myocardial injury have been the focus of studies on MI (4,5). The transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-inducible early gene-1 (TIEG1), also known as Kruppel-like factor 10, was first discovered in foetal osteoblasts using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (6). TIEG1 expression is induced by TGF-\u03b2, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and other cytokines (7). It is located in multiple cell types and tissues, such as myocytes, tumour tissues and osteoblasts (8,9). The TIEG1 gene encodes a 72 kDa protein, which regulates cell growth and apoptosis (10,11). There has been significant progress regarding the role of TIEG1 in various diseases. In the field of cancer studies, Yao et al found that TIEG1 blocked the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of leukaemic cell lines, including HL-60, U937, Raji and K562 in both a time- and dose-dependent manner (12). Jiang et al proved that the transactivation of TIEG1 inhibited the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner (13). Moreover, Jin et al demonstrated that TIEG1 inhibited the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer by suppressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transcription and the EGFR-related signalling pathway (14). However, the biological function of TIEG1 in the cardiovascular field remains unclear. In 2011, Miyake et al discovered that TIEG1 was a feedback regulator of myostatin in myoblasts (9), and Li et al illustrated that TIEG1 played a novel role as a blocker in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy via the GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) signalling pathway (15). In this study, we investigated both the functional changes and underlying pathway variations caused by TIEG1 deficiency in ischaemic heart disease, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments in an aim to fully determine the role of TIEG1 in heart disease. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China and met the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and 10 TIEG1 knockout (KO) mice (aged 6\u20138 weeks; C57BL/6 background) were purchased from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China for research purposes only. The mice were housed in cages in a controlled environment (12 h light/dark) with an ambient humidity of 50\u201380% and a temperature of 21\u00b14\u00b0C. Food and water were available ad libitum. Neonatal ventricular CMs were prepared as described previously (16,17). Briefly, the hearts from 10 other 24-h-old TIEG1 KO and WT mice were removed and dissociated with 0.1% trypsin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The dispersed cells were cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplemented high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (glucose concentration, 4 g/l) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 90 min. Unadherent cells were harvested and seeded on the bottom of 24-well plates (2.5\u00d7105 cells/well) or 6-well plates (1\u00d7106 cells/well). Murine endothelial cells were isolated from 10 WT and TIEG KO adult mice as previously described (18) with some modifications. The mice were sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane, the lungs were separated and minced into small pieces, washed in Hank's buffer and digested with dispase for 1 h. The homogenate was passed through a filter and centrifuged at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min. The resulting cells were suspended and purified with anti-mouse VE-cadherin antibody-coated magnetic beads (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany). The collected cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, endothelial cell growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) penicillin (50 U/ml) and streptomycin (50 \u00b5g/ml). The endothelial cells from the first two passages were >95% Dil-Ac-LDL positive for purification. The cells at passage 3\u20136 were then prepared for use in the in vitro experiments. The neonatal CMs were seeded at 1\u00d7104 cells/well in 24-well plates and apoptosis was induced under hypoxic conditions (0.1% O2, 5% CO2) in FBS-free medium for 48 h. The apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining (In Situ Cell Death kit, TMR red; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Briefly, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilised in 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with primary antibodies [troponin I (TnI; ab47003); Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA] overnight followed by the respective fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies [goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (DyLight 488; ab96883); and goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (DyLight 550; ab96884); both from Abcam]. Following 3 washes with 0.1% Tween-20 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the CMs were incubated with the reaction mixture provided with the TUNEL kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell nucleuses were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Fluorescence images were acquired using a Leica fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Cell proliferation was determined by Ki67 immunostaining. Neonatal CMs were seeded at 1\u00d7104 cells/well in 24-well plates and cultured under normoxic conditions (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 5% O2) for 7 days. The proliferating cells were detected by double staining with Ki67 and TnI. Briefly, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 5% BSA after 10 min of permeabilization, and incubated with primary antibodies [Ki67 (ab16667), TnI (ab30807) both from Abcam] overnight followed by the respective fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies [donkey anti-rabbit IgG H&L (DyLight 488; ab96891); and donkey anti-goat IgG H&L (DyLight 550; ab96932); both from Abcam]. After 3 washes with PBST, the cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate 1 \u00b5g/ml (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were then acquired using a Leica fluorescence microscope. To investigate the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells in vitro, the cells were seeded at a concentration of 2\u00d7104 cells onto each growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA)-coated well of a 96-well plate. Following 4\u20136 h of incubation, the capillary network structures of the endothelial cells were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), and the total number of inter-branches was evaluated using Image-Pro software. All animal research protocols met with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Publication no. 85-23, (revised in 1996) and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang Province Medical Institute. The WT and TIEG1 KO mice were subjected to MI as previously described (19,20). Briefly, the mice were anaesthetised intraperitoneally with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg) and ventilated with a rodent ventilator via tracheal intubation. The hearts were exposed through a lateral thoracotomy, and the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was permanently ligated with a 7-0 silk suture. Paleness around and below the ligation point indicated a successful operation. The chest was closed, and the mice were placed back into cages following surgery. Echocardiography was performed at 3 and 28 days post-MI, whereas haemodynamics evaluation was performed 28 days post-MI. Briefly, the mice were anaesthetised via the inhalation of isoflurane at a concentration of 2%, and a transthoracic parasternal M-mode echocardiogram was performed using a Vevo 2100 system. The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD and end-systolic diameter (LVESD) were obtained from at least 3 separate cardiac cycles. The left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) were calculated as follows: 7.0 \u00d7 LVESD3/(2.4 + LVESD), and 7.0\u00d7 LVEDD3/(2.4 + LVEDD), respectively. The ejection fraction (EF, %) and fractional shortening (FS, %) were calculated as follows: [(LVEDV \u2212 LVESV)/LVEDV] \u00d7100, and [(LVEDD \u2212 LVESD)/LVEDD] \u00d7100, respectively. Cardiac catheterization was performed with a catheter conducer (Millar Instrument, Houston, TX, USA) for haemodynamic assessment. A 1.4F pressure catheter, SPR-671, was inserted into the aorta and left ventricle through the right carotid artery. The transducer was connected to measure the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and left ventricular maximum \u00b1dp/dt. The animals were sacrificed, and the excised hearts were immediately placed in a 10% KCl solution to induce cardiac arrest during the diastolic phase. The left and right atria of the heart were removed, leaving the left ventricle, and dehydrated in a 30% sucrose solution. The samples were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA) compound and snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections of the left ventricle were cut into a 7-\u00b5m-thick sections. After preparing 3-day-post-MI samples, TUNEL assay was used to measure the ratio of CM apoptosis in the border zone according to manufacturer's instructions. The slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with primary antibodies (TnI; Abcam) overnight followed by the respective fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies. After 3 washes with 0.1% Tween-20 PBS, the sections were incubated in equilibration buffer accroding to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide and TdT enzyme mixture were added to the samples at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate 1 \u00b5g/ml (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were obtained using a Leica fluorescence microscope. The ratio of TUNEL-positive CMs was analysed using the quantitative software Image-Pro Plus. For BrdU incorporation assay, the 7 day-post-MI heart sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilised in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h. The samples were incubated with primary antibody reacted with BrdU (ab1893, Abcam), which was injected into the heart on the day of the surgery and primary antibody to TnI (ab47003, Abcam) diluted 1:200 at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by incubation with the respective secondary fluorescent antibodies [donkey anti-sheep IgG H&L (DyLight 488; ab96939); and donkey anti-rabbit IgG H&L (DyLight 550; ab96892); both from Abcam]. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and imaging was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The proportion of BrdU-positive CMs was analysed using the quantitative soft-ware Image-Pro Plus. For \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)/CD31 immunostaining, the 7-day-post-MI heart tissue sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilised with 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with PBST containing 5% BSA. The samples were reacted with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (ab21027) and anti-CD31 antibody (ab7388) (both from Abcam) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After several washes with PBST, the samples were reacted with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate 1 \u00b5g/ml. The fluorescence photographs were obtained at 4\u20135 randomly selected high visual fields in the border zone of ischaemic myocardium/sample and calculated average number of microvessels/visual field with a Leica fluorescence microscope. The scar size of the 28-day-post-MI samples was measured using Masson's trichrome staining. Briefly, the frozen tissue sections of heart tissues from different groups were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the Masson's trichrome kit (HT15, Sigma-Aldrich). The fibrosis and total left ventricular area of each image were measured using Image-Pro Plus software. The infarct area was calculated as the percentage (%) of the infarcted area divided by the entire left ventricle. Total RNA was extracted from the CMs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2 \u00b5g of RNA using Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT)18 primer (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the SYBR-Green Reaction Mix (Takara) following the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR conditions were 95\u00b0C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec and 40 cycles of 72\u00b0C for 1 min. The PCR primers were designed using Primer3 Input online software and are listed in Table I. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a control, and the relative expression of the target genes were evaluated by a comparative CT method and normalised to the control. After a 48-h incubation under hypoxic conditions and FBS-free stimulation, the CMs were rinsed with PBS, lysed in 2.5X sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel loading buffer [30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 12.5% glycerol and 2.5% mercaptoethanol] and boiled for 30 min. We also rinsed the endothelial cells with PBS, lysed them in 2.5X SDS gel loading buffer [ mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 12.5% glycerol and 2.5% mercaptoethanol] followed by boiling for 30 min. Equal amounts of the cell lysates were loaded, and the proteins were separated on 8\u201312% SDS polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Boston, MA, USA). After the non-specific binding sites were blocked with 5% non-fat milk, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies, TIEG1 (1:500; A302-015A, Bethyl, Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA), Pten (1:500; 9559), p-Akt (1:500; 13038), t-Akt (1:500; 14702), Bcl-2 (1:500; 3498), Bax (1:500; 2772), caspase-3 (1:500; 9664) (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), VEGF (1:500; Abcam) and actin (1:3,000; Kangchen, Shanghai, China), followed by horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (sc-2357; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) incubated at room temperature. After washing with PBST, the protein bands were visualised using the Gel Doc EZ Imaging System and analysed using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All the data are presented as the means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses for the measurement of significant differences between the TIEG1 KO and WT groups were performed using the Student's t-test. Probability values of P<0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences. To examine the biological role of TIEG1 in CM apoptosis, CMs isolated from TIEG1 KO and WT mice underwent 48 h of exposure to hypoxic conditions. We evaluated TUNEL-positive cells and found that TIEG1 deficiency led to an approximately 15% decrease in the apoptosis of myocytes in the border areas compared to the WT group (P<0.05; Fig. 1A and D). To determine the functional role of TIEG1 in CM proliferation, Ki67 immunostaining was performed. We calculated the number of Ki67-positive cells and found that TIEG1 deficiency led to a 20% greater number of proliferative CMs than the WT mice (P<0.05; Fig. 1B and E). To determine the functional role of TIEG1 in endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation was performed. We calculated the length of capillary structure in the TIEG1 KO and WT group, and found that the endothelial cells from the TIEG1 KO mice had a greater powerful ability of microvessel formation than those from the WT mice (P<0.05; Fig. 1C and F). To determine whether TIEG1 plays a key role in cardiac function, we evaluated the myocardial contractile parameters at 3 and 28 days post-MI in mice. The echocardiographic results indicated that the absence of TIEG1 led to an improvement in heart function compared to the WT group at 28 days post-MI (Fig. 2A), including a better EF (TIEG1 KO, 41.496\u00b12.131%; WT, 27.616\u00b12.503%), and FS (TIEG1 KO, 23.522\u00b10.870%; WT, 17.536\u00b11.585%) (P<0.05; Fig. 2B and C). Furthermore, the LVEDD and LVESD were shorter in the TIEG1 KO mouse hearts than in the WT group at 28 days post-MI (LVEDD: TIEG1 KO, 3.841\u00b10.122 mm; WT, 4.165\u00b10.108 mm; LVESD: TIEG1 KO, 2.950\u00b10.133 mm; WT, 3.420\u00b10.112 mm) (P<0.05; Fig. 2D and E). Moreover, the haemodynamic results revealed a similar effect. Compared to the WT group, the TIEG1 KO mice had a significantly higher LVSP, a lower LVEDP and a higher \u00b1dp/dt (TIEG1 KO: LVSP, 125\u00b112 mmHg; LVEDP, 2.4\u00b10.8 mmHg; dp/dt, 11500\u00b11050; \u2212dp/dt, \u22129700\u00b1790 mm; WT: LVSP, 95\u00b17 mmHg; LVEDP, 5.9\u00b11.1 mmHg; dp/dt, 7800\u00b11100; \u2212dp/dt, \u22125400\u00b1850) (P<0.05; Fig. 2F\u2013I). To evaluate the effect of TIEG1 on infarct size variation, Masson's trichrome staining was used. The quantitative assessment of myocardial fibrosis indicated that the TIEG1-deficient mice had reduced 10% scar area compared to the WT group (P<0.05; Fig. 4A and B). We validated the role of TIEG1 in apoptosis in vivo using TUNEL staining in 3-day samples. Our findings revealed that the defect of TIEG1 markedly decreased the number of apoptotic nuclei in the border zone compared to the WT group (P<0.05; Fig. 3A and B). The proliferation ratio of myocytes in the border area of 7-day-samples was measured by immunostaining with BrdU antibody. We observed more double-positive staining of BrdU and TnI (P<0.05; Fig. 3C and D) in the CMs in the border zones from the TIEG1 KO mice than those from the WT mice. We validated the role of TIEG1 in angiogenesis in vivo using immunofluorescence staining in 28-day-samples. Our findings suggested that the defect of TIEG1 markedly increased microvessel formation in the border zone compared to the WT group (P<0.05; Fig. 3E\u2013H). In order to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for the anti-apoptotic effects observed with the loss of TIEG1 in CMs, we analysed the relative expression levels of Pten/Akt and Bcl-2/Bax signalling pathway molecules by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Our results revealed that a deficiency in TIEG1 led to the differential expression of the Pten/Akt and Bcl-2/Bax signalling pathway molecules at the mRNA and protein level. Specifically, the deficiency of TIEG1 decreased the expression of Pten, Bax and caspase-3, and increased the p-Akt/t-Akt ratio and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio (P<0.05; Fig. 4C\u2013E). We also examined the expression of related molecules in the Pten/Akt and Bcl-2/Bax signalling pathways in endothelial cells. Our results revealed the deficiency of TIEG1 also decreased Pten expression in endothelial cells, as in the CMs, and increased VEGF expression (P<0.05; Fig. 4F\u2013H). Our study first assessed the role of TIEG1 in reducing myocardial damage and promoting microvessel generation in the infarcted heart. The major findings of our study are as follows: i) the lack of TIEG1 improves heart function and haemodynamics; ii) the absence of TIEG1 results in less myocardial apoptosis and greater myocyte proliferation, as shown by both in vitro and in vivo experiments; and iii) TIEG1 deficiency causes the variable expression of the Pten/Akt and Bcl-2/Bax signalling pathways; thus, these are the mechanisms through which TIEG1 deficiency has cardioprotective effects. A number of studies have revealed the biological functions of TIEG1 in different cells (12,15,21). Of these properties, apoptosis induction and proliferation inhibition by TIEG1 have garnered attention from researchers. In the field of oncology, higher levels of TIEG1 protein have been shown to be expressed in epithelial cells compared to breast tumour cells, whereas it was absent in infiltrative tumour tissues, demonstrating its inhibitory role in cell growth (22). The results of haematological tumour analyses have also demonstrated the effects of TIEG1 (23,24). Jin et al found that TIEG1 is a key regulator that promotes the apoptosis of K562 leukaemic cells (25). Furthermore, TIEG1 has been shown to promote the apoptosis of different leukaemia cell lines, such as HL-60, U937, Raji and K562, in a dose- and time-dependent manner (12). For cardiovascular diseases, TIEG1 was first reported to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy in 2007 (26), and this result was confirmed in a later clinic study (27). Currently, TIEG1 prevents CMs from Ang II-mediated hypertrophy, which provides a novel strategy for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy (15). Although the effect of TIEG1 on hypertrophy has been studied, the functional role of TIEG1 in myocardial infarction remains unknown. In this study, we examined cell apoptosis and proliferation in the myocardium both in vitro and in vivo, in a TIEG1-deficient mouse model of MI compared to a WT mouse model of MI. Moreover, we characterised the heart function and haemodynamics of the TIEG1 KO mice and investigated the underlying pathway responsible for these phenotypic changes. For our in vitro experiments, CMs from TIEG1 KO mice were significantly more resistant to apoptosis according to the results of TUNEL assay. By contrast, Ki67 immunostaining demonstrated that the lack of TIEG1 was also beneficial to myocyte proliferation. These results suggest the acceleration of apoptosis and the suppression of proliferation by TIEG1 in CMs, which have not been previously reported, at least to the best of our knowledge. Notably, our findings using the animal model of MI also revealed that the TIEG1 KO mice had better cardiac functional recovery than WT mice following coronary artery ligation surgery. The results of histological analysis confirmed greater myocardium preservation and a smaller scar area in the TIEG1 KO infarcted mouse heart than in the WT mouse hearts. Our results provide strong evidence for the apoptosis-promoting role of TIEG1 in CMs both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis can be initiated by the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway. This pathway is controlled by the Bcl-2 protein family, which is critical for regulating apoptosis and cell survival. Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by forming heterodimers with Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein, to stop its release (28). Bcl-2 and Bax are relevant to apoptosis in CMs, and they are apoptosis involved factors in myocytes under ischaemic conditions (29,30). A correlation between TIEG1 and Bcl/Bax in tumour cells has been confirmed (12); however, this remains unclear in cardiovascular cells. The tumour suppressor gene, Pten, inactivates the signalling pathway by promoting protein phosphatase to reduce tumour cell growth and invasion (31,32). Similarly, Pten inhibition results in cardioprotective effects against ischaemia reperfusion injury of the myocardium by stimulating apoptotic survival signals (33). Furthermore, the inactivation of the Pten gene is regulated by transcriptional modification (34). Pten and Bcl-2/Bax are associated with apoptosis, and they are critical apoptosis factors in CMs. In this study, we found an increased Bcl-2 expression, and decreased Bax and downregulated expression of Pten caused by TIEG1 deficiency at both the mRNA and protein level in CMs, which is key to protecting CMs against apoptosis. However, the details of this process require further investigation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the deletion of TIEG1 results in a significant anti-apoptotic effect for myocardium salvage following ischaemic injury. The cardioprotective effects caused by TIEG1 defects are associated with variations in the expression of Pten, Akt and Bcl-2/Bax. These data suggest that TIEG1 may be a novel target for the effective therapy of MI."}, "27630165": {"pmid": "27630165", "pmcid": "PMC5055201", "title": "Long-Lived CD4+IFN-\u03b3+ T Cells rather than Short-Lived CD4+IFN-\u03b3+IL-10+ T Cells Initiate Rapid IL-10 Production To Suppress Anamnestic T Cell Responses during Secondary Malaria Infection", "abstract": "\nCD4+ T cells that produce IFN-\u03b3 are the source of host-protective IL-10 during primary infection with a number of different pathogens, including Plasmodium spp. The fate of these CD4+IFN-\u03b3+IL-10+ T cells following clearance of primary infection and their subsequent influence on the course of repeated infections is, however, presently unknown. In this study, utilizing IFN-\u03b3\u2013yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and IL-10\u2013GFP dual reporter mice, we show that primary malaria infection\u2013induced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells have limited memory potential, do not stably express IL-10, and are disproportionately lost from the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell memory population during the maintenance phase postinfection. CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells generally exhibited a short-lived effector rather than effector memory T cell phenotype postinfection and expressed high levels of PD-1, Lag-3, and TIGIT, indicative of cellular exhaustion. Consistently, the surviving CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell\u2013derived cells were unresponsive and failed to proliferate during the early phase of secondary infection. In contrast, CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell\u2013derived cells expanded rapidly and upregulated IL-10 expression during secondary infection. Correspondingly, CD4+ T cells were the major producers within an accelerated and amplified IL-10 response during the early stage of secondary malaria infection. Notably, IL-10 exerted quantitatively stronger regulatory effects on innate and CD4+ T cell responses during primary and secondary infections, respectively. The results in this study significantly improve our understanding of the durability of IL-10\u2013producing CD4+ T cells postinfection and provide information on how IL-10 may contribute to optimized parasite control and prevention of immune-mediated pathology during repeated malaria infections.\n", "fulltext": "The cytokine IL-10 plays a central role in determining the outcome of many different infections, including malaria (1, 2). In murine models of primary malaria infection, IL-10 is critical for repressing the development of immune-mediated pathology in tissues, including the liver, lung, and brain (3\u20137). In agreement, levels of IL-10 are frequently lower in individuals with severe Plasmodium falciparum infections compared with individuals with mild or asymptomatic infections (8, 9). Nevertheless, in both human and murine malaria infections, overproduction or mistimed production of IL-10 can also blunt protective immune responses during infection, resulting in high parasite burdens and morbidity (10, 11). Although the precise mechanisms of action of IL-10 during malaria infection remain to be defined, it has been shown to suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12 (4, 6). In other models, IL-10 can directly suppress the inflammatory activity of multiple cell types within the innate and adaptive immune compartments, including macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells (1, 2, 12). CD4+ T cells, and in particular the Th1 subset, are the major source of IL-10 during both murine and human malaria infections (3, 5, 13, 14). As a consequence, IL-10\u2013producing Th1 cells are nonredundantly required for attenuation of morbidity and immune-mediated pathology during primary murine malaria infection (3, 5). At present, however, the fate and the memory potential of these IL-10\u2013producing Th1 cells following clearance of primary malaria infection remains unclear, both in mice and in humans. A number of the signals that instruct IL-10 expression by Th1 cells during primary malaria infection, including IL-27R and ICOS, play major roles in programming the development, maintenance, and function of memory T cell populations (15\u201318), implying that IL-10\u2013producing Th1 cells may have a selective advantage in transitioning into long-lived memory cells. In apparent agreement, it has been reported that durable parasite-specific IL-10\u2013, but not IFN-\u03b3\u2013, producing CD4+ T cell responses can be sustained in individuals many years after malaria infection (19). However, in contrast to the results reported by Wipasa et al. (19), long-lived IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing activated CD4+ T cells have been observed during malaria and multiple other infections (20\u201322). Moreover, it has recently been suggested that P. falciparum\u2013induced IL-10 production is maintained only during the duration of active malaria infection (23), and that the frequencies of maintained IL-10\u2013producing CD4+ T cells are inversely correlated with duration from previous exposure (14). These latter results are consistent with the divergent or linear limited potential models of memory T cell development where fully differentiated effector T cells\u2014it is currently thought that IL-10 expression is induced in fully differentiated effector Th1 cells (24, 25)\u2014have limited capacity to form memory T cells (26, 27). Thus, it remains to be definitively resolved, in any model, whether IL-10\u2013producing Th1 cells have the capacity to become long-lived memory cells that subsequently regulate the nature and strength of anamnestic immune responses during secondary infections. Of relevance, it has been hypothesized that infection-acquired protection against severe malaria disease (termed antidisease immunity) involves development of immune mechanisms that attenuate the strong inflammatory responses that contribute toward much of the morbidity and mortality of initial malaria infections (9, 28). At present, the molecular and cellular basis of protective anamnestic immune responses to malaria are unclear (9, 28); however, given the importance of IL-10 in regulating inflammatory responses during malaria infection (1\u20139), it is foreseeable that IL-10 may play a major role in acquired (antidisease) protection against severe malarial disease. Nevertheless, whether primary parasite exposure leads to qualitative or quantitative reprogramming of the dynamics of the IL-10 response during subsequent malaria infections, and whether IL-10 exerts stronger or dichotomous activity during secondary versus primary malaria infections, has yet to be definitively addressed. In this study, utilizing a novel tractable IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 dual reporter system, we have shown that IL-10\u2013producing Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells generated during the early phases of primary malaria infection have limited ability to populate the memory CD4+ T cell compartment that functions during subsequent parasite infections. However, CD4+IFN-\u03b3\u2013yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)+IL-10\u2013GFP\u2212 memory T cells rapidly express IL-10 during parasite re-exposure, which leads to enhanced IL-10 production during secondary malaria infection compared with primary infection. We have addressed the impact of elevated IL-10 production during secondary infection in shaping anamnestic immune responses and demonstrate that IL-10 may play an important role in regulating reactivation of memory CD4+ T cells. Our results significantly increase our understanding of the dynamics and maintenance of IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells postinfection and reveal the functions of IL-10 during secondary parasite infections. All animal work was approved following local ethical review by the University of Manchester Animal Procedures and Ethics Committee and was performed in strict accordance with the U.K. Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (project license 70/7293). IFN-\u03b3 YFP reporter mice (29), IL-10 GFP reporter mice (30), and C57BL/6 CD45.1+ (Pep3) mice were bred and maintained at the University of Manchester in individual ventilated cages. Heterozygous IFN-\u03b3 reporters and homozygous IL-10 reporter mice were intercrossed to generate dual reporter mice. F1 offspring were used in experiments after genotyping for YFP expression by flow cytometry. Sex-matched 6- to 10-wk-old mice were used in separate experiments. Cryopreserved Plasmodium yoelii NL parasites were thawed and passaged through C57BL/6 mice. Experimental mice were subsequently infected with 1 \u00d7 104 parasitized RBCs (pRBCs) via i.v. injection in the tail vein. The course of infection was monitored by microscopic examination of peripheral parasite levels in Giemsa-stained thin blood smears and by assessing weight loss (calculated relative to uninfected starting weight). To terminate primary infection at a defined time point, mice were treated with pyrimethamine in drinking water from day 9 to day 19 of infection. Drugs were also administered to age-matched uninfected mice used as uninfected or primary infection controls. In some experiments, previously infected mice and age-matched controls were infected with 1 \u00d7 104 pRBCs on day 60 after primary infection (secondary infection). In some instances, experimental mice were injected i.p. with 250 \u03bcg anti\u2013IL-10R (Bio X Cell, West Lebanon, NH) on days \u22121, +1, +3, and +5 of primary and secondary infection. Spleens were obtained and animals were subsequently perfused by intracardial injection of 10 ml of PBS before other organs were removed. Single-cell suspensions from spleen and liver were prepared by homogenization through a 70-\u03bcm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). RBCs were lysed (RBC lysing buffer; BD Biosciences) and samples were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (HBSS with 2% FCS). Blood, obtained by cardiac puncture prior to whole-body perfusion, was treated with RBC lysis buffer and resuspended in FACS buffer. Lungs were dissected into chunks and incubated in HBSS containing 2% FCS with collagenase (final concentration 1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min on a tube roller at room temperature. The resulting suspension was filtered through a 70-\u03bcm cell strainer and RBCs were lysed. Samples were refiltered through a 70-\u03bcm cell strainer, washed, and resuspended in FACS buffer. Bone marrow (BM) cells were obtained from the femur by flushing with FACS buffer. Live/dead cell differentiation and absolute cell numbers were calculated by trypan blue exclusion (Sigma-Aldrich) using a C-Chip (NanoEnTek, Pleasanton, CA). Following staining with Live/Dead fixable blue dead cell stain for UV (Life Technologies), CD4+ T cell phenotyping was performed by surface staining with anti-mouse Abs against CD4 (GK1.5), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), CD44 (IM7), CD62L (MEL-14), CD49d (R1-2), CD11a (M17/4), CD127 (A7R34),KLRG1 (2F1), PD-1 (RMP1-30), CD25 (PC61), LAG-3 (C9B7W), CD69 (H1.2F3), ICOS (C398.4A), TIGIT (GIGD7), and CD103 (2E7). Different lymphoid populations were assessed by surface staining with CD3 (17A2), CD40 (1C10), MHC class II (M5/114.15.2), CD8a (53-6.7), CD11c (N418), CD68 (Fa-11), CD49b (DX5), F4-80 (BM8), Ly6C (HK1.4), Ly6G (RB6.8C5), CD19 (6D5), and CD11b (M1/70). All staining cocktails contained a mouse Fc receptor block (clone Fc-G2a). All Abs were purchased from eBioscience or BioLegend. Fluorescence minus one controls were used to validate flow cytometric results. All flow cytometry acquisition was performed using an LSR II (BD Systems, U.K.) under the same application settings, with a configuration including 510/20 nm bandpass and 500 nm longpass (for GFP signal) and 550/30 nm bandpass and 525 nm longpass (for YFP signal) filters. All FACS analyses were performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Splenic CD4+ T cells from malaria-infected (day 7) dual reporter mice were purified by magnetic positive selection using anti-CD4 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. CD4+ T cells were then stained with anti-mouse CD49d and anti-mouse CD11a (as described above). Total CD4+CD49d+CD11a+ T cells and YFP+GFP\u2212 and YFP+GFP+ subsets were isolated by flow cytometric cell sorting (BD FACSAria). The different populations of purified cells were adoptively transferred, separately, by i.v. injection into malaria-infected (day 7) congenic CD45.1+ mice, which were subsequently drug cured as described above. In some experiments recipient mice were reinfected with 1 \u00d7 104 pRBCs on day 60 after primary infection. CD4+CD49d+CD11a+ T cells were sort purified, as described above, from the spleens of day 7 and day 60 infected Pep3 mice. As a control, total CD4+ T cells were purified from spleens of naive mice by magnetic separation. Cells were cultured at 2 \u00d7 105 cell density in 96-well plates and stimulated for either 4 h with 200 ng/ml PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 \u03bcg/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 24 and 72 h with 2 \u03bcg/ml anti-CD3 (BD Biosciences) and 2 \u03bcg/ml anti-CD28 (eBioscience). Cell supernatants were removed and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The concentrations of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-10 in supernatants were measured by a cytometric bead array mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine kit (BD Biosciences), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The concentrations of multiple innate and adaptive-derived cytokines and chemokines in plasma were measured by ProcartaPlex 26-plex mouse cytokine and chemokine panel (eBioscience) using a Luminex 100/200 system, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For two group comparisons, statistical significance was determined using a t test. For three or more group comparisons, statistical significance was determined using a one-way or two-way ANOVA, with a Bonferroni post hoc analysis. Results were considered as significantly different when p < 0.05 To date, the fate of CD4+IFN-\u03b3+IL-10+ T cells postinfection and their capacity to enter into the long-lived (memory) CD4+ T cell pool has not been assessed in detail in any model. Thus, to definitively investigate whether a long-lived CD4+IFN-\u03b3+IL-10+ T cell population is maintained after malaria infection, we generated dual IFN-\u03b3\u2013YFP and IL-10\u2013GFP reporter mice and determined the kinetics of the Ag-experienced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell response during and after primary malaria infection. We assessed the expansion and contraction of the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell response in the spleen, BM, and selected nonlymphoid organs to identify whether particular tissue sites provided niche environments for the preferential survival or maintenance of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells. Because tetramers do not exist for tracking parasite-specific CD4+ T cell responses during P. yoelii NL infection, we used CD11a and CD49d as proxy markers for activated Ag-experienced cells, which include malaria-specific effector and memory CD4+ T cell populations (31, 32). Of note, IL-10 is only expressed by the CD11a+CD49d+ subset during malaria infection (32). As previously described (32), the numbers of IFN-\u03b3\u2013YFP and IL-10\u2013GFP dual-expressing CD4+CD11a+CD49d+ T cells increased significantly in all examined organs by day 7 of infection, before antimalarial drug administration (Fig. 1A, 1B). Following antimalarial drug administration, used to terminate infection at a defined time point and to replicate chemotherapy of human malaria infection, the numbers of Ag-experienced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells declined heterogeneously in the examined tissues, with the contraction being extremely fast in the spleen and slowest in the BM (Fig. 1B). By day 60 postinfection, the numbers of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells had returned to approximately baseline levels in all examined organs, indicating that Ag-experienced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were not maintained long-term in any anatomical compartment after malaria infection (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the above data, IL-10\u2013GFP+ T cells were disproportionately lost within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell population after malaria infection during the memory maintenance phase (which we define as the interval between clearance of infection and the time of reinfection) (Fig. 1C, 1D). By day 60 postinfection the frequencies of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell response were \u223c20\u201325% of those observed on day 7 (Fig. 1C, 1D). This is in contrast to the frequencies of YFP+GFP\u2212 cells within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell pool, which was stably maintained (or increased) in all examined tissues between days 14 and 60 postinfection (Fig. 1E, 1F). In agreement with the reporter data, Ag-experienced splenic CD4+ T cells obtained on day 7 of infection produced high levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 protein (Fig. 1G, 1H). Moreover, whereas Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells obtained on day 60 of infection produced only marginally less IFN-\u03b3, they produced significantly less IL-10 than did counterpart cells obtained from day 7 of infection (Fig. 1G, 1H). Collectively, these data show that CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells are less able to populate the long-lived Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell compartment than are other CD4+ T cell subsets after malaria infection. Furthermore, IL-10 production is extinguished rapidly within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell compartment postinfection. The disproportionate loss of the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells within the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell pool after clearance of malaria infection indicated that the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells may exhibit specific cellular characteristics that restricted their maintenance. To examine this, CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells and, for comparison, CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells that survived postinfection were first subcharacterized into various populations of effector and memory T cell subsets (Fig. 2A). As anticipated, high frequencies of both CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells and CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell subsets exhibited an effector T cell phenotype (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R\u2212, KLRG-1\u2212) on day 14 of infection; however, at later time points after clearance of infection (days 30 and 60) there was a significant divergence in phenotypes of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells and CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells, with significantly higher frequencies of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells exhibiting an effector T cell profile compared with CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells (Fig. 2B). Correspondingly, a significantly higher frequency of CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells exhibited an effector memory T cell signature (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R+, CD103\u2212KLRG-1\u2212) after clearance of infection compared with CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells (Fig. 2B), and the proportion of CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells exhibiting an effector memory T cell phenotype increased with time during the memory maintenance phase postinfection (Fig. 2B). Thus, the loss of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells after malaria infection (Fig. 1) appears to be related to their skewed differentiation as short-lived effector T cells and their inability to acquire durable effector memory T cell characteristics. Of note, very few CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells and CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells displayed phenotypic characteristics of resident memory (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R+, CD103+), central memory (CD44+CD62Lhigh, IL-7R+), terminally differentiated effector (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R\u2212, KLRG-1+), or effector-like effector memory T cells (CD44+CD62Llow, IL-7R+, CD103\u2212, KLRG-1+) on any day after clearance of malaria infection (Fig. 2A, 2B and results not shown). It is clear that in addition to differentiation status, the activation profile of T cells may determine their ability to populate the long-lived memory T cell compartment postinfection (22, 33). CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells expressed significantly higher levels of markers associated with cellular activation and exhaustion/regulation, including PD-1, ICOS, Lag3, and TIGIT on days 30 and 60 compared with CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells (Fig. 2C and results not shown). Thus, these data suggest that the activation profile of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells, as well as their differentiation status, may restrict their maintenance after malaria infection. The failure of the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells to express characteristics of memory T cells after malaria infection indicated that the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were lost from the Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell population after infection because they were short-lived and rapidly died postinfection. To directly investigate this, total splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells (CD11a+CD49d+) and Ag-experienced YFP+GFP\u2212 and YFP+GFP+ subsets were purified from dual reporter mice on day 7 of infection (Fig. 3A), and equal numbers were adoptively transferred, separately, into infected CD45.1 congenic mice (day 7 of infection). Thus, donor T cell populations were transferred into the same physiological environment (i.e., Ag load and cytokine milieu) from which they were obtained, ensuring that the memory capacity of the cells could be appropriately defined. Utilizing the established drug cure model, recipient mice were treated with antimalarial drugs on day 9 to clear infection, and the maintenance of the donor populations was examined on day 60 postinfection. All three adoptively transferred populations were identified in the spleen on day 60 postinfection and they remained CD11a+ and CD49d+, verifying the validity of the surrogate marker system (Fig. 3B). Significantly fewer CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were, however, recovered in the spleen than CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells, and a lower trend in recovery of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells was observed compared with total Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells (Fig. 3C). The reduced maintenance of transferred CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells in the spleen compared with the CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell population was not because they preferentially accumulated within other tissues, as fewer CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were recovered in the BM and liver than CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 or total Ag-experienced T cell populations (Fig. 3C). Notably, in addition to their apparent short life span, a high proportion of the transferred donor CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells had extinguished GFP expression, to a similar degree in all the tissues analyzed, by day 60 postinfection (Fig. 3D). Consequently, as the Vert-X mice are transcriptional reporters (30), these data imply that uniform and stable transcription of IL-10 mRNA does not occur in malaria-specific activated CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells during and/or after malaria infection, suggesting that the IL-10 gene is not epigenetically imprinted for poised production in these cells. Alternatively, the IL-10 gene may be epigenetically silenced in the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells postinfection, actively inhibiting gene expression. In contrast, consistent with data in Fig. 1, donor CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells maintained IFN-\u03b3\u2013YFP expression (Fig. 3D). As the YETI mice are also transcriptional reporters (29), this may suggest that the IFN-\u03b3 gene is epigenetically modified in IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing (IL-10\u2013GFP+/\u2212) CD4+ T cells, leading to poised expression of the cytokine mRNA in Th1-derived memory cells after malaria infection, as has been shown in NK cells and CD8+ T cells in other models (29, 34). This is consistent with the ability of Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells to maintain IFN-\u03b3 protein production postinfection (Fig. 1G). Collectively, these data show that not only are CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells inherently short-lived compared with other Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell subsets, but they fail to stably express IL-10 postinfection. The extensive contraction of the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell population, as well as their exhausted phenotype, after malaria infection indicated that the subset may not play a major role in shaping anamnestic immune responses during temporally separated rechallenge infections. Consistent with this scenario, following adoptive transfer (utilizing the same methodology as in Fig. 2), the small number of maintained CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell\u2013derived memory cells were unresponsive during early secondary infection, failing to proliferate and increase in number in any examined organ (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell\u2013derived cells also failed to re-express IL-10\u2013GFP following pathogen re-exposure in either the spleen or liver (Fig. 4B\u2013D), with the latter being a major tissue site where IL-10 limits immune-mediated pathology during malaria infection (3\u20137). These data suggest that CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell\u2013derived cells are unable to expand and accumulate in number and are not imprinted to immediately replicate their early effector phenotype upon reactivation during reinfection. In contrast, CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell\u2013derived memory cells responded rapidly during secondary infection, expanding to a significantly greater extent than CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell\u2013derived memory cells in the spleen (fold change expansion of 2.3 versus 0.8) and liver (fold change expansion of 5.8 versus 1.0) by day 4 of infection (Fig. 4A). Moreover, CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell\u2013derived memory cells rapidly upregulated IL-10\u2013GFP expression in the spleen during challenge infection (Fig. 4B, 4C), leading to a significant increase in generation of new CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells in the spleen during secondary infection (Fig. 4D). Although CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell\u2013derived memory cells did not upregulate IL-10 expression within the liver during secondary infection (Fig. 4B, 4C), the large expansion of CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell\u2013derived memory cells within the organ during challenge infection (Fig. 4A) led to a significant increase in the number of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells within the liver during secondary infection (Fig. 4D). Consistent with the reporter data, splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells purified on day 60 postinfection (which were predominantly YFP+GFP\u2212, as shown in Fig. 1C\u2013F) rapidly produced IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 protein following reactivation, producing significantly more of each cytokine than did CD4+ T cells purified from naive mice after 24 h anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation (Fig. 4E). Moreover, the Ag-experienced memory CD4+ T cells continued to produce more IL-10 than did naive CD4+ T cells following 72 h restimulation, vastly upregulating production from that observed at 24 h (Fig. 4E). In contrast, the memory Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells produced equivalent quantities of IFN-\u03b3 as did naive CD4+ T cells after 72 h restimulation (Fig. 4E). Thus, reactivating malaria infection\u2013induced Ag-experienced memory CD4+ T cells appear specifically programmed to rapidly become differentiated IL-10\u2013producing cells following challenge infection. Notably, splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells purified on day 60 postinfection also produced large amounts of IL-2 very rapidly upon PMA/ionomycin restimulation (4 h) (Fig. 4F), most likely facilitating their rapid expansion during the early phases of secondary infection, as shown specifically for the CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 subset (Fig. 4A). Collectively, these data indicate that CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell\u2013derived memory cells are unlikely to play a major role in influencing the nature of amnestic immune responses during malaria infection. Instead, CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell\u2013derived memory cells, due to their rapid ability to produce IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and proliferate and their capacity to secrete large amounts of IL-10, may play an important role in coordinating inflammation and regulation during the early phases of secondary malaria infections. Given the ability of memory Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells to produce IL-10 during challenge infection, we hypothesized that the dynamics of IL-10 production may be altered in secondary malaria infection compared with primary infection, providing a mechanism underlying infection-induced resistance to severe malarial disease. In agreement with this, circulating plasma IL-10 levels trended higher on days 2 and 7 and were significantly increased on day 4 in secondary-infected dual IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 reporter mice compared with primary-infected counterparts (Fig. 5A). Importantly, peripheral parasitemia was comparable during secondary and primary infections during the early phase of infection (up to and including day 4), after which time secondary-infected mice rapidly cleared peripheral parasites (Fig. 5B). Thus, enhanced expression of IL-10 occurs during the early stages of secondary infection and is not simply a consequence of altered parasite burdens. Consistent with the plasma IL-10 data, significantly increased frequencies and numbers of total IL-10\u2013GFP+ cells were observed in the spleen and liver during the period of patent parasitemia on day 2 and/or day 4 after secondary-infected mice compared with primary-infected mice (Fig. 5C, 5D). Concordant with the upregulation of GFP by CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell\u2013derived memory CD4+ T cells during challenge infection (Fig. 4B), CD4+ T cells were the predominant source of IL-10 in both the spleen and liver on days 2 and 4 of secondary infection (Fig. 5E). All GFP-expressing CD4+ T cells in the spleen and liver during secondary infection coexpressed YFP, showing that IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ T cells were also the dominant source of IL-10 during secondary infection (Supplemental Fig. 1). Although CD4+YFP+ T cells were also the major source of IL-10 in the spleen during the early stages of primary infection, the numbers of splenic CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were significantly lower during primary infection than during secondary infection (Fig. 5F). Notably, CD4+ T cells constituted a significantly higher fraction of the IL-10+ cells in the liver during the early stages of secondary compared with primary infection (Fig. 5E). These data show that IL-10 production, principally from CD4+YFP+ T cells (most probably reactivated memory cells), is amplified during the early phases of secondary infection compared with primary malaria infection. The altered dynamics of IL-10 production during secondary infection compared with primary malaria infection suggested that IL-10 may exert different quantitative and/or temporal roles during the early phases of primary and anamnestic immune responses to malaria. To assess whether this hypothesis was correct, we administered anti\u2013IL-10R Ab to mice prior to primary or secondary infection and examined the effect on parasite control and the innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-10R blockade did not significantly modify peripheral parasitemia during the early phases of either primary or secondary infection, with an effect observed only during primary infection on day 8 postinfection (Fig. 6A). This was consistent with the unaltered parasite burden observed in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with WT mice during the early phase of primary Plasmodium berghei NK65 infection (35). Ablation of IL-10R signaling did, however, cause significantly increased levels of weight loss during both primary and secondary infection, which was particularly evident during secondary infection on day 6 postinfection (Fig. 6B). The numbers of inflammatory monocytes (CD68+, CD11b+, Ly6Chigh), dendritic cells (which include monocyte-derived dendritic cells [CD11c+, CD11b+, F4-80\u2212], classical dendritic cells [CD68\u2212, CD11c+], and plasmacytoid dendritic cells [CD19+, CD11c+]), and neutrophils (Ly6G+, Ly6Clow, CD11b+, CD68\u2212) were significantly increased in spleens of secondary-infected mice compared with primary-infected mice (Fig. 6C), indicating differences in the general nature of the innate immune response during primary and repeat malaria infections. Whereas anti\u2013IL-10R mAb treatment failed to significantly increase the numbers of any of the examined splenic innate populations during primary or secondary infection, including red pulp macrophages (the numbers of which were comparable in primary- and secondary-infected mice [Fig. 6C]), anti\u2013IL-10R significantly elevated the expression of MHC II by inflammatory monocytes during both primary and secondary infections, and by red pulp macrophages and dendritic cells specifically during primary infection (Fig. 6D). Consequently, irrespective of the higher production during secondary infection, IL-10 appears to play a broader and quantitatively stronger role in inhibiting MHC II expression and potentially suppressing the Ag-presenting function of APC populations during the early stages of primary infection compared with secondary malaria infections (Fig. 6E). Despite the effects on the innate immune response during primary infection, anti\u2013IL-10R administration caused a slight decrease (rather than the expected increase) in the numbers of Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells during the early phases of primary infection (Fig. 7A). In contrast, anti\u2013IL-10R administration led to a significant increase in Ag-experienced splenic CD4+ T cell numbers during secondary infection (Fig. 7A). Consequently, the effect of anti\u2013IL-10R administration on splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell numbers was quantitatively higher during secondary infection compared with primary infection (Fig. 7B). Of note, the numbers of Ag-experienced splenic CD4+ T cell cells were significantly increased in secondary-infected mice compared with primary-infected mice, most probably reflecting reactivation of memory CD4+ T cells (Fig. 7A). Anti\u2013IL-10R administration did not, however, affect splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell activation (as determined by CD69 or ICOS expression) during the early phase of primary or secondary infections, and the activation of splenic Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells was not significantly different during primary and secondary infections (results not shown). Consistent with a specific effect of anti\u2013IL-10R administration on the adaptive compartment during secondary infection, anti\u2013IL-10R administration caused a quantitatively larger increase in plasma IFN-\u03b3 levels during secondary infection compared with primary infection (Fig. 7C, 7D). Collectively, these data suggest that IL-10 may have diversified functions within the innate and adaptive immune compartments during primary and secondary malaria infections, respectively. This indicates that different targeted regulatory immune responses may be necessary to modify innate immunity compared with reactivation of memory immune responses during primary and secondary malaria infections, respectively, to prevent formation of infection-induced immunopathology. IL-10\u2013producing Th1 cells play critical and nonredundant regulatory roles in limiting inflammation and controlling the outcome of many different infections (1, 2, 24, 25). As a consequence, the molecular signals instructing their development have been extensively studied, demonstrating the involvement of myriad cytokines and suites of transcription factors working in coordinated or context-specific pathways (1, 24, 25). However, the stability and memory potential of IL-10\u2013producing Th1 cells after primary infection, as well as their relative influence on the course of secondary infections, have, until now, been significantly understudied. In this study, we have shown that CD4+IFN-\u03b3\u2013YFP+IL-10\u2013GFP+ T cells have limited capacity to become long-lived memory cells following the resolution of primary malaria infection. Endogenous CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were disproportionately lost from the memory-fated and maintained Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell population postinfection, as compared with CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells. Moreover, significantly fewer infection-induced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell\u2013derived cells were obtained following adoptive transfer into malaria-infected and drug-cured recipient mice in comparison with total Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells or CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 counterpart cells. Consistently, the total Ag-experienced CD4+ T cell population maintained the capacity to produce IFN-\u03b3 but rapidly stopped producing IL-10 postinfection. To our knowledge, we have provided the first evidence that the ephemeral nature of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells may be intrinsically dictated by their skewed effector differentiation state, as well as by their apparent cellular exhaustion. The short-lived effector phenotype of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells, in comparison with CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells, is consistent with the idea that IL-10 is expressed only by mature effector T cells following strong TCR activation (24, 25), and that strong T cell activation restricts memory potential (26, 27). Additionally, high expression of markers of exhaustion, including LAG-3, PD-1, and TIGIT, by CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells potentially restricted their capacity to receive and/or respond to homeostatic signals such as IL-7 during the memory maintenance phase postinfection (36). Of relevance, however, IL-10\u2013producing CD4+ T cells have also been shown to express high levels of BLIMP-1 and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, both of which instruct IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells via direct binding within the gene locus (37, 38). BLIMP-1 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression have been shown to antagonize CD4+ T cell memory potential in nonmalarial models (39, 40). Thus, the molecular network operational in IL-10\u2013producing CD4+ T cells, coupled with their differentiation as short-lived effector cells and the coordinated expression of multiple inhibitory cell surface receptors, may directly restrict their memory potential postinfection. Consequently, it is probable that IL-10\u2013producing CD4+ T cells may only be effectively maintained in the presence of malaria Ag in context of TCR engagement. This is consistent with recent data obtained in the field showing that the maintenance of IL-10\u2013producing CD4+ T cells is inversely correlated with the duration from previous P. falciparum infection (14, 23). Whether IL-10\u2013producing CD4+IFN-\u03b3+ T cells play an important role in shaping the nature of the memory compartment postinfection, such as has been proposed for Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (13, 41), will require further investigation. Although the restricted life span of YFP+GFP+ T cells appeared to be a dominant factor driving their loss from the Ag-experienced memory CD4+ T cell pool, it was also clear that a high proportion of primary infection\u2013induced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells downregulated IL-10\u2013GFP expression following drug-induced resolution of infection. Consequently, a logical conclusion from our results is that IL-10 production by CD4+YFP+ T cells is inherently unstable during/after malaria infection and that most CD4+YFP+ T cells do not necessarily become programmed for extended production. Indeed, it would be unexpected for Ag-experienced, including parasite-specific, memory CD4+ T cells to continue to produce IL-10, or any nonhomeostatic cytokine, in the absence of inflammation and TCR signals after infection (26, 27, 42). Nevertheless, as the Vert-X mice are transcriptional reporters, our data importantly show that CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells do not uniformly maintain a poised signature postinfection, where the IL-10 gene is continually transcribed but not actively translated. In agreement with this, it has been suggested that the IL-10 gene does not undergo extensive epigenetic remodeling in memory IFN-\u03b3+CD4+ T cells (43) but depends upon constant stimulation to maintain IL-10 transcription (44). This is opposed to the archetypal CD4+ T cell lineage\u2013defining cytokines IFN-\u03b3 or IL-4, which display permissive hypermethylation (H3K4me3) marks in memory cells with Th1 and Th2 ontogenies, respectively (45). Consequently, following transcription in T cells and NK cells, epigenetic remodeling of the IFN-\u03b3 gene leads to maintained gene transcription, even though translation may be prevented by destabilizing elements within the mRNA untranslated regions (46). This is consistent with our observation that memory Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells from infected/drug-cured mice (most of which are YFP+GFP\u2212) have the maintained capacity to produce IFN-\u03b3 protein immediately ex vivo following mitogenic restimulation. Of note, we have previously shown that cell-sorted IFN-\u03b3\u2013YFP+ and IL-10\u2013GFP+ T cells actively translate the respective cytokines on day 7 of infection (33). This demonstrates, in agreement with previous studies, that functionally defined mature Th1 cells can be maintained long-term after malaria infection (21). Despite the limited maintenance of CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cell after malaria infection, we found that the IL-10 response was amplified during secondary malaria infection compared with primary infection. Notably, CD4+YFP+ T cells were the major source of IL-10 during secondary infection in all examined organs, implying that memory CD4+ T cells rapidly expanded and expressed IL-10 during secondary infection. In agreement with this, we found that CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell\u2013derived memory cells reactivated quickly during secondary infection, proliferating and upregulating IL-10 GFP expression. Of note, the small frequency of GFP+ cells within the CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cell\u2013derived memory cell population on day 60 postinfection likely reflects induction of IL-10 in the transferred population prior to drug treatment of the recipient mice (Fig. 4B, 4C). In contrast, consistent with their exhausted phenotype, the small numbers of residual primary infection\u2013derived CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells were relatively unresponsive during secondary infection. These results suggest that infection-induced CD4+YFP+GFP+ T cells may not play a major role in modulating the course of anamnestic responses during subsequent temporally separated malaria infections. Importantly, we observed that purified memory Ag-experienced CD4+ T cells (most of which were YFP+GFP\u2212) produced significant quantities of IL-10 protein in vitro following 24 and 72 h restimulation in vitro. This indicates that memory Ag-experienced CD4+YFP+GFP\u2212 T cells are predisposed and programmed toward rapid induction of IL-10 following reactivation during secondary infection. Thus, the enhanced IL-10 response during secondary infection is unlikely to be dominantly or solely controlled by the specific environment the CD4+ T cells are exposed to during rechallenge. Also importantly, the accelerated and amplified IL-10 production during rechallenge did not cause generalized immune inhibition during infection, as innate and adaptive responses were increased during the early phases of secondary infection compared with primary infection. These data are, therefore, inconsistent with a model where generalized suppression of inflammation contributes toward infection-induced resistance to symptomatic malaria. Rather, our data suggest that during secondary malaria infections strong antiparasitic immune responses are allowed to develop to facilitate rapid control and elimination of the parasite, but counterbalancing regulatory responses, of which IL-10 plays a pivotal role, are instructed to ensure that inflammation is restricted below tissue-damaging levels. Such a model is in agreement with recent results showing that upon re-exposure to P. falciparum, children develop co-ordinately enhanced antiparasitic and immunoregulatory responses that facilitate parasite control while limiting pathogenic inflammation (23). Of relevance, high ratios of plasma proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, are a common feature of severe malaria disease, emphasizing the importance of infection-instructed immune balance in enabling optimal control of malaria infection (9). Interestingly, our results also highlight distinct activities for IL-10 during primary and subsequent malaria infections. The main function of IL-10 during primary infection appears to be inhibition of MHC II expression by APCs and innate cells, whereas during secondary infection its primarily role appears to be controlling T cell responses and, putatively, the early reactivation of memory CD4+ T cells. IL-10 has been previously shown to target and regulate different immune cell populations, depending on the nature of inflammation (47\u201349), Thus, the varied activity of IL-10 during primary and secondary infections is likely determined by the different immune environments and contrasting responsiveness of immune cells within primary- and secondary-infected hosts. Although the differential sensitivity of recently primed effector T cells and memory CD4+ T cells to IL-10 regulation has yet to be examined in detail in any model, IL-10 has been shown to suppress IFN-\u03b3 production by TCR-activated memory CD4+ T cells (50). In summary, in this study we have directly shown that malaria infection\u2013induced IL-10\u2013expressing CD4+IFN-\u03b3+ T cells have limited memory cell potential and do not respond strongly during pathogen re-exposure. These results substantially increase our understanding of the fate of IL-10\u2013expressing CD4+ T cells after malaria, and infection in general. In contrast, memory CD4+IFN-\u03b3+ T cells rapidly expand and produce IL-10 during secondary malaria infection, leading to augmented IL-10 production and coordinated strong antiparasitic and regulatory immune responses. These data provide new insights into the importance and role of IL-10 during primary and repeat malaria infections and reveal the memory CD4+ T cell subset that dominantly produces IL-10 to influence the nature of anamnestic immune responses during secondary malaria infection."}, "28846666": {"pmid": "28846666", "pmcid": "PMC5584822", "title": "Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Inflammation and Metabolism in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Inner Mongolia", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is common all over the world.

However, the pathogenesis of GDM is still unclear, and might be related to hormone level changes, insulin resistance (IR), obesity, a chronic inflammatory reaction, oxidative stress, genetics, insulin-secretion deficiency, immunity and so on. Recently attention has focused on the relationship between inflammatory reaction and IR, indicating that inflammation is a critical factor in promoting IR. During pregnancy, the maternal tissues become insensitive to insulin resulting from changes due to placental lactogen and other hormones. For women with GDM, IR results in maternal hyperglycemia and stimulates fetal hyperinsulinemia. IR and reduced secretory function of \u03b2 cell are important pathological features of GDM. After giving birth, GDM in women disappears immediately. Risk factors, such as increased maternal age, previous occurrence of GDM, and family history of diabetes, are helpful for diagnosis of GDM. In China, a universal screening program for GDM in women living in the six urban districts of Tianjin was carried out, with the results showing that the GDM prevalence was as low as 2.3% in 1998. However, there is scant research on the prevalence of GDM in the Chinese population, and in particular Inner Mongolia. In our study, we analyzed the expressions of IL-65\u201372C/G and TNF-\u03b1-857C/T SNPs in GDM patients from Inner Mongolia, as well as their relationship with glucose and lipid metabolism, in order to inform clinical diagnosis and prevention of GDM with information on related molecular mechanisms. Data were collected from 140 women with GDM pregnancies and 140 women with healthy pregnancies, who delivered in the Obstetric Department of Huhhot First Hospital from June of 2013 to June of 2015. All the women lived in Inner Mongolia (China) for more than 20 years, with routine ultrasonic examination and prenatal care. Informed consent was obtained from each participant and approved by the medical ethics committee of Huhhot First Hospital and Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. GDM pregnancies were diagnosed according to the criteria of Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The pregnant women, with gestational weeks of 24~28, were screened for GDM by one hour 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT). When the fasting glucose was higher than 92 mg/d/L but lower than 126 mg/d/L, GDM was diagnosed at any gestational age. Those pregnant women in early pregnancy, not meeting the diagnostic criteria for GDM, were asked to have oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) from the 24th and 28th gestational weeks. We collected 10 mL peripheral blood at 9: 00 in the morning, which was then store at \u221228\u00b0C for subsequent experiments. A sample of 2 mL of the blood was used for SNPs analysis. Genomic DNA in each sample was extracted and purified with genomic DNA extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Shanghai, China) according to the kit specification, and then stored at \u221278\u00b0C until PCR amplification. PCR primers were designed with Sequenom Assay Desigh 3.0 software and synthesized by Thermo Fisher. Primers are shown in Table 1. DNA samples were diluted quantitatively and then prepared for amplification. PCR amplification system is shown in Table 2, with the process in Table 3. After amplification, 0.3 U alkaline phosphatase was added to remove the remaining deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP). Finally the PCR products were spotted into SpectroCHIP (Sequenom) with the automatic instrument. MALDI-TOF-MS (SpectroREADER, Sequenom) was used to detect the chips. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and fasting blood insulin (FINS) were detected by automatic biochemical analyzer (BioTek Instrument, Inc., Beijing, China). Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) formula was used for calculating IR index (HOMA-IR) and islet \u03b2 cell function index (HOMA-\u03b2). Serum Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were determined by Bio-Plex 200 Systems with Bio-Plex ProTM Human Cytokine Assay kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Shanghai, China). Fresh placental tissues were collected after delivery and fixed in 10% formalin (Solarbio Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing. China), and then finely ground with RIPA buffer (Thermo). Tissue residues were discarded after centrifuging. Tissue suspension was used for detecting placental indexes by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), including nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP-4), chemerin, nesfatin-1, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), IRS-2, fatty acid transport protein-4 (FATP-4), endothelial lipase (EL), low density lipoprotein (LPL), fatty acid binding protein-1 (FABP-1), FABP-3, FABP-4 and FABP-5. ELISA kits were obtained from TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China), Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd. (China) and Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering Co., Ltd. (China). All data were analyzed by SPSS 19.0 and shown as mean\u00b1standard deviations (X \u00b1SD). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was used for estimating allele frequencies. Comparisons of genotypes and allele frequencies between the patients and volunteers were analyzed by chi-square test. Binary logistic regression analysis was used for evaluating the association between SNPs of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 genotype, and allele frequencies with GDM. The characteristics were compared with Fisher\u2019s exact test. T-test was used for comparisons on continuous variables. Logistic regression was used for the association of inflammatory biomarkers in serum with GDM. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Mass spectrometry of IL-65\u201372C/G and TNF-\u03b1-857C/T genotypes are shown in Figure 1 and Table 4. Both allele frequencies of IL-65\u201372C/G (\u03c72=0.6712, p>0.05) and TNF-\u03b1-857C/T (\u03c72=0.3909, p>0.05) fit the Hardy-Weinberg genetic equilibrium. As shown in Figure 1A and 1B, there were 20 samples of GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies without results. The distribution frequencies of IL-65\u201372C/G in GDM pregnancies were: CC (19.29%), CG (54.29%), and GG (26.43%). The allele frequencies were C (46.43%) and G (53.57%), respectively. In healthy pregnancies, IL-65\u201372C/G frequencies were CC (21.67%), CG (37.50%), and GG (40.83%), and the allele frequencies were C (40.42%) and G (59.58%). There was no significant difference on genotypes or allele frequencies of IL-65\u201372C/G between GDM and healthy pregnancies. As shown in Figure 1C and 1D, there were six samples of GDM pregnancies and 16 of healthy pregnancies without results. The distribution frequencies of TNF-\u03b1-857C/T in GDM were CC (72.86%) and CT (22.86%), and allele frequencies were C (88.06%) and T (13.56%). In healthy pregnancies, the distribution frequencies of TNF-\u03b1-857C/T were CC (77.86%) and CT (10.71%), and the allele frequencies were C (93.95%) and T (6.05%), respectively. The differences of the two genotypes frequencies were statistically significant between GDM and healthy pregnancies (chi-square=5.84, p<0.05), as well as the allele frequencies (chi-square=6.97, p<0.05). The distribution frequency of CT in GDM pregnancies was significantly higher than in healthy pregnancies (OR=3.316, 95% CI=1.092\u20138.304, p=0.025), which showed that the risk of developing GDM for patients carrying CT genotype. Table 5 and Figure 2A show the results of the comparisons of clinical characteristics, serum metabolic biomarkers, and inflammatory biomarkers of the pregnancies with or without GDM. There were significant differences (p<0.05) between the GDM pregnancies and the healthy pregnancies in clinical characteristics, including maternal age (29.13\u00b13.65 versus 25.06\u00b15.94 years), pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (38.68\u00b19.50 versus 28.74\u00b17.26), nulliparous women (10 women versus 28 women), family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (34 women versus 13 women), and history of GDM (8 women versus 1 woman), but not for gestational age. Additionally, serum inflammatory biomarkers were also significant different (p<0.05) between GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies, including hs-CRP (8.38\u00b11.67 versus 4.60\u00b11.04 mg/L), IL-6 (5.85\u00b11.41 versus 3.91\u00b11.66 ng/L), IL-8 (2.17\u00b10.45 versus 0.74\u00b10.12 ng/L), and IL-6/IL-10 ratio (3.15\u00b10.73 versus 1.93\u00b10.46), while excluding IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1. Blood glucose metabolic indexes in serum were significantly different between GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies, including FBG (8.03\u00b11.57 versus 4.20\u00b11.62 mmol/L), FINS (3.15\u00b11.08 versus 1.92\u00b11.54 mIU/L), HOMA-IR (4.89\u00b11.40 versus 2.16\u00b11.51) and HOMA-\u03b2 (75.32\u00b110.64 versus 157.49\u00b118.85), respectively (p<0.05). As shown in Table 6, some of the serum inflammatory biomarkers were obviously associated with GDM, including CRP (0R=9.52, 95% CI (2.76, 33.10), p=0.001), IL-6 (OR=4.66, 95% CI (1.53, 14.59), p=0.008), IL-8 (OR=2.58, 95% CI (1.27, 10.08), p=0.009) and IL-6/IL-10 ratio (OR=1.75, 95% CI (1.22, 2.68), p=0.003). After delivery, inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines in placentas were detected and compared. The results are shown in Table 7. In Figure 2B, except for IL-10, all the inflammatory biomarkers in placentas had significant differences (p<0.05) between GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies, including NF-\u03baB (283.56\u00b131.32 versus 125.69\u00b117.38 \u03bcg/L), IL-6 (177.09\u00b122.68 versus 103.85\u00b115.6 \u03bcg/L), IL-8 (126.43\u00b116.02 versus 45.70\u00b14.95 \u03bcg/L), IL-6/IL-10 ratio (3.09\u00b11.40 versus 1.51\u00b11.06), IL-1\u03b2 (36.42\u00b15.10 versus 13.48\u00b12.06 mg/L) and TNF-\u03b1 (21.61\u00b13.21 versus 13.82\u00b12.02 mg/L). IRS-1 (83.94\u00b113.22 versus 106.01\u00b114.30 \u03bcg/L) and IRS-2 (104.28\u00b110.95 versus 190.11\u00b120.58 \u03bcg/L) in placentas were significantly different (p<0.05) between GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies. Lipid metabolic indexes all had significant differences (p<0.05) between GDM pregnancies and healthy pregnancies as follows: leptin (16.36\u00b12.03 versus 9.17\u00b11.88 mg/L), adiponectin (92.58\u00b113.20 versus 150.14\u00b117.21 \u03bcg/L), visfatin (127.39\u00b118.68 versus 52.28\u00b19.05 \u03bcg/L), RBP-4 (22.46\u00b13.01 versus 10.72\u00b12.05 mg/L), chemerin (11.20\u00b11.17 versus 5.76\u00b10.03 mg/L), nesfatin-1 (178.32\u00b120.77 versus 93.59\u00b111.64 \u03bcg/L), FATP-4 (13.06\u00b12.90 versus 6.50\u00b10.75 mg/L), EL (154.91\u00b120.16 versus 89.04\u00b110.37 \u03bcg/L), LPL (17.14\u00b13.68 versus 10.32\u00b11.07 mg/L), FABP-1 (115.60\u00b112.44 versus 63.38\u00b19.83 \u03bcg/L), FABP-3 (235.17\u00b120.84 versus 105.26\u00b113.02 \u03bcg/L), FABP-4 (178.37\u00b120.98 versus 112.64\u00b114.02 \u03bcg/L) and FABP-5 (99.40\u00b111.37 versus 42.31\u00b18.29 \u03bcg/L). In our study, we firstly detected the SNPs of IL-65\u201372C/G and TNF-\u03b1-857C/T in GDM and healthy pregnancies. The results showed that the differences in the CC and CT genotypes of TNF-\u03b1-857C/T were statistically significant between GDM and healthy pregnancies, while IL-65\u201372C/G was without significance. The distribution frequency of TNF-\u03b1-857CT in GDM pregnancies was higher than that in healthy pregnancies, which indicated a risk of developing GDM for patients carrying TNF-\u03b1-857CT, and T allele was the risk factor. According to previous studies, IL-65\u201372C/G is associated to obesity, colon cancer, and T2DM; as is TNF-\u03b1-857C/T, but no research has focused on their relationship with GDM. In our study, we did not find an association of IL-65\u201372C/G with GDM pregnancies. Therefore, we presumed that women carrying TNF-\u03b1-857CT in Inner Mongolia were at higher risk for GDM than those without. In addition, by detecting serum factors we found that hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-6/IL-10 were significantly associated with GDM. The inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, hs-CRP, IL-1 \u03b2, and IL-8 have mostly been found to be increased in GDM pregnancies compared to healthy pregnancies. However, in our study, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 was found to be abnormal in GDM pregnancies, but not significantly. This difference might be due to differences in pregnancies within different population, indicating that for GDM women in Inner Mongolia, abnormal levels of hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-6/IL-10 ratio may be diagnostic biomarkers. In women with GDM, the placenta may adapt to the inflammatory environment and exhibit morphological changes [19\u201321]. In our study, we collected the placentas from GDM and healthy pregnancies. By detecting the metabolic indexes, we found that the inflammatory biomarkers, including NF-\u03baB, IL-6, IL-8, IL6/IL-10 ratio, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1, had significant differences between GDM and healthy pregnancies, as well as the adipokines, including leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, RBP-4, chemerin and nesfatin-1, IRS-1, IRS-2, FATP-4, EL, LPL, FABP-1, FABP-3, FABP-4, and FABP-5. This phenomenon showed that the placentas of GDM women were in an inflammatory environment, and that the increased inflammatory mediators might promote intraplacental inflammatory cascades by specific gene transcription or translation. Additionally, the adipose tissue also generated numbers of adipokines to promote the production of inflammatory cytokines, which aggravated the GDM status. Otherwise, we found that both FBG and FINS in serum obviously increased, and the HOMA-IR and HOMA-\u03b2 were significantly different between GDM and healthy pregnancies. Considering the decreased IRS-1 and IRS-2 in placentas of GDM, we confirmed that glucose metabolism was disordered in the whole body, a finding which was in accorded with previous studies, as was lipid metabolism. However, which cytokines were regulated and how deregulation led to the GDM progression, is still unclear. In the future, there should be further investigations using larger sample sizes and collecting data from pregnant women in different regions. Our study confirmed that TNF-\u03b1-857C/T SNPs and inflammation were associated with GDM, and glucose and lipid metabolisms were disordered in GDM."}, "28393239": {"pmid": "28393239", "pmcid": "PMC5403466", "title": "Psoriasin promotes invasion, aggregation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells; association with disease progression", "abstract": "\nPsoriasin (S100A7) is an 11-kDa small calcium binding protein initially isolated from psoriatic skin lesions. It belongs to the S100 family of proteins which play an important role in a range of cell functions including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. Aberrant Psoriasin expression has been implicated in a range of cancers and is often associated with poor prognosis. This study examined the role of Psoriasin on pancreatic cancer cell functions and the implication in progression of the disease. Expression of Psoriasin was determined in a cohort of pancreatic tissues comprised of 126 pancreatic tumours and 114 adjacent non-tumour pancreatic tissues. Knockdown and overexpression of Psoriasin in pancreatic cancer cells was performed using specifically constructed plasmids, which either had anti-Psoriasin ribozyme transgene or the full length human Psoriasin coding sequence. Psoriasin knockdown and overexpression was verified using conventional RT-PCR and qPCR. The effect of manipulating Psoriasin expression on pancreatic cancer cell functions was assessed using several in vitro cell function assays. Local invasive pancreatic cancers extended beyond the pancreas expressed higher levels of Psoriasin transcripts compared with the cancers confined to the pancreas. Primary tumours with distant metastases exhibited a reduced expression of Psoriasin. Psoriasin overexpression cell lines exhibited significantly increased growth and migration compared to control cells. In addition, Psoriasin overexpression resulted in increased pancreatic cancer cell invasion which was associated with upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Overexpression of Psoriasin also promoted aggregation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells when they lost anchorage. Taken together, higher expression of Psoriasin was associated with local invasion in pancreatic cancers. Psoriasin expression is associated with pancreatic cancer cell growth, migration, cell-matrix adhesion, and invasion via regulation of MMPs. As such, the proposed implications of Psoriasin in invasion, disease progression and as a potential therapeutic target warrant further investigation.\n", "fulltext": "Psoriasin, also known as S100A7, is a member of the S100 protein family of calcium binding proteins and was first identified as being overexpressed in psoriatic skin lesions (1). It is a 11.4-kDa secretory protein encoded on chromosome 1q21, clustered alongside 16 other members of the S100 family within a region known as the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) (2,3). The S100 family encodes both cytoplasmic and secreted proteins that share EF-hand helix-loop-helix domains, important for their role as calcium binding proteins (4). Psoriasin S100 proteins are widely expressed in numerous cell types localised to the cytoplasm and/or nucleus, or in some cases are secreted. Due to their role in calcium binding and signalling, they are involved in numerous cell functions including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. In addition to its overexpression in psoriatic skin lesions, aberrant Psoriasin expression has been implicated in a range of human diseases including cancer. Interestingly, Psoriasin is a chemotactic factor for keratinocytes and leukocytes (5\u20137), and is also upregulated and excreted from cells of the epidermis during inflammation. Additionally, Psoriasin has been implicated as an antimicrobial peptide, selectively killing E. coli on the surface of the skin (8). Therefore, Psoriasin may be utilised, via the host immune response, as a selective chemotactic factor both in psoriasis and cancer (9). The expression of Psoriasin during carcinogenesis has been studied in detail, and its overexpression has been linked to a number of cancers including breast (10), prostate (11), skin (12), head and neck (13), bladder (14) and lung cancer (15). It is also often associated with poor prognosis. For example in breast cancer, Psoriasin expression correlates with features of poor prognosis, including oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negativity, HER2 positivity, and the presence of lymphocytic infiltration (16\u201318). The precise role of Psoriasin in cancer remains unclear. One hypothesis links Psoriasin expression with stimulation of angiogenesis regulated by VEGF (19). In the development of breast cancer, Psoriasin regulates epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR), actin remodelling and NF-\u03ba\u03b2 mediated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) secretion, promoting tumour development and metastasis (20). These results suggest Psoriasin plays an important role in carcinoma development. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in Western countries and carries a very poor prognosis due to delayed diagnosis and lack of effective treatments. The majority of patients present with metastasis at diagnosis; 25% with local metastasis and 55% with regional metastasis (21). The most common sites of metastasis are the liver, followed by the peritoneum, lung and pleura, bones and adrenal glands. Outcome for patients is poor with a 5-year survival rate of <5% (22). In comparison to the studies of other malignancies, pancreatic cancer requires more intensive study for understanding genetic and molecular machinery which is utilised by cancerous cells during disease progression and metastasis. This study aimed to examine the role of Psoriasin in pancreatic cancer with a focus for its involvement in local invasion and distant metastasis. Pancreatic cell lines (MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). Both cell lines are derived from primary tumours of pancreatic cancer. MIA-PaCa-2 was isolated from a pancreatic carcinoma while PANC-1 was derived from an epithelioid carcinoma of pancreas. The pancreatic cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-F12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. LP-9 mesothelial cells were purchased from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ, USA) and maintained in M199 medium supplemented with 15% FCS and antibiotics. Matrigel (BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix) was obtained from BD Biosciences (Oxford, UK). Anti-human Psoriasin hammerhead ribozymes were designed based on the secondary structure of the mRNA generated using Zuker's RNA Mfold program (23). The ribozymes were synthesized and cloned into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The primers used for ribozyme synthesis are shown in Table I. Similarly, full-length human Psoriasin coding sequence amplified from normal human prostate tissues was cloned into the same vector. Constructed plasmids were extracted using the Genelute Plasmid Mini-Prep kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). Ribozyme transgenes, overexpression constructs, and control plasmids were transfected into MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells by electroporation (Gene Pulser Xcell; Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK). Stable transfectants were obtained and verified following two weeks selection using blasticidin (5 \u03bcg/ml, Melford Laboratories Ltd., Suffolk, UK). The cells were then cultured in DMEM with blasticidin at a lower concentration (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) to maintain plasmid expression. Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). First strand cDNA synthesis was undertaken using the Precision nanoScript Reverse Transcription kit (Primer Design, Southampton, UK). PCR was performed using GoTaq Green MasterMix (Promega, Dorset, UK). Cycling conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 36 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 40 sec. This was followed by a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Products were visualised using 2% agarose gels stained with SYBR Safe (Invitrogen). QPCR was performed using the Icycler IQ5 system (Bio-Rad, Hammel Hempsted, UK). Pancreatic cancer cell cDNA samples were examined for Psoriasin transcript expression, alongside a set of standards and negative controls. The Amplifluor system (Intergen Inc., Oxford, UK) and qPCR mastermix (Bio-Rad) were used. Psoriasin primer pairs were designed using Beacon design software (Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA), whereby the reverse primer contained an additional Z sequence (5\u2032-ACTGAACCTGACCGTACA) complementary to the universal Z probe (Intergen Inc.). Reaction conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 12 min, followed by 90 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 sec, 55\u00b0C for 40 sec and 72\u00b0C for 20 sec. Human pancreatic tissue was collected from patients undergoing surgical resection of pancreatic tumours at the Beijing Cancer Hospital. The specimens retrieved comprised 126 pancreatic tumours and 114 along with matched adjacent normal pancreatic tissues over a period from 2002 to 2011 with follow-up information up to 2013 (median, 12 months, IQR, 6\u201320.5 months). The tissues were stored immediately after surgery at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Clinicopathological factors, including age, sex, histological type, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastases and embolism, were recorded and stored in the patient database. The protocol and procedure were reviewed and approved by the Beijing Cancer Hospital Research Ethics Committee and written consent was obtained from all patients involved. Total RNA extraction was then performed using TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Psoriasin transcripts were determined using QPCR together with an internal control keratin 19 (CK19). Normalised Psoriasin transcript levels are shown in Table II. Primer sequences are provided in Table I. A standard growth assay was undertaken as previously described (15,24). Cells were plated into a 96-well plate (3,000 cells/well) and growth was assessed after 1, 3 and 5 days. Crystal violet was used to stain the cells, and absorbance was determined at a wavelength of 540 nm using a spectrophotometer (Elx800; Bio-Tek, Bedfordshire, UK). An ECIS-Ztheta instrument (Applied Biophysics Ltd.; Troy, NJ, USA) was used with a 96-well 96W1E microarrays and wounding module. Pancreatic cancer cells were seeded at 40,000 cells per well and cell adhesion was tracked immediately over a range of frequencies from 1,000 to 64,000 Hz. Once the cells reached confluence, a current of 2,600 \u03bcA was passed across each well for 20 sec to produce a reproducible wound, after which cell migration was automatically tracked. A total of 20,000 cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate previously prepared by coating with Matrigel (5 \u03bcg/well). The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 45 min and the medium was then discarded. Non-adherent cells were washed off using balanced salt solution (BSS) buffer. Adherent cells were then fixed in 4% formalin, stained with crystal violet and absorbance determined at 540 nm. LP-9 mesothelial cells were trypsinised and transferred to a 96-well plate at 30,000 cells per well and grown to confluence over a 24-h period. Pancreatic cancer cells were stained with 10 \u03bcg/ml DiI membrane stain (1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindo-carbocyanine perchlorate, Life Technologies) before being added at 20,000 cells per well to the mesothelial cell mono-layer. Pancreatic cancer cells were left to adhere for 40 min before non-adherent cells were washed off using BSS buffer. Adherent cells were then fixed (4% formalin) and images were taken at 549 excitation/565 emission and phase contrast using an EVOS FL auto (Life Technologies), before the total number of adherent pancreatic cancer cells was counted. Transwell inserts with 8 \u03bcm pore size (Greiner Bio-One, Gloucester, UK) were coated with 50 \u03bcg Matrigel and air-dried before being rehydrated. A total of 20,000 cells were added to each insert. Following 72-h incubation, cells that had migrated through the matrix and pores were fixed (4% formalin), stained in crystal violet and absorbance determined at 540 nm. Pancreatic cancer cells (3\u00d7106) were seeded into a 75-cm2 flask. Following overnight culture, cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and cultured in serum-free DMEM for 6 h. The conditioned medium was then collected by centrifugation to remove any cells. Samples were prepared in non-reducing sample buffer (containing 0.625 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 2% bromophenol blue). Each sample (30 \u03bcl) was loaded into each lane and separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatine (Sigma-Aldrich). The gel was then renatured at room temperature in washing buffer (containing 2.5% Triton X-100 and 0.02% NaN3), before being incubated in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mM CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3 for 72 h before staining with Coomassie blue. The clear bands of gelatin digested by MMPs was documented and analysed using densitometry. Cell aggregation was measured over a time course of 3 h, at 1 h intervals. MiaPa-Ca-1 cells with varying Psoriasin expression were harvested using trypsin. A small amount was aliquoted for initial measurements. The remaining solution was left at 37\u00b0C, on a tilt table, to prevent adherence. The collected samples were kept on ice to prevent additional aggregation. Cells were aliquoted out at 1, 2 and 3 h. Cell aggregation was measured using a Neubauer haemocytometer (Celeromics, Cambridge, UK) under a light microscope, with total individual cells counted followed by the number of cell groups. Cells (250,000\u2013500,000) per experiment were transferred to a fresh UC and spun down in a centrifuge at 1700 rpm for 5 min and washed with ice-cold PBS and re-centrifuged. The cells were suspended in 250 \u03bcl of Annexin V binding (Invitrogen) buffer per 250,000 cells. This solution (100 \u03bcl) was mixed with 5 \u03bcl of pre-mixed staining solution (0.2 \u03bcl propidium iodide, 0.8 \u03bcl Annexin V-FITC, 4 \u03bcl Annexin V binding buffer) (Invitrogen) and left in the dark, at room temperature, for 30 min. It was then diluted with 400 \u03bcl of filtered PBS and kept on ice. The remaining cell solution was incubated at 37\u00b0C at 5% CO2 and the process repeated at 1 and 2 h. The samples were then run through a flow cytometer (Cyflow, Sysmex UK Ltd.). Equal amount of total proteins of each cell line was separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were then electrically transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-caspase 3 and GAPDH antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), respectively, and also corresponding peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). Images of the protein bands were developed using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Luminata, Millipore) and a UVITech imager (UVITech, Inc.). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for normally distributed and non-normally distributed data respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyse the correlation with patient survival. Differences were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. In the search of gene expression array data base at PubMed, a reduction was seen in the expression of Psoriasin in pancreatic cancers in comparison with the paired adjacent normal pancreatic tissues (GDS4336) (Fig. 1A). We further determined the transcript levels of Psoriasin in a cohort of 126 pancreatic tumours and 114 adjacent normal pancreatic tissues. Psoriasin expression appeared to be reduced in the tumours but did not reach a significant level in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues (Table II). An even lower expression of Psoriasin was seen in tumours with distant metastases. Interestingly, higher Psoriasin transcript levels were seen in locally invasive tumours which extended beyond the pancreas (T3 and T4) in comparison with tumours confined to the pancreas (T1 and T2) (Table II). It suggests that Psoriasin plays a significant role in regulation of invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. To clarify the involvement of Psoriasin in metastasis, we analysed the expression of Psoriasin in another gene expression array of pancreatic tumours which includes 145 primary tumours and 61 metastatic tumours (GSE71729) (25). An increased expression of Psoriasin was seen in the secondary tumours in comparison with its expression in primary tumours (Fig. 1B). The mRNA expression of Psoriasin in three different pancreatic cancer cell lines was evaluated using RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). RAGE, the receptor of Psoriasin was detected in the three pancreatic cancer cell lines. PCR products of 528 bp were amplicons of both variant 2 and 4, while 480-bp products represented amplicons from variant 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. However, exact variants expressed in these cell lines are yet to be further determined (Fig. 1C). The expression of Psoriasin in MIA-PaCa-2 is higher than that for PANC-1, and lowest in AsPc-1. Psoriasin knockdown and overexpression was verified in the MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines transfected with ribozyme transgenes using RT-PCR (Fig. 1D) and qPCR (Fig. 1E). The Psoriasin-modified MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines were used for subsequent experiments. A significant decrease in cellular growth was observed in Psoriasin knockdown MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig. 2A, p<0.001) and PANC-1 (Fig. 2B, p<0.05) cell lines in comparison with controls. Conversely, overexpression of Psoriasin resulted in increased growth of MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines (p<0.05). Psoriasin knockdown resulted in decreased migration of MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig. 2C, p<0.001) and PANC-1 (Fig. 2D, p<0.05) cell lines compared to controls. Conversely, Psoriasin overexpression resulted in increased migration of MIA-PaCa-2 (p<0.001) and PANC-1 (p<0.05) cell lines. An in vitro cell-matrix adhesion assay was adopted to investigate the effect of Psoriasin knockdown and overexpression on the adhesive ability of pancreatic cancer cells to extracellular matrix. MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig. 3A, p<0.05) and PANC-1 (Fig. 3B, p<0.05) Psoriasin overexpressing cells exhibited decreased cell-matrix adhesion whilst Psoriasin knockdown resulted in increased adhesion to matrix (p<0.05). According to the involvement in adhesion of pancreatic cancer cells, we were curious about a possible implication in dissemination through peritoneal cavity. Therefore, we determined the effect of Psoriasin expression on pancreatic cancer cell adhesion to mesothelial which constitute peritoneum. Neither Psoriasin overexpression nor knockdown had any significant effect on the adhesion of PANC-1 cells to peritoneal mesothelia compared to control (Fig. 3C). The influence of Psoriasin expression on MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell invasion was examined. Interestingly, Psoriasin overexpression resulted in increased invasion of MIA-PaCa-2 (Fig. 4A, p<0.001) and PANC-1 (Fig. 4B, p<0.05) cell lines whilst Psoriasin knockdown resulted in decreased invasion of MIA-PaCa-2 (p<0.001) and PANC-1 (p<0.05) cells. At the mRNA level, MMP-9 expression was significantly increased in Psoriasin overexpression MIA-PaCa-2 cells compared to controls (Fig. 4C). Conversely, MMP-9 expression was decreased in Psoriasin knockdown MIA-PaCa-2 cells. As the results from zymography show, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity is increased in Psoriasin overexpression MIA-PaCa-2 cells compared to control (Fig. 4D), whilst MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity is decreased in Psoriasin knockdown MIA-PaCa-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, decreased Psoriasin expression resulted in the decreased expression of cyclin D2 at the mRNA level in MIA-PaCa-2 cells in which an increased level of p27Kip1 was also noted. Moreover, overexpression of Psoriasin resulted in increased cyclin D2 expression. In order to evaluate how MIA-PaCa-2 cells interact with one another in suspension, a cell aggregation assay was performed. Cells with increased Psoriasin expression demonstrated an increased propensity to form cell-cell contacts whilst in suspension, reaching significance at 3 h (Fig. 5, p<0.05). To determine whether this observation had an impact on the anoikis resistance in this cell line, an apoptosis assay was performed. We observed cell survival after suspension was increased in Psoriasin overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 6). Western blot analyses of adherent cells showed an enhanced activation of caspase-3 in MIA-PaCa-2 cells as cleaved proteins in comparison with the control (Fig. 7). A reduction in the cleavage of caspase-3 was not observed in the Psoriasin overexpression cells compared with the control which also exhibited a lower level of the activation. Psoriasin was first identified as being overexpressed in the hyperproliferative skin disease psoriasis. Numerous studies have since demonstrated Psoriasin overexpression to be associated with tumour progression. Upregulation of Psoriasin in cancer was initially identified in pre-invasive carcinomas; whether this upregulation occurs in pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasia progression that proceeds to pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains to be elucidated. Increased Psoriasin expression has also been identified in cancers at an advanced stage. In breast cancer, Psoriasin overexpression is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. In the present study, Psoriasin expression was determined in a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients. Psoriasin expression tended to be reduced in the pancreatic cancers compared to adjacent normal pancreatic tissues, though did not reach statistical significance. This observation is similar to findings from a GEO data set (GDS4336) (Fig. 1A) (26). A reduced expression was noted in primary tumours (n=9) with distant metastases. This finding is yet to be verified by examining of a large cohort pancreatic primary tumours with a reasonable number of primary tumours which have distant metastasis. In an analysis of a gene expression array data, an increased expression levels of Psoriasin was seen in metastases of pancreatic cancer in comparison with primary tumours (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, a greater expression of Psoriasin was evident in locally advanced pancreatic tumours. It suggests that Psoriasin may play differential roles during the development and progression of the disease, in particular, the metastatic process. We determined the expression of Psoriasin in the cell lines AsPc-1, MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1, and expression appeared highest in MIA-PaCa-2 which is the most tumourigenic of the three cell lines (27). These results demonstrate that Psoriasin overexpression is associated with increased cancer cell growth in vitro, whilst knockdown inhibits growth. Interestingly, during breast cancer progression, Psoriasin has been shown to interact with Jab1 (c-jun activation-domain binding protein), which is involved in proteosomal degradation and signal transduction. Interaction between Psoriasin and Jab1 results in increased activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity, increased expression of AP-1 and HIF-1-dependent genes, and reduced expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, resulting in enhanced tumourigenesis and metastasis in vivo (28). It may be that in pancreatic cancer, the same mechanisms are taking place promoting tumour growth and metastasis. Jab1 is a negative regulator of p27Kip1, promoting its degradation (29). p27Kip1 normally binds to and prevents the activation of cyclin complexes controlling cell cycle progression at G1 (30). Thus, it may be that increased interaction between Psoriasin and Jab1 results in decreased p27Kip1. In line with this, an increased expression of p27Kip1 was also observed in the Psoriasin knockdown cells (Fig. 4C). We also found that Psoriasin overexpression results in increased expression of cyclin D2, which may explain the mode of action for Psoriasin-mediated promotion of cyclin activation and cell cycle progression. Additionally, differential expression of RAGE, the receptor of Psoriasin was seen in three pancreatic cancer cell lines. RAGE has 8 isoforms of protein products encoded by 9 different splicing variants in humans (listed at PubMed Gene). However, we cannot identify which variants were expressed by these cell lines. The exact role played by RAGE in mediating functions of Psoriasin in pancreatic cancer is yet to be investigated. In this study, Psoriasin expression was inversely linked to cell-matrix adhesion. This is similar to our results observed in both prostate and lung cancer (11,15). It suggests that expression of Psoriasin is a response by cancer cells to changes of cell-matrix adhesion and reciprocally affects cell adhesion to matrix. We also found Psoriasin expression has no effect on the adhesion of pancreatic cancer cells to peritoneal mesothelial in vitro, and conclude that Psoriasin may not be required for the adhesion during peritoneal metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Psoriasin is regarded as an inflammation-associated protein and has chemoattractant properties, promoting migration of granulocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages and monocytes. Our study showed Psoriasin overexpression results in increased migration of pancreatic cancer cells. The multi-ligand receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) has been identified as a Psoriasin receptor, and implicated in leukocyte migration and the inflammatory process. It may be that, similar to leukocyte migration, Psoriasin attaches to RAGE in order to promote cancer cell migration (5). Further to its influences on cell growth, adhesion and migration, we also examined the effect of Psoriasin on pancreatic cancer cell invasion. It is well known that activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 promotes the invasive and metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells (31,32). In our recent study of Psoriasin in prostate cancer, Psoriasin has been shown to have an effect on prostate cancer cell invasion via MMPs (11). This is subsequently confirmed herein, whereby Psoriasin overexpression in pancreatic cancer cells resulted in increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity. Taken together, these data suggest Psoriasin regulates invasion of pancreatic cancer cells via regulation of MMPs. In a recent study, Morgan et al observed interaction between Psoriasin and the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin \u03b26 subunit is required for \u03b1v\u03b26-dependent breast cancer cell invasion. Similarly, they showed upregulation of MMPs in Psoriasin overexpressing breast cancer cells (33). In line with its higher expression levels in local invasive tumours, Psoriasin promotes invasion of pancreatic cancer cells which leads to a greater local invasive expansion of the disease. A recent report of disruption of cell anchorage inducing apoptosis led us to investigate whether Psoriasin has a role of inducing this form of anoikis resistance in pancreatic cancer cells (34). Anoikis is referred to as a programmed cell death or apoptosis which happens to adherent cells lacking anchorage (34). It can occur during the dissemination of pancreatic cancer cells through circulation and peritoneal cavity when they lose anchorage. At 3 h we saw a significant rise of cell-cell aggregates, indicating a role for Psoriasin in inducing these aggregates. Previous experiments showed a role for Psoriasin in preventing anoikis (34), a result we confirmed in our cell lines, hinting that cell-cell aggregation may contribute to preventing anoikis. Despite this, based on our results, the number of cell-cell aggregates show a significant increase only at 3 h, whereas cells display anoikis resistance at 1 h, indicating other mechanisms must be at play to compensate for the disparity. Western blot analyses of adherent cells showed an increased activation of caspase 3 in the Psoriasin knockdown MIA-PaCa-2 cells. The involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic caspase pathways and activation of caspase-3 in pancreatic cancer cells undergoing anoikis remains unclear and is yet to be investigated. Further investigation is also required to reveal molecules involved in the enhanced cell-cell adhesion and aggregation. In conclusion, reduced expression of Psoriasin was seen in pancreatic cancers with distant metastases, whilst higher transcript levels were seen in locally advanced tumours. Psoriasin expression in pancreatic cancer cells is associated with cell growth, cell-matrix adhesion and migration. Psoriasin regulates invasion of pancreatic cancer cells via expression of MMPs. The implication of Psoriasin expression in invasion, disease progression and potential as a therapeutic target warrants further investigation."}, "27866394": {"pmid": "27866394", "pmcid": "PMC5345670", "title": "Repeated otilonium bromide administration prevents neurotransmitter changes in colon of rats underwent to wrap restraint stress", "abstract": "\nAbstract\nOtilonium bromide (OB) is a spasmolytic drug successfully used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Its efficacy has been attributed to the block of L\u2010 and T\u2010type Ca2+ channels and muscarinic and tachykinin receptors in the smooth muscle. Furthermore, in healthy rats, repeated OB administration modified neurotransmitter expression and function suggesting other mechanisms of action. On this basis, we investigated whether repeated OB treatment prevented the functional and neurochemical changes observed in the colon of rats underwent to wrap restrain stress (WRS) a psychosocial stressor considered suitable to reproduce the main IBS signs and symptoms. In control, WRS and OB/WRS rats functional parameters were measured in vivo and morphological investigations were done ex vivo in the colon. The results showed that OB counteracts most of the neurotransmitters changes caused by WRS. In particular, the drug prevents the decrease in SP\u2010, NK1r\u2010, nNOS\u2010, VIP\u2010, and S100\u03b2\u2010immunoreactivity (IR) and the increase in CGRP\u2010, and CRF1r\u2010IR. On the contrary, OB does not affect the increase in CRF2r\u2010IR neurons observed in WRS rats and does not interfere with the mild mucosal inflammation due to WRS. Finally, OB \nper se increases the Mr2 expression in the muscle wall and decreases the number of the myenteric ChAT\u2010IR neurons. Functional findings show a significantly reduction in the number of spontaneous abdominal contraction in OB treated rats. The ability of OB to block L\u2010type Ca2+ channels, also expressed by enteric neurons, might represent a possible mechanism through which OB exerts its actions.\n", "fulltext": "Otilonium bromide (OB) \u2013 also known by its IUPAC chemical name N,N\u2010diethyl\u2010N\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010(4\u2010[2\u2010(octyloxy)benzamido]benzoyloxy)ethanaminium bromide \u2013 is prescribed in Europe, Asia and South America as an anti\u2010spasmodic for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 1. This drug contains a charged quaternary ammonium that favours its accumulation within the gastrointestinal wall 2. The OB spasmolytic activity is mainly because of the interference of calcium influx through L\u2010type Ca2+ channels and the mobilization of cellular calcium required for smooth muscle contraction, thereby limiting excessive intestinal contractility. Otilonium bromide also inhibits T\u2010type Ca2+ channels and muscarinic and tachykinin receptors (NK1r and NK2r) on smooth muscle and primary afferent neurons that may have the joint effect of reducing motility and abdominal pain 3. Indeed, in strips of human colon, exposure to OB, either alone or in the presence of the tachykinin agonist, caused a concentration\u2010dependent reduction in the number of the cells that internalized the receptor NK2r 4. A recent clinical trial has confirmed the OB efficacy in IBS patients and has shown, for the first time, the long\u2010term beneficial effect of the drug during the follow\u2010up period in a group of patients previously treated with OB as compared to placebo group 5. These findings suggest that OB given in a long\u2010term way is able to preserve the clinical beneficial effects beyond its interruption. Several experiments have been done in rats repeatedly treated with OB to ascertain its cellular targets and mechanisms of action. The results obtained demonstrated: in the smooth muscle cells, morphological changes in the structures involved in calcium handling and storage (caveolae, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria) and in the NK1r distribution and Mr2 expression; in the enteric neurons, immunohistochemical and functional changes in the nNOS/SP/NK1r mediated signalling circuit 6, 7, 8. Colonic biopsies from IBS patients show an increase in activated lymphocytes, mast cells, and neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes in the mucosa suggestive for a local inflammation 9, 10. Moreover, an increase in the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 no\u2010selective ionic channel and SP expression has been reported and related to pain 11. A main role in the aetiopathogenesis of IBS has been attributed to a psychosocial stress and animal models based on this hypothesis and reproducing some of the most common IBS symptoms have been developed. We recently demonstrated in rats underwent to the wrap restrain stress (WRS) the development of an increased colonic activity and faecal excretion and, as in IBS patients, a mild inflammation in the mucosa 12. Interestingly, we also found important changes in glial cells and in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the entire colonic wall, and an increase in CRF1r expressing myenteric neurons. The peculiar features of the WRS model make it particularly suitable to investigate the ability of OB to prevent or attenuate the appearance and evolution of the colonic alterations induced by stress. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate whether a repeated treatment with OB prevented the functional and immunohistochemical changes characterizing the WRS rats. Male Wistar rats (n = 71) from Janvier Labs (Saint\u2010Berthevin, France) weighing around 250\u2013350 g on the day of experiments were used for this study and housed at Syncrosome Laboratories (Marseille, France). The acclimatization of the animals lasted at least 5 days. They had free access to food and drinking water ad libitum. The experimental procedures were carried out in accordance to European guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Directive 2010/63/UE) and were approved by the French Ethical Committee C2EA\u2010/71, of which Syncrosome is a member. Every effort was done to maintain animal's health, safety and welfare, minimize suffering and reduce the number of animals used in the experiments. Furthermore, Syncrosome laboratories and its animal housing facilities are accredited by French Authorities and audited every year by French Department of Veterinary Service. The study was divided into two consecutive phases. The first phase was carried out to better define the OB dose to be used in the second one, consisting in the main session of experiments. First phase: OB was given 4 hrs before colorectal distension (CRD) and abdominal contraction (AC) recordings at doses of 2 or 20 mg/kg p.o. (Fig. 1 and Table S1). These doses and time were chosen on the basis of previous experiments 6, 7 and of pharmacokinetic properties of the drug 2. Second phase: The chosen OB dose of 20 mg/kg was administered for 10 days and on the day 11, the rats received the last dose 4 hrs before undergoing to CRD (Fig. 1 and Table S1). In both phases, rats were subjected to WRS for 2 hrs, starting at 1.5 hrs after the last OB administration. For the total number of rats used for each phase, see Table S1. The drug was dissolved in water at final concentrations of 0.4 and 4 mg/ml and a total volume of 5 ml/kg was administered to reach the 2 or 20 mg/kg dose respectively. The controls received an equal volume of water. Otilonium bromide was given p.o. For the first phase, OB was administered once at Day 0 (D0) 4 hrs before CRD test; for the second phase OB was administered twice daily from D\u221210 to D0 and the last dose on D0 4 hrs before CRD test (Fig. 1 and Table S1). The application of WRS consists in the block of the upper forelimbs and thoracic trunk for 2 hrs. The timing and the procedure of WRS application was described in detail in Data S1. Faecal pellet collection and ACs following colorectal distention by the insertion of a balloon were chosen as functional parameters. The details about the timing of functional evaluations and methods were explained in Data S1. As depicted on Figure 1 and Table S1, the animals that did not undergo to CRD were killed at T0 with pentobarbital and the colon was removed. In particular, three full\u2010thickness samples (length: 1 cm/each) of the ascending colon (starting 1 cm far from the ileo\u2010caecal junction) were taken from each experimental group and randomly assigned to the different procedures described below. For paraffin embedded tissue, the sample was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) over night (ON) at 4\u00b0C, dehydrated in graded ethanol series, cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin. Then, the sections (5 \u03bcm thick) were cut using a rotary microtome (MR2; Boeckeler Instruments Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA) and collected on positively charged slides. For frozen tissue, a second sample after fixation was cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS ON at 4\u00b0C, embedded in Killik cryostat medium (Bio\u2010Optica, Milan, Italy) and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. Transverse cryosections (8 \u03bcm thick) were cut using a cryostat (Leica Microsystem CM 1950, Wetzlar, Germany) and collected on positively charged slides. For western blot analysis, a third sample was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To evaluate the tissue organization, either paraffin embedded or frozen sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. The paraffin embedded sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated as usual and for antigen retrieval boiled 10 min. in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0; Bio\u2010Optica) or treated for 20 min. at 90\u201392\u00b0C in Tris buffer (10 mM) with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (1 mM, pH 9.0), as appropriate, followed by cooling to room temperature (RT). For fluorescence microscope examination, the frozen and the deparaffinized sections were washed in PBS and blocked for 20 min. at RT with 1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Applichem, Darmstad, Germany) in PBS, plus 0.5% Triton (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for the frozen ones. The primary antibodies diluted in PBS were applied ON at 4\u00b0C. The day after, the sections were washed in PBS and incubated for 2 hrs at RT in the dark with appropriate fluorochrome\u2010conjugated (AlexaFluor 488\u2010 or 568\u2010conjugated) secondary antibodies (goat anti\u2010rabbit, goat anti\u2010mouse, donkey anti\u2010goat, or goat anti\u2010guinea pig, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) diluted 1:333 in PBS. The sections were washed in PBS and mounted in an aqueous medium (Immuno\u2010Mount; Thermo scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) with or without 4\u2032,6\u2010diamidino\u20102\u2010phenylindole (Sigma\u2010Aldrich). The immunoreaction products were observed under an epifluorescence Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using 488\u2010, 568\u2010 and 370\u2010nm excitation wavelength for the green, red and blue fluorescent labels, respectively, and the fluorescence images were captured using a Leica DFC310 FX 1.4\u2010megapixel digital camera, equipped with the Leica software application suite LAS V3.8 (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). For light microscope examination, after deparaffinization, rehydration and antigen retrieval phase as reported, the sections were treated with 3% H2O2 in PBS for 5 min. to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After washing, the sections were incubated with 1.5% BSA in PBS for 20 min. at RT. The anti\u2010S100\u03b2 primary antibody was applied ON at 4\u00b0C. The day after, the sections were incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibody diluted 1:300 (goat anti\u2010mouse; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) in PBS for 2 hrs at RT. Subsequently, the sections were washed, treated with ABC Reagent (Vectastain ABC/Elite Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 20 min. and developed with 3,3\u2032\u2010diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma\u2010Aldrich), as chromogen. Sections were counter\u2010stained with haematoxylin. After washing in PBS, the sections were mounted in an aqueous medium (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) and observed under the Microstar IV light microscope (Reichert Technologies, Reichert Inc, Depew, USA). For CRF1r staining, the procedure described by 13, 14 has been followed. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation for 30 min. with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS and nonspecific reaction was blocked by incubation in 3% normal donkey serum (60 mg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min. at RT. Sections were incubated with anti\u2010CRF1r in PBS 0.3% Triton X\u2010100 and the day after with the secondary antibody (rabbit anti\u2010goat; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Finally, these sections were processed for avidin\u2010biotin\u2010peroxidase procedure using DAB and observed under the light microscope. Negative controls were performed omitting the primary antibody or using the specific blocking peptide to exclude the presence of nonspecific staining. The procedure followed foreseen the protein content extraction from full\u2010thickness samples of ascending colon. After spectrophotometrically protein quantification, samples and appropriate molecular\u2010weight markers were resolved by standard electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane. After the incubation with primary and peroxidase\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies, the immunoreaction products were revealed by chemiluminescence reagent. To normalize the values of the antibody, the runs were also immunostained with anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010actin, assumed as housekeeping protein. The details about western blot procedures were explained in Data S1. Information on primary antibody sources and used concentrations for fluorescence, light microscope examination and WB analysis is shown in Table S2. The faecal pellets and AC number was quantified and expressed as number \u00b1 S.E.M. A quantitative analysis of the immunoreactive (IR) structures was done by the acquisition of digitized images of the labelling (1 section/animal; 5 animals/group) using 20\u00d7 or 40\u00d7 objectives, as appropriate; attention was made to avoid overlapping between the adjacent portions. Each image was analysed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, ML, USA) to evaluate the intensity of labelling and to quantify the area of the IR structures. The photographs\u2019 threshold values were set to analyse the structures of interest exclusively. The labelling was converted to a binary image and the number of pixels and the IR intensity were measured. The results are expressed as optical density \u00b1 S.E.M. The quantitative analysis of the number of IR neurons or inflammatory cells was done by two observers, blind to each other, along the entire section (three sections/animal; five animals/group) and expressed as number \u00b1 S.E.M. The quantitative analysis of western blot\u2010IR bands was performed by computer\u2010assisted densitometry by using the QuantityOne analysis software (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with each band corresponding to a single specimen. The results for the protein of interest were normalized to the corresponding \u03b2\u2010actin band. Statistical analysis was performed by one\u2010way anova followed by Newman\u2013Keuls post\u2010test to compare the three groups. Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05. A statistically significant increase (P < 0.05) in the weight and number of faecal pellets was found in rats subjected to WRS as compared to controls (2869 \u00b1 416 versus 986 \u00b1 219 mg and 10.63 \u00b1 1.97 versus 5.88 \u00b1 1.27 respectively). Acute administration of OB (2 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) did not affect these parameters (data not shown). AC numbers of rats subjected to WRS was increased only at 1.2 ml distension as compared to controls (21.00 \u00b1 3.09 versus 14.43 \u00b1 2.62). This increase (35% from controls) was reduced by 20 mg/kg p.o. OB at 14.63 \u00b1 1.89 and by 2 mg/kg p.o. OB at 17.88 \u00b1 2.97. On the basis of these results, the dose of 20 mg/kg OB was chosen for the next experiments. Number and weight of faecal pellets showed a statistically significant increase (P < 0.05) in the WRS group as compared to control one (10.0 \u00b1 1.64 versus 7.25 \u00b1 1.10 and 2724 \u00b1 364 versus 1146 \u00b1 151 mg respectively). The repeated treatment with 20 mg/kg of OB was unable to affect these parameters (values in number and weight of faecal pellets were: 10.25 \u00b1 1.22 and 2327 \u00b1 277 mg). Increase in distension volume produced an increase in AC in all groups. Controls: 3.75 \u00b1 1.39, 7.75 \u00b1 0.86, 13.25 \u00b1 1.79, 21.75 \u00b1 2.30; WRS rats: 4.13 \u00b1 1.11, 5.88 \u00b1 1.57, 18.13 \u00b1 1.92, 29.00 \u00b1 2.00; OB/WRS rats: 1.75 \u00b1 0.56, 6.50 \u00b1 1.73, 17.38 \u00b1 1.61, 25.25 \u00b1 3.52 at 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 ml of volume distension, respectively. The increase was statistically significant (P < 0.05) as compared to 0 volume distension at 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 ml of volume distension in controls and at 0.8 and 1.2 ml in WRS and OB treated animals. Comparison between controls and WRS rats showed a statistically significant increase (P < 0.05) in the latter group at 0.8 and 1.2 ml of volume distension. OB/WRS did not show any significant difference in the number of AC at any volume of distension examined as compared to WRS rats. However, at variance with WRS rats, the number of AC in OB treated rats at 1.2 ml of volume distention was not significantly different from controls. To note, in the absence of volume distension, OB/WRS group showed a statistically significant decrease (P < 0.05) in number of AC (1.75 \u00b1 0.56) versus WRS (4.13 \u00b1 1.11) and control rats (3.75 \u00b1 1.39). Histological evaluation of the colonic wall with haematoxylin and eosin showed a substantial integrity of mucosa, submucosa and muscle wall in all groups of animals. Similarly, the labelling with the pan\u2010neuronal marker PGP9.5 showed no changes among the groups in the total number of neurons either in the myenteric or submucous plexus (SMP; data not shown). Haematoxylin and eosin staining and c\u2010kit\u2010IR labelling revealed the presence of a mild inflammation consisting in clusters of immunity cells beneath the lining epithelium and in the mucosa a significant increase in eosinophilic granulocytes (controls: 51.50 \u00b1 6.652; WRS: 76.50 \u00b1 3.775; OB/WRS: 71.50 \u00b1 6.764, P < 0.05) and mast cells (controls: 166 \u00b1 7.371; WRS: 231.3 \u00b1 7.219; OB/WRS: 221.3 \u00b1 4.978, P < 0.001), in WRS and OB/WRS rats compared to controls. CGRP\u2010IR nerve fibres were significantly increased in WRS rats. This increase was prevented by OB treatment, especially in the submucosa (Fig. 2A\u2013D and Table 1). S100\u03b2\u2010IR structures were significantly decreased in WRS rats compared to controls. This decrease was not present in OB/WRS rats (Table 1). VIP\u2010IR neurons were decreased in WRS rats. This decrease was prevented in OB/WRS group (Fig. 3A\u2013D and Table 1). nNOS\u2010IR neurons were significantly decreased either in WRS or OB/WRS rats compared to controls (Table 1). NK1r\u2010 and ChAT\u2010IR neuron number was unchanged in the SMP among the groups of animals (Table 1). To note, whereas in controls and OB/WRS rats, the NK1r\u2010IR labelling was located along the plasma membrane, in WRS rats, it was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. c\u2010kit\u2010IR interstitial cells of Cajal showed no changes in organization, size, shape and number; however, the labelling distribution appeared clustered in OB/WRS and WRS rats instead to be uniformly distributed along the cell profile as in controls (Fig. 4A\u2013C). Mr2\u2010IR in the smooth muscle cells was decreased in WRS rats compared to controls and OB/WRS rats (Fig. 5A\u2013C). Quantization of the receptor by WB confirmed this decrease (Fig. 5D). ChAT\u2010IR neuron number showed no change in WRS rats while it was significantly decreased in OB/WRS rats (Fig. 5E\u2013G and Table 1). S100\u03b2\u2010IR structures were significantly reduced in WRS rats compared to controls; this decrease was prevented by OB treatment (Table 1). CRF1r\u2010 and CRF2r\u2010IR neurons (Fig. 6A\u2013F) were significantly increased in WRS rats compared to controls. To note, OB prevented the CRF1r increase exclusively (Fig. 6G and H, Table 1). VIP\u2010, nNOS\u2010 and NK1r\u2010IR neuron number was significantly decreased in WRS rats; these decreases were completely prevented in OB treated rats (Figs 3A\u2013C, E and 7D; Table 1). Similar to the SMP neurons, in controls and OB/WRS rats the NK1r\u2010IR labelling was mostly distributed along the plasma membrane (Fig. 7A and C), while in WRS rats the majority of the neurons were labelled also in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7B). SP\u2010 and nNOS\u2010IR nerve structures were significantly decreased in WRS rats; these decreases were undetected in OB/WRS group of animals (Table 1). This study demonstrates that repeated OB administration in rats subjected to acute WRS is able to counteract most of the morphological changes caused by this psychosocial stressor in the colonic wall. In particular, the drug prevents the decrease in SP\u2010, NK1r\u2010, nNOS\u2010, VIP\u2010 and S100\u03b2\u2010IR as well as the increase in CGRP\u2010, and CRF1r\u2010IR detected in WRS rats. As expected, OB does not interfere with the mild mucosal inflammation because of WRS. Interestingly, OB treatment per se increases the Mr2 expression in the muscle wall and decreases the number of the ChAT\u2010IR myenteric neurons. Noteworthy, OB does not affect the increase in CRF2r\u2010IR neurons observed in WRS rats. With regard to the functional findings, OB is able to significantly reduce the number of spontaneous AC compared to WRS and control rats but not of those induced by volume distention. Several studies have been addressed to identify the OB molecular targets 15, 16. The results obtained in in vitro experiments after acute exposition of rat colonic strips to the drug showed that OB behaves as antagonist of the L\u2010type Ca2+ channel, M2 and neurokinin receptors 3, 17, 18. These effects were considered the consequence of the OB interaction with the colonic smooth muscle cells because of the very poor systemic absorption of the drug 2. Recently, a series of publications where OB was administered repeatedly has allowed to extend the knowledge on the complexity of OB pharmacology unmasking a constant involvement of the enteric nervous system in mediating the drug actions 6, 7, 8. Otilonium bromide is commonly used to control the main symptoms of IBS, a chronic disease characterized by visceral pain and/or discomfort, hypersensitivity and abnormal motor responses 19. Although the aetiopathogenesis of IBS is only partially understood, a main role has been attributed to psychosocial stressors of different origin 20, 21. The WRS is considered a psychosocial stress model adequate to reproduce in the animals, some of the typical symptoms and signs of IBS 22, 23, 24. Accordingly, we recently reported functional and morphological alterations in WRS rat similar to those described in IBS patients 12 and, presently, we demonstrate that repeated OB administration prevents most of the changes caused by the WRS, particularly those on the enteric nervous system. However, the cellular mechanism through which OB could interfere with the nerve structures is undefined. Among the several pharmacological properties attributed to OB, the inhibition of the calcium entry by binding to the L\u2010type Ca2+ channels has been considered the most significant 3, 6, 16, 17. In this respect, since the neurons express the L\u2010type Ca2+ channels, the possibility that OB, blocking these channels, could modify the neuronal response to physiological 6, 7 or pathological 12 stimuli has to be considered. As a matter of fact the variations in the neurotransmitters\u2019 expression found in the myenteric neurons after repeated OB treatment 6, 7, 8 are coupled to significant changes in neuronal activity 8. Of particular interest are the changes in the CRF1r and CRF2r expression presently detected in the myenteric neurons of WRS rats and in WRS rats pre\u2010treated with OB. The presence of these two receptors was already demonstrated either by PCR techniques in the human colon 13 or by immunohistochemistry in the rat colon 14 and it was shown that the CRF2r is higher expressed compared to the CRF1r. In agreement, we presently detect a greater number of CRF2r\u2010IR neurons compared to the CRF1r\u2010IR ones. Pharmacological studies have shown that the endogenous ligand cortical releasing factor (CRF) shows higher affinity to the CRF1r respect to the CRF2r 14, 25. Cortical releasing factor is considered the primary hypothalamic mediator of the mammalian neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to stress 26 and the adverse gastrointestinal effects (visceral hypersensitivity, increased colonic transit) caused by its injection or by psychosocial stressors are blocked by CRF1r antagonists 27, 28. With regard to the CRF2r role, it was reported that injection of selective agonists did not provoke any measurable response in the rat colonic wall 14 and it has been suggested that the CRF2r activation could negatively modulate the CRF1r mediated responses. In fact, the administration of the selective CRF2r agonist, Urocortin 2, inhibits the CRF1r mediated stimulation of colonic motor function induced by acute partial restrain stress or by CRF injection 14. In a recent paper, we reported that WRS causes an increase in the CRF1r expressing neurons in the myenteric plexus of rat colon. Presently, we show also a significant increase in the CRF2r\u2010IR myenteric neurons in WRS rats. Thus, it can be inferred that stress causes a complex neuronal response consisting not only of a predictable increase in CRF1r, as mediator for the adverse local effects, but also of an unexpected increase in CRF2r. On the basis of the literature, this latter finding might be interpreted as an attempt to cope to the CRF1r mediated stress effects that could bring to an overdrive state and predispose to diseases. The relevance of the CFR2r in determining the outcome of a stress condition is likely underestimate. In a recent report on the lack of a CRF1r antagonist efficacy to ameliorate colonic symptoms in IBS patients 29, it has been suggested that impairment in the CRF1r\u2010CRF2r integrated response might be implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease. In the muscle wall of WRS rats, the expression of the inhibitory (nNOS, VIP) and excitatory (SP/NK1r) neurotransmitters investigated is decreased suggesting that stress causes an impairment of the neuronal activity. Reasonably, this impairment is triggered by the CRF through its receptors. To note, the CRF, beyond the central nervous system, is also expressed and likely released by the enteric neurons and, in stress conditions, the number of the neurons expressing the CRF is increased 13. Few and partial information is available on the specific neuronal population releasing the CRF and/or expressing the CRF receptors 30, 31. Noteworthy, presently, we show that repeated administration of OB prevents almost of the neurotransmitters\u2019 decreases and the overexpression of the CRF1r in the myenteric plexus without modifying that of the CRF2r. Our experimental conditions do not allow to establish a direct relationship between the two events; however, the ability of OB to prevent the neurotransmitters\u2019 changes due to stress and the reduction in the excitatory ChAT expressing neurons, caused by the drug per se, might explain the spasmolytic activity exerted by OB and the relief from most of the IBS symptoms. As expected OB does not show any anti\u2010inflammatory activity when measured as cell infiltrate and mast cell increase. However, through its ability to interact with the nerve structures, OB prevents the increase in the CGRP expression in the submucosa and mucosa of WRS rats. CGRP is mainly expressed by sensory neurons and in IBS patients or in rats underwent to maternal deprivation, CGRP\u2010positive fibres are increased and strictly associated with mast cells 32, 33, 34. Moreover, stress conditions favour mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators able to sensitize sensory afferents such as those carrying CGRP 35, 36. Furthermore, the rectal biopsy samples taken from patients with well\u2010characterized rectal hypersensitivity showed a marked increase in submucosal CGRP 11. Therefore, although OB does not interfere with the mast cell increase present in WRS rats, it is reasonable to infer that, because of its ability to prevent the overexpression of CGRP, it might also ameliorate symptoms such as pain. The results obtained with the functional studies appear contrasting also in view of the known OB efficacy in counteract visceral sensitivity in IBS patients 37, 38. Interestingly, OB causes a significant reduction in the spontaneous AC contraction respect to controls and WRS rats. This datum indicates that OB induces muscle relaxation, thus reducing the visceral motility. The inability of OB to reduce the number of AC because of volume distention might be explained by the modalities provided by the CRD test. In fact, it has been reported that the application of a progressive volume of distention increasing the painful sensations recruits central efferent fibres 22 insensitive to OB effects 3. Accordingly, when this test was applied to measure the efficacy of other drugs known to be able to reduce the visceral sensitivity in humans, the results failed 39. In conclusion, this study confirms the WRS as a model suitable to mimic most of the IBS symptomatology and adequate to investigate the OB cellular targets to ameliorate our understanding of the drug mechanisms of action in IBS. The findings obtained indicate that most of the OB activity is exerted at the enteric nervous system level by preventing the neuronal changes caused by the stress. How OB act at the cellular level is not defined yet; however, its ability to block the calcium entry could represent a plausible explanation. This pharmacological property might play a role also in avoiding the increase in the neuronal cells that express the CRF1r, as observed in the WRS rats. We are aware that the combination of a repeatedly pre\u2010treatment with the application of an acute model of stress might represent a limitation of this study. However, the results obtained in the clinical studies of OB efficacy in IBS patients 40 have brought to hypothesize that cyclic or intermittent treatment, independently on the presence of the IBS symptoms, might be an adequate therapeutic strategy to manage the IBS 41.

Comparing 71 erysipelas patients to 55 age-matched healthy individuals, we sought for CAT, SOD1, and SOD2 single polymorphism mutation (SNPs) interactions with erysipelas' predisposition and serum cytokine levels in the acute and recovery phases of erysipelas infection. Whereas female patients had a higher predisposition to erysipelas, male patients were prone to having a facial localization of the infection. The presence of SOD1 G7958, SOD2 T2734, and CAT C262 alleles was linked to erysipelas' predisposition. T and C alleles of SOD2 T2734C individually were linked to patients with bullous and erythematous erysipelas, respectively. G and A alleles of SOD1 G7958A individually were associated with lower limbs and higher body part localizations of the infection, respectively. Serum levels of IL-1\u03b2, CCL11, IL-2R\u03b1, CXCL9, TRAIL, PDGF-BB, and CCL4 were associated with symptoms accompanying the infection, while IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, and VEGF were associated with predisposition and recurrence of erysipelas. While variations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-7, IL-8, IL-17, CCL5, and HGF were associated with the SOD2 T2734C SNP, variations of PDFG-BB and CCL2 were associated with the CAT C262T SNP.\n", "fulltext": "Erysipelas is an acute bacterial infection of the upper part of the dermis and superficial lymphatic vessels. In addition to nonspecific symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting, erysipelas has unique clinical features of infection including skin lesions, intense erythema, tenderness, and swelling of the lymph nodes. The legs and faces are the most common areas of localization for erysipelas [1, 2]. Group A (\u03b2-hemolytic) streptococcus (GAS) bacteria are the main causative agent for erysipelas that often began with breakages on the skin barriers allowing the microorganism to penetrate into the skin. Diagnosis of erysipelas is largely based on clinical findings, but laboratory diagnosis of group A streptococcal infections is still largely used to identify the causative organism. GAS-related erysipelas has often been diagnosed in old and immunocompromised individuals as well as in neonates and young children. The commonly accepted antibiotic for the treatment of erysipelas is penicillin, but it is important to note that since the 1980s, cases of severe invasive penicillin-resistant GAS diseases have been on the rise and that to date, no licensed vaccines against GAS have been designed. A major clinical problem that has been encountered with erysipelas is its recurrence. There are 18 million cases of severe GAS-related infections annually reported, with approximately 2.3% fatality. It is believed that the severity of the disease and its fatality rate are associated with penicillin-resistant GAS. Despite intense research, our knowledge of the GAS pathogenesis is incomplete. It has been shown that GAS-induced production of free radicals plays several roles in the pathogenesis of infections. An increased production of free radicals can affect cell vitality by disrupting the integrity and function of cytoplasmic membranes, damaging membrane lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Additionally, free radicals can inhibit the immune system's ability to identify and eliminate GAS. These negative effects are referred to as oxidative stress and can be reduced with the aid of exogenous or endogenous antioxidants. There are three main endogenous antioxidant systems: superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and catalase (CAT). SOD1 is found in the cytosol and nucleus, as well as in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. SOD1 is a major cytoplasmic antioxidant enzyme that metabolizes superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (\u041d2\u041e2), thus protecting the cells against oxygen-related toxicity. SOD2 is the only antioxidant located exclusively in the mitochondria, where it scavenges the superoxide radicals and converts them to molecular oxygen and peroxide. Catalase (CAT) is generally found in the liver, kidney, and erythrocytes. CAT catalyzes the hydrogen peroxide decomposition to harmless compounds such as water and oxygen. Therefore, antioxidants are important in preventing harmful effects of free radicals. Disturbed function of superoxide dismutase antioxidants can reduce cell protection against free radicals released during the course of infection. Although cytokines play an important role in host defenses against infection, inflammatory cytokines may favor production of free radicals and facilitate oxidative stress. For example, overexpression of inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1\u03b2 has been found in oxidative stress-induced melanomas. Also, TNF-\u03b1-induced oxidative stress and subsequent redox system dysfunction have been described in patients with cardiac dysfunction. In another study, the overexpression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 was shown to be associated with an increased severity of GAS infection, higher rate of toxic shock, and tissue necrosis [11, 12]. Currently, our knowledge on the association between SOD1, SOD2, and CAT gene expression and severity of erysipelas is limited. Relationships between serum cytokine levels and erysipelas infection are also scarcely known. Also, correlation between expression of SOD1, SOD2, and catalase genes and activation of inflammatory cytokine in erysipelas still remain unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes encoding SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and cytokine levels and their interaction can serve as susceptibility markers for erysipelas. For that, we analyzed clinical characteristics of the disease in conjunction with SNPs in the selected genes and cytokine levels among residents of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. Additionally, relationships between the studied SNPs and serum cytokine profile were studied in erysipelas patients. Seventy-one erysipelas subjects (average age 63.89\u2009\u00b1\u200910.33) admitted into the \u201cRepublican Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital named after Professor A. F. Agafonova\u201d of The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan were enrolled into this study. Diagnosis was established based on clinical symptoms and laboratory bacterial culture test results. Subjects with concomitant severe and chronic inflammatory diseases in the acute phase were excluded. One blood sample was collected from each of the 71 erysipelas cases. Additionally, serum samples were collected from 50 patients, each of whom, one sample was taken from at the acute and another at the convalescent phase of the disease. The clinical characteristics of the subjects are summarized in Table 1. Fifty-five age-matched controls were recruited (average age 58.34\u2009\u00b1\u20096.93) as well. Blood samples were collected from 55 controls, while serum was obtained from 26 controls. The Ethics Committee of Kazan State Medical University approved this study (N6, 06.25.2012), and informed consent was obtained from each study subject, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Article 20, Federal Law \u201cProtection of Health Right of Citizens of Russian Federation\u201d (N323-\u0424\u0417, 11.21.2011). Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood sample using phenol-chloroform protocol. DNA was stored at \u221240\u00b0C until further use. DNA was analyzed for the presence of the SNPs in the SOD1 (G7958A; rs4998557), SOD2 (C60T, rs4880), SOD2 (T2734C; rs11575993), and CAT (C262T; rs101179) using SNP diagnostic kits 01327-100, 01333-100, 01281-100, and 01342-100, respectively (JSC \u201cLytech,\u201d Russia). Amplification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 44 cytokines were analyzed in the serum samples using Bio-Plex Pro\u2122 Human Cytokine 27-plex and Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 21-plex Assay multiplex kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. These cytokines include IL-1ra, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-2R\u03b1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, CCL27, CXCL1, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12, FGF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, HGF, IFN-\u03b12, IFN-\u03b3, LIF, \u03b2-NGF, PDGF-BB, SCF, SCGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, TRAIL, and VEGF. A fifty-microliter serum sample was used to determine cytokine concentration according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data collected was analyzed using MasterPlex CT control software and MasterPlex QT analysis software (MiraiBio, Division of Hitachi Software, San Francisco, CA, USA). Statistical analysis of genotypes of the studied SNPs in our case-control study was carried out comparing the additive, dominant, and recessive models as earlier defined. The Pearson x2 test, analysis of variance, and logistic regression were used to analyze the clinical differences between the subject groups and the control. Allele and genotype frequencies in the subject and control groups were compared with those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equations using x2 test. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was satisfied in most of the distributions. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to assess the association between the alleles and the risk of the studied infection. The association between cytokine levels, genotype, and clinical presentation of the study group was calculated using logistic regression and linear regressions using an earlier described web application SNPStats (http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats). Statistical difference (p) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (K) were used to analyze the cytokine profile of the patients. A value of \u0440 < 0.05 signifies a statistical significant difference in cytokine levels between groups and subgroups. The value of K > 0.4 was used to indicate a high degree of correlation in changes of a cytokine in infected individuals when the level of the cytokines during the acute phase is compared to the level of the same cytokine during the convalescent phase. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software 22 (IBM). All erysipelas patients enrolled in this study were grouped based in the frequency of the infection: those without previous diagnosis of erysipelas (primary) within the last 365 days (38 patients) and others with more than one episode of erysipelas (recurrent) within the last 365 days (33 patients) (Table 1). Forty-eight patients were females, with an equal number of females having the primary form erysipelas (24 cases) and the recurrent form erysipelas (24 cases). Twenty-three were males, where 14 cases had primary and 9 had recurrent form of the infection. Erysipelas cases were analyzed based on the severity (moderate and severe) of the infection. A total of nine patients were diagnosed with the severe form of erysipelas, and 62 had a moderate form of the infection. The number of male and female patients with the moderate form of erysipelas was fairly similar (22 males; 95.7% of all males, versus 40 females; 83.3% of all females). However, a higher proportion of females had the severe form of the infection (8 females; 16.7%) than that of males (1 male; 4.3%). Based on the clinical manifestation of erysipelas, the subjects were also grouped based on the form of the infection into having erythematous form\u201433 patients (46.5%), and bullous form\u201438 patients (53.5%), of the disease. Erysipelas patients were also divided based on the localization of infection. The majority of patients were having infection on the lower limbs (83.1%), followed by the face (12.7%), and, least of all, on the upper limbs (4.2%). Additionally, a higher proportion of male patients had facial localization of the infection when compared to that of females (5 patients; 21.7% versus 4 patients; 8.3%). There were no significant differences between men and women having infection on the limbs. From the observed results, we suggest that erysipelas has a higher chance to develop the severe form of erysipelas in females than in males. Also, more significantly higher number of female adults are prone to have the recurrent form of the infection than that of male adults but a higher proportion of males are prone to having erysipelas on their faces than that of females. Association analysis revealed significantly higher predisposition to erysipelas in patients with G/G genotype (OR\u2009=\u200910.63, 95% CI\u2009=\u20094.45\u201325.40, p < 0.0001) as compared to patients with A/A or A/G genotype. When the G/G genotype was compared to combined G/A and A/A genotypes, the association with erysipelas was still significant (OR\u2009=\u20098.79, 95% CI\u2009=\u20093.76\u201320.56, p < 0.0001) in patients with G/G genotype (Table 2). These results suggest that individuals with the G/G genotype are predisposed to erysipelas as compared to other genotypes. An association was found between SOD2 C2734T SNP and the risk of erysipelas (Table 3). The T/T and C/T genotypes had a significant association with erysipelas. The T/T genotype had the highest predisposition to erysipelas (OR\u2009=\u20098.33, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.44\u201328.41, p < 0.0007), followed by the C/T genotype (OR\u2009=\u20095.55, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.98\u201315.55, p < 0.0011), and then the C/C genotype (OR\u2009=\u20091). It appears that the presence of a T allele (in T/T and C/T) increases the predisposition to erysipelas (OR\u2009=\u20096.19, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.28\u201316.84, p < 0.0004) than that of C/C genotype. There was a lack of predisposition to erysipelas in SOD2 T/T genotype (OR\u2009=\u20092.3, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.93\u20135.72, p < 0.0724) when compared to the C/T and C/C genotypes combined (Table 3). Our data suggest that individuals with the T allele (homozygous T/T or heterozygous C/T genotype) have a higher predisposition to erysipelas as compared to those with C/C genotype. The frequency of the SOD2 C60T SNP allele and genotype distribution in the erysipelas patients and controls were not significantly different (Table 4). Therefore, we conclude that the SNP SOD2 C60T has a limited effect on the predisposition to erysipelas. When analyzed individually, no association between genotypes C/C, C/T, and T/T and predisposition to erysipelas was found. However, when the predisposition was compared between patients with C/C genotype against those with T/T and C/T genotypes together, a significantly higher frequency of erysipelas was found in patients with C/C genotype (OR\u2009=\u20092.58, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.24\u20135.38, p < 0.01) than in those with T/T and C/T genotypes combined (Table 5). Also, analysis revealed a lack of predisposition to erysipelas when patients with T/T genotype were compared to those with C/C and C/T genotypes. We conclude that the C/C genotype of CAT C262T may be linked to a higher predisposition to erysipelas than the C/T and T/T genotypes. The subjects were grouped based on gender, multiplicity of infection, lesion location, severity of the disease, and form of infection (Table 6). There were lack of differences in the distribution of SOD1 (G7958A), SOD2 (T2734C), SOD2 (C60T), and CAT (C262T) SNPs in subjects with erysipelas based on gender, multiplicity, and severity of the disease (p > 0.05). However, when SNPs were analyzed based on the form of erysipelas, a significant difference (p < 0.001) in frequency of SOD2 (T2734C) was found between the bullous and erythematous forms of erysipelas. There was a higher frequency of C allele in patients with erythematous erysipelas (48 patients\u201433.8%) as compared to that in patients with bullous form (37 patients\u201426.1%). In contrast, the frequency of patients with the erythematous form having the T allele was lower (18 patients\u201412.7%) than that in the patients with bullous form (39 patients\u201427.5%). Therefore, we concluded that the presence of C allele could define development of erythematous form of the disease, while T allele delineates bullous erysipelas. There were no differences in the distribution of the SOD1 (G7958A), SOD2 (C60T), and CAT (C262T) SNPs between patients diagnosed with erythematous and bullous forms. Next, SNPs were analyzed based on the localization of erysipelas: the lower limbs, face, or the upper limbs (Table 6). We observed an association between SOD1 (G7958A) and localization of infection, where higher proportion of G/A and A/A genotypes was found in patients who had erysipelas on the upper limb, (p = 0.041). Conversely, a higher number of patients with the G/G genotype had the infection predominantly on the lower limbs. There was a lack of the association between the erysipelas location and SOD2 (T2734C), SOD2 (C60T), or CAT (C-262T) genotypes (Table 6). All cytokines analyzed in the erysipelas patients and control group were divided into four based on their expression levels during the acute phase and convalescent phase of the infection compared to their expression levels in the control group (Table 7). Group 1 consists of IL-1\u03b2, CCL11, IL-2R\u03b1, HGF, CXCL9, and TRAIL. Serum level of these cytokines was significantly higher during the acute phase of the infection in the controls (p < 0.05). There was a lack of differences in these cytokine levels during the convalescent phase as compared to the controls (p > 0.05). Group 2 included IL-7, IL-8, PDGF-BB, CCL4, and CXCL12 cytokines. Serum level of these cytokines did not differ in the acute phase of the disease when compared to the controls (p > 0.05); however, these cytokine levels differed significantly in the convalescent phase of erysipelas as compared to the controls (p < 0.05). The values of IL-7, IL-8, and PDGF-BB in patients were higher in the convalescent phase of the disease than those in controls. Interestingly, the serum level of CCL4 and CXCL12 was higher in the acute phase of the disease as compared to that in the convalescent phase. Group 3 contained IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL10, VEGF, MIF, SCF, and SCGF-\u03b2 cytokines, which differed significantly in the acute phase and as well in the convalescent phase of the disease when compared to values in the control group (p < 0.05). Finally, group 4 included IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL12 (p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-16, IL-18, CCL5, CCL7, CCL27, CXCL1, FGF, IFN-\u03b12, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, TRAIL, and \u03b2-NGF. Serum level of these cytokines remained unchanged during the course of the disease and was similar to that in the controls (p > 0.05). Since serum level of cytokines in groups 1 and 2 differed depending on the phase of the disease, we concluded that changes in these cytokines could be related to the disease pathology. Therefore, we focused our analysis on these cytokines. From cytokines in group 1, we found that the amount of reduction in values of IL1-\u03b2, CCL11, IL-2R\u03b1, CXCL9, and TRAIL from the acute phase to the convalescent phase was significantly similar in all the patients (K > 0.4). In group 2 cytokines, similar changes of serum levels of cytokines PDGF-BB and CCL4 from the acute phase to the convalescent phase were observed in all the patients (K > 0.4). Although the change was a similar reduction from the acute phase in CCL4, serum levels of PDGF-BB were on an average higher during the convalescent phase than the acute phase. Other cytokines of groups 1 and 2 did not express a similar change in values among the patients (K < 0.4). Therefore, we suggest that serum level of IL1-\u03b2, CCL11, IL-2R\u03b1, CXCL9, TRAIL, PDGF-BB, and CCL4 could serve as markers of clinical symptoms associated to erysipelas infection. Since serum levels of group 3 cytokines in the patients differed from the values observed in the controls during the acute phase and also in the convalescent phase, we could suggest that these cytokines are associated to the predisposition of erysipelas and possible recurrence of the infection. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, and VEGFr expressed a similar change in values among the patients (K > 0.4) with the values of IL-6, IL-13, and G-CSF having a similar decrease in the patients from the acute phase to the convalescent phase; VEGFr is maintaining a similar level in the acute and convalescent phases, and IL-9, IL-10, IL-15, and IL-17 expressing a similar value increase from the acute phase to the convalescent phase. Other cytokines of group 3 did not express a similar change in value between the acute phase and the convalescent phase. Cytokines in group 4 did not differ significantly in values between the patients and the controls, but a similar reduction in value from the acute phase to the convalescent phase in the patients was observed in FGF (K = 0.79), while a similar increase in value from the acute phase to the convalescent phase was observed in TNF-\u03b1 (K = 0.83) and CCL27 (K = 0.43). Serum cytokines were analyzed in 50 erysipelas patients and 26 relatively healthy (control) individuals. Two serum samples were collected from each erysipelas case at the time of the admission (acute phase) and the time of discharge (convalescent phase). Erysipelas patients were grouped based on the identified SNPs in SOD T2734C and CAT C262T. Correlation between serum cytokines and SOD C60T was not analyzed since there was a lack of predisposition between this SNP and erysipelas. Also, the SOD 1 G7958A SNP correlation with serum cytokines was not analyzed due to a lack of control individuals with the A/A genotype. The frequency of C/C and C/T genotypes within the 50 erysipelas patients was 25 (50%) and 25 (50%), respectively, while in controls, genotype distribution was 6 (25%) and 18 (75%), respectively. Significant differences in the cytokine values when compared to the genotypes of CAT C262T were observed only in PDGF-BB and CCL2. Cytokine analysis revealed increased PDGF-BB level in serums of patients with C/T genotype (in the acute and convalescent phases) compared to that with controls (p = 0.045) (Table 8). Serum levels of CCL2 were significantly lower in the acute (p = 0.02) and the convalescent phases (p = 0.018) in patients with the CC genotype than in controls (Table 8). Distribution of C/C, C/T, and T/T alleles within the 50 erysipelas patients was 9 (18%), 38 (76%), and 3 (6%), respectively. The values observed in the 26 controls were 4 (15.4%), 17 (65.4%), and 5 (19.2%), respectively. Although IL-1\u03b2 level was elevated in the serum of erysipelas with T/T genotype as compared to the controls, differences in IL-1\u03b2 levels were not significant between the acute and convalescent phases in the patients. There was a T allele dependency on IL-7, IL-8, IL-17, and CCL5 serum level in the patients during the acute phase of the infection. Interestingly, only HFG serum level was associated with the presence of C/C genotype in the erysipelas patients (Table 9). Erysipelas is a superficial skin infection with its etiology often linked to group A streptococci (GAS). The skin of the infected portion is often red, swollen, soft to the touch, and with clearly visible boundaries. Associated clinical symptoms may vary depending on the form of the infection, but typical symptoms could include fever, chills, malaise, and sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A major problem of erysipelas to clinicians is its recurrence, which occurs in 8 to 23 percent of cases. Erysipelas is mostly affected but restricted to the elderly; it has also been observed in younger people. Our observed age distribution of the study group could be on one hand related to the fact that more elderly than younger people with erysipelas are prone to seeking medical care or that the elderly are at a greater risk. Other research had also observed a similar distribution in the age of their studied group [18, 20]. Our study, which was restricted to people who could be categorized as elderly, showed that there was a sex dependence on the recurrence and severity of the infection with more elderly females having more of the recurrent and severe forms of the infection. The elderly female predisposition to recurrence could be associated to treatment or the presence of other ailments such as post breast cancer treatment, osteoporosis, and vaginal colonization of related microbes. Gender-associated differences in the susceptibility to erysipelas could also be attributed to hormonal variations between male and female as has been previously shown by Bellanti et al.. Our observation also revealed that a higher proportion of male patients had facial localization of the infection when compared to that of females. To date, our knowledge on SOD1 G7958A significance is limited to Yi et al. data presenting the association between the mutant allele (A) and increased expression of SOD1 mRNA, while the presence of the wild type (G) was related to reduced gene transcription and consequent increase and accumulation of free radicals in the cells. Our data corroborates this observation, as a significant association was demonstrated between G allele of SOD1 G7958A and predisposition to erysipelas. We propose that the presence of G allele reduces transcription of SOD1 gene leading to decreased protein synthesis of the SOD1 enzyme. As a result, oxidative stress could develop leading to reduced antibacterial defense. Another finding showed that a dysfunctional or reduction in SOD1 expression favored the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza virus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [27, 28]. In another research, an in vitro model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis showed that cells transfected with the mutant SOD1 were more vulnerable to infectious stimuli of the bacteria than cells overexpressing normal SOD1. We observed an association between SOD1 (G7958A) and localization of infection, where higher proportion of G/A and A/A genotypes were found in patients who had erysipelas on the upper limb. Conversely, a higher number of patients with the G/G genotype had the infection predominantly on the lower limbs. This differential distribution of the infection relative to SNP cannot be explained at the moment but needs to be studied. The SOD2 C2734T polymorphism was shown to cause an amino acid substitution from leucine to phenylalanine at codon 84 of the SOD2 gene. Our data provides evidence suggesting this SOD2 substitution of leucine to phenylalanine increases susceptibility to erysipelas and was linked to the more severe bullous form of the infection. It was proposed that due to this substitution, the produced protein subunits fail to properly interact, causing reduction of SOD2 activity and accumulation of free radicals in vitro. Not much data is available about the role of the SOD2 C2734T, but an earlier research had showed that the SNP influenced susceptibility to vitiligo, a skin phenomenon characterized by long-term patches on the skin and loss of skin colour. Other studies had shown that a dysfunctional SOD2 is positively associated with cardiovascular disease risk, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and different forms of cancers [36\u201338]. The C to T substitution in the 60th amino acid position of the SOD2 leads to an alanine to valine substitution. Our data demonstrated lack of association between the SOD2 C60T SNP and predisposition to erysipelas. Therefore, we suggest that SOD2 C60T SNP has limited role in pathogenesis of erysipelas. The CAT C262T SNP is located in the promoter region regulating gene transcriptional activity. It has been shown that the C allele of CAT causes reduction of the transcriptional activity as compared to the T allele. Additionally, C262C genotype of CAT was shown to produce more single-strand DNA breaks than C/T and T/T genotypes. Our data demonstrate that erysipelas patients with the C allele have a higher risk of developing erysipelas. We believe that patients with C262C genotype have lower CAT activity, which can cause accumulation of free radicals and oxidative stress. The association between the CAT C262T SNP was found to have an effect on the predisposition to male infertility, Shigella flexneri-related infection, asbestosis, vitiligo, and cancer although it remains highly contradictory and inconclusive. Our data suggest that IL1-\u03b2, IL-2R\u03b1, CCL4, CCL11, CXCL9, TRAIL, IL-1 \u03b2, and PDGF-BB cytokines could be linked to the clinical symptoms displayed during erysipelas infection. We have found that serum cytokine levels of these cytokines change during the course of the disease. The values of these cytokines during the acute phase in the patients significantly differed from that in the controls. However, during the convalescent phase, these cytokine levels returned to levels similar to that found in the controls. We also suggest that IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, and VEGF could play a role in the clinical patterns and susceptibility of erysipelas infection. This suggestion was based on our finding that serum levels of cytokines in the acute and convalescent phases of the infection significantly differed from values observed in the controls. More research is however suggested to be able to draw out a more direct link between these cytokines and erysipelas infection. Activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 is a hallmark of bacterial infections that is crucial for host-defense responses to infection and injury [10, 44]. The T allele of SOD2 C2734T was shown to be associated with decreased antioxidant capacity in the mitochondria and, subsequently, an increased oxidative stress. Our results show that increased serum IL1-\u03b2 level in erysipelas patients is the T allele of SOD2 SNP C2734T dependent. Based on these observations, we propose that the T allele of SOD2 C2734T could trigger the upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, which would in turn attempt to stimulate the production of a functional SOD2 production which is downregulated in individuals with the T allele. This assumption is supported by our observation that serum IL-1\u03b2 levels were higher in erysipelas patients homozygous for T allele than in patients with the heterozygous form. Therefore, we believe that serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 could serve as a surrogate marker for predisposition to erysipelas and impaired antioxydase system. More study into the role of antioxydase system in erysipelas will help to understand the mechanisms of cytokine activation and their role in disease pathogenesis. IL-7 regulates the development of T cells, enhances cytolytic T lymphocyte activity, and induces lymphokine-activated killer cells [45, 46]. Bacterial invasion induces IL-7 expression in T cells. The role of IL-7 in oxidative stress remains largely unknown. However, studies suggest that IL-7 could be upregulated in patients with increased mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress [48, 49]. Our observation supports the notion that decreased mitochondrial activity is associated with upregulation IL-7. We have found upregulated serum IL-7 in patients with SNP in SOD2 suggesting decreased mitochondrial activity and increased ROS formation. IL-8 is a chemoattractant for inflammatory leukocytes. We found increased IL-8 in patients with the T allele of SOD2 C2734T that causes a decreased antioxidant activity. This observation supports previous observations which showed that IL-8 gene expression can be upregulated by free radicals, while antioxidants reduce the cytokine transcription. We propose that infection could trigger oxidative stress and subsequently IL-8 production. These would exacerbate the generation of the reactive oxygen species and, when combined with decreased SOD2 activity, lead to perpetuate upregulation of IL-8. The cytokine IL-17 is known to recruit leukocytes such as neutrophils to the site of infection thus aiding in the host's defense mechanism against extracellular bacteria. IL-17 also induces neutrophilic release of antimicrobial substances and ROS. Our observation supports this observation as high IL-17 values were associated to the TT genotype of SOD2 C2734T and thus elevated oxidative stress. CCL5 plays an active role in recruiting leukocytes and natural killer cells into inflammatory sites. A strong positive association between CCL5, ROS generation, and systemic lupus erythematosus had earlier been observed. Our observation linked the high levels of expressed CCL5 in erysipelas patients who were linked to the homozygous T genotype in SOD2 C2734T SNP. Interestingly, we have found increased serum level of HGF in erysipelas with C/C genotype of SOD2 C2734T. The C/C genotype is associated with the production of the functional SOD2 protein. Therefore, we suggest that expression of functional SOD2 protein, which is associated with properly functioning antioxidant, is linked to normal cell growth and differentiation. Our conclusion corroborates Borawski et al. data showing increased HGF in individuals with properly functioning SOD. PDGF-BB is known for its participation in cell growth and differentiation. The mitogenic stimulus function of PDGF was shown to be mediated via ROS to activate cell proliferation. Our research showed that while elevated values of PDGF-BB was observed in the erysipelas patients with the C/T genotype of CAT C262T during the acute phase and convalescent phase, the elevated value of PDGF-BB was observed in the patients with the C/C genotype only during the acute phase of the infection. As mentioned earlier, the C allele of CAT C262T was considered poorly functional and contributed to the predisposition of erysipelas. We propose that the functional T allele of CAT C262T contributed to maintaining high PDGF-BB values during the convalescent stage of the infection. Thus, the PDGF-BB-mediated T allele of CAT C262T aided in cell growth and differentiation to replace the erysipelas damaged cells. CCL2 otherwise known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been demonstrated to mediate the migration of monocytes from the blood stream across the vascular endothelium for routine immunological surveillance of tissues, as well as in response to inflammation. The cytokine values of CCL2 were observed to be significantly lower in erysipelas patients with the C/C genotype of CAT C262T than in the individual in the control group with the C/C genotype. Values of the cytokine in patients with the C/T genotype were not significantly different from the values in the individuals of the control group with the C/T genotype. These observations lead us to propose that the C allele of CAT C262T which has been earlier shown to code for a poorly functioning catalase and higher predisposition to erysipelas is linked to low functioning of CCL2, thus hampering immunological surveillance of tissues in erysipelas patients. Our research has been able to demonstrate that erysipelas infection predisposition and its clinical characteristics are affected by age, sex, and SNPs found in SOD1, SOD2, and catalase genes. These SNPs have an influence on an array of cytokines whose values were found to be different from values found in individuals not suffering from erysipelas."}, "28777492": {"pmid": "28777492", "pmcid": "PMC5623735", "title": "Gankyrin induces STAT3 activation in tumor microenvironment and sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma", "abstract": "\nMost hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) develop as a result of chronic liver inflammation.

Gankyrin deficiency in non\u2010parenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal cells, reduced STAT3 activity, interleukin (IL)\u20106 production, and cancer stem cell marker (Bmi1 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]) expression, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential. Chronic inflammation enhances gankyrin expression in the human liver. Gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment is negatively correlated with progression\u2010free survival in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment for HCC. Thus, gankyrin appears to play a critical oncogenic function in tumor microenvironment and may be a potential target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against HCC.\n", "fulltext": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and is usually associated with a very poor prognosis.1 Given the increase in non\u2010alcoholic steatohepatitis and imminent disappearance of chronic viral hepatitis, hepatosteatosis is a major risk factor for HCC.2 Although a causal relationship between chronic damage, inflammation and carcinogenesis has been widely recognized, the exact molecular mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. Hepatic progenitor cells are bipotential cells residing in normal liver and are thought to be implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis.3 A stem cell marker Bmi1 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, tumorigenesis and tumor progression.4, 5 Bmi1 is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene in several human malignancies, including HCC.6, 7 The expression of another \u201cstemness\u201d\u2010related marker epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in HCC is associated with an aggressive biological behavior and poor clinical outcome.8 In chronic inflammation, inflammatory signaling is important for the dedifferentiation and expansion of tumor\u2010initiating cells.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Gankyrin (also named p28GANK or PSMD10) is commonly overexpressed in human cancers.15, 16 In our previous study, we used a conditional gankyrin \u201cfloxed\u201d (gankyrin f/f) strain to generate Villin\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f and Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice lacking gankyrin in intestinal epithelial cells and inflammatory cells to assess the role of gankyrin in the development of colorectal cancer.12 We found that gankyrin promoted the development of inflammation\u2010induced colorectal cancer. We now describe that gankyrin enhances signal transducer and activator of transcription\u00a03 (STAT3) activation, interleukin (IL)\u20106 production and subsequent hepatocarcinogenesis in mice exposed to the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Gankyrin upregulates the expression of stem cell markers in tumors. In addition, gankyrin expression in human non\u2010parenchymal cells is inversely correlated with progression free survival (PFS) in HCC patients treated with sorafenib, suggesting that gankyrin expression may be considered as a new biomarker to predict the likelihood of response to sorafenib. Gankyrin f/f mice were crossed with Alb\u2010Cre and Mx1\u2010Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) to generate Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f and Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice, respectively.12 Induction of Mx1\u2010Cre was achieved with three intraperitoneal injections of 300\u00a0\u03bcg poly(I:C) (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) every other day to 4\u20138\u2010week\u2010old mice. All mice were maintained in the C57BL/6 background in filter\u2010topped cages at Kindai University. Male mice (2\u2010week old) were injected intraperitoneally with 25\u00a0mg/kg DEN (Sigma). After 8\u00a0months on normal chow, mice were killed and analyzed for the presence of HCC. To examine the effect of gankyrin in non\u2010parenchymal cells, we performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiments. Because only 30% of Kupffer cells are reconstituted by donor\u2010derived bone marrow cells 6\u00a0months after BMT,17 we gave mice an intravenous injection of liposomal clodronate (200\u00a0uL intravenously) before irradiation to deplete Kupffer cells and accelerate macrophage turnover.18 We then flushed the tibias and femurs of donor mice to obtain bone marrow. We injected 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 bone marrow cells into the tail veins of lethally irradiated (11\u00a0Gy) recipient mice. Six weeks after BMT, mice were injected intraperitoneally with DEN (100\u00a0mg/kg). Four hours after DEN injection, mice were killed and their livers were removed. All animal procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Kindai University Faculty of Medicine and Institutional Animal Care and in accordance with the recommendations for proper care and use of laboratory animals. Real\u2010time quantitative PCR (qPCR), immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed as previously described.12, 19, 20 The following antibodies were purchased: anti\u2010actin and anti\u2010PSMD10 (gankyrin) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA); anti\u2010Ki67, anti\u2010STAT3, anti\u2010phospho\u2010STAT3, anti\u2010extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinases (ERK), anti\u2010phospho\u2010ERK, anti\u2010p38 and anti\u2010phospho\u2010p38 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA); and anti\u2010Src homology 2 domain\u2010containing protein tyrosine phosphatase\u20101 (SHP\u20101) from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Anti\u2010gankyrin antibody was described previously.16 Immunohistochemistry was performed using ImmPRESS reagents (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunofluorescent TUNEL staining was performed to measure apoptosis in paraffin\u2010embedded sections using the In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit, as described by the manufacturer (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and previous reports.12, 21 Nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6\u2010diamidino\u20102\u2010phenylindole. Duolink fluorescence method was employed to study the interaction between gankyrin and SHP\u20101, as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma Aldrich). The interaction of gankyrin with SHP\u20101 was assessed under a confocal laser microscope using antibodies against human gankyrin and SHP\u20101. THP\u20101 cells and Mono Mac 6 cells, an immortalized line of human monocyte, were maintained in RPMI\u20101640 medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, containing penicillin (100\u00a0U/mL) and streptomycin (100\u00a0mg/mL) and transfection of gankyrin siRNA (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) was carried out using X\u2010treme GENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). To evaluate gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment, we assessed the expression in tumor\u2010infiltrating cells and non\u2010tumor cells at the invasive front of the HCC samples by immunohistochemistry. The evaluation of gankyrin was performed at high magnification (\u00d7100) on the tumor material obtained before receiving sorafenib treatment. The staining status was obtained by calculating the intensity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0extensity score (gankyrin expression score) as described previously.22 Intensity of the staining was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak) or 2 (strong). Extensity of the staining was scored as 0 (1%\u20135% of non\u2010tumor cells), 1 (6%\u201330%), 2 (3%\u201370%) or 3 (71%\u2013100%). To calculate the intensity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0extensity score (gankyrin expression score) of non\u2010tumor cells of the HCC samples, five fields were selected at the invasive front as well as within tumors and the average of five fields (magnification 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0) was used to determine the score. Scoring was performed in a blinded fashion by two investigators (T. S. and N. Y.). Samples were considered high expression for gankyrin if the intensity\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0extensity score (gankyrin expression score) was more than a median value. The gankyrin expression score was evaluated in tumor cells as well. From May 2009 to June 2010, 38\u00a0patients with refractory HCC uncontrolled with standard therapeutic modalities received sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals\u2010Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Leverkusen, Germany) at Kindai University. All pathological specimens of HCC were collected using needle biopsy before sorafenib treatment. Demographic profiles of patients were previously described.21 In addition, liver specimens were collected with needle biopsy in 13\u00a0patients who were clinically suspected of non\u2010alcoholic steatohepatitis. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review boards. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients for subsequent use of their resected tissues. The eligibility criteria for sorafenib therapy were previously described.16 Sorafenib was administered orally at a daily dose of 800\u00a0mg divided into two equal doses. Treatment interruptions and up to two dose reductions (first to 400\u00a0mg once daily, followed by 400\u00a0mg every 2\u00a0days) were permitted for drug\u2010related adverse effects (National Cancer Institute\u2010Common Terminology Criteria [NCI\u2010CTC, version 3]). Treatment was continued until the occurrence of radiologic progression, as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, Version1.1). Data are presented as means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM. Statistical differences between groups were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test or Student's t\u2010test. A value of P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant. We previously generated Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice by crossing gankyrin f/f mice with Mx1\u2010Cre mice. Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice exhibited gankyrin deletion both in parenchymal cells and non\u2010parenchymal cells of the liver (Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a0S1).12 Histomorphology and serum levels of ALT revealed no apparent liver dysfunction in Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice. The strain failed to exhibit spontaneous liver tumors up to 1\u00a0year of age. However, DEN injection on postnatal day 1423 induced well\u2010differentiated HCC in all gankyrin f/f and Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice (Fig.\u00a0S2a). Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice showed gankyrin deletion both in tumor cells and non\u2010parenchymal cells (Fig.\u00a01a). In comparison to gankyrin f/f controls, Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice exhibited reduced HCC multiplicity and size (Fig.\u00a01b\u2013d). HCC isolated from Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice exhibited reduced expression of IL\u20106 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Fig.\u00a01e). Kupffer cell is a major source of IL\u20106 production in the liver.24 Therefore, we purified Kupffer cells from Mxl\u2010Cre;GK f/f mice and examined whether gankyrin in Kupffer cells affect IL\u20106 production. We found that gankyrin deletion reduced IL\u20106 expression in Kupffer cells (Fig.\u00a0S2b). Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of VEGF was reduced in tumor cells of Mxl\u2010Cre;GK f/f mice compared with control mice (Fig.\u00a0S2c). Gankyrin deficiency would downregulate the expression of IL\u20106 in Kupffer cells and that of VEGF in tumor cells. Thus, the deletion of gankyrin both in parenchymal and non\u2010parenchymal cells inhibited hepatocarcinogenesis. We evaluated the role of gankyrin in HCC development in the liver parenchymal cells. Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice were generated by crossing gankyrin f/f mice with Alb\u2010Cre mice. Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice were negative for gankyrin only in liver parenchymal cells (Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a0S1b).12 Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f progeny obtained in the expected Mendelian ratio was healthy and failed to show any apparent liver dysfunction. The strain showed no spontaneous liver tumors up to 1\u00a0year of age. All gankyrin f/f and Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice challenged with DEN developed well\u2010differentiated HCC (Fig.\u00a0S2a). Gankyrin deficiency in liver parenchymal cells reduced HCC size but not HCC number (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c). Furthermore, the deletion of gankyrin in tumor cells reduced the expression of VEGF but not IL\u20106 (Fig.\u00a02d). Several studies report that gankyrin promotes proliferation of cancer cells through the inhibition of apoptosis and cell cycle progression in\u00a0vitro.15, 25, 26 We assessed the effect of gankyrin on cell death and proliferation in\u00a0vivo. Gankyrin deletion exhibited no significant reduction in apoptosis and proliferation of tumors, as assessed by TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry using anti\u2010Ki67 antibody, respectively (Fig.\u00a0S3a,b). Gankyrin deletion affected neither the protein levels of p53 and RB1 nor the mRNA levels of their target genes (Fig.\u00a03a and Fig.\u00a0S3c). Next, we examined the differentiation status of HCC obtained from gankyrin f/f, Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f and Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice. Analysis of H&E\u2010stained HCC sections did not show any difference in the differentiation status among these strains (Fig.\u00a0S2a). Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a multistep biological process whereby epithelial cells change in plasticity by transient de\u2010differentiation into a mesenchymal phenotype. Gankyrin overexpression was reported to exhibit EMT phenotype, including loss of the epithelial marker E\u2010cadherin and gain of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in cell lines.27 However, gankyrin deficiency did not show significant difference in expression of EMT\u2010related genes (Fig.\u00a0S4a,b). Studies have shown that STAT3 plays a critical role in HCC development.24, 28 We examined the consequences of gankyrin deletion on several signaling pathways in liver parenchymal and non\u2010parenchymal cells. Gankyrin deletion significantly reduced the expression of phosphorylated STAT3 in tumors, and slightly reduced the expression in non\u2010tumor liver tissues (Fig.\u00a03a). Gankyrin\u2010induced pro\u2010inflammatory response enhances the activation of ERK in colorectal tumors.12 This is in line with our result, wherein gankyrin deletion in non\u2010parenchymal cells reduced ERK activity in HCC (Fig.\u00a03a). Previous studies have described a critical role of c\u2010Jun and c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinases (JNK) in the development of HCC.20, 21, 29 We observed no effect of gankyrin deficiency on JNK activity (Fig.\u00a0S5a). SHP\u20101, a well\u2010known inhibitor of activation\u2010promoting signaling cascades, negatively regulates signaling by STAT3 dephosphorylation.12, 30 The Duolink Assay showed the interaction between gankyrin and SHP\u20101 as red punctate dots in liver tumors (Fig.\u00a03b and Fig.\u00a0S6), suggestive of STAT3 activation following gankyrin/SHP\u20101 interaction in non\u2010parenchymal cells where SHP\u20101 was predominantly expressed (Fig.\u00a03c). HCC isolated from Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice exhibited reduced expression of IL\u20106, a downstream molecule of STAT3. To confirm the effect of gankyrin in non\u2010parenchymal cells, we performed bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiments. Six weeks after BMT, mice were injected intraperitoneally with DEN (100\u00a0mg/kg). Four hours after DEN injection, mice were killed and their livers were removed. GK f/f mice rescued with gankyrin\u2010deficient bone marrow exhibited a reduced expression of phosphorylated STAT3 and IL\u20106 compared with those rescued with wild\u2010type bone marrow (Fig.\u00a03e and Fig.\u00a0S7). In addition, no difference in IL\u20106 expression and STAT3 activity was found between Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice and gankyrin f/f controls (Fig.\u00a02d and Fig.\u00a0S5b). Given that IL\u20106 produced by non\u2010parenchymal cells activates the transcription factor STAT3 in the liver,24 the decrease in IL\u20106 production in gankyrin\u2010deficient inflammatory cells may lead to reduced STAT3 activity in tumor cells through a paracrine mechanism. Indeed, immunohistochemistry results showed that the STAT3 activity in tumor cells as well as non\u2010parenchymal cells of Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice was reduced as compared to that in gankyrin f/f controls (Fig.\u00a03d). These data indicate that gankyrin in non\u2010parenchymal cells plays a crucial role in the regulation of STAT3/IL\u20106 signaling, which is critical for DEN\u2010induced hepatocarcinogenesis.24 Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 is essential for the expansion of liver cancer stem cell.11, 12, 28 Inflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20106 are important for the dedifferentiation and generation of tumor\u2010initiating cells.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 HCC isolated from Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice, but not Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice, exhibited decrease in the expression of stem cell markers Bmi1 and EpCAM as compared to those from controls (Fig.\u00a01e and 2d). Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of Bmi1 was reduced in tumor cells of Mxl\u2010Cre;GK f/f mice compared with control mice (Fig.\u00a0S8). Taken together, gankyrin in non\u2010parenchymal cells may control STAT3 signaling and stem cell expansion within the tumor microenvironment. Gankyrin accelerates proteasomal degradation of RB.15 Recently, we reported that gankyrin knockdown reduced STAT3 activities in a myeloid cell line.15 To investigate whether the gankyrin\u2010mediated STAT3 activation depends on degradation of SHP\u20101 protein, we examined the protein expression level of SHP\u20101 in the myeloid cell line. Gankyrin knockdown did not affect the protein level of SHP\u20101 (Fig.\u00a0S9a), suggesting that gankyrin activates STAT3 by inhibiting the\u00a0phosphatase activity of SHP\u20101, but not by accelerating the degradation of SHP\u20101. Gankyrin knockdown decreased the mRNA level of SHP\u20101 in THP\u20101 cells (Fig.\u00a0S9b). Given that gankyrin knockdown did not affect the protein level of SHP\u20101, gankyrin might be involved in degradation of SHP\u20101, but it is not the mechanism by which gankyrin activates STAT3. In myeloid cell lines, Mono Mac 6 cells and THP\u20101 cells, gankyrin knockdown decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 and the expression of downstream target genes Pim1 and Mcl\u20101 (Fig.\u00a0S9b,c).12 In our previous study, we showed that longstanding intestinal inflammation increases the expression of gankyrin in the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.12 We assessed the association between gankyrin and chronic hepatitis by collecting liver biopsy specimens from patients clinically suspected to have non\u2010alcoholic steatohepatitis. Patient characteristics are shown in Table\u00a0S1. Patients with chronic hepatitis exhibited an increase in the expression of gankyrin as compared with those without inflammation (Fig.\u00a04a). Thus, gankyrin expression was associated with the disease activity of chronic hepatitis. Immunohistochemical studies has shown that gankyrin expression was enhanced in inflammatory cells as well as hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a04b), indicative of the increased gankyrin expression in non\u2010parenchymal cells and hepatocytes during chronic inflammation. Sorafenib is the only anticancer drug with proven prognostic efficacy in HCC. Identification of surrogate biomarkers that predict the biological and clinical efficacy may help us predict the therapeutic response of patients.31 Cancer stem cells have been reported to play a pivotal role in drug resistance of various cancer types. Given the critical role of gankyrin in the regulation of STAT3 signaling and stem cell marker expression, we investigated the association between the therapeutic response to sorafenib and gankyrin expression using human HCC specimens collected prior to treatment. HCC specimens collected before sorafenib treatment were stained with anti\u2010gankyrin antibody (Fig.\u00a04c). Based on immunohistochemistry, patients were divided into high\u2010gankyrin expression and low\u2010gankyrin expression groups. In line with the data in DEN\u2010induced hepatocarcinogenesis model, increased gankyrin expression in non\u2010parenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal cells, is significantly associated with enhanced IL\u20106 expression (Fig.\u00a04d and Fig.\u00a0S10a). As regards VEGF, we previously reported that gankyrin expression is significantly associated with VEGF expression in human HCC.32 Our data using Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice indicates a significant relationship between gankyrin and VEGF in tumor cells (Fig.\u00a05). We examined the impact of gankyrin expression in non\u2010parenchymal cells on the therapeutic response of patients treated with sorafenib. A log\u2010rank test using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method showed that the low\u2010gankyrin expression group exhibited significant prolongation of PFS (P\u00a0=\u00a00.011, Fig.\u00a04e), but not overall survival (OS; Fig.\u00a0S11), as compared to the high\u2010expression group. By contrast, gankyrin expression in tumor cells affected neither PFS nor OS in patients treated with sorafenib (Fig.\u00a0S10b,c). We have assessed the relationship between gankyrin expression in non\u2010parenchymal cells or parenchymal cells and several clinical parameters, including differentiation and stage of HCC (Table\u00a0S2 and S3). No significant difference was observed in any parameters other than PFS between gankyrin low and high expression groups. Studies have shown that gankyrin is upregulated in many HCC cell lines, wherein it promoted the proliferation of cancer cells through the inhibition of apoptosis and cell cycle progression.15, 25, 26 However, the role of gankyrin in the development of HCC in\u00a0vivo was unclear. Here, we investigated the role of gankyrin in controlling the tumor microenvironment. In our recent study, we revealed that gankyrin upregulates IL\u201017 and TNF\u2010alpha expression in lamina propria cells of the colon and accelerates the development of colitis\u2010associated cancer.12 In the present study, we found that gankyrin activates STAT3 through SHP\u20101 inhibition and IL\u20106 upregulation in the tumor microenvironment, leading to enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, STAT3/IL\u20106 signaling may mediate the gankyrin\u2010induced cross\u2010talk between tumor cells and non\u2010parenchymal cells. Gankyrin has been suggested as a regulator for liver tumor\u2010initiating cells.12, 16, 33 STAT3 activation in inflammatory cells regulates the expansion of cancer stem cells through augmented inflammatory response in the liver.11, 28 Thus, it is generally accepted that cytokine\u2010mediated inflammatory signaling pathways are important for dedifferentiation and generation of tumor\u2010initiating cells.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 However, the precise mechanism involved in the activation of cancer\u2010initiating cells in response to pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines has been poorly understood. In this study, we provide the evidence that gankyrin expression in non\u2010parenchymal cells increases levels of cancer stem cell markers (Bmi1 and EpCAM), thereby promoting the expansion of cancer\u2010initiating cells in tumor microenvironment. We show that the molecular interaction between gankyrin and SHP\u20101 leads to the activation of STAT3 and secretion of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u20106, which may explain the mechanism of gankyrin\u2010induced inflammatory responses by non\u2010parenchymal cells. Thus, understanding of the function of gankyrin in non\u2010parenchymal cells has elucidated a part of the molecular mechanism involved in HCC development. In this study, we used two types of conditional gankyrin\u2010deficient mice: Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f and Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice. Gankyrin deletion was confirmed in cancer cells in Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice and non\u2010parenchymal as well as cancer cells in Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice. DEN\u2010induced HCC development was attenuated in Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice and to a greater extent in Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice as compared with that in control gankyrin f/f mice. These studies with two types of conditional gankyrin\u2010deficient mice strongly suggest the important role played by gankyrin\u2010expressing non\u2010parenchymal and cancer cells in HCC development. This was supported by our observation that gankyrin expression was enhanced both in non\u2010parenchymal cells and hepatocytes of the liver tissue from patients with chronic hepatitis. In addition, DEN treatment significantly reduced the expression of the proangiogenic factor VEGF in HCC tissues of both Alb\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f and Mx1\u2010Cre;gankyrin f/f mice. Thus, gankyrin may enhance tumor development through its effect in the tumor cell as well as the tumor microenvironment. The therapeutic options for advanced\u2010stage HCC are limited, as HCC displays a poor response to systemic treatments such as conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. So far, sorafenib is the only anticancer drug with proven prognostic efficacy in HCC. Identification of surrogate biomarkers that predict the biological and clinical efficacy may help to tailor treatment to every individual patient.31 Sorafenib targets the abnormal activation of ERK often observed in human HCC.34 However, the predictive value of ERK signaling, including VEGF, for the efficacy of sorafenib in HCC remains uncertain.35, 36 The activation of other signaling pathways such as JNK and STAT3 may bypass the sorafenib\u2010induced blockade of ERK signaling, resulting in sorafenib resistance.21, 37 Thus, JNK and STAT3 signaling pathways are potential predictive biomarkers. To date, no robust predictive biomarker has been developed. In this study, we found a strong correlation between elevated gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment and unfavorable PFS in patients treated with sorafenib. Evaluation of gankyrin expression in HCC may be useful to differentiate between responders and non\u2010responders before starting sorafenib treatment and may help to select patients who are likely to benefit from the treatment. STAT3 modulation by gankyrin will contribute to sorafenib resistance, and gankyrin may represent a candidate biomarker to predict the likelihood of response to sorafenib in future HCC patients. Targeting gankyrin might be a promising strategy for cancer prevention and treatment. Small molecular drugs that inhibit gankyrin have gained increasing interest as therapeutics for liver cancer.38 Given that gankyrin deletion has no effect on liver injury in several hepatitis models (data not shown), gankyrin inhibitors may work without severe adverse side effects. Further work should be performed to obtain more information about the clinical implication of gankyrin and for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Taken together, gankyrin, upregulated in chronic inflammation, induces STAT3 activation and IL\u20106 production by binding to SHP\u20101 in non\u2010parenchymal cells. Such pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine responses may upregulate the expression of stem cell markers in the tumor microenvironment and eventually promote the development of HCC (Fig.\u00a05). Thus, suppression and measurement of gankyrin expression is a promising approach for advanced treatment and personalized management of HCC patients.

AA peroxidation by cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2 generates the unstable intermediate prostaglandin PGH2, which then is metabolized by various enzymes to generate a spectrum of PGs, including PGE2, PGI2 (prostacyclin), PGF2\u03b1, PGD2, and thromboxane A2. Dehydratation of PGE2 yields the cyclopenthenone PG, prostaglandin A2 (PGA2). Whereas the biological activities of PGE2, PGF2\u03b1, and PGI2 have been investigated, the vascular effects of other prostaglandins, such as PGA2, are virtually unknown. PGE2 mediates its effects in target cells by binding to specific G protein\u2013coupled prostanoid receptors: EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4; PGI2 acts via the IP receptor, and PGF2 \u03b1 acts via the FP receptor. All of these receptors are expressed in the endothelium, and EP and IP receptors are expressed in lung tissues. A cell surface receptor mediating PGA2 effects has not been defined. Basal EC barrier control is mediated by cell junctions containing adherens junction (AJ) and tight junction (TJ) protein complexes linked to the peripheral actin cytoskeleton network. Increased assembly of AJ complexes containing vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3-catenins, and p120-catenin (Bazzoni and Dejana, 2004) and their interactions with cortical cytoskeleton is precisely regulated by small GTPases Rac, Cdc42, and Rap1. Similar to AJs, TJs are composed of integral membrane proteins: occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), and intracellular proteins, including ZO-1 and cingulin (Miyoshi and Takai, 2005). Although AJs and TJs are separate structural entities, under certain conditions, their components may interact with each other, leading to further enhancement of the cell\u2013cell barrier. These interactions are essential for enhancement of the pulmonary endothelial barrier caused by circulating bioactive molecules. Better understanding of pathophysiological effects and molecular pathways activated by specific PGs is essential to link basic findings with dysregulation of EC behavior in pathologically relevant conditions and ways of pharmacologically correcting endothelial function. For example, stable prostacyclin analogues beraprost and iloprost, which exhibit pronounced vasodilating and antiremodeling effects on vasculature, are widely used to treat pulmonary hypertension (Howard and Morrell, 2005). Effects of other PGs on vascular inflammation and endothelial barrier dysfunction associated with acute lung injury and other inflammatory conditions are far less explored. This study investigated effects of PGA2 on human lung vascular endothelial hyperpermeability and inflammation caused by barrier disruptive and inflammatory mediators. PGA2 effects were further tested in animal models of acute lung injury caused by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or mechanical ventilation at high tidal volume (HTV) combined with intravenous (i.v.) injection of thrombin receptor\u2013activating peptide (TRAP). We identify a receptor mediating barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 in pulmonary endothelium and describe the cellular mechanism of cytoskeletal remodeling induced by PGA2 and contributing to protection of lung endothelial barrier. Dose-dependent effects of PGA2 on EC barrier properties were monitored by changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) of cell monolayers grown on microelectrodes. PGA2 caused dose-\u00addependent TER increases in the concentration range of 0.05\u20131 \u00b5M (Figure 1A). A barrier-enhancing effect was observed by 2 min of PGA2 stimulation, reached maximal levels by 15\u201330 min of stimulation, and was sustained in the next 4\u20136 h after stimulation. Treatment of preconfluent EC monolayers with PGA2 caused rapid formation of cell\u2013cell contacts and establishment of the EC monolayer, leading to decreased paracellular permeability for macromolecules, as detected by decreased accumulation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\u2013labeled avidin on the coating substrate underneath the cells (Figure 1B). In agreement with barrier-enhancing effects on human pulmonary EC monolayers, we saw increased VE-cadherin\u2013 and ZO-1\u2013positive areas at the cell\u2013cell junctions of PGA2-treated cells, indicating enhanced AJs and TJs, respectively (Figure 1, C and D). The PGA2-induced increase in VE-cadherin\u2013positive areas at the cell\u2013cell junctions was further verified by the surface protein biotinylation assay described in Materials and Methods. After in situ biotinylation of cell surface proteins in control and PGA2-stimulated cells, the level of biotinylated VE-cadherin was assessed by Western blotting. VE-cadherin surface expression, as reflected by the levels of biotinylated VE-cadherin, increased in PGA2-treated EC monolayers (Figure 1E). These findings are consistent with PGA2-induced EC morphological changes and monolayer barrier function. Coimmunoprecipitation assays with VE-cadherin antibody showed that PGA2-induced enhancement of the EC barrier was also associated with increased association of VE-cadherin with other AJ proteins: p120-catenin, \u03b1-catenin, and TJ-associated protein ZO-1 (Figure 1F). The PGA2-mediated TER increase was accompanied by a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP levels within 2 min (Figure 2A). Direct measurements of small GTPase activation showed that barrier enhancement in response to PGA2 was associated with rapid activation of Rap1 and Rac1 GTPases (Figure 2B), whereas RhoA activity was not affected (unpublished data). As a reflection of elevated cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) enzymatic activity, PGA2 treatment increased phosphorylated levels of PKA substrates cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the actin-binding protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP; Figure 2C). Tyrosine phosphorylation of a regulator of cortical actin polymerization, cortactin, is promoted by activated Rac1. Consistent with activation of Rac1, PGA2 caused rapid phosphorylation of cortactin (Figure 2C). Of interest, coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that PGA2 also stimulated association of VE-cadherin, \u03b1-catenin, and ZO-1 with the PKA cytoskeletal target VASP (Figure 2D). These results demonstrate a convergence of PKA- and Rac-mediated signaling pathways on cytoskeletal and cell junction proteins involved in PGA2-induced EC barrier response. Elevation of cAMP by other prostaglandins\u2014PGI2 and PGE2\u2014is mediated by IP and EP receptors. Therefore we hypothesized that the observed effects of PGA2 on intracellular signaling are mediated by one or more prostaglandin receptors. We tested such receptors in the following experiments. We screened potential receptors mediating PGA2-induced EC barrier enhancement using specific agonists and inhibitors of prostanoid receptors. EC permeability assays of PGA2-stimulated EC monolayers using TER measurements showed that specific inhibitors of FP, TP, DP2, and IP prostanoid receptors did not affect PGA2-induced EC barrier enhancement response (Figure 3A). EC pretreatment with AH6809, an EP1-3 and DP receptor antagonist with nearly equal affinity for the cloned human EP1, EP2, EP3, and DP1 receptors, also did not affect the barrier-enhancing response to PGA2. In turn, pretreatment with EP4 receptor inhibitor L161982 or GW627368X abolished PGA2-induced EC barrier enhancement (Figure 3, A and B). In turn, stimulation of pulmonary EC with pharmacological EP4 receptor activator CAY10580 recapitulated EC barrier enhancement caused by PGA2 (Figure 3A, right). As an alternative to pharmacological inhibition, we performed molecular inhibition of EP4 receptor by small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2013induced EP4 knockdown. Treatment with EP4-specific siRNA suppressed the barrier-enhancing effect of PGA2 (Figure 3B). Activation of Gs-coupled EP4 receptor leads to Gs-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase and elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. Control experiments (Figure 3C) showed that the EC barrier enhancement response to elevation of intracellular cAMP caused by cell treatment with stable cAMP analogue Br-cAMP or adenylate cyclase activator forskolin was not affected by cell pretreatment with EP4 antagonist. EP4 antagonist did not affect EC barrier enhancement caused by prostacyclin, known to act via the IP receptor, but abolished EC barrier response to PGA2. In turn, IP antagonist was without effect on prostacyclin-induced cell response but inhibited EC barrier enhancement response to PGA2. Taken together, these results show a specific role of EP4 receptor in mediating the pulmonary EC barrier-enhancing response to PGA2. Involvement of EP4 in PGA2-induced cytoskeletal remodeling linked to EC barrier enhancement was evaluated using siRNA-induced EP4 knockdown and pharmacological EP4 receptor antagonist L161982. EP4 antagonist abolished PGA2-induced activation of Rac1 and Rap1 (Figure 4A). Analysis of downstream cytoskeletal targets of Rap1/Rac1 and cAMP/PKA signaling showed that inhibition of EP4 by L161982 (Figure 4B) or siRNA-induced EP4 knockdown (Figure 4C) suppressed PGA2-induced phosphorylation of Rac1-dependent regulator of actin polymerization, cortactin and cAMP/PKA substrates, actin-binding protein VASP, and transcription factor CREB. A role of EP4 in PGA2-activated EC cytoskeletal dynamics critical for EC barrier-enhancing response was further evaluated using live-cell microscopy. Pulmonary ECs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2013labeled cortactin were treated with nonspecific or EP4-specific siRNA, followed by stimulation with PGA2. PGA2 stimulated formation of lamellipodia (shown by arrows in Figure 4D, top), also associated with accumulation of GFP-cortactin at the cell periphery. These changes reflect PGA2-\u00adinduced activation of peripheral cytoskeletal remodeling. This cytoskeletal response was abolished in cells with EP4 knockdown (Figure 4D, bottom). The higher-magnification insets in Figure 4D show details of the peripheral cortactin arrangement. The bar graph depicts a quantitative image analysis of peripheral cortactin accumulation in stimulated control and EP4 knockdown cells. Next we studied effects of EP4 inhibition on PGA2-induced enhancement of AJs. PGA2 stimulated enlargement of VE-cadherin\u2013positive and ZO-1\u2013positive areas at the cell junctions in EC monolayers, which was abolished by siRNA-induced EP4 knockdown (Figure 5A). In biochemical studies, in situ biotinylation assay showed decreased levels of biotinylated VE-cadherin in PGA2-stimulated ECs pretreated with EP4 antagonist (Figure 5B). AJ enhancement is associated with increased interactions of AJ proteins. We visualized intracellular colocalization and protein interaction of VE-cadherin and p120-catenin using a proximal ligation assay (PLA). Increased accumulation of both proteins at the cell junction areas of PGA2-stimulated ECs and their interaction was suppressed by EC pretreatment with EP4 receptor inhibitor (Figure 5C). Coimmunoprecipitation assays with anti-VE-cadherin and anti-VASP antibodies showed that PGA2 increased association of ZO-1, \u03b1-catenin, VASP, and VE-cadherin, which was abolished by pretreatment with EP4 receptor inhibitor (Figure 5D). These findings suggest an EP4-dependent mechanism of PGA2-induced enhancement of endothelial AJs and activation of AJ\u2013TJ functional interactions. Epithelial barrier protects the lung from invasion of bacterial particles. In cooperation with pulmonary vascular endothelium, lung epithelial cells form a second barrier to control fluid balance and prevent alveolar flooding and pulmonary edema. We tested effects of PGA2 on barrier properties of small airway epithelial cell (SAES) monolayers using TER measurements. Similar to the response developed by pulmonary ECs, PGA2 caused rapid elevation of TER in SAES in the concentration range of 0.2\u20133.0 \u00b5M (Figure 6A). The barrier-enhancing effect developed within 2\u20135 min of PGA2 stimulation, reached maximal levels by 15\u201330 min, and then gradually declined, reaching basal levels by 5 h poststimulation. SAEC stimulation with PGA2 (0.5 \u00b5M) caused time-dependent phosphorylation of regulators of peripheral actin remodeling, VASP and cortactin (Figure 6B, left). Inhibition of EP4 by L161982 suppressed the PGA2-induced phosphorylation of cortactin and VASP (Figure 6B, right). The barrier-enhancing effect of PGA2 and increased phosphorylation of cortactin and VASP were associated with increased F-actin immunoreactivity at the cell periphery (Figure 6C) and enhancement of AJs indicated by increased peripheral accumulation of p120-catenin, an AJ adaptor and signaling protein (Figure 6D). These cytoskeletal effects caused by PGA2 were inhibited by cell pretreatment with EP4 inhibitor L161982. The higher-magnification insets depict details of cortical actin remodeling. To study the physiological role of PGA2 in modulation of agonist-induced EC responses, we evaluated the effect of PGA2 on the endothelial barrier using a model of thrombin-induced EC permeability. Pretreatment of pulmonary EC monolayers with PGA2 suppressed the acute TER decline in response to thrombin (Figure 7A). In addition to TER measurements, we examined PGA2 protective effects against thrombin-induced EC hyperpermeability using an imaging assay detecting EC monolayer permeability for macromolecules. Consistent with TER results, PGA2 attenuated thrombin-induced EC monolayer permeability for FITC-labeled tracer (Figure 7B, left). The barrier-protective effect of PGA2 was abolished by EC pretreatment with EP4 inhibitor (Figure 7B, right). We made similar observations in experiments with EP4 knockdown. We evaluated EC monolayer integrity by immunofluorescence staining for F-actin. Whereas PGA2 suppressed stress fibers and gap formation induced by thrombin, EP4 knockdown abolished PGA2-protective effects (Figure 7C). Because thrombin-induced disruption of ECl junctions and EC barrier dysfunction are associated with activation of the Rho pathway (Fukata and Kaibuchi, 2001), we next examined effects of PGA2 on the thrombin-induced Rho signaling. Pretreatment with PGA2 markedly suppressed thrombin-induced Rho activation (Figure 7D) and Rho-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain phosphatase (MYPT) and myosin light chain (MLC; Figure 7E). In turn, EP4 inhibitor abolished PGA2-mediated inhibition of Rho activation and phosphorylation of MYPT and MLC caused by thrombin (Figure 7, D and E). Bacterial compounds such as LPS cause pronounced activation of inflammatory signaling in pulmonary ECs and disruption of EC monolayers. We tested the effects of PGA2 on EC barrier dysfunction caused by LPS. LPS decreased TER, reflecting endothelial barrier dysfunction, and PGA2 pretreatment abolished this effect (Figure 8A). Of importance, the protective effect of PGA2 was inhibited by EP4 antagonist. Activation of the NF\u03baB signaling cascade manifested by phosphorylation of the NF\u03baB subunit and degradation of the inhibitory I\u03baB\u03b1 subunit is a hallmark of LPS-induced inflammation. LPS triggered the canonical inflammatory pathway and induced phosphorylation of NF\u03baB and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. LPS-induced NF\u03baB phosphorylation was suppressed by PGA2, and this anti-inflammatory effect of PGA2 was abolished by cell pretreatment with EP4 inhibitor (Figure 8B). Because our studies showed activation of Rap1/Rac1 and PKA signaling by PGA2 (Figure 2), we tested involvement of these pathways in the PGA2-induced inhibition of NF\u03baB phosphorylation. Inhibition of either PKA or Rac1 activity attenuated PGA2-induced NF\u03baB phosphorylation (Figure 8C), suggesting critical involvement of both PKA and Rac1 signaling in PGA2 anti-inflammatory effects. Activation of NF\u03baB-dependent inflammatory signaling stimulates expression of ICAM1 and VCAM1, the EC adhesion molecules involved in neutrophil adhesion (Smith, 1993). Pretreatment with PGA2 inhibited LPS-induced expression of ICAM1 and VCAM1, and this protective effect was inhibited by EP4 antagonist (Figure 8D). Similarly, siRNA-induced knockdown of EP4 abolished the protective effect of PGA2 against LPS-stimulated ICAM1 expression (Figure 8E). In accordance with the anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 on LPS-challenged EC, PGA2 pretreatment also attenuated LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by pulmonary ECs (Figure 8, F and G, left). Of note, PGA2 was also protective against endothelial barrier disruption induced by EC exposure to individual cytokines (Figure 8, F and G, right). Because treatment of ongoing inflammation with protective compounds represents a more clinically relevant scenario of pharmacological intervention, we next tested the effects of PGA2 against LPS-induced EC barrier dysfunction as a posttreatment option. PGA2 added after 30 min, 2 h, or 5 h of LPS stimulation also had a potent barrier-protective effect, reflected by pronounced and sustained elevation of TER (Figure 9A). This effect was abolished in ECs with siRNA-induced EP4 knockdown (Figure 9B). Protective effects of PGA2 posttreatment on LPS-induced disruption of EC monolayers were further monitored by analysis of actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Pulmonary ECs were treated with LPS with or without PGA2 added 5 h after LPS challenge. Immunofluorescence staining of actin cytoskeleton was performed 1 h after PGA2 addition. LPS induced formation of paracellular gaps. These changes were reduced by EC posttreatment with PGA2 (Figure 9C, top). Restoration of EC monolayer integrity, gap closure, and disappearance of actin stress fibers caused by PGA2 posttreatment were abolished in EC with EP4 knockdown (Figure 9C, bottom). Protective effects of PGA2 were next tested in the murine models of acute lung injury (ALI). In the model of nonbacterial lung injury, mice were exposed to mechanical ventilation as described in Materials and Methods and i.v. injection of TRAP. PGA2 treatment was performed by i.v. administration of PGA2 at the beginning and 2 h later during mechanical ventilation. Injection of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as a control. After 4 h of mechanical ventilation mice, developed a prominent acute inflammatory response characterized by increased cell counts and protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples (Figure 10A). These effects were significantly attenuated by injection of PGA2. There was no significant difference in BAL cell count and BAL protein between PGA2-treated animals and a control group without PGA2 treatment in the absence of HTV (unpublished data). Effects of PGA2 on the lung vascular leak induced by TRAP/HTV were evaluated by measurement of Evans blue extravasation into the lung tissue, as described in Materials and Methods. Increased Evans blue accumulation in the lung parenchyma caused by TRAP/HTV was attenuated by PGA2 (Figure 10B). Barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 were further tested in the animal model of ALI caused by intratracheal (i.t.) injection of bacterial wall LPS. Two i.v. injections of PGA2, concurrently and 5 h after LPS instillation, significantly decreased BAL protein content and total cell count in the LPS-treated mice (Figure 11A). Effects of PGA2 on the lung vascular leak induced by LPS were further evaluated by measurement of Evans blue extravasation into the lungs. PGA2 treatment suppressed LPS-induced Evans blue accumulation in the lung parenchyma (Figure 11B). Next, to evaluate the rate of ALI recovery, we performed image analysis of PGA2 effects on lung recovery after LPS-induced injury. Lung vascular leak in mice treated with LPS and PGA2 was monitored in the same animals prospectively 1, 2, 3, and 6 d after treatment. Lung accumulation of the Angiosense 680 EX tracer was performed in anesthetized animals using noninvasive fluorescence optical imaging as described in Materials and Methods. Accumulation of the fluorescent tracer reflecting lung inflammation and vascular barrier compromise increased 24 and 48 h after LPS injection and gradually declined by day 6 (Figure 11C). Of importance, LPS-induced lung dysfunction was markedly reduced by PGA2 treatment (two injections, concurrently and 5 h after LPS challenge), and recovery of lung function occurred earlier than in LPS-challenged mice without PGA2 treatment. To test the role of endothelial EP4 in the mediation of the barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 in vivo, we used endothelial EP4-knockout mice generated by cross-breeding of the inducible endothelial VECad-Cre-ERT2 line and EP4lox/lox mice. Generation and characterization of EC-specific EP4-knockout mice (EC-EP4\u2013/\u2013) were described previously. First, we evaluated the magnitude of LPS-induced lung injury in EC-EP4\u2013/\u2013 mice and matching controls. Parameters of lung injury were analyzed 24 h after LPS administration. EC-EP4\u2013/\u2013 mice developed higher levels of lung injury in response to LPS, which was reflected by increased total and neutrophil cell counts and protein content in BAL samples (Figure 12A). Of greater importance, PGA2 treatment significantly attenuated parameters of LPS-induced lung injury and vascular leak in wild-type controls, as reflected by reduced cell count and protein content in BAL samples (Figure 12A) and decreased Evans blue accumulation in lung parenchyma (Figure 12B). In contrast, this lung-protective effect of PGA2 treatment was abolished in EC-EP4\u2013/\u2013 mice. Western blot analysis of lung tissue samples also revealed increased ICAM1 expression in EC-EP4\u2013/\u2013 mice and matching wild-type controls after 24 h of LPS challenge (Figure 12C). LPS-induced activation of ICAM1 expression was strongly suppressed by PGA2 treatment of wild-type mice but remained at levels similar to those for animals treated with LPS alone in EC-EP4\u2013/\u2013 mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate pronounced anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective effects of PGA2 in the two animal models of ALI and emphasize a key role for endothelial EP4 receptor in PGA2-induced protection against LPS-induced lung vascular inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and lung injury. The role of PGA2 in regulation of endothelial permeability and lung inflammatory response to bacterial pathogens remains virtually unknown. This is the first report demonstrating PGA2 vascular protective and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. PGA2 caused sustained barrier enhancement of pulmonary EC monolayers, dramatically attenuated EC permeability caused by thrombin, and restored the barrier function of EC monolayers challenged with LPS. Cell membrane receptor(s) mediating PGA2 effects are not well defined. An earlier study suggested PGA2 interaction with two groups of cell membrane receptors\u2014one stimulating phospholipase C and calcium entry and the other stimulating production of cAMP. Both receptor types were also activated by other PGs: PGE2, PGI2, PGF2\u03b1, and others. We screened potential receptors engaged in PGA2 signaling and identified EP4 as a receptor mediating vascular endothelial barrier\u2013protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 in vitro and in vivo. This novel finding was further verified using a genetic model of EC-specific EP4-knockout mice. EP4 is a Gs-coupled receptor stimulating cAMP production primarily activated by PGE2 but may also ligate PGF2\u03b1 and PGD2 at much higher concentrations. Of interest, accumulating evidence suggests considerable functional selectivity among the structurally related prostaglandins. PGE2 was the most selective in activating G\u03b1s, whereas PGF2\u03b1 and PGE1 were the most biased for activating G\u03b1i1 and \u03b2-arrestin, respectively. Physiological effects of PGE2, PGF2\u03b1, and PGD2 are quite different because these prostaglandins also interact with their other cognate receptors (EP1-3, FP and DP, respectively) and stimulate additional functional responses mediated by Gs-, Gq-, and Gi-coupled signaling pathways. Furthermore, depending on receptor subtype, cell population, and the context of activation, PGE2 displays pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas PGI2 and its stable analogues have mostly anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective properties. These unique patterns of receptor activation by each class of prostaglandin likely define the specific type of tissue or organ response to these mediators. Ligation of EP4 receptor stimulates G\u03b1-protein\u2013mediated transient increase in intracellular cAMP (Sugimoto and Narumiya, 2007). In turn, cAMP activates PKA, which then phosphorylates downstream effector proteins\u2014in particular, CREB. In addition, elevation of intracellular cAMP activates the PKA-induced independent pathway mediated by cAMP-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor EPAC (Bos, 2006). Activation of Rap1, Rac1, and PKA pathways observed in PGA2-stimulated EC is consistent with engagement of EP4 receptor and stimulation of downstream cell adhesion and cytoskeletal targets as a potential mechanism involved in the enhancement of the EC barrier. Activation of Rac1 by PGA2 in this study was accompanied by peripheral translocation of cortactin linked to EC barrier enhancement. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of another actin-binding protein, VASP, which was observed in PGA2-stimulated ECs, leads to structural relaxation of the actin cytoskeleton, its linkage with tight junctions via the VASP/ZO-1 complex. PGA2 in this study increased association of VASP with the AJ protein \u03b1-catenin and other AJ\u2013TJ complex members\u2014p120-catenin, VE-cadherin, and ZO-1. This functional association reflects PGA2-induced enhancement of the EC barrier via increased interactions between AJ and TJ complexes assisted by VASP. In turn, pharmacological or molecular inhibition of EP4 receptor attenuated PGA2-induced activation of peripheral actin cytoskeleton, AJ and TJ assembly, and formation of the VASP/AJ/TJ functional complex. Whereas direct interaction of VASP and \u03b1-catenin at the AJs has been reported (Kobielak and Fuchs, 2004), the presence of VASP in ZO-1, p120-catenin, and VE-cadherin complexes may reflect functional AJ\u2013TJ interactions contributing to PGA2/EP4-induced EC barrier enhancement. Of interest, PGA2 also induced the barrier-enhancing response and remodeling of peripheral actin cytoskeleton and cell junctions in pulmonary epithelial cells; however these effects were less sustained. These results may indicate cell type\u2013specific differences in PGA2 effects. In addition to pulmonary artery ECs, PGA2 also exhibited barrier protective effects in LPS-challenged lung microvascular EC monolayers (unpublished data). Such complementary PGA2 effects on both lung endothelial and epithelial cells may further promote lung barrier function in the ALI settings in vivo. However, in this study, we focused on the endothelial side, and the i.v. route of PGA2 administration used in this study more specifically targeted pulmonary endothelium. PGA2 attenuated EC barrier dysfunction caused by thrombin. This effect is consistent with attenuation of thrombin-induced RhoA signaling, a major pathway of EC barrier dysfunction. Our result show that PGA2 induced activation of Rap1/Rac1/PKA signaling, which was previously shown to down-regulate barrier-disruptive RhoA signaling via mechanisms of negative cross-talk. Besides the canonical activation by the TLR4-MyD88-IRAK-TRAF6 cascade, LPS-induced stimulation of RhoA pathway also contributes to the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inflammatory response. Activated p38 MAPK phosphorylates the NF\u03baB RelA/p65 subunit, which further stimulates NF\u03baB transcription activity. Inhibition of Rho activities by Clostridium difficile toxin B, inhibition of RhoA nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1, or p38 MAPK knockdown suppressed the LPS-induced NF\u03baB phosphorylation and transactivation and increased IL-8 synthesis. Our data show that PGA2-induced elevation of cAMP was associated with activation of Rap1 and Rac1 GTPases (Figure 2). PGA2 pretreatment attenuated agonist-induced activation of RhoA (Figure 7) and inflammatory signaling, including LPS-induced NF\u03baB phosphorylation (Figure 8). In turn, inhibition of Rac1 attenuated anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 and restored the increased NF\u03baB phosphorylation caused by LPS. These findings are in line with work showing that inhibition of Rho signaling by the activated Rap1/Rac1 cascade down-regulated the lung inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the model of ventilator-induced lung injury. Our data also demonstrate an additional PKA-dependent mechanism of the cAMP anti-inflammatory effect. Inhibition of PKA blocked effects of PGA2 on LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF\u03baB (Figure 8C). Increased intracellular cAMP in endothelial cells was previously found to prevent NF\u03baB-dependent ICAM-1 expression induced by inflammatory agonists. Elevation of intracellular cAMP in pulmonary ECs blocked p38 MAPK activation in a PKA-dependent manner, which prevented NF\u03baB RelA/p65 subunit phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of nuclear DNA-bound NF\u03baB. Previous work also shows the anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 on other cells involved in the inflammatory response. PGA2 inhibited the production of NO, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1 from astrocytes stimulated with LPS. Cyclopentenone isoprostanes also inhibited the inflammatory response in macrophages. PGA2 potently inhibited LPS-stimulated I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and subsequent NF\u03baB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity in macrophages. PGA2-induced inhibition of the NF\u03baB pathway in macrophages was at least partially mediated by a redox-dependent mechanism. However, evaluation of PGA2-EP4 mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects in other cells was beyond the scope of this study. Of importance, PGA2 had potent protective effects in two animal models of ALI\u2014one due to i.t. instillation of LPS and the other to mechanical ventilation at high tidal volume and injection of TRAP peptide. In both models, PGA2 treatment improved lung vascular endothelial barrier function, as indicated by decreased cell and protein content in BAL samples and decreased extravasation of Evans blue tracer into the lung parenchyma. These effects were also observed in the setting of more clinically relevant PGA2 posttreatment. Experiments with noninvasive optical imaging of LPS-challenged mice with or without PGA2 treatment made it possible to monitor the progression and recovery of ALI. The role of endothelial EP4 receptor in the barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 observed in animal models was confirmed in a genetic model of EC-specific ablation of EP4 receptor. In these experiments, conditional deletion of EP4 in vascular endothelium abolished the anti-inflammatory and barrier-protective effects of PGA2 treatment. In summary, this study described PGA2-induced barrier-enhancing and barrier-protective effects in cell and animal models of endothelial vascular leak, inflammation, and lung barrier dysfunction. We identified EP4 as a receptor mediating barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of PGA2 in pulmonary endothelium and described PGA2-induced cell junction and cytoskeletal remodeling contributions to protection of the lung endothelial barrier. Our results suggest that PGA2 may also enhance resolution of lung injury and accelerate EC barrier restoration. Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), and cell culture basal medium with growth supplements were obtained from Lonza (Allendale, NJ). Cells were cultured according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and used at passages 5\u20137. All reagents for immunofluorescence studies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). PGA2, EP4 agonist CAY10580, and prostaglandin receptor inhibitors were obtained from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). The following receptor inhibitors were used: TP inhibitor SQ29548, DP inhibitor BWA868C, IP inhibitor CAY10449, EP4 inhibitors L161982 and GW627368X, FP inhibitor AL8810, and EP1-3 inhibitor AH6809. Rac1 inhibitor NAS23766 was obtained from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA); PKA peptide inhibitor PKI was from Promega (Madison, WI). VE-cadherin antibody was obtained from Cayman; EP4, Rap1, Rac1, RhoA, ICAM1, and VCAM1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); \u03b2-actin and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); cortactin, phospho-cortactin, VASP, phospho-VASP, phospho-CREB, phospho-MYPT, diphospho-MLC, phospho-NF\u03baB, and I\u03baB\u03b1 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); \u03b1-catenin, p120-catenin, and ZO-1 antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Unless specified, other biochemical reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates. At the day of assay, the cells were stimulated with the PGA2 for desired periods of time. Cyclic AMP accumulation was quantified by cAMP Biotrak Enzyme Immunoassay (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA), and optical density was determined using a plate reader at 630 nm. Each sample/standard was analyzed in duplicate, and resulting OD values were averaged. To reduce the content of endogenous EP4, cells were treated with gene-specific siRNA duplexes. A predesigned standard-purity, EP4-specific set of four siRNAs (Homo sapiens) was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO), and transfection of ECs with 100 nM gene-specific siRNA or nonspecific, nontargeting siRNA (Dharmacon), which was used as a control treatment, was performed as previously described. After 72 h of transfection, cells were used for experiments or harvested for Western blot verification of specific protein depletion. The siRNA transfection efficiency according to our protocol was >90%. EC monolayer barrier properties were evaluated by two complementary methods. Analysis of agonist-induced changes in TER was performed using the ECIS Z electrical cell\u2013substrate impedance-sensing system (Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY). This method allows measurements of TER in real time, which reflects agonist-induced EC permeability changes. Analysis of EC monolayer permeability for macromolecules was performed using Vascular Permeability Imaging Assay (17-10398; Millipore). The method is based on high-affinity binding of avidin-conjugated, FITC-labeled tracer added in cell culture medium during agonist stimulation to the biotinylated ligand in the substrate coating underlying EC monolayers. In permeability visualization experiments, cells grown on biotinylated gelatin\u2013coated glass coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS (10 min, room temperature), and imaging of areas with substrate-bound FITC-avidin was performed as described elsewhere. Endothelial cells plated on glass coverslips were treated with PGA2 with or without pretreatment with inhibitors, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS-Tween (PBST) for 30 min at room temperature, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST for 30 min. Incubations with antibodies of interest were performed in blocking solution (2% BSA in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by staining with Alexa 488x or Alexa 544\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies. Actin filaments were stained with Texas red\u2013conjugated phalloidin. After immunostaining, slides were analyzed using a Nikon video imaging system (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) as described elsewhere. For live imaging of GFP-cortactin, cells were plated on MatTek dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and transfected with GFP-cortactin plasmid (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). Time-lapse images were acquired with a 100\u00d7/numerical aperture (NA) 1.45 oil objective in a 3I Marianas Yokogawa-type spinning-disk confocal system equipped with a CO2 chamber and a heated stage. Images were acquired with a 60\u00d7/NA 1.45 oil objective with 2-s intervals for 0.5\u201310 min. Quantitative analysis of paracellular gap formation, peripheral p120-catenin, ZO-1, and cortactin accumulation was performed as previously described. For each experimental condition, at least 10 microscopic fields in each independent experiment were analyzed. Cells were fixed with methanol/acetone and incubated for 30 min with the mouse anti\u2013p120-catenin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Labs) and rabbit polyclonal anti-VE-cadherin antibody (Cayman). Ligation and amplification were performed as described in the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Duolink In Situ PLA; Sigma-Aldrich), using the following reagents: PLA probe anti-rabbit plus; PLA probe anti-mouse minus, and detection reagent Red. After PLA, the samples were incubated for an additional 30 min with FITC-labeled donkey antibody against mouse immunoglobulin G. Cells were treated with 0.5 \u00b5M PGA2, washed with PBS at 37\u00b0C, and incubated for 10 min with 5 mM Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) at room temperature. Subsequently cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS with 100 mM glycine and lysed for 30 min on ice in 1% Triton-100 PBS, and cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Equal amounts of cell lysate were incubated with 60 \u00b5l of streptavidin-agarose (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and boiled in SDS sample buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 \u00d7 g, and supernatants were subjected to Western blot analysis with VE-cadherin antibody. Protein extracts from cell or mouse lung tissue samples were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were incubated with antibodies of interest. Equal protein loading was verified by probing of membranes with antibody to \u03b2-tubulin or a specific protein of interest. Coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed as described elsewhere. Briefly, after agonist stimulation, plated EC cultures were washed in cold PBS and lysed on ice with cold TBS-NP40 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Clarified lysates were then incubated with antibodies to VASP (Cell Signaling) or VE-cadherin (Cayman) overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed three or four times with TBS-NP40 lysis buffer, and the complexes were analyzed by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. The relative intensities of the protein bands were quantified by scanning densitometry. Rac, Rap, and Rho activation was evaluated in pull-down assays using agarose beads with immobilized PAK1-PBD, Ral GDS-RBD, and rhotekin, respectively, as described elsewhere. The levels of activated small GTPases bound to beads and evaluated by Western blot analysis were normalized to total Rac, Rap, and Rho levels. Concentrations of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 in control and treated cell-conditioned medium samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All experimental protocols involving the use of animals were approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for the humane treatment of experimental animals. Endothelial-specific, EP4-knockout mice were previously described. C57Bl6 mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1.5 mg/kg) and subjected to mechanical ventilation as previously described. Briefly, tracheotomy was performed, and the trachea was cannulated with a 20-gauge, 1-inch catheter tied into place to prevent air leak. The animals were then placed on a mechanical ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, Boston, MA). Mice received PGA2 (10 \u00b5g/kg, i.v. administration) before a single dose of TRAP6 (1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 mol/kg, i.t. instillation), followed by 4 h of mechanical ventilation with high tidal volume (30 ml/kg, 75 breaths/min, and 0 positive end expiratory pressure, HTV). Control animals were anesthetized and allowed to breathe spontaneously. In the model of LPS-induced lung injury, bacterial LPS (0.63 mg/kg body weight; Escherichia coli O55:B5) or sterile water was injected i.t. in a small volume (20\u201330 \u00b5l) using a 20-gauge catheter (Penn-Century, Philadelphia, PA). PGA2 (10 \u03bcg/kg) or sterile saline solution was administrated two times, concurrently and after 5 h of LPS instillation, by i.v. injection in the external jugular vein. Animals were killed by exsanguination under anesthesia 24 h after LPS challenge and used for evaluation of lung injury parameters. After the experiment, collection of BAL fluid was performed using 1 ml of sterile Hanks balanced saline buffer. The BAL protein concentration was determined by a BCATM Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). BAL inflammatory cell counting was performed using a standard hemacytometer technique. Evans blue accumulation in the lung tissue was evaluated as described previously. At the end of the experiment, thoracotomy was performed, and the lungs were perfused in situ via the left atrium with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA to flush the blood off the lungs. Left and right lungs were excised and imaged by a Kodak digital camera. Mice treated with LPS or cotreated with PGA2 and LPS were injected i.v. via tail vein with 100 \u00b5l of 2 nmol Angiosense 680 EX (a vascular fluorescent blood pool imaging agent purchased from PerkinElmer, Boston, MA; NEV10054EX). After 24 h, fluorescence optical imaging was performed in the Integrated Small Animal Imaging Research Resource at the University of Chicago using the Xenogen IVIS 200 Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, CA). Mice were exposed to isoflurane anesthesia with O2 through the gas anesthesia manifold and placed on the imaging stage. Acquisition and image analysis were performed with Living Image 4.3.1 Software. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 SD. Experimental samples were compared with controls by unpaired Student\u2019s t test. For multiple-group comparisons, a one-way analysis of variance and post hoc multiple comparison tests were used. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."}, "27798239": {"pmid": "27798239", "pmcid": "PMC5156544", "title": "Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase II\u03b2 negatively regulates invadopodia formation and suppresses an invasive cellular phenotype", "abstract": "\nThe PI4KIIs play important roles in membrane trafficking through the production of PI(4)P. This study reveals a novel function of PI4KII\u03b2 in regulating invadopodia formation and illustrates the importance of maintaining specific pools of trans-Golgi network\u2013endosomal PI(4)P.\n", "fulltext": "The two human type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KII) enzymes display 68% sequence identity across their conserved catalytic domains and exist in multiple subcellular membrane compartments (Balla and Balla, 2006; Minogue and Waugh, 2012). Since the molecular characterization of the PI4KIIs, a general model of PI4KII function in post\u2013trans-Golgi network (TGN) traffic has gradually emerged in which the kinases generate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P), which is required for the recruitment of clathrin adaptors needed in TGN-to-endosomal traffic. PI4KIIs have been most extensively described in endosomes (Balla et\u00a0al., 2002), the TGN (Wang et\u00a0al., 2003), and at the plasma membrane (Minogue et\u00a0al., 2006), as has PI(4)P (Hammond et\u00a0al., 2014). The PI4KII\u03b1 isoform generates PI(4)P, which interacts with AP-1 (Wang et\u00a0al., 2003), GGAs (Wang et\u00a0al., 2007), and AP-3 (Salazar et\u00a0al., 2005; Craige et\u00a0al., 2008; Mossinger et\u00a0al., 2012) and therefore has roles in TGN-to-endosome and TGN-to\u2013late endosomal trafficking known to be important in transport to the lysosome. More recently, a mechanism has been described involving the redirection of PI from phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) into PI(4)P synthesis, which is required for exocytic traffic from endosomes. This pathway requires PI4KII\u03b1 and is significant because it represents an important step in the recycling of plasma membrane cargoes such as \u03b21-integrin and the transferrin receptor (Ketel et\u00a0al., 2016). PI4KII\u03b1 has also been implicated in human cancer (Li et\u00a0al., 2010, 2014). PI4KII\u03b2 functions in TGN-to-endosomal traffic by directly interacting with AP-1, playing a role in developmental signaling by controlling the endosomal traffic of Frizzled, a receptor for Wnt (Wieffer et\u00a0al., 2013). The PI4KII isoforms therefore produce lipids needed for different steps in post-TGN trafficking.Protease-dependent matrix remodeling performs key physiological functions during embryo development and in the pathogenesis of metastatic disease. In metastatic cells, proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) is mediated by extracellular proteases such as the membrane type I metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), whose increased expression is associated with a poor prognosis in a wide variety of human tumors (Egeblad and Werb, 2002). ECM invasion by tumor-derived cells is mediated in part by specialized actin- and phosphotyrosine-rich protrusions termed invadopodia, which are capable of degrading extracellular matrix through the directed membrane traffic of MMPs (Poincloux et\u00a0al., 2009). The overexpression of components of invadopodia such as cortactin in breast and squamous carcinomas and ovarian, bladder, and lung cancers is associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poorer patient prognosis (Paz et\u00a0al., 2014). MT1-MMP is a key component of mature invadopodia and has been implicated in breaching of basement membranes and invasion through interstitial collagen (Sabeh et\u00a0al., 2004; Hotary et\u00a0al., 2006). Trafficking to the plasma membrane from endosomal compartments is a recognized pathway for the delivery of MT1-MMP to invadopodia (Steffen et\u00a0al., 2008; Yu et\u00a0al., 2012). However, the molecular machinery controlling the complex trafficking of this key protease is not fully understood.The PI4KII enzymes have been associated with both the development of breast cancer (Li et\u00a0al., 2014) and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; Mazzocca et\u00a0al., 2008), but links between the PI4KIIs and cellular processes such as actin reorganization during oncogenesis are unclear. We therefore investigated the role of PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 in actin remodeling and found that depletion of the enzymes had starkly different effects on the actin cytoskeleton. We also found that PI4KII\u03b2 depletion specifically induced the formation of invadopodia and was sufficient to convert HeLa and MCF-7 cells into an invasive phenotype. Loss of PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 affected different PI(4)P TGN pools and post-TGN traffic. The steady-state distribution of MT1-MMP was also shifted from an endosomal to an exocytic trafficking route. Finally, database analyses indicated that PI4KII\u03b2 was lost in human cancers, indicating that PI4KII\u03b2 may be a clinically significant tumor suppressor.We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to induce loss of PI4KII function. Gene silencing was confirmed by immunoblotting 72 h after transfection of HeLa cells with isoform-specific siRNA SMARTpools. We repeatedly achieved at least 85% reduction in levels of PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 compared with nontargeted controls (Figure 1, A and B, and Supplemental Figure S1, A and B). When we specifically depleted PI4KII isoforms in this way, we noted that monolayers of cells treated with PI4KII\u03b2 siRNA were more dispersed than with PI4KII\u03b1 and controls (unpublished results), as described previously (Mazzocca et\u00a0al., 2008). To investigate this further, we stained the actin cytoskeleton with fluorescently labeled phalloidin and found that, in comparison to controls, loss of PI4KII\u03b1 led to increased actin stress fiber formation at leading edges (Figure 1C). Cells also showed some clear focal colocalization with phosphotyrosine (Figure 1C). Loss of PI4KII\u03b2, on the other hand, resulted in complete loss of actin stress fibers and increased the intensity of cortical actin staining (Figure 1C), as well as of the formation of scattered, actin-rich punctae staining positive for phosphotyrosine (Figure 1C), which were absent in PI4KII\u03b1 and control siRNAs. Actin remodeling was confirmed by analyzing the ratio of cortical actin:stress fiber signals (Figure 1D), and normal actin phenotypes were restored by reexpression of siRNA-resistant PI4KII\u03b2 (Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure S1, C\u2013F). The same rescue experiment with overexpressed GFP-PI4KII\u03b1 led to increased levels of cortical actin (Figure 1E), a likely consequence of increasing PI(4)P levels (Henmi et\u00a0al., 2016), which would be expected to alter the actin cytoskeleton. These data indicate that loss of PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 has markedly different effects on the actin cytoskeleton.We sought to confirm the identity of the scattered actin-rich punctae in Figure 1C formed as a result of loss of PI4KII\u03b2. Initially, we costained F-actin along with the early endosomal marker EEA1; however, these showed minimal colocalization (Supplemental Figure S2A), indicating that these punctae were distinct from actin comets localized to endosomal membranes (Taunton et\u00a0al., 2000). Furthermore, these structures typically had average diameters of \u22640.25 \u03bcm, mostly clustered in regions under the nucleus, and were thus suggestive of invadopodia (Garcia et\u00a0al., 2014). To confirm the identity of these punctae, we immunostained cells for actin and cortactin, the coincidence of which is diagnostic of invadopodia and related structures (Garcia et\u00a0al., 2014).We found that loss of PI4KII\u03b2, but not of PI4KII\u03b1, induced the formation of punctae staining positive for both markers in HeLa cells (Figure 2A). When we acquired confocal z-series data from PI4KII\u03b2-depleted cells, we observed the colocalization of actin and cortactin at the ventral surface of gelatin-coated coverslips (Figure 2B), thereby confirming that these structures were indeed invadopodia. As further confirmation, we performed a positive control by treating cells with the phorbol ester phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; Tatin et\u00a0al., 2006) and found that the actin- and cortactin-rich structures were indistinguishable from those obtained by depletion of PI4KII\u03b2 (Figure 2B). Key constituents of invadopodia are the matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP (Poincloux et\u00a0al., 2009) and \u03b21-integrin (Destaing et\u00a0al., 2010). To determine whether the ventral structures contained known components of mature invadopodia, we stained siRNA-treated cells plated on coverslips coated with a three-dimensional (3D) layer of collagen for MT1-MMP and \u03b21-integrin or cortactin. Confocal microscopy demonstrated the colocalization of these markers with MT1-MMP (Figure 2, C and D), particularly on the ventral surface of PI4KII\u03b2-depleted cells (Figure 2, E and F). Furthermore, these structures were seen to penetrate the 3D ECM when we performed Z-series confocal microscopy (Figure 2, E and F).MT1-MMP requires posttranslational processing to become active (Williams and Coppolino, 2011). We therefore determined whether the structures formed upon the loss of PI4KII\u03b2 expression were capable of ECM degradation. We plated target and control siRNA-transfected HeLa cells on an ECM composed of cross-linked fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\u2013conjugated gelatin. In comparison with PI4KII\u03b1 and control siRNA\u2013transfected cells, loss of PI4KII\u03b2 resulted in an approximately fourfold increase in fluorescent matrix degradation in comparison with PI4KII\u03b1 (Figure 3, A and B). Areas of degradation also corresponded to clusters of actin-rich punctae (Figure 3A), demonstrating that they were the source of the gelatinolytic activity.We also performed Transwell invasion assays to measure the ability of PI4KII-depleted cells to invade a 3D collagen matrix in response to chemoattractant (serum). Invasion in the absence of serum was relatively low but significantly higher in PI4KII\u03b2 siRNA cells. The introduction of serum to the lower chamber increased the number of migrating cells, with PI4KII\u03b2 cells invading at approximately three times control values and two times that recorded for PI4KII\u03b1-depleted cells (Figure 3, C and D, and Supplemental Figure S2B).PI4KII isoforms are not known to directly influence the actin cytoskeleton; instead, they control trafficking from the TGN to endosomes through the recruitment of clathrin adaptors. To address the question of how PI4KII\u03b2 knockdown leads to increased matrix degradation, we asked whether the PI4KII isoforms synthesized separate pools of PI(4)P and whether loss of this PI(4)P affected post-TGN membrane traffic. We visualized the PI(4)P generated by each PI4KII isoform by inhibiting PI4KIII activities with wortmannin in control and siRNA-treated cells. When we stained siRNA-treated cells with the PI(4)P reporter glutathione S-transferase (GST)\u2013FAPP-PH, we noted that the intensity of staining in the Golgi region was affected in both PI4KII\u03b1- and PI4KII\u03b2-knockdown cells but included signal from PI(4)P synthesized by the Golgi enzyme PI4KIII\u03b2 (Supplemental Figure S3A). We therefore treated the same cells with wortmannin to inhibit PI4KIII\u03b2 and fixed and stained the cells with recombinant GST-P4C, which is an unbiased PI(4)P reporter (Luo et\u00a0al., 2015). The residual GST-P4C signal allowed us to report the PI(4)P derived from the activity of PI4KII\u03b1 (PI(4)PPI4KII\u03b1) and PI4KII\u03b2 (PI(4)PPI4KII\u03b2; Figure 4, A\u2013C, and Supplemental Figure S4D), which in both cases localized to membranes in the Golgi region and on cytoplasmic vesicles (Figure 4, A\u2013C). Cells in which PI4KII\u03b1 was depleted showed residual PI(4)PPI4KII\u03b2 staining that colocalized with TGN46 (Figure 4, A and D). In contrast, PI(4)PPI4KII\u03b1 predominantly colocalized with the TGN marker syntaxin 6 (Figure 4, B and D). Colocalization of PI(4)P with syntaxin 6 and TGN46 was restored upon expression of plasmids containing silent mutations rendering them resistant to siRNA (Figure 4, E and F, and Supplemental Figure S3, E and F). This demonstrates that the wortmannin-insensitive PI(4)PPI4KII\u03b1 and PI(4)PPI4KII\u03b2 pools generated by the PI4KIIs exist in distinct subdomains of TGN/endosomal membranes and that knockdown of each isoform affects a metabolically separate PI(4)P compartment.PI(4)P at the TGN is known to control the recruitment of the clathrin adaptor AP-1 in TGN-to-endosomal traffic (Wang et\u00a0al., 2003; Wieffer et\u00a0al., 2013), and we therefore reasoned that loss of TGN PI(4)P would affect this trafficking route. We investigated how loss of TGN PI(4)P altered the steady-state distribution of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), finding that PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 led to a significant loss in colocalization between PI(4)P and this AP-1 cargo (Figure 4, C and D). This effect was particularly marked in PI4KII\u03b2 cells, which also displayed a more compact staining pattern in the Golgi region and an absence of vesicular M6PR (Figure 4C). We also stained cells transfected with GFP-M6PR for AP-1 and found that PI4KII\u03b2 siRNA cells showed reduced colocalization between them (Figure 4, G and H), indicating defective TGN-to-endosomal traffic. We tested the consequences on endolysosomal traffic by performing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation assay and found that depletion of both PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 significantly impaired ligand-induced degradation of the EGFR (Figure 4, I and J). Given that loss of either PI4KII isoform impairs EGFR degradation, we coimmunostained MT1-MMP with the lysosomal marker CD63 and found that both PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 siRNA resulted in reduced colocalization (Supplemental Figure S4, A and B). Collectively these results show that loss of either PI(4)P pool affects TGN-to-endosome traffic and ultimately the degradation of cargo destined for lysosomes.MT1-MMP is delivered to invadopodia from endosomal compartments (Steffen et\u00a0al., 2008; Wiesner et\u00a0al., 2013). We therefore considered that altered intracellular traffic might play a role in the increased localization of MT1-MMP to invadopodia. We analyzed cell surface MT1-MMP staining versus total cellular MT1-MMP using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and found that loss of either PI4KII isoform led to an increase in total cellular MT1-MMP levels compared with controls (Supplemental Figure S4C); however, loss of PI4KII\u03b2 led to an approximately threefold increase in MT1-MMP at the cell surface compared with control and PI4KII\u03b1 siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 5A).Increased surface MT1-MMP could result from a decreased rate of endocytosis or an increased rate of exocytic trafficking. We therefore analyzed changes to the complex trafficking itinerary of MT1-MMP by coimmunostaining MT1-MMP and a selective panel of Rab GTPases known to control traffic of cargo in endosomal and Golgi membranes (Wiesner et\u00a0al., 2013). On loss of PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2, MT1-MMP displayed decreased colocalization with early endosomal Rab5 and the late endosomal Rab7 (Figure 5, B and C). A significant increase in colocalization was observed with the post-Golgi Rab8, but meaningful differences were not detected in the colocalization of MT1-MMP with late endosomal Rab9 or the recycling endosomal Rab11 (Figure 5, B and C). This analysis demonstrates that MT1-MMP trafficking is redirected from an early endosomal (EE)\u2013late endosomal (LE) route to the plasma membrane via a Rab8 exocytic route.We asked whether PI4KII\u03b2 depletion was sufficient to convert the minimally invasive MCF-7 epithelial cell line into an invasive migratory phenotype. To test this, we evaluated the ability of PI4KII\u03b2-depleted MCF-7 cells to degrade FITC-gelatin matrix and invade a collagen layer in the Transwell chamber assay. PI4KII\u03b2-depleted MCF-7 cells degraded FITC-gelatin to an extent comparable to the highly invasive MDA-MDB-231 line (Figure 6, A and B). Furthermore, they displayed increased invasiveness and the ability to invade collagen ECM and cross the membrane toward a chemoattractant (Figure 6C). These findings indicate that PI4KII\u03b2 suppresses cell invasion in vitro.A region of human chromosome 4 encompassing the gene for PI4KII\u03b2 (PI4K2B) contains tumor suppressor genes associated with sporadic colorectal carcinoma (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2008). We therefore interrogated oncogenomic and transcriptomic data in the CBioPortal and Oncomine databases and found an association between heterozygous loss of PI4K2B and lung (squamous cell and adenocarcinoma), esophageal, pancreatic, prostate, breast, liver, and various other epithelial cancers (Figure 7A and Supplemental Figure S5). In pancreatic tumors, homozygous loss of PI4K2B was detected in 2.75% of samples, heterozygous loss in 43.1%, and gain in 12.8%. Copy number was normal in 39.44% (n = 109 samples; Figure 7B). In HCC, both PI4K2B alleles were deleted in 0.52%, 23.68% displayed heterozygous deletion, 64.73% had normal copy numbers, and 10.52% showed gain of PI4K2B (n = 190; Figure 7C). Significant reductions in PI4KII\u03b2 mRNA expression were detected\u00a0in invasive breast carcinoma (n = 59; Figure 7D). We also analyzed survival data in the small number of cases available (Ciriello et\u00a0al., 2015) and found that loss of PI4KII\u03b2 expression correlated with poor survival in patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the breast (Figure 7E). Together these data support the hypothesis that loss of PI4KII\u03b2 is a risk factor in cancers.Here we identify a post-TGN trafficking pathway that negatively regulates endolysosomal traffic and the formation of invadopodia. Loss of the PI4KII isoforms had dramatically different and unexpected effects on the actin cytoskeleton. An additional and striking feature of PI4KII\u03b2-depleted cells was the appearance of mature and functional invadopodia on the ventral surface.PI4KII\u03b2 plays a role in the development of a migratory phenotype in HCC (Mazzocca et\u00a0al., 2008), but there is limited evidence for the direct involvement of mammalian PI4KII isozymes in actin regulation. In contrast, several studies have described PI4KII functions in post-TGN traffic through PI(4)P biosynthesis and direct binding to clathrin adaptors AP-1 and AP-3 (Wang et\u00a0al., 2003, 2007; Salazar et\u00a0al., 2005; Craige et\u00a0al., 2008), both pathways that contribute to endolysosomal traffic. PI4KII\u03b1 controls LE traffic of the EGFR (Minogue et\u00a0al., 2006), endolysosomal traffic mediated by AP-3 (Craige et\u00a0al., 2008), and that of lysosomal membrane proteins and hydrolases such as the enzyme \u03b2-glucocerebosidase (Jovic et\u00a0al., 2012). This explains the similar effects of PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 depletion on EGFR degradation and LE traffic (Figure 4, I and J). PI4KII\u03b2 localizes to the TGN and recruits AP-1, where it controls the endosomal sorting of Frizzled by traffic to degradative compartments (Wieffer et\u00a0al., 2013). There is therefore a substantial amount of data from our study and in published work indicating that each PI4KII contributes to TGN-EE/LE traffic by acting at different points in a pathway leading to lysosomal degradation. The other principal way in which the PI4KII isoforms differ is in the regulation of their PI4KII activity. The reported low activity of PI4KII\u03b2 (Balla et\u00a0al., 2002) and the need to recruit this isoform to membranes (Jung et\u00a0al., 2011) illustrate the importance of regulating its activity and suggest that this isoform is subject to tight regulation.Few studies have investigated the role of PI4KIIs in TGN PI(4)P synthesis. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the PI4KII enzymes synthesize separate TGN pools of PI(4)P that are defined by the markers syntaxin 6 and TGN46. This is consistent with our previous description of a TGN-endosomal compartment enriched in syntaxin 6 containing highly active PI4KII\u03b1 (Simonsen et\u00a0al., 1999; Waugh et\u00a0al., 2003). The structurally unrelated, wortmannin-sensitive PI4KIII\u03b2 also contributes to PI(4)P synthesis in the Golgi of MDCK cells (Weixel et\u00a0al., 2005), indicating that the Golgi complex contains at least three metabolically separate PI(4)P pools.Cells such as HeLa and MCF-7 normally display minimal invasive potential and typically have low levels of surface MT1-MMP, reflecting the importance of controlling surface metalloproteinase activity (Poincloux et\u00a0al., 2009). Loss of either PI4KII isoform led to increased levels of the metalloproteinase, consistent with a general impairment of endolysosomal degradative traffic; however, only depletion of PI4KII\u03b2 caused increased levels of surface MT1-MMP, indicating that intracellular traffic of MT1-MMP was affected in an isoform-specific manner.The reduced colocalization of MT1-MMP with Rab7, which acts at the EE-LE boundary, in both PI4KII-depleted cells demonstrates that the proteinase is not sorted to the LE. This is consistent with the elevated levels of MT1-MMP observed in both PI4KII knockdowns (Supplemental Figure S4C), the impaired degradation of the EGFR (Figure 4, I and J), and the failure of MT1-MMP to traffic to CD63-containing lysosomes (Supplemental Figure 4, A and B). The most dramatic change in colocalization was a PI4KII\u03b2-specific increase in association with Rab8 membranes. Rab8 operates in a post-Golgi exocytic pathway that determines directional traffic to protrusions of the plasma membrane (Hattula et\u00a0al., 2006) and is known to mediate the trafficking of MT1-MMP (Bravo-Cordero et\u00a0al., 2007). A mechanistic investigation of Rab8 was outside the scope of our study, but it is interesting to note that this GTPase was recently shown to regulate the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Bravo-Cordero et\u00a0al., 2016), suggesting that the mistrafficking of Rab8 may contribute to the actin phenotype.We were unable to detect increased trafficking of MT1-MMP-GFP to invasive structures in live cell experiments; however, our attempts were fraught with technical difficulties arising from the substantial MT1-MMP signal present in multiple subcellular compartments that obscured invadopodia dynamics. The trafficking of MT1-MMP is known to be complex, and surface levels are controlled by endocytosis and exocytosis from several compartments (Poincloux et\u00a0al., 2009). The increased localization of MT1-MMP to the plasma membrane, increased association with invasive protrusions, loss of colocalization in Rab5- and Rab7-positive compartments, and increased colocalization with exocytic Rab8 membranes indicate that loss of PI4KII\u03b2 and the associated pool of TGN PI(4)P causes disequilibrium between the endolysosomal and exocytic trafficking routes controlling plasma membrane levels of MT1-MMP. Our data support a model in which MT1-MMP traffic is directed away from the default endolysosomal pathway and forced into an exocytic pathway. One possible consequence of reduced MT1-MMP traffic into the endolysosomal pathway is increased recycling. Although we did not directly address this possibility, it remains likely because we also detected increased invadopodial localization of \u03b21-integrin, a molecule known to be recycled through a pathway involving Rab8 and cotrafficked with MT1-MMP (Macpherson et\u00a0al., 2014). Of interest, the recent finding that PI4KII\u03b1 directs exocytic traffic of \u03b21-integrin from endosomes to the plasma membrane when endosomal PI(3)P is lost (Ketel et\u00a0al., 2016) suggests that endosomal PI(4)PPI4KII\u03b1 may play a role in \u03b21-integrin delivery. Further investigation is required to determine whether loss of PI(4)PPI4KII\u03b2 results in an increase in PI(4)PPI4KII\u03b1 and whether this is accompanied by increased \u03b21-integrin recycling. Integrin traffic to the plasma membrane plays important roles in tissue organization and is known to be dependent on PI(3)P (Ribeiro et\u00a0al., 2011). Cross-talk between this PI monophosphate and the PI(4)P produced by the PI4KIIs is an unanswered question.The conversion of the minimally invasive HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines to an invasive phenotype and the fact that tumor suppressor genes map closely to the chromosomal location of the PI4K2B allele (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2008) led us to perform database searches. These showed that loss of heterozygosity of the PI4K2B allele and PI4KII\u03b2 underexpression were associated with numerous cancers of epithelial origin. PI4KII\u03b2 underexpression was also associated with poorer patient survival; however, the low statistical power of the studies led to a relatively low probability value (p = 0.262). Although we are cautious in drawing conclusions, we are aware that this finding may be highly significant and therefore speculate that PI4KII\u03b2 acts as a metastasis suppressor by maintaining PI(4)P-dependent post-TGN traffic into the endolysosomal pathway. The association of PI4KII\u03b2 with relatively common human cancers (lung, breast, liver, pancreas, and others) warrants further investigation, particularly because of the possibility that this putative suppressor pathway could be rescued by inhibition of PI(4)P phosphatases acting at the TGN.It is notable that a developmental role for PI4KII\u03b2 in zebrafish has been described (Wieffer et\u00a0al., 2013). The pathological process of tumor cell invasion has many similarities with important processes during embryogenesis along with neurite outgrowth and angiogenesis. It is therefore possible that PI4KII\u03b2 activity is subject to regulation controlling physiological invasion. This hypothesis points to a PI(4)P-regulated switch that determines the decision between lysosomal degradation of cargoes and their traffic to the plasma membrane that may be fundamentally important in the intracellular traffic of key molecules such as integrins and matrix metalloproteinases that determine tissue remodeling during development.HeLa and MCF7 cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Leibowitz\u2019s L-15 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 15% FBS and 2 mM l-glutamine (Life Technologies) and maintained at 37\u00b0C, 0.1% CO2. All media were supplemented with antibiotics (1000 U/ml penicillin and 0.1\u00a0mg/ml streptomycin; Sigma-Aldrich).

Highly cross-adsorbed Alexa Fluor\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies and Alexa Fluor\u2013conjugated phalloidin (1:250 dilution) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Life Technologies). Hoechst 33342 trihydrochloride was also from Molecular Probes and was used at 1:5000 for nuclear staining. Human recombinant EGF was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Unless otherwise stated, other reagents were from Sigma Aldrich.siRNA-resistant GFP-tagged PI4KII\u03b1 and hemagglutinin-tagged PI4KII\u03b2 were generous gifts from Volker Haucke (Leibniz Institut f\u00fcr Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany). mCherry and GFP-tagged CI-M6PR were kindly provided by Mihaela Anitei (Technische Universit\u00e4t, Dresden, Germany).We silenced PI4KII\u03b1 and PI4KII\u03b2 using ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools siRNA oligonucleotides (GE Healthcare Dharmacon). Each comprised a mix of four siRNA duplexes targeting specific sequences within the named genes. We also used an ON-TARGETplus nontargeting pool (D-001810-10-05) as control. Gene silencing was confirmed by Western blotting of whole-cell lysates. PI4KII-knockdown phenotypes were rescued using single siRNA duplexes and the ectopic expression of siRNA resistant plasmids as described previously (Mossinger et\u00a0al., 2012; Wieffer et\u00a0al., 2013). Further details are given in the Supplemental Materials and Supplemental Table S2.Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA], 0.5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(\u03b2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N\u2019,N\u2019-tetraacetic acid [EGTA], 10 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mM Na3VO4) and 1\u00d7 cOmplete Protease Inhibitor (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Protein content was determined using the Lowry method (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK), and lysates were solubilized in 2\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer, separated using SDS\u2013PAGE, blotted, and probed with respective antibodies. Blots were imaged on a FluorChem M Multifluor imaging system (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA) and analyzed by densitometry using its gel analysis function.Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed, and probed with antibodies of interest as previously (Minogue et\u00a0al., 2006). Unless otherwise stated, images were acquired using the 63\u00d7/1.4 numerical aperture lens on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Randomly chosen representative fields were selected and 12-bit images acquired using identical detector gain and offset settings. Images were quantitatively analyzed for fluorescence intensities, pixel correlations, area measurements, and cell densities using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Full details are available in the Supplemental Materials.The ability of cells to degrade the extracellular matrix was analyzed using fluorescent gelatin matrix\u2013coated culture dishes prepared according to Bowden et\u00a0al. (1999). Targeted or control siRNA-transfected cells were seeded onto FITC-gelatin\u2013coated coverslips and cultured for 12\u201318 h. Matrix degradation was calculated as the total area of matrix degradation (black holes) per total cell area expressed as a percentage (full details are given in the Supplemental Materials).We used an established method (Kean et\u00a0al., 2009). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were reseeded onto coverslips thinly coated with collagen (5 \u03bcg/cm2) at 36 h posttransfection and grown in complete DMEM for 20 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then serum starved for 4 h to facilitate internalization of MT1-MMP. For trafficking of endogenous MT1-MMP, cells were pulsed with anti\u2013MT1-MMP antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Cells were subsequently fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized, and immunostained.For flow cytometry experiments, we induced internalization of MT1-MMP by serum starvation and stimulated surface expression as described. Cells were lifted using FACS buffer (5 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], pH 7.4) and subsequent steps carried out at 4\u00b0C. Cells were probed with rabbit anti\u2013MT1-MMP (Abcam) for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and then labeled with anti\u2013rabbit Alexa Fluor antibody. Cells were analyzed using a FACS LSRII cell sorter (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK), and \u223c10,000 cells were counted per sample. Postacquisition analysis was performed using Flowjo software, version V10 (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR).This was performed in 8-\u03bcm-pore, collagen-coated Transwell chambers (Corning, Tewksbury, MA). Cells were transfected with target or control siRNA in six-well plates and, after 48 h, resuspended in serum-free medium and seeded at 5 \u00d7 104 into the upper chamber of the Transwell. Cells were allowed to migrate toward 10% FBS plus DMEM for 12 h. Migratory cells at the lower chamber were fixed and stained with Alexa 488\u2013conjugated phalloidin, imaged using similar optical settings (20\u00d7 Objective, Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope), and counted in five random fields using ImageJ. Histograms represent relative invasion of the Transwell chamber, calculated as the number of cells counted at the lower chamber relative to the total number of cells seeded onto the upper chamber (details are give in the Supplemental Materials).Prism 5 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA) was used for statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM from at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s posttest at a 95% confidence interval.The cBIO Cancer Genomics Portal (http://cbioportal.org/; Cerami et\u00a0al., 2012; Gao et\u00a0al., 2013) and Oncomine (Rhodes et\u00a0al., 2004) are open access resources for cancer genomics data sets containing data from 69 cancer genomics studies with 17,177 samples (cBIO) and 715 data sets with 86,733 samples (Oncomine). Heterozygous loss of the PI4K2B allele was analyzed in all cancers, as were copy number alterations in pancreatic cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Although early-stage, localized CRC is often curable by surgical resection, some of these patients will experience recurrent, metastatic disease. Currently, the best predictor of risk is lymph node status. There is, however, considerable interest in identifying mechanistically based, molecular markers to improve the ability to forecast individual risk of disease recurrence. In a prior study, we sought to identify such markers by proteomic analysis of samples obtained by laser capture micro-dissection of tumor tissue from node-negative and node-positive patients. Of these, transgelin, a 23\u00a0kDa actin binding protein, ranked the highest in a statistical analysis. Transgelin, also known as SM22\u03b1, is an abundant protein in normal tissue. It promotes podosome formation and contributes to cell motility in response to injury or inflammation [4, 5]. Transgelin knockout mice are viable and fertile, but exhibit reduced smooth muscle contractility [7, 8] and enhanced atherogenesis in a susceptible background. Perhaps because of its abundance, transgelin has been frequently identified in proteomic profiling studies of cancer. Early studies showed that expression is down-regulated in early-stage cancer models [10, 11], leading to the idea that transgelin is a tumor suppressor (reviewed in). However, proteomic studies of transgelin in human cancers often indicate up-regulation in aggressive, late-stage disease [13\u201316]. Several studies, although not all, have shown a correlation between higher tumor transgelin levels and aggressive behavior, advanced stage, or poor prognosis [1, 17\u201321]. Consistent with this, various studies have suggested an influence of transgelin on motility or invasiveness in cell-based models [1, 22, 23]. A recent review summarizes current understanding of transgelin in normal tissue and malignancy. One hypothesis that fits with most of the experimental and clinical data is that transgelin is not a marker of cancer per se, but rather a marker of metastatic potential in advanced disease. One way that transgelin may influence metastasis is through direct interaction with cytoplasmic actin. There is also evidence that manipulation of transgelin expression levels affects the expression of other metastasis-related genes, suggesting a possible dual mechanism of action. Here, we adopt an approach based on comparison of isogenic CRC cell populations that differ in transgelin expression but are otherwise identical. We generated new isogenic cell pairs, in which low transgelin-expressing CRC cell lines were transfected with a transgelin cDNA vector to create high-expressing derivatives. We also further characterized a previously created isogenic cell pair, in which high transgelin-expressing cells were stably transfected with miRNA to attenuate transgelin expression. Overexpression in low-expressing cells and attenuation in high-expressing cells had reciprocal effects on cell behavior. In addition, comprehensive gene expression profiling showed that increasing transgelin expression in a low-expressing background led to changes in expression of ~250 other mRNAs. Thus, experimental manipulation of transgelin levels leads to wide-scale transcriptional reprogramming. Previously, we described stable transfection of HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells with transgelin miRNA to create two independent cell line pairs that differ in transgelin protein and mRNA levels. In both cases, lower transgelin expression was associated with reduced motility, invasiveness, and resistance to anoikis. This phenotype could furthermore be reversed by transfection with miRNA-resistant transgelin cDNA. To extend and confirm the results of the transgelin knockdown experiments, we tested a complementary approach, creating a new isogenic cell line model in which transgelin was overexpressed in CRC cells that express endogenous transgelin at very low levels. We transfected RKO CRC cells, in which endogenous transgelin is nearly undetectable, with a transgelin cDNA and selected stable transfectants. After selection, virtually all cells expressed a fluorescent transfection marker (Fig.\u00a01a). Immunoblotting showed high levels of transgelin protein in cells that received the transgelin cDNA (RKOTAGLN), whereas transgelin remained undetectable in cells that received an empty control vector (RKOCTRL) (Fig.\u00a01b). Measurement of the relative levels of transgelin mRNA by qPCR showed an increase of about 25-fold (Fig.\u00a01c). The overexpressed transgelin was distributed primarily in the cytoplasm, as indicated by immunofluorescence staining (Fig.\u00a01d). We investigated the phenotype of the newly created RKO cell pair using in vitro assays. Transgelin overexpression led to a 2 to 3-fold increase in invasiveness in a Transwell assay (Fig.\u00a02a). There was also an increase in the ability to form colonies when plated at low density (Fig.\u00a02b), and in the number and size of colonies in a soft-agar growth assay (Fig.\u00a02c). Differences were highly significant in all three assays (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Interestingly, transgelin expression had essentially no effect on growth rate or cell cycle distribution under standard cell culture conditions (Fig.\u00a02d, e), suggesting that transgelin expression primarily affects behaviors relevant to metastasis (such as invasiveness, clonogenicity, and anchorage-independent growth) rather than growth per se. We next tested the behavior of isogenic cell pairs in a model of experimental metastasis. RKOTAGLN or RKOCTRL cells were injected via the tail vein into scid mice. We also tested the behavior of previously described HCT 116 cells stably transfected with a transgelin miRNA knockdown vector (HCT116 TAGLN-KD) or with empty control vector (HCT116CTRL) in the same assay. Tumor burden in each experimental group was measured by quantitative histologic analysis. Mice receiving RKOTAGLN cells had more tumors than those receiving RKOCTRL cells, and the tumors occupied a greater fraction of the lung area (Fig.\u00a03A). Similar results were seen with HCT116CTRL and HCT116TAGLN-KD cells (Fig\u00a03B). In both instances, the member of the isogenic pair that had higher transgelin levels also had a greater tumor burden. Although transgelin levels affected the number and size of metastases, there were no consistent differences in tumor histology (Fig.\u00a03c, d). Immunostaining of HCT116-derived tumors with anti-transgelin antibody showed that tumors derived from the two cell populations retained their respective transgelin phenotypes in vivo, with no evidence of reversion (Fig.\u00a03e). We did note that injection with HCT116 TAGLN-KD cells resulted in an unexpected incidence tumors near the injection site, instead of or in addition to the lung metastases (6/10 with HCT116 TAGLN-KD versus 1/10 with HCT116CTRL). Tumors near the injection site were not grossly evident in mice injected with the RKO cells. Prior studies suggest that transgelin is capable of both activating and repressing genes involved in tumor progression [1, 25, 26], although only a small number of individual genes have been examined to date. To define the full scope of transgelin-mediated gene regulation, we performed comprehensive gene expression profiling on RKOCTRL and RKOTAGLN cells using Affymetrix microarray technology. Based on criteria of adjusted P value <0.05 and a minimum 2-fold change, 256 transcripts were significantly affected, with approximately equal numbers of transcripts increased and decreased (Fig.\u00a04a). The most significantly affected categories of genes were those involved in cytoskeletal and actin binding (Fig.\u00a04b). Other categories that were significantly affected included GTPase regulatory activities, other enzyme regulatory activities and identical protein binding (the ability to form homodimers or higher-order multimers). Table\u00a01 shows the ten most highly up-regulated and ten most highly down-regulated genes. Interestingly, prior studies implicate a number of these in metastasis or cell motility (see Discussion). To confirm the microarray results and investigate their generality, we performed qPCR analysis to independently determine mRNA levels for seven genes, chosen from Table\u00a01 based on cancer relevance (see Discussion for details on the function of individual genes). We performed the analysis using RNA from the RKO cells, which were used for microarray, and also from an isogenic cell pair derived from DLD-1 cells. Like RKO, DLD-1 is a widely studied human CRC line with low endogenous transgelin levels. Transgelin protein expression was undetectable by immunoblotting in cells stably transfected with empty control vector (DLD-1CTRL) and was greatly increased following transfection with the transgelin expression vector (DLD-1TAGLN) (Fig.\u00a05a). The effect of chronic transgelin expression in RKO and DLD-1 cells was strikingly similar and correlated well with the microarray data (Fig.\u00a05b and Additional file 1: Table S1). HOOK1, SDCCAG8, ENAH, and TNS1 were up-regulated in the presence of transgelin, with effect sizes ranging from 5-fold to more than one hundred-fold. EMB, BCL11B, and PTPRD were down-regulated 3- to 60-fold. The significance of these changes in gene expression will be taken up in the Discussion; all of the genes are related to the cytoskeleton or cancer, and concordant regulation by transgelin in two independent CRC lines suggests a general effect with a common mechanism. We characterized a new isogenic pair of high and low transgelin-expressing cell populations. In contrast to our previous study, where we knocked down expression in two high expressing CRC lines, here we increased transgelin expression in a low-expressing line. The overexpressing variant showed gain of metastasis-related behaviors in cell-based assays. Thus, overexpressing cells showed increased ability to invade Matrigel, an increased ability to form colonies when plated at low density, and more and larger colonies in soft agar. The reciprocal effects of up-regulation and down-regulation further support the idea that transgelin levels are causally related to metastatic behavior. Here, we show that experimental manipulation of transgelin expression levels affects the metastatic potential of CRC cells in vivo. In the experimental metastasis assay, control HCT116 cells and RKO cells with stable overexpression of transgelin produced more and larger tumors in the lung than their isogenic, low transgelin-expressing counterparts. The widely used tail vein assay provides a composite measure of the efficiency of sequential events required for metastasis, including survival of isolated cells in the bloodstream, extravasation into the lung, and subsequent colonization and proliferation to form observable tumors. Each of these steps has a parallel counterpart that was previously measured in cell culture, including resistance to anoikis, invasiveness in a Transwell assay, and colony formation at low density, respectively. Although a number of proteomic studies (but not all) have shown a correlation between transgelin levels and advanced stage disease and poor prognosis, data here imply a direct causal relationship between transgelin levels and metastatic potential in vivo. In normal cells and tissue, transgelin interacts directly with the actin, influencing cell motility [3\u20135]. This mechanism may apply in cancer cells as well. In addition to direct interaction with actin, transgelin may also influence cell phenotype by affecting gene regulation. This idea is based on transgelin\u2019s partial nuclear localization, its homology to transgelin 3, which has transcriptional regulatory activity, and other evidence [1, 25, 26]. To address the influence of transgelin on gene regulation in greater depth, we performed comprehensive gene expression profiling comparing low- and high-expressing RKO cells. Altering transgelin levels significantly affected the expression of a set of ~250 other genes, with statistical overrepresentation of cytoskeletal and actin-binding proteins, together with various other regulatory genes. The five most-highly upregulated genes in Table\u00a01 are connected with cancer, and in some cases specifically with tumor metastasis. HOOK1 (up-regulated 96-fold) interacts with microtubules and is up-regulated in breast cancer. SDCCAG8 (up-regulated 86-fold) organizes the centrosome and is related to a colon cancer autoantigen. ENAH (up-regulated 18-fold), which is the mammalian enabled homology and is also known as Mena, is a transcriptional target of the wnt/beta-catenin pathway. It facilitates cell invasion via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent local accumulation of actin filaments. Increased ENAH/Mena expression levels correlate with invasiveness of breast and salivary gland tumors[33, 34], and are also seen in colorectal cancer and in polyps with high grade dysplasia. TNS1 (up-regulated 14-fold), which is also known as Tensin 1, has actin cross-linking activity and localizes to focal adhesions. Prior studies show that increased expression of Tensin 1 correlates with tumor cell migration [36, 37]. A sialyltransferase (ST8SIA4) has been shown to promote metastatic dissemination in pancreatic cancer by interfering with E-cadherin dependent cell adhesion. Of the most highly down-regulated genes, EMB (down-regulated 16-fold) is thought to mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix. BCL11B (down regulated 12-fold) is a tumor suppressor that is widely mutated in acute lymphocytic leukemia and has recently been shown to be methylated, and thus likely down-regulated, in prostate cancers. PTPRD (down-regulated 11-fold), a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in glioblastoma [42, 43], Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, lung cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. PTPRD has previously been shown to suppress colon cancer cell migration in cooperation with \u03b2-catenin/TCF signaling. Based on an analysis of a more limited set of genes, we had previously hypothesized that transgelin regulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In one cell line, fibronectin and vimentin (mesenchymal markers) and occludin (an epithelial marker) were affected. In another, only fibronectin was affected. In the RKO model, however, neither these nor other markers of EMT were altered. Thus the effect of transgelin on EMT, if any, appears to be cell-line specific. It remains unclear whether the effect of transgelin on gene regulation occurs by a direct or indirect mechanism. Transgelin localized partially in the nucleus of the CRC cells; it shares 85\u00a0% similarity to TAGLN3, which is believed to be a transcriptional regulator; Bioinformatic analysis using the DP-bind Web server (http://lcg.rit.albany.edu/dp-bind) identified several segments of transgelin as having high DNA-binding potential (data not shown); studies also suggests that nuclear actin-binding proteins participate widely in the transcription processes (reviewed in). We were, however, unable, to detect direct association of transgelin with RNA polymerase II or chromatin (HMZ, YYF, and YL, unpublished results), which suggests that transgelin most likely works indirectly, through interaction with other transcriptional regulatory proteins, rather than by direct interaction with the polymerase or template. The original impetus for the studies reported here was to identify biomarkers that could be quantified at the time of surgical resection and used to predict metastatic risk. Transgelin is abundant in normal tissue and is not a marker of cancer per se. In our work, however, it discriminated well between node-positive and node-negative CRC specimens. Evaluation of potential biomarkers should ideally include evidence that they influence the biological process of interest; that is, adding or subtracting transgelin in a given context influences phenotypic behaviors associated with metastatic risk. Combining the results presented with those of a previous study, we have created four isogenic pairs (HCT116, SW480, RKO, and DLD-1), three have been characterized with respect to in vitro phenotypes (HCT116, SW480, and RKO) and two (HCT116 and RKO) have been characterized in an animal model of experimental metastasis. The combined results are consistent with a contribution of transgelin to metastatic potential. Human CRC is characterized by genomic instability and variability, and caution is warranted in generalizing from results with individual cell lines. However, laboratory findings provide a rationale for continuing to explore the potential of transgelin, perhaps in conjunction with other biomarkers, as a predictor of individual risk. As noted earlier, proteomic studies of human cancer are not in universal agreement with respect to the role of transgelin, and it will be important to identify the root cause of the discrepancies, which could relate either to different patient populations or to technical factors. Separately, the finding that a number of gene products are co-regulated with transgelin suggests that they may be attractive targets for drug therapy in advanced CRC. The results support a hypothesis that transgelin expression levels influence metastatic potential in CRC cell lines, and this may occur in part due to altered expression of downstream target genes that affect cell motility. RKO and DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA; CRL-2577 or CRL-221 respectively). Cells were transfected with pcDNA6.2/EmGFP-Bsd/V5-DEST or pcDNA6.2/EmGFP-Bsd/V5-TAGLN-mut vectors; the latter was generated using pDONR221-TAGLN-mut from a previous study by an LR recombination). Stable transfectants were selected in medium containing 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-transgelin IgG or anti-GAPDH IgG1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) with ECL substrate for detection (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Immunofluorescence was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed cells as described. For qPCR, total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), cDNA was prepared, and qPCR was performed using primers in Additional file 2: Table S2. Reactions were performed using a SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Creation and characterization of HCT116CTRL and HCT116TAGLN-KD populations has been described. In brief, cells were transfected with plasmid expressing an artificial microRNA (Invitrogen, Hmi416875) or with control vector and drug selection was applied to obtain cell populations that differed by about five-fold in transgelin expression levels. Cell invasion assays were performed as described [1, 50] using a Transwell permeable support (8.0\u00a0\u03bcm pore size in 6-well format, Corning Life Sciences, Corning, NY). Filters were coated with 650\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Cells were harvested and resuspended in serum-free medium, and 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells were applied onto the upper chamber of the Transwell apparatus. The bottom chamber contained 0.6\u00a0ml of medium supplemented with 10\u00a0% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for 48\u00a0hours. Cells that did not migrate were removed by cotton swabbing. Remaining cells were fixed with 4\u00a0% formaldehyde for 20\u00a0minutes at room temperature and stained with 0.1\u00a0% crystal violet for 15\u00a0minutes, also at room temperature. The stained cells were extracted with 10\u00a0% acetic acid, and the absorbance at 595\u00a0nm was measured. Cells were plated at 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009102 per 60\u00a0mm dish and incubated with complete growth medium for 12\u00a0days. Colonies were fixed and stained with staining buffer (0.1\u00a0% crystal violet, 4\u00a0% formaldehyde) for 30\u00a0minutes at room temperature. Eagle\u2019s MEM supplemented with 20\u00a0% fetal bovine serum, was adjusted to 0.6\u00a0% agar and distributed in a 6-well plate to form a base layer. Cells (2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009102 cells per well) were suspended in the same medium containing 0.35\u00a0% agar and the suspension was dispensed to each well. Cultures were fed twice weekly with an overlay of complete medium. After 17\u00a0days colonies of 100 or more cells were counted. Replicate cultures were seeded in 6-well dishes (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/well). Triplicate samples of each cell population were harvested and counted daily for four days. For cell cycle analysis, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells were fixed with 70\u00a0% ethanol overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 50\u00a0\u03bcg RNase (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 9\u00a0\u03bcg propidium iodide (Invitrogen, USA) for 30\u00a0minutes at 4\u00a0\u00b0C in the dark. DNA content was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA). For the tail vein assay, 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells were suspended in 0.15\u00a0ml of Hank\u2019s solution, filtered to obtain a single-cell suspension, and injected using a 28-gauge needle into a tail vein of six-week-old CB.17 scid mice. Mice were sacrificed after 6\u20138 weeks or when they exhibited signs of disease (weight loss and decreased grooming). Animals were necropsied and lungs and any other organs that showed gross tumors were fixed, paraffin embedded, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for examination by a pathologist. The number of tumors in lung, heart, kidney, rib, back (near the injection site), leg, and foot was scored. Representative lung tissue sections were imaged using an Aperio Scanscope eSlide capture device and analyzed using Aperio Precision image analysis software. Gene expression profiling was performed using an Affymetrix Gene Chip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, which contains 54,000 probe sets representing 38,500 well-characterized human genes (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Total RNA was isolated from triplicate cultures using the TRIzol method. After passing a quality control measurement, RNA was amplified and labeled using the Affymetrix 3\u2019 IVT Express kit and hybridized to the array for 16\u00a0hours. This was followed by washing and staining using the Affymetrix fluidics station 450. Arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix 3000 7G plus instrument. AGCC software was used to generate .cel files. CHP files were generated with the mas5 method using the Affymetrix Expression Console. Data were imported into the Agilent Gene Spring GX software for further analysis. Statistical significance of inter-group differences was evaluated by a t-test with Bonferroni correction. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using Spotfire 5.0 software (TIBCO, Somerville, MA). The row dendrogram was generated using Ward\u2019s clustering method with a half square Euclidean distance measure. The column dendrogram was generated using the single linkage clustering method and a Euclidean distance measure. Gene ontology analysis was based on David 6.7 [52, 53] (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov).

The phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene was identified as a stroke susceptibility. Several studies tried to replicate this association in different populations but the results were conflicting. The complex entity and heterogeneity of stroke might be responsible for the inconsistent findings among studies. Given that atherosclerosis proceeds long before the occurrence of clinical ischemic event, using the severity of carotid atherosclerosis as a phenotype may reduce the complexity and improve the power to detect the PDE4D genetic effect. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaques have been shown to be good independent predictors for future vascular events. Despite the fact that both phenotypes correlate well to the pathologically and clinically defined atherosclerosis, they represent distinct traits with unique determinants and relationships to atherosclerosis. IMT is akin to a physical effect adapting to aging and hypertensive stress whereas plaque corresponds to a more pathogenic alternation in the vessel walls. Therefore, these two phenotypes can be used as independent surrogate markers in the genetic studies of atherosclerosis. Sex-specific relationships between IMT and the environmental factors like triglyceride, smoking and physical activities have been demonstrated in the Troms\u03c6 study. In addition, the association between inflammatory markers and IMT progression is stronger in women than in men. The lower incidence of cardiovascular disease in premenopausal women suggests a different susceptibility to atherosclerosis in men and women. Accordingly, the genetic effect on IMT or plaque may be modified by sex. Among the literature investigating the associations between the PDE4D gene and stroke, only one study included IMT and plaque as phenotypes of interest. This study only enrolled participants between ages 50 and 65; thus their results may not generalize to the population at large. In the present study, we sought to determine whether the PDE4D gene is involved in the pre-clinical atherogenic process, ranging from the early changes in the vessel morphology (i.e. IMT) to a later stage of atherosclerosis (i.e. plaque formation). The SNP rs702553 at the PDE4D gene was selected because it conferred a risk to young ischemic stroke in our previous study. To clarify the influence of sex on the relationship between the PDE4D gene and carotid atherosclerosis, we first performed the analyses in the overall data and then analyzed the data from men and women separately. The study subjects were stroke- and myocardial infarction (MI)-free volunteers who participated in the health screening programs at the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital between January 2006 and December 2007. A total of 1013 subjects were enrolled for carotid ultrasonography examinations. To compare the genetic effect across the atherosclerotic phenotypes, we also used the previous young stroke data (including 190 cases and 211 age-matched controls) with an additional 532 control subjects who were younger than 45 years old. These young subjects were recruited from the Kaohsiung Medical University and did not receive carotid ultrasound examinations. All of the study participants were descendants of Han Chinese resided at southern Taiwan. Demographic data and histories of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking were obtained from each study subject. Blood pressure measurements were done using a calibrated standard aneroid sphygmomanometer (Omron; Vernon Hills, Illinois) after sitting for at least 5 minutes and the average values from two measurements were used. A subject was defined as having hypertension if he had systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure \u226590 mm Hg, or was taking anti-hypertensive medications. A subject was defined as having diabetes if he had fasting blood glucose \u2265126 mg/dl or was taking hypoglycemic medications. A subject was defined as having hyperlipidemia if he had serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) \u2265 240 mg/dl. Overnight fasting venous blood was collected for biochemistry analyses and genetic studies. Serum levels of TC were determined using standardized enzymatic procedures (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). A subject was defined as a smoker if he ever smoked (including current or past smoker). All study protocols and methods were approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB). The ultrasonic examinations were assessed using the Philips HD 11 ultrasonography system equipped with a 7.5 Hz to 10 Hz linear array transducer (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, Washington, US). An experienced technician who was blinded to the patients' clinical data performed all the ultrasonic measurements. Subjects were examined in supine position. The transducer scanning direction was using anterior-oblique insonation. The far walls of carotid IMT were visualized bilaterally and the IMT values were measured at the plaque-free area of the common carotid artery (CCA, 10 to 20 mm proximal to the tip of the flow divider), carotid bifurcation (Bif, tip of the flow divider and extending 10 mm proximally) and internal carotid artery (ICA, proximal 10 mm above the bulb) separately. We used an automated computerized analyzing system (Philips Qlab quantification software) to improve the measurement accuracy. This new computerized technique automatically detected the echo interfaces and manual corrections were performed when there was no automatic outlining of the lumen-intima or the media-adventia interfaces. All the ultrasonic data were interpreted by a single neurologist (HF Lin). The mean absolute difference and standard deviation (SD) between two measurements was 0.05 \u00b1 0.04 mm. Carotid plaque, defined as an area of focal protrusion into the lumen at least 50% greater than the surrounding wall thickness, was measured in 682 out of the 1013 participants. The degree of plaque was graded using the following criteria: grade 0, no observable plaque; grade 1, one small plaque (<30% of the vessel diameter); grade 2, one medium plaque (30-50% of the vessel diameter) or multiple small plaques; grade 3, one large plaque (>50% of the vessel diameter) or multiple plaques with a least one medium plaque. The plaque index was calculated by the summation of plaque grades from five segments of the carotid arteries bilaterally (proximal and distal CCA, Bif, ICA and extra-cranial carotid artery), which was a modified method based on the Sutton-Tyrrell's study. Genomic DNA was isolated from the whole blood using Puregene kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Gentra, Research Triangle, NC). Previously, we screened four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were implicated to be associated with stroke in the literature. The four SNPs were rs12188950 (SNP45), rs702553 (SNP56), rs966221 (SNP83), and rs2910829 (SNP87). We found that the SNP rs702553 was significantly associated with young ischemic stroke in the Taiwanese population. In the present study, we further tested whether this SNP was also related to other atherosclerotic phenotypes. Genotyping was performed by the Applied Biosystems TaqMan technology. Briefly, PCR primers and two allelic-specific probes were designed to detect the specific SNP target. The PCR reactions were performed in the 96-well microplates with an ABI 7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Allele discrimination was achieved by detecting fluorescence using its System SDS software version 1.2.3. The genotype calling rate was 97.1%. Genotype distribution was tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using the Goodness-of-fit test. Two phenotypes (IMT and plaque index) were used as proxies for carotid atherosclerosis. For carotid plaque, those with a plaque index \u2265 four were defined as high-risk individuals, subjects with an index between one and three were defined as low-risk individuals, and those without any observable plaque (index = 0) were defined as reference individuals. Conditional logistic regression and the chi-squared test were used to evaluate the difference in genotype distribution. We analyzed both the continuous IMT data as well as the dichotomized IMT data. For the dichotomized IMT data, subjects with IMT values above the sex-specific and age-adjusted mean plus one SD were defined as high-risk individuals, and the rest of study subjects were defined as reference individuals. Logistic regression with adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking) were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk genotype. For the continuous IMT data, age-adjusted IMT values were log-transformed to approximate the normal distribution. ANOVA and Student's t-test were then used to compare the mean IMT values across different genotypes. We analyzed the genetic effect on the overall data as well as the sex- specific genetic effect by stratifying the subjects into men and women. The sex-genotype interaction was further evaluated by (1) adding an interaction term into the regression model, and (2) comparing the difference of odds ratios in men and women using Woolf's logit method and Z-test. Since we tested the PDE4D effect on seven phenotypes (i.e. plaque index, dichotomized IMT data at three segments, continuous IMT values at three segments) and performed the overall and sex-stratification analyses (i.e. a total of 21 tests in Table three), Tukey's ad hoc correction was adopted for multiple testing correction. To evaluate the genetic effect on stroke, logistic regression was used to estimate the OR for each genotype. We also performed subgroup analyses stratified by sex. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS statistical software (version 13.0). The demographic features of the study population are shown in Table 1. The genotype distribution was in HWE. The minor allele frequency of rs702553 in the present study was 0.41, which was quite close to those reported in the three independent Japanese populations (0.42-0.46). Among the 1013 subjects with IMT data, men had significantly higher IMT values than women at any of the three carotid segments (p = 7.7 \u00d7 10-9 - 1.8 \u00d7 10-16; Table 2). The average age-adjusted IMT values (mm) in men and women were 0.64 vs. 0.59 at CCA, 0.67 vs. 0.63 at Bif, and 0.54 vs. 0.48 at ICA. The cutoff levels (mm) to define the high-risk and low-risk groups at CCA, Bif and ICA were 0.77, 0.80 and 0.64 respectively in men; and 0.69, 0.73, and 0.57 respectively in women. Among the total study participants, data on plaque index was available for 682 subjects. Up to 10.8% of the male subjects had a plaque index \u2265 four; whereas 1.7% of the female subjects had a plaque index \u2265 four (p = 1 \u00d7 10-7, Table 2). There was a moderate association between the plaque index and the age-adjusted IMT value from each carotid segment (Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) = 0.24-0.35, p < 0.001). The prevalence of the cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and smoking) was much higher in men than in women (all p values < 0.05, Table 2). Sex remained as an independent determinant of IMT values in the multivariate regression no matter which carotid segment was analyzed (p = 0.001 - 5.5 \u00d7 10-12). Three genetic models (assuming the rare allele having a dominant, recessive, or additive effect) were used to evaluate the associations between rs702553 and the atherosclerotic phenotypes. The rare allele appeared to exert a recessive effect and the TT genotype was associated with increased IMT values and a higher plaque index (Table 3). Using individuals with no plaque as the reference group, the TT genotype was over-represented in individuals with a plaque index \u2265 four (OR = 3.1, nominal p = 0.034, corrected p = 0.15). Actually, the TT genotype was only significantly related to the high plaque index (plaque index \u2265 four) in men (OR = 5.9, nominal p = 0.008, corrected p = 0.036) but not in women. There was no significant association between the SNP rs702553 and the low-risk group (plaque index = 1-3). In the overall population, SNP rs702553 was not significant for IMT at any carotid segment. For the dichotomized IMT data in men, the TT genotype had an OR of 2.1 (nominal p = 0.032) for a thicker CCA IMT in comparison to the A allele carriers. However, the p value was not significant after Tukey's ad hoc correction (corrected p = 0.14). The T allele was associated with an increased IMT at Bif (p = 0.078) or ICA (p = 0.588) in men, although the association was not statistically significant. For women, the data was not significant for IMT at any carotid segment. We first used regression analysis to evaluate the sex-differential effect of the PDE4D gene. For CCA IMT, the existence of sex-genotype interaction was supported by a p value of 0.009 for the interaction term in the regression model. There was a borderline significance for the sex-genotype interaction (p = 0.062) when plaque index was the phenotype of interest. We further compared the odds ratios in men and women between SNP rs702553 and the various phenotypes (Figure 1). For CCA IMT, the TT genotypes conferred a significantly higher odds ratio in men than in women (OR (95% CI) = 2.16 (1.16-4.02) and 0.5 (0.21-1.16) respectively, p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in the odds ratios for men and women in other phenotypes. The results from carotid atherosclerotic phenotypes were in concordance with the results observed in our previous PDE4D young stroke study where the TT genotype was over-represented in young stroke cases than in the controls (23.9% vs. 15.9%, p = 0.01, Table 1). The TT frequency in the control subjects resembled that in the IMT study population who had no histories of stroke or MI. Compared with the A allele carriers (AA + AT genotypes), the TT genotype conferred an increased risk for stroke in men (OR = 1.79, p = 0.025) but not in women (OR = 1.44, p = 0.27) (Figure 2). The present study demonstrates a sex-differential effect of the PDE4D gene on CCA IMT and plaque. The TT genotype at SNP rs702553 is associated with an increased risk not only for ischemic stroke but also for the preclinical carotid atherosclerosis. The consistent genetic effect on various atherosclerotic phenotypes suggests that one of the major contributions of the PDE4D gene is to increase atherosclerosis. Our results indicate that the influence of the PDE4D gene begins long before the ischemic infarct, and its genetic effect on stroke is at least partially attributed to the wall thickening and plaque formation in the carotid arteries. In the present study, the pro-atherogenic effect of PDE4D is mainly present in men. One of the strengths of the present study is using the intermediate phenotypes as proxies of the more complex clinical outcome (i.e. stroke). To our knowledge, there was only one study investigating the PDE4D effect on carotid atherosclerosis. Bevan et al. found a borderline significance for IMT but a negative result for plaque. It should be noted that their study used the arbitrary cut off point of 1.8 mm of wall thickness to define the presence or absence of plaque; whereas we used both the size and the quantity of plaques to calculate the plaque index. We used both IMT and plaque index to estimate the atherosclerosis severity because they measure different aspects of atherogenesis. IMT mainly represents hypertensive hypertrophy of the vessel walls in response to systemic hypertension and aging. In contrast, plaque probably reflects a later stage of atherosclerosis when lipid infiltration, inflammation, matrix over-production, endothelium dysfunction, and smooth muscle cell proliferation take place. Our results showed that the PDE4D genetic effect is more prominent on plaque index than CCA IMT. It implies that this gene plays a more important role in the pathological process than the physiological changes as IMT. In addition, the modest correlation between plaque index and IMT supports that these two phenotypes represent different aspects of atherosclerotic process. In the present study, the genetic effect of PDE4D is strongest in the CCA IMT, attenuated in the Bif IMT, and completely disappeared in the ICA IMT. Genes with differential effects on different carotid segments have been reported previously. One intriguing finding in the present study is the potential sex-differential effect of the PDE4D gene. This sex-genotype interaction has not been reported in the PDE4D gene. However, sex-specific effect has been demonstrated in other genes. For examples, the endothelial NO synthase gene (NOS3) affects vascular stiffness in women but not in men. The solute carrier family 2 member 9 (SLC2A9) gene accounts for a larger proportion of uric acid variation in women than in men. Notably, 37.7% of our female subjects were below the age of 50 years. They were still under the anti-atherosclerotic protection of estrogen, which might also partially explain the lack of PDE4D genetic effect on the female subjects. Joakimsen et al. reported a low plaque prevalence in women younger than fifties and a linear escalation from 10% to 80% at their 4th to 7th decades. Indeed, the fact that only 7 female subjects were in the high-risk group (plaque index \u2265 4) indicates that these women might be too healthy to reveal the PDE4D genetic effect. The small sample size in the high-risk group also explains why a borderline significance was found for the sex-genotype interaction in plaque. Despite recent studies in the Han Chinese and Korean showed significant associations between the PDE4D gene and certain stroke subtypes, the largest PDE4D association study conducted in the Asian population (including 2847 stroke cases and 4464 controls in Japan) showed a negative result. The main finding of the present study is to demonstrate the PDE4D effect on preclinical carotid atherosclerosis. Therefore, their findings in ischemic stroke may not be comparable to our results in IMT and plaque index. We selected rs702553 at the PDE4D gene as the candidate locus based on our previous findings in the young stroke study. This 5' SNP is located in a block that has been associated with a reduced expression of the PDE4D7 isoform in stroke patients. In addition, differential expressions of the PDE4D isoforms have been found during the transformation process of vascular smooth muscle cells and monocytes. These studies give a plausible explanation why the intronic SNP rs702553 may modulate IMT progression and plaque formation. There are several limitations in the present study. First, we only genotyped one SNP at the PDE4D gene and it may not be sufficient to stand for the overall PDE4D genetic effect. Second, the present findings should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size in subgroup analyses. Yet, the current sample size had a statistical power of 0.51-0.95 to detect a genetic effect of odds ratio 2 with disease prevalence ranged from 10% to 30% and an alpha level of 0.011 http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/gpc/. Furthermore, we acknowledged that a significant threshold of nominal p less than 0.05 might lead to false positive results when several phenotypes were tested concurrently. We presented both the nominal p values and the Tukey's ad hoc corrected p values. The significance threshold represented a trade-off between avoidance of false positive associations while taking into account that a set of related phenotypes were tested in the present study. We analyzed both continuous and dichotomized IMT data because a certain threshold may be needed in order to detect the atherogenic effect. There was no consensus on the definition of abnormal IMT values and diverse cutoff points were used in different studies. We selected mean plus one SD as the cutoff level to dichotomize thick and thin IMT to be comparable to a previous study which used per SD difference in IMT values to estimate the atherosclerotic risks. We also divided the plaque index into three risk groups (index = 0, 1-3, \u2265 4) rather than treating it as a continuous variable for two reasons: (1) plaque index is not normally distributed and the majority of our study subjects (>60%) had no plaque, and (2) the size of plaque could be ambiguous under different insonation angles. The present study demonstrates that the rs702553 at the PDE4D gene affects both the IMT progression and plaque formation in the carotid arteries. Men have thicker IMT values, a worse plaque profile, and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Sex may modify the relationships between the PDE4D genes and preclinical atherosclerotic phenotypes. The lack of genetic effect in women warrants further investigation and replication."}, "28851297": {"pmid": "28851297", "pmcid": "PMC5575872", "title": "An A\u03b3-globin G->A gene polymorphism associated with \u03b2039 thalassemia globin gene and high fetal hemoglobin production", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nIncrease of the expression of \u03b3-globin gene and high production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in \u03b2-thalassemia patients is widely accepted as associated with a milder or even asymptomatic disease.

In agreement with the expectation that this mutation alters the LYAR binding activity, we found that the A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) and G\u03b3-globin-XmnI polymorphisms are associated with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells isolated from \u03b2039/\u03b2039 thalassemia patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nAs a potential explanation of our findings, we hypothesize that in \u03b2-thalassemia the G\u03b3-globin-XmnI/A\u03b3-globin-(G->A) genotype is frequently under genetic linkage with \u03b20-thalassemia mutations, but not with the \u03b2+-thalassemia mutation here studied (i.e. \u03b2+IVSI-110) and that this genetic combination has been selected within the population of \u03b20-thalassemia patients, due to functional association with high HbF. Here we describe the characterization of the rs368698783 (+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphism of the A\u03b3-globin gene associated in \u03b2039 thalassemia patients with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells.\n\n", "fulltext": "The \u03b2-thalassemias are relevant hereditary hematological diseases caused by nearly 300 mutations of the \u03b2-globin gene, leading to low or absent production of adult \u03b2-globin and excess of \u03b1-globin content in erythroid cells, causing ineffective erythropoiesis and low or absent production of adult hemoglobin (HbA) [1\u20135]. Increase of the expression of \u03b3-globin genes and high production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in \u03b2-thalassemia patients is widely accepted as associated with a milder or even asymptomatic disease [6\u20138]. In several cases, high HbF expressing \u03b2-thalassemia patients do not need transfusion regimen and, consequently, chelation therapy [6\u20138]. This well recognized finding has prompted researchers to develop efficient HbF inducers for treating \u03b2-thalassemia patients expressing low levels of HbF [9\u201314]. On the other hand, the search for HbF-associated polymorphisms (such as the XmnI, BCL11A and MYB polymorphisms) [15\u201319] has recently gained great attention, in order to stratify \u03b2-thalassemia patients with respect to expectancy of the first transfusion, need for annual intake of blood, response to HbF inducers (the most studied of which is hydroxyurea) [20\u201322]. In consideration of the fact that several HbF-related polymorphisms probably act in synergy, the interest in finding novel HbF-related genetic biomarkers has remained high. This field of investigation, in addition to a clear interest in diagnostics and prognostics, might bring novel therapeutic options, in the case the polymorphism(s) is (are) associated with novel therapeutic markers. This field of research has identified several direct or indirect transcriptional repressors of \u03b3-globin gene expression such as BCL11A, KLF1, MYB, Oct-1 [16\u201319]. In a recent paper Ju et al. identified a putative novel nuclear protein repressor of \u03b3-globin gene transcription, LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone). The LYAR DNA-binding motif (GGTTAT) was identified by performing CASTing (cyclic amplification and selection of targets) experiments. Results of EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays confirmed that LYAR binds a DNA region corresponding to the 5\u2032-untranslated region of the A\u03b3-globin gene. Ju et al. formally demonstrated that LYAR is a strong repressor of human fetal globin gene expression in both K562 cells and primary human adult erythroid progenitor cells. Interestingly, LYAR was found to directly interact also with the methyltransferase PRMT5 which triggers the histone H4 Arg3 symmetric dimethylation (H4R3me2s) mark. Altogether, these data indicate that LYAR acts as a novel transcription factor that binds the \u03b3-globin gene, and is essential for silencing the \u03b3-globin gene. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of genetic variants in \u03b2-thalassemia patients potentially affecting the LYAR binding site and the possible association with the most common HbF-associated polymorphism, the XmnI polymorphism [18, 24, 25]. To this aim we focused our attention on \u03b2-thalassemic patients from the north-west Mediterranean area, in particular those carrying the \u03b2039 and \u03b2+IVSI-110 thalassemia mutations, allowing to compare \u03b20- and \u03b2+-genotypes. The genomic DNA from these patients was studied by full sequencing of both the G\u03b3- and A\u03b3-globin genes. A total of 75 \u03b2-thalassemia patients were recruited for this study, including 31 \u03b2039/\u03b2039, 33 \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-110, 9 \u03b2+IVSI-110/\u03b2+IVSI-110, one \u03b20IVSI-1/\u03b2+IVSI-6 and one \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-6 patient. The \u03b2-thalassemia patients have been recruited at Ferrara Hospital and Rovigo Hospital. The Declaration of Helsinki was followed for the collection of blood samples from \u03b2-thalassemia patients; furthermore, specific approvals by the Ethical Committees of Ferrara Hospital and Rovigo Hospital were obtained. All the \u03b2-thalassemia patients duly signed the informed consent form before blood sampling. The genomic DNA from \u03b2-thalassemia patients was extracted from 500\u00a0\u03bcL of whole blood using the QIAamp\u00ae DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described in Bianchi et al.. PCR amplification of \u03b2-, A\u03b3- or G\u03b3-globin genes and DNA sequencing methods used in this study have been previously described by Bianchi et al.. The nucleotide sequences of the PCR primers are reported in Table 1. BMR Genomics (Padua, Italy) performed gene sequencing. The two-phase liquid culture procedure was employed as previously described [26, 27]. The erythroid differentiation status of ErPCs was verified analyzing transferrin receptor (TrfR) and glycophorin A (GYPA) expression by FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) using the BD FACScan\u2122 system (Becton, Dickinson & Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and anti-human CD71 (TrfR) FITC-conjugated antibody (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and anti-human CD235a (GYPA) antibody PE-conjugated (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH) as described elsewhere [28, 29]. Production of hemoglobins was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described elsewhere [11, 28]. The results reported in this paper are usually presented as average\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. The one-way ANOVA (ANalyses Of VAriance between groups) software was used for compare statistical differences between groups. The paired t test of the GraphPad Prism Software was used to obtain the p values. Differences were considered statistically significant when p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 (*) and highly significant when p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 (**) [28, 29]. In order to verify whether mutations affecting the LYAR-binding site of the A\u03b3-globin gene are present within our \u03b2-thalassemia patient population, sequencing of the A\u03b3-globin genes was performed using genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 \u03b2-thalassemia patients, including 31 \u03b2039/\u03b2039, 33 \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-110, 9 \u03b2+IVSI-110/\u03b2+IVSI-110, one \u03b20IVSI-1/\u03b2+IVSI-6 and one \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-6 patient. Examples of the sequencing results obtained are shown in Fig. 1a, which indicates that one (G->A) rs368698783 polymorphism was found in position +25 of the A\u03b3-globin gene, modifying the LYAR-binding sequence from 5\u2032-GGTTAT-3\u2032 to 5\u2032-GATTAT-3\u2032. For this reason, we called this mutation rs368698783 A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) (see its location in Fig. 1b). In the examples reported in Fig. 1a, the representative homozygous (G/G), heterozygous (G/A) and homozygous mutated (A/A) genomic sequences are shown. In addition, as indicated in the representative examples shown in Fig. 1a, the G/G genotype is linked to the XmnI(\u2212/\u2212) haplotype; in contrast the G/A and A/A A\u03b3(+25) genotypes are linked to XmnI(\u2212/+) and XmnI(+/+) haplotypes, respectively. Figure 1b shows the location of the mutation within the 5\u2019UTR sequence of the A\u03b3-globin gene and the nucleotide change concerning the 5\u2032-GGTTAT-3\u2032 LYAR binding site proposed by Ju et al. Notably, no other nucleotide variations affecting the LYAR-binding sequence were found in these 75 patients. Moreover, no other mutations were found in the 607\u00a0bp and 613\u00a0bp sequenced regions of the A\u03b3-globin and G\u03b3-globin genes, respectively, with the exception of a 4\u00a0bp deletion residing in the promoter region of the A\u03b3-globin gene (HBG1: g.-225_-222delAGCA), found in three XmnI(\u2212/\u2212), A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/G) \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-110 patients. In 16/75 patients (21%) this A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphism was found in the heterozygous (G/A) state, while the A\u03b3(+25) homozygous (A/A) state was found only in four patients. While we cannot exclude the presence of other mutations in the A\u03b3-globin genes of sub populations of \u03b2-thalassemia patients, we can conclude that the A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) concerning the rs368698783 polymorphism is the most frequent mutation affecting this A\u03b3-globin gene region within our population, well representative of the Mediterranean area. Table 2 shows that in all the patients analyzed the A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) rs368698783 polymorphism is strictly linked to the G\u03b3-XmnI polymorphism. In fact all the 55 G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/\u2212) patients were found to be A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/G). In addition, all the 16 G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/+) patients were found to be A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/A) and the four G\u03b3-XmnI(+/+) patients were found to be A\u03b3(+25 A/A). This very interesting distribution allows to hypothesize that the XmnI polymorphism, when present in this \u03b2-thalassemia patient population, is physically linked to the A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphism. The results shown in Fig. 2 show that only one of the 9 \u03b2+IVSI-110/\u03b2+IVSI-110 patients was found to be G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/+) and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/A) (11.1%). The other patients were G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/\u2212) and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/G) (88.9%). No patients exhibited a G\u03b3-XmnI(+/+) and A\u03b3(+25 A/A) combination. By sharp contrast, in the \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-110 cohort, the G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/+) and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/A) patients were found to be 6 (18.2%), 27 being G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/\u2212) and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/G) (81.8%). Also in this case no patients exhibited a G\u03b3-XmnI(+/+) and A\u03b3(+25 A/A) combination. Finally, in the \u03b2039/\u03b2039 cohort the G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/+) and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/A) patients were found to be 7 (22.6%), 20 being G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/\u2212) and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/G) (64.5%). Unlike the \u03b2+IVSI-110/\u03b2+IVSI-110 and the \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-110 cohorts, four \u03b2039/\u03b2039 patients exhibited a G\u03b3-XmnI(+/+) and A\u03b3(+25 A/A) combination (12.9%). These data, when analyzed together with the data shown in Table 2, support the hypothesis that the G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms might be preferentially linked with the \u03b2039 thalassemia mutation. To verify this hypothesis the family trees of all the available families with \u03b2-thalassemia patients carrying at least one \u03b2039-globin gene were analyzed with respect to \u03b2-globin genes and G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms. Figure 3a shows the family trees of a \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-6, two \u03b2039/\u03b2039 (out of three present in our cohort) and 5 \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-110 patients (out of the 6 available). The results obtained firmly demonstrate that in the \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-6 family (Fe89) the G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms are linked to the \u03b2039 gene (Fig. 3a, upper left side of the panel). In the two families with \u03b2039/\u03b2039 patients (Fig. 3a, upper middle side of the panel), one \u03b2039-globin gene (Fe29) and both \u03b2039-globin genes (Fe77) are associated with the G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms. More importantly, when families with \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-110 were considered, one (Fe11) was not informative (the genome of the mother was not available), while in patients Fe31, Fe34, Fe88 and Fe91 the \u03b2039 genotype was structurally linked to the G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms combination. These polymorphisms were not associated with the \u03b2+IVSI-110 gene, as summarized in Fig. 3b. These data clearly indicate that in the population analyzed the G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms cosegregate with the \u03b2039-globin gene mutation in the majority of the families of compound-heterozygous \u03b20-thalassemia patients. In order to verify possible relationships between the G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms configuration, 30 available \u03b2039/\u03b2039 patients were recruited, peripheral blood isolated, erythroid precursor cells (ErPCs) selected and erythropoietin (EPO)-induced as elsewhere reported [27, 28]. After 7\u00a0days of EPO treatment, the erythroid differentiation was confirmed by benzidine-staining (looking at hemoglobin production) and FACS analysis of transferrin receptor and glycophorin A expression, as reported elsewhere (data not shown). After demonstration that more than 80% of the cells were benzidine, TrfR and GYPA positive, HPLC analysis was performed to quantify fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production. Figure 4 (panels a and b) shows the representative HPLC profile of two ErPC lysates (arrowed in Fig. 4c), displaying a low (Fig. 4a) and high (Fig. 4b) HbF relative production. All the data obtained are shown in Fig. 4c, in which the ErPCs are stratified with respect to the G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms configuration. As clearly evident, a significant correlation can be observed between the G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms configuration and elevated production of HbF. In fact the average HbF production by ErPCs from \u03b2039/\u03b2039, G\u03b3-XmnI(+/+) and A\u03b3(+25 A/A) patients was 66.1 \u00b1 14.1%, a value significantly higher than those found in ErPCs from G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/\u2212) and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/G) or G\u03b3-XmnI(\u2212/+) and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G/A) patients. This finding suggests that G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphisms should be present in both alleles for maximal potentiation of HbF production, even if not \u201cper se\u201d sufficient and probably acting with other \u201cHbF modifiers\u201d, since all the G\u03b3-XmnI(+/+) and A\u03b3(+25 A/A) patients did not carry any detectable alteration of the \u03b1-globin gene asset. In any case, the cellular system here described might help to dissect genetic control of fetal-hemoglobin persistence and disease phenotypes, especially considering the possibility to access cellular biobanks from \u03b2-thalassemia patients stratified with respect to genotype, G\u03b3-XmnI and A\u03b3(+25) polymorphisms, enabling cryopreservation and usage of the cryopreserved and thawed cells for molecular biology studies. Clinical observations have shown that increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate the severity of the disorders of \u03b2-hemoglobin, including \u03b2-thalassemia. High HbF levels are associated with transcriptional effects on the \u03b3-globin genes, which are associated with the biological activity of several transcription repressors, including MYB, BCL11A, Oct-1, KLF1 and others [16\u201319, 31\u201333]. A recent paper has pointed out the attention on a new putative repressor of the \u03b3-globin gene, LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone), recognizing the A\u03b3-globin gene sequence 5\u2032-GGTTAT-3\u2032. Interestingly, several alterations within this consensus sequence for LYAR are associated with a decrease binding efficiency. At present, no extensive analysis of this sequence has been reported in \u03b2-thalassemia patients; no attempts have been made to verify a possible association with the major HbF associated polymorphism, the G\u03b3-globin-XmnI; finally, no extensive analysis has been reported on possible linkage with \u03b20- and \u03b2+-globin gene mutations. In this paper we report the sequencing of the A\u03b3-globin genes performed on genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 \u03b2-thalassemia patients, including 31 \u03b2039/\u03b2039, 33 \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-110, 9 \u03b2+IVSI-110/\u03b2+IVSI-110, one \u03b20IVSI-1/\u03b2+IVSI-6 and one \u03b2039/\u03b2+IVSI-6. The major results of this paper are the following: (a) a G->A mutation at the level of the rs368698783 polymorphism is present in \u03b2-thalassemia patients in the 5\u2019UTR sequence (+25) of the A\u03b3-globin gene, affecting the LYAR binding site 5\u2032-GGTTAT-3\u2032 sequence (Fig. 1); (b) no other mutations of the LYAR binding site were found; (c) this A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) polymorphism is in complete linkage disequilibrium with a promoter variant of the G\u03b3-globin-gene (the XmnI polymorphism, rs7482144, C->T); (d) the A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) and G\u03b3-globin-XmnI polymorphisms are linked with the \u03b2039-globin gene, but not with the \u03b2+IVSI-110-globin gene (Figs. 2 and 3). Further genetic analysis in different \u03b2-thalassemia patient population is necessary (a) to extend this specific finding to other \u03b20-thalassemia mutations and (b) to verify the link of A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) and G\u03b3-globin-XmnI (C->T) polymorphisms with the \u03b2039-globin gene in a statistically more significant number of patients. It is interesting to note that the A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) rs368698783 polymorphism is expected to deeply alter the LYAR binding activity, thereby activating the A\u03b3-globin gene. One possibility, which deserves to be verified in further studies, is that rs368698783, rather than the XmnI polymorphism, could be the physiologically (and even clinically) active variant in hemoglobinopathy patients carrying haplotypes including the XmnI(+) allele. In respect to this point, our last conclusion is that the A\u03b3(+25\u00a0G->A) and G\u03b3-globin-XmnI polymorphisms might be associated with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells isolated from the \u03b2039/\u03b2039 thalassemia patients (Fig. 4), in agreement with several studies suggesting the association between XmnI polymorphism and high HbF production [18, 24, 34, 35]. On the other hand, as a potential explanation of our findings, we hypothesize that in \u03b2-thalassemia the G\u03b3-globin-XmnI/A\u03b3-globin-(G->A) genotype is frequently under genetic linkage with \u03b20-thalassemia mutations, but not with the \u03b2+-thalassemia mutation here studied (i.e. \u03b2+IVSI-110). One hypothesis is the very interesting possibility that this genetic combination has been selected within the population of the \u03b20-thalassemia patients, due to its functional association with high HbF."}, "20534142": {"pmid": "20534142", "pmcid": "PMC2898666", "title": "Association of obesity risk SNPs in PCSK1 with insulin sensitivity and proinsulin conversion", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nProhormone convertase 1 is involved in maturation of peptides.

One important enzyme that catalyzes this processing is prohormone convertase 1. This protease is selectively expressed in neuronal and endocrine tissues and is active within dense core secretory granules. Among its numerous substrates are key hormones and neuropeptides for the regulation of energy metabolism, including proopiomelanocortin, proglucagon, and proinsulin. Patients with prohormone convertase 1 deficiency (MIM: #600955), a rare monogenic disease, suffer from childhood obesity, small intestinal absorptive dysfunction and various endocrine disturbances. They develop hypoadrenalism, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and abnormal glucose homeostasis with elevated proinsulin levels due to insufficient prohormone processing. Genome-wide linkage studies identified a genomic locus on chromosome 5q to be associated with obesity. Among other genes, this locus harbors PCSK1, and associations of two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this gene (rs6232 and rs6235, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 5.4% and 27.3%, respectively) with obesity were reported. Since prohormone convertase 1 is involved in proinsulin conversion and thereby in insulin maturation as well as in body weight regulation, the present study examined the association of the putatively obesity-related SNPs rs6232 and rs6235 in PCSK1 with the prediabetic traits insulin resistance, \u03b2-cell dysfunction, and glucose intolerance. We studied 1498 non-diabetic subjects from southwestern Germany. The participants were selected from the ongoing T\u00fcbingen Family Study which currently includes ~2000 individuals with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Selection was done based on the availability of all phenotype data used for the analyses. Especially proinsulin levels for all time points during the OGTT were not available for all subjects in the cohort. Most (68.5%) of these subjects had a family history of diabetes, i.e., at least one second-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants and the local Ethics Committee approved the protocol. The OGTT revealed that 73.0% of the non-diabetic participants had normal glucose tolerance, 10.0% had impaired fasting glycaemia, 9.6% had impaired glucose tolerance and 7.3% had impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance. DNA from whole blood was isolated using a commercial DNA isolation kit (NucleoSpin, Macherey & Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany). Genotyping was performed using the TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA, USA). The TaqMan genotyping reaction was amplified on a GeneAmp PCR system 7000 and fluorescence was detected on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). The genotyping success rates were 99.0% for rs6232 and 99.1% for rs6235. The genotypes were verified in 50 randomly selected subjects by bidirectional sequencing, and both methods resulted in 100% identical results. Both SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (rs6232 p = 0.1 and rs6235 p = 0. 7). The SNPs were incompletely linked (D' = 0.887, r2 = 0.145). After an overnight fast, subjects ingested a solution containing 75 g glucose at 08:00 hours. Venous blood samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, and plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin concentrations were determined. Clamp-derived insulin sensitivity was determined in a subgroup of 512 subjects by a hyperinsulinemic-eugylcemic clamp with measurement of glucose and insulin. The test was performed as described earlier. Plasma insulin and proinsulin were determined by commercial chemiluminescence assays for ADVIA Centaur (Siemens Medical Solutions, Fernwald, Germany). Blood glucose was measured using a bedside glucose analyzer (glucose oxidase method; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH, USA). The area under the curve (AUC) AUCIns30/AUCGlc30 was calculated as (Ins0 + Ins30)/(Glc0 + Glc30). First-phase insulin was determined from the OGTT as described earlier by calculating 1283 + 1.829 \u00d7 Ins30 - 138.7 \u00d7 Glc30 + 3.772 \u00d7 Ins0. AUC of glucose, insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin during the OGTT were calculated according to the trapezoid method as: 0.5 \u00d7 (c0/2 + c30 + c60 + c90 + c120/2) with c = concentration. HOMAIR was calculated as (Glc0 \u00d7 Ins0 \u00d7 2)/45. Insulin sensitivity during the OGTT was estimated as proposed by Matsuda and DeFronzo: ISI = 10,000/\u221a(Glc0\u00b7Ins0\u00b7Glcmean\u00b7Insmean). Unless otherwise stated, data are given as arithmetic means \u00b1 SEM. Data were logarithmically transformed prior to statistical analysis. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using \u03c72 test. Differences in anthropometrics and metabolic parameters between genotypes were tested using multivariate linear regression analysis. PCSK1 SNP rs6235 and SNP rs6232 were examined under both an additive (add) and a dominant inheritance model (dom). However, only the dominant inheritance model was interpreted for SNP rs6232 because of this SNP's low MAF of 6% (only 5 participants were homozygous for the minor allele). All data were adjusted for gender and age. The glucose concentrations and insulin sensitivity indices were additionally adjusted for BMI, and proinsulin concentrations and insulin secretion parameters were additionally adjusted for OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity index and BMI. Differences with a p-value < 0.05 were considered to indicate nominal associations. After correction for the two unlinked SNPs tested and the endpoints anthropometrics, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity (according to Bonferroni), results with values of p < 0.0085 were considered statistically significant. The JMP 7.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) statistical software package was used. Using two tailed t-test, the study was sufficiently powered (1-beta \u2265 0.8) to detect an effect size of 15% for SNP rs6235 and 22% for SNP rs6232 (dominant inheritance model, p = 0.05). Power calculations were performed using G*power 3.0 software available at http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/aap/projects/gpower/. The observed MAF for SNP rs6235 was 25.8% (reported 27.3%) and for rs6232 6.0% (reported 5.4%). After appropriate adjustment, both minor alleles of the PCSK1 SNPs rs6232 and rs6235 were neither associated with BMI nor with weight-related traits, like waist circumference and total body fat (all p \u2265 0.07, tables 1 + 2). The frequency of obesity (BMI < 30 versus BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2) in our cohort was not influenced by the risk alleles (all p \u2265 0.4). None of the SNPs revealed association with fasting proinsulin concentrations (all p \u2265 0.1, tables 1 + 2). However, upon glucose ingestion, subjects carrying the minor alleles showed an association with higher proinsulin concentrations (rs6232 nominally associated, pdom = 0.0104; rs6235 significantly associated with AUCProins, padd = 0.0018; adjusted effect sizes 10/8%; tables 1 + 2) and nominally lower proinsulin-to-insulin conversion (AUCProins/AUCins) compared to those with the major allele (rs6232, pdom = 0.0094; rs6235, padd = 0.0090; adjusted effect sizes 21/8%; tables 1 + 2, figure 1A+1D) and this finding was consistent when adjusting for insulin sensitivity or not. Both variants were not associated with differences in insulin secretion (all indices used p \u2265 0.08, tables 1 + 2), and SNP rs6235 was furthermore neither associated with glucose nor with insulin levels during the OGTT (all p \u2265 0.2, figure 1B and 1C). In addition to these findings, the minor allele of SNP rs6232, but not that of SNP rs6235, was significantly associated with decreased 120-min blood glucose (pdom = 0.0003, table 1, figure 2) and nominally associated with decreased fasting insulin levels (pdom = 0.0297, table 1). Insulin sensitivity derived from the OGTT was significantly increased (pdom = 0.0010, adjusted effect size 15%, table 1, figure 2) and insulin resistance derived from fasting state (HOMAIR) was accordingly nominally decreased in carriers of the minor allele (pdom = 0.0232, table 1 and figure 2). The effect on OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity remained significant even after adjustment for gender, age, BMI, AUCProins/AUCIns, and first-phase insulin secretion (pdom = 0.0033). To confirm that the association with insulin sensitivity did not solely reflect altered insulin levels due to impaired prohormone processing, we analyzed insulin sensitivity measured by exogenous administration of insulin during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Again, SNP rs6232, but not SNP rs6235 was associated with significantly increased insulin sensitivity (pdom = 0.0047; adjusted effect size 19%; table 1). To analyze subjects with low risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus versus those with a high risk, we stratified for family history of diabetes. This stratification did not produce consistent results, probably due to the limited power of the subgroups. In our cohort, the reported association of the common variants rs6232 and rs6235 within the PCSK1 gene with BMI and obesity could not be replicated. This is most likely explained by the limited power of our study to detect relatively small effect sizes of the SNPs on BMI and obesity. The effect sizes detectable in our study were as small as 15%, and for the established obesity risk locus FTO an effect size of about 10% could be demonstrated. In the present study, we found that the minor alleles of both candidate SNPs in the PCSK1 gene are associated with significantly higher glucose-stimulated proinsulin levels indicating reduced proinsulin conversion, while insulin secretion was unaffected. These findings were not altered by adjustment for insulin sensitivity. Basal proinsulin levels were unaffected by the variants in PCSK1. Thus, under basal conditions the enzyme cleaves sufficient amounts of proinsulin. However, in the state of much higher secretory demands following a glucose load, proinsulin levels and proinsulin-to-insulin ratios were increased in carriers of both SNPs and this points to insufficient insulin maturation. Both SNPs in the PCSK1 gene alter the amino acid sequence of the protein. SNP rs6232 changes asparagine to aspartic acid (N221D) in the catalytic domain and leads to a 10% reduction of activity, while SNP rs6235 substitutes serine by threonine (S690T) without any effect on the enzymatic activity. Reduced enzymatic activity due to SNP rs6232 can plausibly explain this observation, though the mechanism is less clear in the case of the other SNP, rs6235. The substituted amino acid by that variation could possibly influence binding of regulators of the enzyme's activity, its localization within the \u03b2-cell, or the available number of prohormone convertase 1 molecules via altered stability. All these effects could theoretically influence prohormone conversion. Although both PCSK1 SNPs affect proinsulin levels, they do not alter insulin secretion after glucose stimulation. Thus, the enzyme does not represent the rate-limiting step in insulin secretion which is in contrast to SNPs in diabetes risk genes which influence both proinsulin conversion and insulin secretion. Furthermore, the putative obesity risk allele of SNP rs6232 was unexpectedly associated with increased insulin sensitivity (fasting, OGTT-derived, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-clamp derived) and reduced 120-min glucose levels independently of BMI and proinsulin conversion. The similar findings with different independent measurements of insulin sensitivity as well as the inverse influence on 120-min blood glucose argue against a mere statistical type 1 error. Since only SNP rs6232 in the PCSK1 gene, the one that decreases the enzyme's catalytic activity, influences insulin sensitivity, independently of BMI and proinsulin conversion, and since there is a long list of potential substrates of the prohormone convertases, it seems reasonable to speculate that the enzyme also cleaves factors that modulate insulin sensitivity (e.g. BNDF). In most cases, obesity is associated with insulin resistance. However, a proportion of overweight/obese persons display a phenotype of obesity with is metabolically benign and characterized by high insulin sensitivity. Since the minor allele of SNP rs6232 was associated with higher insulin sensitivity in our study and with obesity in a large metaanalysis including more then 13,000 subjects, we hypothesize that this allele may promote a kind of obesity, which is more benign. Increased proinsulin levels are reported to be a marker of insulin resistance. Interestingly, for carriers of PCSK1 SNP rs6232 it is the other way round: Those with higher proinsulin concentrations during the OGTT have also increased insulin sensitivity. Similar findings are reported in another publication where insulin resistance was associated with enhanced proinsulin processing in subjects with normal glucose tolerance. Hence, increased proinsulin concentration can not generally be seen as a marker of insulin resistance. Our study was underpowered to detect the previous reported associations of the PCSK1 variants with obesity. The associations with proinsulin conversion and insulin sensitivity found in this study clearly need replication in other cohorts, in particular, the unexpected association of SNP rs6232 with insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, efforts should also be undertaken to identify prohormone convertase 1 substrates that alter insulin sensitivity and to further characterize these mechanisms. Studies on the molecular level could additionally help to answer the question how PCSK1's SNP rs6235 influences proinsulin levels without changing the enzyme's activity. In conclusion, our data suggest that the common genetic variants rs6232 and rs6235 within PCSK1 determine glucose-stimulated proinsulin conversion, but not insulin secretion. In addition, rs6232, encoding the mutation N221D, influences glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity independently of BMI and proinsulin concentrations."}, "27184800": {"pmid": "27184800", "pmcid": "PMC4894370", "title": "Metallothionein-1 as a biomarker of altered redox metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells exposed to sorafenib", "abstract": "\n\nBackground\nSorafenib, a kinase inhibitor active against various solid tumours, induces oxidative stress and ferroptosis, a new form of oxidative necrosis, in some cancer cells.

In addition to its inhibitory effect on RAF and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) kinases, it is increasingly clear that sorafenib possesses other biochemical activities that might contribute to its anti-oncogenic efficacy. Identification of specific biomarkers that could be used for the analysis of the contribution of each mode of action is needed in order to understand how sorafenib exerts its antioncogenic activity, and to allow for eventual repurposing and personalization of the prescription of this drug in clinics. Recently, we and others reported that sorafenib is an inducer of oxidative stress [4\u20137], eventually leading to the occurrence of a new form of regulated necrosis, called ferroptosis, in various human cancer cell lines established from HCC and other solid tumours [5\u20139]. Ferroptosis is a form of necrosis characterized by membrane lipid peroxidation [10, 11]. Interestingly, the ability of sorafenib to induce ferroptosis is not shared by other, clinically-approved kinase inhibitors, and is therefore probably unrelated to its inhibitory action on its essential target kinases. The ability of sorafenib to induce ferroptosis might be partially explained by its ability to interfere with the function of the Xc(-) membrane transporter, a membrane transporter for the amino-acid cystine, a rate-limiting precursor for the synthesis of Glutathione (GSH). In addition to depleting the intracellular GSH levels, sorafenib increases the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HCC cells [4, 9]. Interestingly, Coriat et al. found high levels of advanced oxidation products of proteins (AOPP), a marker of oxidative stress, in the serum of HCC patients treated with sorafenib. While the findings of Coriat et al. suggest that this new mode of action of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells might be relevant to the clinical setting, AOPP do not constitute a specific marker and their measurement is not easily standardized [12, 13]. The identification of new biomarkers that would directly reflect the activity of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells is therefore awaited. Metallothioneins (MT) are a family of small intracellular proteins that are ubiquitously expressed by eukaryotic cells and are characterized by a common structure and a high content of the amino-acid Cysteine [14, 15]. In humans, MTs are encoded by 17 genes defining four groups (MT1-MT4). The first group, called MT1, is the largest and consists of 13 members. Members of this group are important regulators of the homeostasis of zinc and copper ions, and play a role in the defence mechanisms of eukaryotic cells against heavy metals such as Cadmium. MT1 also represent an important cellular defence against oxidative stress in various cell types. Multiple alterations of the expression of individual isoforms of MT1 have been reported in solid tumours, some of which may be associated with the patient\u2019s prognosis. Individual isoforms of MT1 have also been reported to modulate the response of tumour cells to chemotherapeutic agents [17\u201319]. There is however little literature regarding the regulation and the possible role that MT1 might play in cancer cells exposed to targeted therapies, such as sorafenib. In order to explore the response of HCC cells to sorafenib, we examined the transcriptome of Huh7 cells exposed to sorafenib (10\u00a0\u03bcM, 9\u00a0h) with genome-wide microarrays. Interestingly, of the 35 genes that were found to be overexpressed by more than 3-fold upon sorafenib exposure, six were members of the MT1 family (Fig.\u00a01a, see Additional file 1: Table S1). Quantitative PCR confirmed the induction of these six genes (MT1B, MT1G, MT1E, MT1L, MT1M and MT1H), confirming the results of the microarray (Fig.\u00a01b). Immunoblot analysis also confirmed the induction of MT1 at the protein level (Fig.\u00a01c). These findings prompted us to examine the regulation of MT1 in cancer cells exposed to sorafenib. The analysis of the threshold cycle (Ct) suggested that the MT1G gene was one of the most abundant isoforms of the MT1 family at the mRNA level in Huh7 cells. Since MT1G was also one of the isoforms whose expression was most strongly induced by sorafenib, we centred our analysis on the regulation of this isoform. We examined the effect produced by sorafenib in a panel of cancer cell lines originating from different types of human tumours (Fig.\u00a01d). Sorafenib was found to induce a robust increase in the levels of the mRNA encoding MT1G in the human cell lines Hep3B and BxPC3 established from HCC and Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, respectively (Fig.\u00a01d). In the other cells, the induction was either statistically-significant but of low amplitude (ACHN, NCIH) or absent (HCT116, PANC1, primary human hepatocytes) (Fig.\u00a01d). In each cell line, except for Huh7 cells, we observed that sorafenib had little effect on cell viability. In Huh7 cells, overnight exposure to 10\u00a0\u03bcM sorafenib reduced cell viability by 15\u00a0%, shown by trypan blue exclusion. The loss of viability never exceeded 5\u00a0% in the other cell lines (data not shown). The effect of sorafenib on MT1G mRNA was therefore unrelated to its effect on cell viability. In Huh7 cells, the induction of the MT1G mRNA was robust, and the effect produced by sorafenib was even superior to that of ZnCl2, the inducer of reference of MT1, in terms of potency for the induction of MT1G (Fig.\u00a01e). A similar pattern of induction was found with the MT1B mRNA (see Additional file 1: Figure S1). We wondered whether other chemical inhibitors of kinases, applied at pharmacological concentrations, would induce an increase in the expression levels of MT1G mRNA (Fig\u00a01f). The following chemical inhibitors were applied to Huh7 cells: erlotinib (1\u00a0\u03bcM), directed against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), vemurafenib (10\u00a0\u03bcM), directed against the BRAF kinase, selumetinib (1\u00a0\u03bcM), directed against the kinases MEK1/2, and rapamycin (1\u00a0\u03bcM), directed against the kinase mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). None of these inhibitors increased the expression of MT1G in Huh7 cells (Fig.\u00a01f). In order to explore the possibility that oxidative stress might play a role in the overexpression of MT1 induced by sorafenib, Huh7 cells were treated with deferoxamine (DFX), an iron chelator reported to protect cancer cells from oxidative stress and ferroptosis by preventing the formation of potent oxidants [5, 10] before being exposed to sorafenib (Fig.\u00a02a). We found that DFX reduced the levels of MT1G mRNA in Huh7 cells exposed to sorafenib (10\u00a0\u03bcM, 18\u00a0h) (Fig.\u00a02a). In order to directly address the possibility that sorafenib might regulate the levels of MT1G via its ability to interfere with the transport of the amino-acid cystine, we preincubated Huh7 cells with N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC), a chemical precursor of cysteine and a potent antioxidant, before treatment with sorafenib (Fig.\u00a02b). We found that NAC radically prevented the increase in MT1G expression induced by sorafenib (Fig.\u00a02b). Comparable results were obtained with MT1B (see Additional file 1: Figure S2). In order to further examine the impact of cystine transport inhibition on the regulation of MT1G, we applied sulfasalazine, a chemical inhibitor of the membrane transporter Xc(-) structurally-unrelated to sorafenib to Huh7 cells. Sulfasalazine increased MT1G mRNA levels at a pharmacologically-active concentration of 300\u00a0\u03bcM, an effect that was blocked by NAC (Fig.\u00a02c). These findings pointed to oxidative stress and cysteine metabolism as playing a possible role in the regulation of MT1 gene expression in cancer cells exposed to sorafenib. In order to identify the minimal region of MT1G promoter able to confer sorafenib inducibility, four constructs encompassing various portions of the MT1G promoter were introduced upstream of the gene encoding the enzyme luciferase. Each reporter construct was transfected into Huh7 cells, and cells were subsequently exposed to sorafenib (Fig.\u00a03a). All constructions encompassing 133 nucleotides upstream of the transcription starting site conferred a strong, close to 10-fold inducibility by sorafenib (Fig.\u00a03a). Interestingly, this region of the promoter contains an Antioxidant Response Element (ARE). We verified that this sequence confers redox control over the transcription of the MT1G gene by testing the effect of NAC on luciferase activity measured with the 1-133 construct (Fig.\u00a03b). Addition of NAC abolished the increase in Luciferase activity observed with sorafenib on the 1-133 construct, showing a redox-dependent regulation of this region of the MT1G promoter. Antioxidant Response Elements (ARE) are cis-acting elements that are recognized by the transcription factor NRF2, reported to play an essential role in the coordination of the transcriptional response of eukaryotic cells exposed to conditions of oxidative stress. Interestingly, sorafenib greatly increased the expression levels of NRF2 in Huh7 cells, and NAC abolished this increase (Fig.\u00a03c). In order to definitely establish the role of NRF2 in the regulation of the MT1G gene in cells exposed to sorafenib, we used RNA interference against NRF2. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against NF2E2 was applied to Huh7 cells and was found to reduce the levels of NRF2 to 50\u00a0% of its control values (data not shown). Compared to control conditions, it prevented the induction of MT1G observed upon exposure of Huh7 cells to sorafenib (10\u00a0\u03bcM, 18\u00a0h) (Fig.\u00a03d). The findings demonstrated a NRF2-dependent regulation of the transcription of the MT1G gene in cancer cells exposed to sorafenib. In order to explore the significance of MT1 induction in cancer cells exposed to sorafenib, we knocked-down the expression of MT1G in Huh7 cells (Fig.\u00a04a). A siRNA that targets MT1G was found to abolish the induction of the corresponding mRNA in Huh7 cells exposed to sorafenib (Fig.\u00a04a). In the corresponding conditions, we did not detect any effect of MT1G on the expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, reflecting the impact of sorafenib on the RAF kinases (Fig.\u00a04b). We also did not find any difference in the expression levels of the protein PCNA (Proliferating cell nuclear antigen) or caspases, suggesting that neither cell proliferation nor apoptosis levels were significantly impacted by MT1G (Fig.\u00a04b, data not shown). A direct measurement of the levels of ferroptosis induced by sorafenib, performed by comparing the % LDH released in control- or siMT1G-treated Huh7 cells also failed to reveal any significant difference (Fig.\u00a04c). Cells with low levels of MT1G also displayed similar properties in clonogenic growth upon exposure to increasing concentrations of sorafenib (Fig.\u00a04d), further suggesting the lack of an important modulatory effect of MT1G on the response of these cells to sorafenib. In order to explore the clinical relevance of our findings, we carried out short-term culture of tumour explants prepared from five HCC tumours (Fig.\u00a05a). Tumour samples were obtained from five patients undergoing surgical resection with curative intent (see Additional file 1: Table S2). The tumours were prepared as thin slices and maintained for 18\u00a0h in the presence of sorafenib in order to examine its effect on MT1G mRNA expression levels. A more than two-fold increase in MT1G mRNA upon exposure to sorafenib (10\u00a0\u03bcM, 18\u00a0h) was seen in two out of the five HCC tumours (Fig.\u00a05a). Next, we measured the protein levels of MT1 in the serum of two cohorts of patients with HCC. The clinical characteristics of the patients are presented in the Additional file 1: Table S3. The first cohort consisted of 20 patients with HCC treated with sorafenib (Fig.\u00a05b). For each patient, serum samples were obtained before and 4 to 24\u00a0weeks after the onset of treatment with sorafenib. Using an ELISA kit that measures the presence of all isoforms of MT1, we found that serum levels of MT1 significantly increased in the serum of patients with HCC treated with sorafenib (median value before sorafenib: 1225\u00a0pg/mL; median value after sorafenib: 1353\u00a0pg/mL, p\u2009<\u20090.05 using paired Wilcoxon test). At the individual level, 7 out of the 20 patients in this exploratory cohort presented a more than three-fold increase in MT1 upon sorafenib treatment. In order to examine the possibility that the induction of MT1 might partially reflect the exposure of tumour cells to sorafenib, we examined the serum trough concentration of sorafenib measured in individual patients (Fig.\u00a05c). Serum concentrations of sorafenib were highly heterogeneous among the patients, with a more than 80-fold difference between the minimum and the maximum concentrations (min. concentration: 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM; max.: 41.3\u00a0\u03bcM; median: 7.1\u00a0\u03bcM). However, we found no significant difference in terms of induction of MT1 in the population with low concentrations of sorafenib (i.e. the patients with serum concentrations below the median) and the population with high concentrations of sorafenib (i.e. above the median): in these two groups, the median values calculated for the ratio MT1 after/before sorafenib were 2.05 and 1.22, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.40 using Mann-Whitney). To examine the clinical impact of MT1, serum levels of MT1 and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analysed in a second cohort of 55 patients with HCC treated with sorafenib. We performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis comparing PFS and OS in the groups with the lowest and highest induction of MT1 upon sorafenib treatment (based on the calculation of the ratio of MT1 before/MT1 after sorafenib treatment, and using the median value as cut-off) (Fig.\u00a05d, e). This analysis revealed that the group of patients presenting with the highest induction of MT1 had a tendency toward a reduced PFS compared to the group with the lowest induction (Median PFS: 93\u00a0days vs 136\u00a0days, p\u2009=\u20090.08 using Log-rank test, Fig.\u00a05d). Strikingly, the group of patients presenting with the highest induction of MT1 had a significantly reduced OS compared to the group with the lowest induction (Median overall survival: 237\u00a0days vs 456\u00a0days, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.05 using Log-rank test) (Fig.\u00a05e). No statistically-significant difference were found between the two groups in terms of clinical characteristics (Age, Sex, Child Pugh score, etiology of cirrhosis, or presence of metastasis) (data not shown). We concluded that high induction of MT1 in the serum was indicative of poor prognosis in HCC patients treated with sorafenib. In the present study, we identify MT1 as a potential new biomarker reflecting the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells. We confirm and extend the conclusions of the previous studies that revealed that sorafenib is able to induce oxidative stress in various cancer cells, in vitro and in animal models [4\u20139]. Using a combination of pharmacological and molecular approaches we showed that the transcription factor NRF2, an essential regulator of redox metabolism in eukaryotic cells, is activated upon exposure of cancer cells to sorafenib. We identified a region of 133\u00a0bp, located immediately upstream of the transcription start site in the promoter of MT1G, that constitutes the minimal region able to confer transcriptional inducibility by sorafenib. This region of the promoter contains an ARE, known to constitute a recognition site for NRF2 [21, 22]. In full agreement with these observations, we showed that pharmacological anti-oxidants, such as NAC, or the knock-down of NRF2 prevented the induction of MT1G induced by sorafenib. Interestingly, we observed no induction of MT1G in primary human hepatocytes, and a striking specificity was also observed when sorafenib was compared with a panel of other clinically-approved kinase inhibitors in terms of ability to induce MT1G. Our study therefore identifies MT1G as a gene whose expression levels reflect the specific effect of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells. Redox metabolism of cancer cells is an essential facet of tumour physiology and a major determinant of cancer cell fate during tumour development and in the therapeutic context [24\u201326]. The NRF2 transcription factor is an essential coordinator for the regulation of the expression of the main genes and molecules with antioxidant function in eukaryotic cells. Exome sequencing of human HCC tumours revealed the presence of somatic mutations that activate NRF2 in a substantial fraction of HCC [27\u201329]. Recently, the NRF2 status was directly reported to modulate the response of HCC cells to sorafenib. In HCC cells with low levels of NRF2 achieved through RNA interference, sorafenib was found to induce ferroptosis with a higher efficacy. These findings suggest that the NRF2 status could be an important determinant of the response of sorafenib, though it is presently partially unclear which target genes could mediate this effect of NRF2. In the present study, we did not observe a modulatory role of MT1G on the clonogenic growth of HCC cells or their susceptibility to ferroptosis, a new form or regulated oxidative necrosis. At this stage, it must however be pointed out that functional redundancy between the isoforms of MT1, and the choice of the genetic background used to explore the role of MT1G may explain the lack of a phenotype. More studies are required to address the role of MT1 in solid tumours, especially in the context of therapeutic targeting. Our analyses performed using tumour explants and serum samples obtained from cancer patients treated with sorafenib demonstrate the clinical applicability of MT1 as a biomarker. Compared to the previous report by Coriat et al. presenting a first clinical analysis centred on the measurement of serum levels of AOPP, our study brings three important additional pieces of information: i) Firstly, the measurement of MT1 provides a more specific and standardizable analysis for the study of the effects of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells than AOPP; ii) Secondly, our study highlights the existence of important individual heterogeneity in terms of the ability of sorafenib to activate the transcription of the MT1 genes. Tumour-intrinsic determinants at least partially account for this heterogeneity, since we observed that human cancer cell lines and individual tumour explants present great differences in their induction of MT1G mRNA upon exposure to sorafenib. Based on our results demonstrating the role of oxidative metabolism in the regulation of MT1G, it is tempting to speculate that this patient heterogeneity might at least partially reflect individual differences in the effects of sorafenib on the oxidative metabolism of cancer cells in different tumours. Whether these differences are related to tumour genotype and the presence of somatic mutations of NRF2 [27\u201329] is an interesting possibility, but further studies are required to address these possibilities; iii) thirdly, HCC patients with the highest induction of MT1 have reduced overall survival under sorafenib treatment, suggesting the possibility that the alteration of the redox metabolism of cancer cells might be detrimental to HCC patients receiving sorafenib. These conclusions might at first-look appear to be in contrast with the work by Coriat et al. and the in vitro studies that recently highlighted the remarkable ability of sorafenib to induce ferroptosis [5\u20137]. A possible explanation might be that the serum levels of AOPP and the markers of ferroptosis reflect intense oxidative damage induced by sorafenib, while the present study explored the transcriptional regulation of MT1 in cancer cells, and therefore the impact of sorafenib at lower, sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Whether such an effect of sorafenib could limit its anti-oncogenic activity, perhaps by activating specific oncogenic signal transduction cascades in tumour cells [30, 31], is an interesting possibility that deserves further study. Our findings further establish the remarkable ability of sorafenib to alter the redox metabolism of\u00a0some, but not all cancer cells. We show that MT1 constitute a biomarker adapted for exploring the impact of sorafenib on the redox metabolism of cancer cells. A list of all cancer cell lines and primary cells used in this manuscript is provided in a Supplementary Materials and methods section [see Additional file 2]. Sorafenib and all kinase inhibitors were purchased from Selleck chemicals. Samples were prepared from 500\u00a0ng total RNA using the GeneChip WTPLUS Reagent kit protocol and hybridized on Affymetrix four-array strips (HuGene 2.1 ST array strips). After hybridization (19\u00a0h at 48\u00a0\u00b0C) on the Affymetrix GeneAtlas hybridization station, strips were washed and imaged on the GeneAtlas imaging station. Data were normalized using the expression Console software using default RMA-sketch normalization. Normalized files were analyzed using TAC software (Affymetrix) with default settings. A summary of the results is presented in Additional file 1: Table S1. Small interfering RNA directed against MT1G, NFE2L2 and silencer negative control were purchased from Life technologies and were transfected using the siPORT-neoFX reagent (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The sequence of the siRNA targeting MT1G was 5\u2032-GCUCCCAAGUACAAAUAGAtt-3\u2032 and was specific to this isoform. DNA constructs encompassing various portions of the human MT1G promoter (position -1000 to -28 from the transcription starting site) were inserted in the pGL3-Basic vector, encoding firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase (Promega). Transfection was performed using the Genjet reagent, as indicated by the provider (Tebu-Bio). Luciferase activity was measured on a CentroLB 960 Microplate Luminometer (Berthold). All values were normalized according to the protein concentration of the extracts, and a fold induction was calculated by comparing control vs sorafenib conditions. We have previously reported the use of short-term culture of tumour explants for the exploration of the individual sensitivity of HCC tumours to sorafenib. Tumour samples were obtained from five patients undergoing surgical resection with curative intent performed between January 2015 and July 2015 in Amiens University Hospital (France). The corresponding protocol was approved by the Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Nord-Ouest (CPP NO 2009/14). Patient consent was obtained for the use of resected tumours. The summary of the tumour characteristics can be found in the Additional file 1: Table S2. Frozen serum samples from two cohorts of patients with HCC receiving sorafenib were used in this study. Details regarding the patients recruited can be found in a previous study and in the Additional file 2 and Additional file 1: Table S3. Serum levels of MT1 were determined using a sandwich-based ELISA kit (Cusabio, CSB-E09060h). Student\u2019s t-test was used for the interpretation of the experiments performed on cells. Paired Wilcoxon test, Mann-Whitney test, and Kaplan Meier were used as indicated for analyses performed on the patient cohorts. In each case, a value of p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered as threshold for significance. This study was conducted in compliance with the French legislation and the declaration of Helsinki regarding ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. The use of surgically-resected tumours for research purposes in the laboratory of Biochemistry of the University Hospital of Amiens was approved by the Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes Nord-Ouest (CPP NO ref. 2009/14). No samples were obtained from any patients that were minor or physically or mentally unable to understand and give their consent to the use of surgical samples.

MYC overexpression in B-NHL is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis. Although genomic studies suggest a link between MYC overexpression and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling molecules in B-NHL, signaling pathways essential to Myc-mediated B-cell transformation have not been fully elucidated. We utilized intracellular phospho-flow cytometry to investigate the relationship between Myc and BCR signaling in pre-malignant B cells. Utilizing the E\u03bc-myc mouse model, where Myc is overexpressed specifically in B cells, both basal and stimulated BCR signaling were increased in precancerous B lymphocytes from E\u03bc-myc mice compared to wild-type littermates. B cells overexpressing Myc displayed constitutively higher levels of activated CD79\u03b1, Btk, Plc\u03b32, and Erk1/2. Notably, Myc overexpressing B cells maintained elevated BCR signaling despite treatment with ibrutinib, a Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, PI3K/Akt pathway signaling was also increased in E\u03bc-myc B cells, and this increase was partially suppressed with ibrutinib. Additionally, experiments with Btk-null B cells revealed off-target effects of ibrutinib on BCR signaling. Our data show that in pre-malignant B cells, Myc overexpression is sufficient to activate BCR and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways and further enhances signaling following BCR ligation. Therefore, our results indicate precancerous B cells have already acquired enhanced survival and growth capabilities prior to transformation, and that elevated MYC levels confer resistance to pharmacologic inhibitors of BCR signaling, which has significant implications for B-NHL treatment.\n", "fulltext": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a spectrum of morphologically, phenotypically, and genetically distinct lymphomas with ~85% of B lymphocyte lineage. Overexpression of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC is associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor overall survival, regardless of the B-NHL subtype (1\u20134). Dysregulated Myc expression in primary murine B cells drives cellular transformation and lymphomagenesis and is necessary for both human and murine lymphoma maintenance (5\u20137). Signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR) in the absence of antigenic stimulation is important for normal B cell differentiation and survival (8, 9). Additionally, ligation of the BCR induces a cascade of phosphorylation events and activation of multiple kinases, including the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK), leading to MAPK and NF-\u03baB activation and a gene expression signature enriched for MYC-induced genes (10\u201312). Independently of BTK, SYK can activate an alternative pro-survival pathway through PI3K/AKT (13). Aberrant or chronic BCR signaling is commonly observed in B-NHL and contributes to lymphoma growth and survival, but the mechanisms for this remain incompletely understood (14\u201316). Targeting the BCR pathway by silencing signaling proteins has deleterious effects on lymphoma cells with chronic BCR activation (14), and pharmacologic inhibition of BTK by ibrutinib has shown encouraging results in the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-NHL (17\u201319). Recent studies in human lymphoma cell lines identified components of the BCR pathway as possible MYC transcriptional targets (20). Additionally, the MYC-regulated miRNA cistron miR-17~92 was reported to influence BCR signaling in lymphoma cell lines (21). Although these studies suggest a link between MYC overexpression and BCR signaling in lymphoma, the relationship between MYC and BCR signaling in non-transformed B lymphocytes was unknown. Therefore, we investigated BCR signaling in pre-malignant B cells. We determined the levels of activated forms of multiple components of the BCR signaling pathway were increased both at rest and following ligation of the BCR in primary B cells overexpressing Myc. Myc overexpressing B cells were less sensitive to Btk inhibition by ibrutinib, and off-target effects of ibrutinib were also identified. These studies highlight the relationship between Myc overexpression and pro-survival signaling, identify a means by which Myc drives lymphomagenesis, and provide insight into treatment strategies for patients with lymphoma expressing high levels of MYC protein. To investigate the influence of Myc on BCR signaling prior to cellular transformation, spleens were harvested from E\u03bc-myc transgenic mice, which overexpress Myc specifically in B cells ((5) and Supplemental Fig S1), before the development of lymphoma. Spleens from wild-type littermates served as controls. Basal activity of BCR signaling proteins was interrogated in IgM+, CD19+ splenic B cells by intracellular phospho-flow cytometry (schematic Fig 1A). Unstimulated B lymphocytes from E\u03bc-myc mice demonstrated significantly increased levels of phospho-Btk (36% elevated, p=0.0179), phospho-Plc\u03b32 (48% and 40% elevated at Y759 and Y1217, p=0.0013 and 0.0050, respectively), and phospho-Erk1/2 (56% elevated, p=0.0007) compared to wild-type B cells (Fig 1B). Levels of phospho-CD79\u03b1 and phospho-Syk were also increased in unstimulated E\u03bc-myc splenic B cells (28% and 9% elevated, respectively; Fig 1B), but differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.07 and p=0.12, respectively). Therefore, Myc overexpression alone increased basal signaling of several proteins in the BCR pathway in primary, non-transformed B cells. Ligation of the BCR activates signaling of the pathway above basal levels (22). To determine whether Myc expression affects activated BCR signaling, we ligated the BCR with anti-IgM F(ab\u2019)2. At intervals after BCR ligation, proteins in the BCR pathway were evaluated by intracellular phospho-flow cytometry. We detected robust activation of proteins that are activated early following IgM ligation (e.g., CD79\u03b1, Syk, Btk, and Plc\u03b32) in both E\u03bc-myc and wild-type splenic B cells (Fig 1C). Although the activation curves were similar in E\u03bc-myc and wild-type cells, with 2\u20134 fold increases in each phospho-protein following ligation of the BCR, there were notable differences. Specifically, although basal levels of activated CD79\u03b1 were statistically equivalent in E\u03bc-myc and wild-type B cells, there was a sharp increase in phospho-CD79\u03b1 in E\u03bc-myc cells that significantly exceeded that of wild-type cells at 5 (p=0.0041), 10 (p=0.0115), 30 (p=0.0065), and 60 minutes (p=0.0055) following BCR ligation (upper left, Fig 1C). Phospho-CD79\u03b1 peaked within 30 minutes in E\u03bc-myc B cells at a level 2.8-fold above the baseline. In contrast, phospho-CD79\u03b1 peaked later in wild-type B cells, achieving a level 2.6-fold above baseline 60 minutes after BCR ligation (upper left, Fig 1C). Additionally, although activation of Syk in E\u03bc-myc B cells paralleled that of wild-type B cells (middle left, Fig 1C), the levels of activated downstream proteins phospho-Btk (bottom left, Fig 1C) and phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y1217) (middle right, Fig 1C) started and remained significantly higher in E\u03bc-myc B cells over 60 minutes after BCR ligation. Levels of phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y759) were slightly higher in E\u03bc-myc cells until 30 minutes following BCR ligation and then decreased at a faster rate than wild-type cells (upper right, Fig 1C). Together these data indicate Myc overexpression altered the activation of critical BCR signaling proteins in non-transformed B cells following BCR ligation resulting in augmentation of BCR signaling. Although phospho-Erk1/2 levels in E\u03bc-myc B cells were constitutively higher (52\u201381% higher) than in wild-type cells, we did not detect an expected increase in phospho-Erk levels following BCR ligation in either genotype (bottom right, Fig 1C). Other known BCR downstream effector proteins, including NF-\u03baB and p38MAPK, exhibited similar results (Supplemental Fig S2). Because multiple signals converge on downstream effector proteins, we postulated their activation is likely to be tightly regulated by phosphatases and thus, more difficult to detect. To further investigate Erk phosphorylation, we added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) after BCR ligation to transiently inactivate protein tyrosine phosphatases and allow accumulation of phosphorylated Erk. Phospho-Erk1/2 levels increased nearly 5-fold in both E\u03bc-myc and wild-type splenic B cells 10 minutes after BCR ligation and addition of H2O2 (top left, Fig 2A). Phosphatases typically recover from H2O2 inactivation resulting in reduced phospho-protein levels by 30 minutes (23). However, we observed in repeated experiments phospho-Erk1/2 levels in E\u03bc-myc B cells declined more slowly compared to wild-type B cells in the presence of H2O2, remaining above baseline and nearly 50% higher than wild-type levels 30 minutes after BCR ligation. Therefore, Erk1/2 activity is differentially regulated in B cells that overexpress Myc, resulting in constitutively higher phospho-Erk1/2 levels and sustained signaling following BCR ligation. We also evaluated other proteins in the BCR signaling pathway in the presence of H2O2. Addition of H2O2 alone caused minimal accumulation of phosphorylated proteins in either genotype. However, following BCR ligation, H2O2 augmented activation of CD79\u03b1, Syk, Btk, and Plc\u03b32, which peaked by 10 minutes and returned to near baseline levels by 30 minutes in both genotypes, and again levels were significantly higher in E\u03bc-myc B cells. For example, following BCR ligation and addition of H2O2, phospho-CD79\u03b1 and phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y759) levels in E\u03bc-myc B cells increased 10- and 11-fold, respectively, as compared to 7- and 9- fold in wild-type B cells and resulted in significantly higher peak phospho-protein levels at 10 minutes [p=0.0013 for CD79\u03b1 and p=0.0150 for Plc\u03b32 (Y759)] (middle, Fig 2A). Although phospho-Syk and phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y1217) levels increased 5- and 7-fold, respectively in B cells of both genotypes 10 minutes after BCR ligation and addition of H2O2 (bottom, Fig 2A), peak phospho-protein levels were significantly higher in E\u03bc-myc B cells compared to wild-type [p=0.0012 for Syk and p=0.0154 for Plc\u03b32 (Y1217)]. Additionally, the phospho-Btk levels were significantly higher in E\u03bc-myc cells (p=0.0001) 10 minutes after BCR ligation and H2O2 addition (upper right panel, Fig 2A), even though phospho-Btk increased nearly 25-fold in wild-type B cells compared to 11-fold in E\u03bc-myc cells. Histograms of fluorescence in B cells from a representative experiment illustrate increased phospho-protein levels 10 minutes after BCR ligation and/or H2O2 addition by a shift of the curves to the right and return toward baseline by 30 minutes (Fig 2B). These data provide additional evidence that untransformed Myc overexpressing B cells have increased basal BCR signaling and that Myc further increases BCR signaling upon receptor ligation. Following BCR ligation, Syk phosphorylates tyrosine-551 of Btk, which prompts autophosphorylation of tyrosine-223 in Btk (24). Ibrutinib covalently binds Btk near the ATP binding domain to irreversibly inhibit Btk activity (25). Given the robust activation of Btk in E\u03bc-myc B lymphocytes following BCR ligation, we postulated ibrutinib would be a potent inhibitor of Btk activation in B cells that overexpressed Myc. We first evaluated basal levels of phospho-Btk (Y223) in splenic B cells treated with increasing concentrations of ibrutinib. Treatment with ibrutinib induced equivalent dose-dependent decreases in basal levels of phospho-Btk in wild-type and E\u03bc-myc B cells (Fig 3A), with a 38% decrease using 12.5 \u03bcM ibrutinib and a 58% decrease with 62.5 \u03bcM ibrutinib. After BCR stimulation, there was a greater reduction in phospho-Btk levels in E\u03bc-myc B cells compared to wild-type cells, with 12.5 \u03bcM ibrutinib achieving 42% reduction in phospho-Btk in E\u03bc-myc B cells, but only 26% reduction in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, absolute levels of phospho-Btk remained higher in E\u03bc-myc B cells than in wild-type cells over the range of ibrutinib concentrations (Fig. 3B). Notably, the level of phospho-Btk in 12.5 \u03bcM ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc B lymphocytes was analogous to the level of phospho-Btk in untreated wild-type cells 10 minutes after BCR ligation (p = 0.54; Fig. 3B). We also investigated downstream of Btk by assessing basal and BCR stimulated levels of phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y759) and phospho-Erk1/2 in the presence of ibrutinib. Ibrutinib treatment led to dose-dependent decreases in phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y759) in unstimulated B cells and B cells after BCR ligation (Supplemental Fig S3A and B). Ibrutinib did not affect basal levels of phospho-Erk (T203/Y205) even in the presence of H2O2 (Supplemental Fig S3C), but potently reduced stimulated phospho-Erk levels (Supplemental Fig S3D). Importantly, at any concentration of ibrutinib, levels of phospho-Btk, phospho-Plc\u03b32, and phospho-Erk remained higher in E\u03bc-myc B cells than in wild-type. Therefore, Myc overexpression renders B cells relatively resistant to Btk inhibition by ibrutinib. Based on its mechanism of action and reported specificity for Btk inhibition (25), we expected ibrutinib would inhibit Btk phosphorylation and consequently, phosphorylation of downstream components of BCR signaling (e.g., Plc\u03b32 and Erk1/2; Fig 1A). While treatment with ibrutinib (12.5 \u03bcM) reduced phospho-Btk levels in IgM-ligated E\u03bc-myc B cells by 47%, these levels were equivalent to the IgM-stimulated phospho-Btk levels in wild-type B cells that did not receive ibrutinib (MFI 255 versus 194, respectively, p=0.11) (Fig 4A, 3rd bar versus last bar). Ibrutinib (12.5 \u03bcM) had little effect on basal levels of phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y759) in both genotypes (Fig 4B, 0 min DMSO versus 0 min ibrutinib). However, the levels of phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y759) after BCR ligation remained ~50% higher in ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc B cells than ibrutinib-treated wild-type cells (MFI 93 versus 60, respectively, p=0.0016, Fig 4B last two bars), and this level in ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc B cells was analogous to the level of phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y759) in IgM-stimulated wild-type B cells that had not been treated with ibrutinib (MFI 95, p=0.42; Fig 4B, 3rd bar versus last bar). Absolute levels of phospho-Erk and phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y1217) were significantly higher in E\u03bc-myc B cells than in wild-type B cells, but we did not detect an increase in activation following BCR ligation or an effect of ibrutinib in the absence of H2O2 (Fig 4C and Supplemental Fig S4A, respectively). We again utilized H2O2 to better visualize the effects of ibrutinib on phospho-Erk1/2. As we observed previously with addition of H2O2, Erk1/2 activation was detectable 10 minutes after BCR ligation and persisted in E\u03bc-myc cells beyond that in wild-type cells (Fig 4D). Treatment with ibrutinib attenuated activation of Erk1/2 in both genotypes, but phospho-Erk1/2 levels remained higher in the E\u03bc-myc B cells at every time evaluated (Fig 4D, p=0.0008, 0.0522, and 0.0413 at 0, 10, and 30 minutes, respectively). H2O2 also accentuated the differences between E\u03bc-myc and wild-type B cells upon ibrutinib treatment when evaluating Plc\u03b32. Phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y759) in ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc B cells was 1.3-fold and 4.2-fold greater than in ibrutinib-treated wild-type cells at 10 and 30 minutes, respectively, after BCR ligation and addition of H2O2 (p=0.0201 and p=0.0013, respectively, Fig 4E). The absolute levels of phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y759) in ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc B cells were statistically equivalent to levels in wild-type cells that were not treated with ibrutinib (MFI 116000 and 113250, respectively, at 10 min, p=0.39; MFI 34402 and 31520, respectively, at 30 minutes, p=0.28) (Fig 4E, dashed line with square symbol versus solid line with circle symbol). Levels of phospho-Plc\u03b32 (Y1217) also remained higher in E\u03bc-myc cells than in wild-type B cells despite ibrutinib treatment (Supplemental Fig S4B). Thus, as predicted, ibrutinib blunted the phosphorylation of Plc\u03b32 and Erk1/2; however, more complete inhibition was evident in wild-type B cells. We also evaluated the effect of ibrutinib on the BCR pathway upstream of Btk (Fig 1A), originally as a negative control, as ibrutinib is a Btk-specific inhibitor and should not alter signaling upstream of Btk (25). Unexpectedly, in both wild-type and E\u03bc-myc B cells, CD79\u03b1 and Syk phosphorylation was also inhibited by ibrutinib (Fig 5A and 5B). There was little effect on basal levels of phospho-CD79\u03b1 with ibrutinib treatment (Fig 5A, first two bars versus 5th and 6th bars), but a pronounced reduction was evident in BCR stimulated cells (~30% reduction in both genotypes) (Fig 5A, 2nd and 3rd bars versus last two bars). As with Btk, BCR stimulated phospho-CD79\u03b1 levels were similar in ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc B cells and wild-type B cells that were not ibrutinib-treated (Fig 5A, 3rd bar versus last bar, p=0.506). Treatment with ibrutinib (12.5 \u03bcM) reduced basal and BCR-stimulated phospho-Syk levels in both genotypes, with a 48% reduction in phospho-Syk levels in wild-type cells and a 34% decrease in E\u03bc-myc cells 30 minutes after BCR ligation (Fig 5B, 3rd bar versus 7th bar and 4th bar versus last bar, respectively). Dose titration experiments indicated that even 0.0025 \u03bcM ibrutinib caused significant reductions in basal phospho-Syk in wild-type (9.3% reduction, p=0.0263) and E\u03bc-myc B cells (10.3% reduction, p=0.0188) (Supplemental Fig S5A). Higher concentrations of ibrutinib (0.25 \u03bcM for wild-type, p=0.1367 and 0.03125 \u03bcM for E\u03bc-myc, p=0.0044) were required to achieve 10% reductions in phospho-Syk after BCR ligation (Supplemental Fig S5B). These data indicate ibrutinib treatment inhibits more than just Btk activation in B cells. To determine whether ibrutinib inhibits phosphorylation of CD79\u03b1 and Syk directly or by a feedback loop with Btk or downstream effector molecules, we first evaluated total Btk levels in wild-type B cells after ibrutinib treatment. Ibrutinib treatment did not alter total Btk levels in B cells (top panel, Fig 5C). We also evaluated B cells from Btk-null mice, which do not express Btk protein ((26, 27) and Fig 5C, top panel). In BCR ligated Btk\u2212/\u2212 B cells, ibrutinib treatment did not affect phosphorylation of CD79\u03b1 (middle panel, Fig 5C), whereas there was significantly reduced phosphorylation of Syk (bottom panel, Fig 5C). Interestingly, levels of activated CD79\u03b1 and Syk following BCR ligation were significantly higher in Btk\u2212/\u2212 B cells than wild-type B cell controls. In addition, Btk\u2212/\u2212 B cells were more sensitive to Syk inhibition by ibrutinib than wild-type B cells, as evidenced by a 26% reduction in phospho-Syk 10 minutes after ligation of the BCR in ibrutinib-treated Btk\u2212/\u2212 B cells but only 11% reduction in phospho-Syk levels in wild-type B cells (p=0.0015). Additionally, dose-dependent decreases in phospho-Syk levels in Btk\u2212/\u2212 B cells were similar to wild-type and E\u03bc-myc B cells (Supplemental Fig S6A). Finally, Myc levels were evaluated in wild-type and E\u03bc-myc B cells and shown to not be affected by ibrutinib treatment in either genotype (Supplemental Fig S6B), indicating the inhibition of signaling upstream of Btk by ibrutinib was not due to a reduction in Myc. Together these results imply that direct off-target effects are likely responsible for the reduction in phospho-Syk detected in B cells treated with ibrutinib. The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated following ligation of the BCR by cross-talk with kinases such as Syk (Fig 1A and (13)). Thus, we evaluated the effect of Myc overexpression on activation of Akt and ribosomal S6 kinases by evaluating phosphorylation of threonine-308 and serine-473 of Akt and ribosomal protein S6 (S6RP), respectively. In both E\u03bc-myc and wild-type B cells, small increases in phospho-Akt (T308) occurred quickly following BCR ligation (left panel, Fig 6A), and returned to baseline within 30 minutes, whereas no significant changes were detected in phospho-Akt (S473) (middle panel, Fig 6A). Notably, levels of phospho-Akt (T308 and S473) were constitutively higher in E\u03bc-myc B cells compared to wild-type B cells (Fig 6A). Following ligation of the BCR, phosphorylation of S6RP increased similarly in E\u03bc-myc and wild-type B cells over 60 minutes (right panel, Fig 6A), but diverged by 180 minutes, when higher levels of phospho-S6RP were detected in E\u03bc-myc B cells compared to wild-type cells (p=0.0562). Although H2O2 has little direct effect on serine/threonine phosphatases, it can indirectly impact them through upstream tyrosine kinases (28); consequently, we evaluated both phospho-Akt sites following addition of H2O2. Addition of H2O2 immediately after BCR ligation further accentuated the early increase in phospho-Akt (T308) (left panel, Fig 6B) and revealed a BCR ligation-induced increase in phospho-Akt (S473) that was not evident in absence of H2O2 (middle panel, Fig 6B). H2O2 had minimal effect on detection of phospho-S6RP in wild-type B cells, but allowed a slight accumulation of phospho-S6RP in E\u03bc-myc cells (right panel, Fig 6B), suggesting altered regulation of S6-kinases in Myc overexpressing cells. We also assessed whether ibrutinib affected Akt phosphorylation. Treatment with ibrutinib reduced basal and BCR-stimulated phospho-Akt (T308) in E\u03bc-myc and wild-type B cells, but absolute levels were higher in ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc cells than in untreated wild-type cells (left upper panel, Fig 6C). Upon exposure to H2O2, proportionally larger reductions in phospho-Akt (T308) occurred in ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc B cells, but again the levels remained higher in ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc cells compared to wild-type cells that were not treated with ibrutinib (left lower panel, Fig 6C). Phosphorylation of Akt (S473) was not affected by ibrutinib treatment in either genotype in the absence or presence of H2O2 (upper and lower middle panels, Fig 6C). Ibrutinib treatment significantly inhibited basal and BCR-stimulated phosphorylation of S6RP in both E\u03bc-myc and wild-type B cells in the absence (upper right panel, Fig 6C) and presence (lower right panel, Fig 6C) of H2O2. Again, phospho-S6RP levels remained higher in ibrutinib-treated E\u03bc-myc cells than wild-type B cells and were similar to levels in untreated wild-type B cells. Together these data indicate Myc overexpression activates PI3K/Akt signaling and that ibrutinib has previously unappreciated effects beyond Btk inhibition. Myc is required for the growth and survival of B cell lymphomas, and its overexpression is frequently selected for in these malignancies (7). Genetically engineered mice showed Myc overexpression induces B cell transformation, solidifying Myc as a driver of B cell lymphoma (5). However, the cellular mechanisms by which Myc dysregulation induces B cell transformation had not been fully explored. Our study focused on cell signaling and revealed that prior to cellular transformation, Myc overexpression alone led to increased signaling through pro-growth and survival pathways, including the BCR and PI3K/Akt pathways. There was significantly increased basal activation of Btk, Plc\u03b32, Erk1/2, and Akt in non-transformed, primary splenic B cells from E\u03bc-myc mice compared to wild-type littermates. Moreover, our data show these Myc-mediated increases in signaling cannot be fully inhibited with ibrutinib, which has clinical implications. Ligation of the BCR prompts phosphorylation of downstream kinases and effector molecules, such as Syk, Btk, Plc\u03b32, and Erk1/2, as well as components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in normal B lymphocytes (Fig 1A). Following BCR ligation in B cells from E\u03bc-myc mice, we detected more robust activation of CD79\u03b1, Btk, and Plc\u03b32. Additionally, levels of phospho-Erk1/2 and phospho-Akt were constitutively higher in B cells from E\u03bc-myc mice. Increased BCR signaling is reported to contribute to B cell lymphoma development (29). Finally, as evidenced by increased levels of phospho-S6RP 180 minutes after BCR ligation, Myc overexpression led to sustained activity of ribosomal S6-kinases, which are important regulators of cell growth and metabolism. Although we detected high levels of activated Erk1/2 and p38MAPK in B cells from E\u03bc-myc mice, we were unable to detect further activation in either genotype following BCR ligation. Consequently, we utilized H2O2, which allowed phosphorylated proteins to accumulate, and as such, we were able to detect BCR-induced increases in phospho-Erk and phospho-p38MAPK, implying these kinases are tightly regulated. Although phosphatases that regulate upstream proteins in the BCR pathway had rebounded by 30 minutes after H2O2 addition, phospho-Erk1/2 levels remained elevated, suggesting phosphatases that regulate Erk activation are more sensitive to H2O2 inhibition. Furthermore, altered regulation of Erk1/2 activation in E\u03bc-myc B cells allowed for higher basal and more sustained BCR-stimulated Erk signaling. Levels of phospho-p38MAPK were also higher in E\u03bc-myc B cells compared to wild-type. These results are consistent with our previous report that Myc overexpression was sufficient to induce Ras/MAPK signaling (30). Together these data indicate Erk1/2 and p38MAPK are involved in BCR signaling and are regulated by mechanisms that are different than upstream kinases. Activation of BCR signaling leads to a transcriptional program that is enriched for MYC and MYC-induced genes (10, 11). Additionally, genomic studies in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines identified CD79\u03b2 and SYK as potential transcriptional targets of MYC (20), and the MYC-regulated miR-17~92 cluster augments signaling through the BCR in transformed lymphoma cells (21). These reports together with our data suggest a feed-forward loop, whereby MYC expression increases BCR signaling, which further amplifies MYC activation, and so on. Importantly, our data indicate that such a feed-forward mechanism is not dependent on oncogenic transformation, as Myc overexpression alone augmented both basal and stimulated signaling by multiple proteins in the BCR signaling cascade in non-transformed B cells. Aberrant activation of BCR and PI3K/Akt signaling has been demonstrated in B-NHL. Prolonged or continuous signaling via the BCR pathway and reduced sensitivity to negative regulation have been identified in various lymphoid malignancies (14, 16, 31, 32). Our data indicate that elevated Myc levels likely contribute to this increased signaling. Moreover, since inhibition of BCR activation in vitro by genetic or pharmacologic means has proven deleterious to lymphoma growth and survival (14, 16, 33, 34), pharmacologic inhibition has been an attractive prospect for drug development. Indeed, ibrutinib is efficacious in the treatment of indolent B-NHL (17\u201319); however, a subset is refractory to ibrutinib. We determined that hyperactivation of BCR signaling by Myc confers relative resistance to Btk inhibition by ibrutinib. While ibrutinib did reduce phosphorylation and activation of Btk in Myc overexpressing B cells, absolute levels of activated Btk and downstream proteins Plc\u03b32 and Erk1/2 remained higher following ibrutinib treatment than the levels in untreated wild-type B cells. Our studies predict that B-NHL with increased MYC expression may be less likely to respond to ibrutinib specifically and possibly BCR inhibition more generally. While MYC expression in indolent lymphomas is not routinely evaluated, it may be worthwhile if ibrutinib treatment is being considered. Furthermore, although aberrant BCR signaling has been demonstrated in aggressive large cell lymphomas, ibrutinib therapy has not been as successful (17). We postulate that differential responses to ibrutinib treatment may correlate with MYC expression, recognizing that MYC overexpression is associated with more aggressive lymphoma phenotypes. We observed treatment with ibrutinib impaired activation of Btk and downstream signaling molecules, but also reduced activation of upstream signaling proteins CD79\u03b1, Syk, and Akt in both Myc overexpressing and wild-type B cells. These results were unexpected, since ibrutinib is reported to be highly specific for Btk (25, 35). Ibrutinib did not affect SYK phosphorylation in a previous report, but only tyrosine-352 was interrogated (34), whereas SYK activation is complicated by phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues, the roles of which have not been fully elucidated (36, 37). Nevertheless, tyrosine-352 is believed to lie in a regulatory domain, whereas tyrosine-525/526 are in the activation loop and are autophosphorylated upon ligation of the BCR (37), and reportedly are better predictors of SYK activity in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (38). Therefore, we evaluated phosphorylation of the murine homologous residues, tyrosine-519/520. Data showed inhibition of Syk phosphorylation by ibrutinib occurred in Myc overexpressing and wild-type B cells in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was also observed in Btk\u2212/\u2212 B cells, indicating it is an off-target effect rather than the result of a regulatory feedback loop. Therefore, the ibrutinib-mediated reduction in phospho-Akt and phospho-S6RP we detected may be secondary to Syk inhibition, as Syk activates PI3K/Akt signaling following BCR ligation (13). These unexpected findings could provide an alternative explanation for the increased bleeding risk in patients treated with ibrutinib, which has been previously linked to ineffective collagen-evoked signaling in platelets (39, 40). Phosphorylation of SYK (Y525) is associated with platelet activation and thrombus formation in the setting of sheer stress (41). Therefore, inhibition of SYK by ibrutinib may lead to ineffective thrombosis and bleeding. Our results expand understanding of the role of Myc in cell signaling and indicate Myc overexpression alone is sufficient to cause aberrant activation of pro-growth and survival signaling that likely contributes to lymphomagenesis. Our data have significant clinical implications for targeting the BCR pathway in human lymphomas that highly express MYC. Additionally, we showed off-target effects of ibrutinib on Syk that may explain some side effects of ibrutinib therapy. Furthermore, the relative resistance to Btk inhibition by ibrutinib in cells that overexpress Myc suggest MYC expression may serve as a therapeutic biomarker. Male C57Bl/6 E\u03bc-myc mice (5) were mated to C57Bl/6 females to generate transgenic and nontransgenic littermates. C57Bl/6 Btk\u2212/\u2212 mice (26) and C57Bl/6 wild-type controls were provided by Dr. Peggy Kendall (Vanderbilt University Medical Center). Spleens were harvested from mice 4\u20136 weeks of age, prior to lymphoma development. All mouse studies were in accordance with state and federal guidelines and were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The protocol was modified from Irish, et al (42). Briefly, following disaggregation and red blood cells lysis, 1\u00d7107 splenocytes/ml in culture medium were incubated at 37C for 60 minutes. For assessment of upstream BCR signaling proteins, culture medium was DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For Erk, p38MAPK, Akt, and S6RP assessment, FBS was reduced to 2.5% for the 3 hour kinetic experiments or 0% for shorter experiments. BCR signaling was stimulated by ligation of IgM with 10 \u03bcg/ml anti-mouse IgM F(ab\u2019)2 fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For some experiments, splenocytes were pretreated for 1 hour with ibrutinib (Selleckchem) or DMSO (control). In indicated experiments, H2O2 (550 \u03bcM) was added immediately after BCR ligation. Cells were fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde (10 minutes, room temperature) at one time after intervals following IgM ligation. Cells were incubated with anti-IgM and anti-CD19 antibodies, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X (5 minutes, 4C), and then incubated with phospho-specific antibodies in PBS, 3% FBS, 15 mM sodium azide. In some cases unconjugated phospho-specific antibodies were used, followed by AlexaFluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) for 30 minutes at room temperature. For a list of antibodies used see Supplemental Table S1. Fluorescence was measured on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer, and data was analyzed with FlowJo software. Unless otherwise stated, values represent mean \u00b1 SEM, and paired t-test was used for comparisons."}, "28346429": {"pmid": "28346429", "pmcid": "PMC5532072", "title": "Deletion of Endothelial Cell-Specific Liver Kinase B1 Increases Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth via Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor", "abstract": "\nLiver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. It was first identified in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome as a tumor suppressor gene. Whether endothelial LKB1 regulates angiogenesis and tumor growth is unknown. In this study, we generated endothelial cell-specific LKB1-knockout (LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212) mice by crossbreeding vascular endothelial-cadherin-Cre mice with LKB1flox/flox mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was highly co-stained in endothelial cells but not macrophages in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice. Consistently, LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mouse tissues including the lung, skin, kidney, and liver showed increased vascular permeability. Tumors implanted in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice but not macrophage-specific LKB1-knockout mice grew faster and showed enhanced vascular permeability and increased angiogenesis as compared with those implanted in wild-type mice. Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibody but not the isotype-matched control antibody decreased endothelial-cell angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, LKB1 deletion enhanced mouse retinal and cell angiogenesis, and knockdown of VEGF by small-interfering RNA decreased endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Re-expression of LKB1 or knockdown of VEGF receptor 2 decreased the over-proliferation and -migration observed in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 cells. Mechanistically, LKB1 could bind to the VEGF transcription factor, specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which then inhibited the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter to reduce VEGF expression. Endothelial LKB1 may regulate endothelial angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating Sp1-mediated VEGF expression.\n", "fulltext": "Angiogenesis is the physiological process whereby new blood vessels are formed from preexisting vessels. It is crucial for growth, development, and postnatal organ repair. Angiogenesis also contributes to several pathological conditions, including cancer, by supplying nutrients and oxygen to maintain aggressive growth.1 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling plays an essential role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis.2 The VEGF family consists of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and placenta growth factor. VEGF-A, first described as a vascular permeability factor,3 binds to its cell-surface receptors including VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2 and neuropilin-1/2 on endothelial cells (ECs). This binding dimerizes and authophosphorylates the receptor and starts the signaling cascades required for EC proliferation and migration.4 VEGF-A plays a critical role in angiogenesis; VEGF-A\u2013knockout mice are lethal embryonically because of abnormal vascular development.5 Although VEGF-A (hereafter VEGF) is well known to regulate angiogenesis, how it is regulated remains poorly understood. VEGF expression is regulated at many levels including transcription, translation and mRNA stability.6,7 Under various conditions, VEGF is upregulated by transcriptional factors such as specificity protein 1 (Sp1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1.8 Sp1 has 785 amino acids and regulates VEGF expression by binding to GC-rich motifs within the promoter.9 Sp1 downregulation reduces tumor vascularization,8 so it may play an anti-tumor role. Given the important roles of VEGF in angiogenesis, a complete understanding of its regulation is significant to elucidate the process of angiogenesis. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase and ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. It was first identified in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome as a tumor suppressor.10,11 LKB1 can phosphorylate the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family of proteins, including 14 members, and play an important role in energy metabolism and cell polarity.12,13 Many LKB1-knockout mouse models have been generated to further elucidate the in vivo roles.14 We previously showed that LKB1 overexpression inhibits endothelial tube formation,15 which suggests that LKB1 is anti-angiogenic. However, the detailed mechanism for this formation is unknown. In this study, we used endothelium-specific LKB1-knockout mice (LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212)16 to show that LKB1 deletion in ECs promoted tumor growth by increasing tumor angiogenesis. Because LKB1-deficient mice exhibit abnormal VEGF expression,17 we determined whether LKB1 deletion in the endothelium would affect VEGF levels. Primary lung ECs from WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice were isolated and cultured. Levels of two important endothelial markers, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin), were checked, with no change between WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 1A), which suggests no phenotypic changes in cells. VEGF protein and mRNA levels were increased in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 ECs (Fig. 1A and 1B). Furthermore, serum VEGF levels were increased in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1C) and the mice showed more VEGF-positive staining in endothelium on immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1D). Hence, endothelial LKB1 deletion increased VEGF levels in ECs. VEGF is also a vascular permeability factor,18 so we evaluated the effect of LKB1 deletion on vascular permeability. To quantify vascular leakage, mice were injected with Evans blue. The amount of dye leaked was greater in tissues including the kidney, liver, lung, and skin from LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice (Fig. 1E), which suggests that endothelial LKB1 deletion results in increased vascular permeability. As well, aortas from WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice were examined to identify possible ultrastructural changes. Tight junctions between LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 ECs were significantly smaller and wider than those between WT cells (Fig. 1F). The mean length of tight junctions in ECs from LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice was 52% of that from WT mice (Fig. 1G), which further confirmed the phenotype of hyperpermeability in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice. Microalbuminuria is a marker of endothelial hyperpermeability and dysfunction,19 and it can be determined by measuring the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). Urinary ACR was significantly higher in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice (Fig. 1H), so LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit microalbuminuria and hyperpermeability. To show the architecture of cell\u2013cell contact, we used ZO-1 immunostaining of WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 ECs. LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 cells showed increased permeability (Fig. 1I). The morphological structure of glomerulus from WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice analyzed by H&E staining showed LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice with glomerular enlargement in the kidney (Fig. 1J and Supplementary Fig. 1). Taken together, LKB1 deletion increases VEGF level and permeability. To address whether the loss of endothelial LKB1 affects tumor growth and vascular permeability, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) or B16F10 melanoma cells were implanted in the backs of WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice, then tumor growth was monitored for 14 days, and tumors were excised; LLC tumors grew faster in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice (Fig. 2A). Similarly, B16F10 melanoma tumors grew faster in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice (Fig. 2B). To detect the vascular permeability in LLC tumors, FITC-labeled dextran was injected: the area of extravasated dextran was increased in LLC tumors from LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2C). In addition, Evans blue was injected into mice, and samples were quantified spectrophotometrically. Evans-blue content was greater for LLC tumors from LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice (Fig. 2D). Tumor permeability can be quantified by using macromolecular tracers, such as fibrin/fibrinogen staining.20 Fibrinogen staining was greater for LLC tumors from LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice (Fig. 2E). Hence, tumors implanted in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice feature increased growth and microvascular permeability. To determine which cell type-derived VEGF contributes to the different tumor growth in WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice, we stained LLC tumors from WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice for VEGF and found no difference in VEGF staining between the mice (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Then we detected EC- or macrophage-derived VEGF levels by co-staining CD31 or CD68 and VEGF. CD31 and VEGF but not CD68 and VEGF co-staining was significantly increased in tumors from LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Fig. 2B and 2C), which suggests that EC-derived VEGF contributes to the different tumor growth in WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice. Moreover, we implanted LLC cells into the backs of WT and macrophage-specific LKB1 knockout (LKB1macro\u2212/\u2212) mice for 14 days. As expected, LLC tumors from WT and LKB1macro\u2212/\u2212 mice did not differ in size (Supplementary Fig. 2D), so macrophage-derived VEGF is unlikely the major factor for aberrant tumor growth observed in tumor-implanted LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice. Tumor angiogenesis was evaluated with an antibody to the endothelial-specific marker CD31. The vasculature was more dense for LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT LLC tumors (Fig. 3A). Quantification of CD31-positive areas suggested increased angiogenesis in LLC tumors from LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice (Fig. 3A). To evaluate the effect of endothelial LKB1 on tumor growth for a longer time, LLCs were implanted in WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice. After 28 days, LLC tumors were still larger in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice (Fig. 3B). CD31 staining revealed more vascularization in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT tumors (Fig. 3C). Then, we examined tumor cell proliferation with an antibody to Ki-67 antigen. Ki-67 staining was greater in tumors from LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice (Fig. 3D). To detect apoptosis in tumors, we detected cleaved Caspase-3 level and found no significant difference in level between LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 and WT tumors (Fig. 3E), which suggests that endothelial LKB1 deletion did not affect tumor cell apoptosis. Hence, LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 tumors may grow faster due to increased angiogenesis. Because LKB1 knockout increased VEGF levels in the endothelium, we determined whether the VEGF-neutralizing antibody could affect tumor growth in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice. Injection of the VEGF-neutralizing antibody decreased serum VEGF level (Fig. 4G) and tumor growth in WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4A); the IgG control antibody had no effect. Immunofluorescence with CD31 revealed that LKB1 deletion increased the vascular density of LLC tumors, and VEGF-neutralizing antibody treatment reduced the vascular density (Fig. 4B). Therefore, LKB1 inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth via a VEGF-mediated autocrine pathway. To address whether tumor angiogenesis and growth were mediated by an LKB1/VEGF paracrine pathway, LLC and B16F10 cells were infected with control or LKB1 shRNA lentivirus to silence LKB1, then implanted into WT mice. At the same time, mice were intravenously injected with the neutralizing monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody or control antibody. LKB1 silencing in B16F10 or LLC cells resulted in VEGF overexpression (Fig. 4H) and enhanced tumor growth (Fig. 4C and 4E). However, injection with the VEGF-neutralizing antibody reduced LLC and B16F10 tumor growth (Fig. 4C and 4E). Immunofluorescence assay with CD31 revealed that LKB1 loss increased the vascular density of LLC and B16F10 tumors, and treatment with the VEGF-neutralizing antibody decreased the vascular density (Fig. 4D and 4F). Thus, LKB1/VEGF also regulates tumor angiogenesis and growth via a paracrine pathway. LKB1 deletion increased VEGF levels and permeability. Because vascular permeability contributes to the angiogenesis process in vivo,21 we assessed whether LKB1 deletion affects angiogenesis. The vascular system of the mouse retina provides a useful model to study angiogenesis.22 We examined the developing retinal vasculature of WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice and found accelerated retinal vasculature outgrowth at P6 in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 pups (Fig. 5A). In addition, LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 retinas had more branch points, filopodia-containing tip cells and dilated vessels than WT retinas (Fig. 5B). To detect retinal protein leakage, we injected 70-kDa FITC-dextran into mice via the tail vein. Protein leakage was increased in the retinas of LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5C), which was further confirmed by Evans-blue content measurement (Fig. 5D). To test whether LKB1 regulates angiogenesis via VEGF, we silenced VEGF in WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 ECs, then examined cell proliferation. The proliferation of LKB1-deficient cells was increased, and VEGF knockdown restored the proliferation of LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 cells to normal conditions (Fig. 5F). In addition, results from wound healing assay suggested that LKB1 deletion enhanced cell migration, which could be inhibited by VEGF silencing (Fig. 5G, Supplementary Fig. 3). To study the effect of acute knockdown of LKB1 on angiogenesis, HUVECs were transfected with control or LKB1 shRNA lentivirus to silence LKB1, then cell proliferation and migration was examined. Similar to LKB1-deficient lung ECs, LKB1 knockdown increased VEGF expression, cell proliferation and migration (Supplementary Fig. 4). To detect whether re-expression of LKB1 could rescue the phenotype in LKB1-deficient cells, LacZ or LKB1 plasmid was transfected into WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 ECs, then cell proliferation and migration was examined. LKB1 deletion increased VEGF level released from ECs, and re-expression of LKB1 reduced VEGF level (Fig. 5I). As expected, re-expression of LKB1 decreased the over-proliferation and -migration observed in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 5J and 5K). To further confirm whether LKB1 regulation of endothelial proliferation and migration depends on VEGF, we transfected control or VEGFR2 siRNA into WT or LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 cells, then examined cell proliferation and migration. VEGFR2 knockdown rescued the phenotype of over-proliferation and -migration observed in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5M and 5N). Hence, LKB1 deficiency enhances angiogenic processes, including cell proliferation and migration, by increasing VEGF level. To explore how LKB1 regulates VEGF expression, LKB1-deficient A549 lung cancer cells were transfected with LKB1 or LacZ plasmid; VEGF mRNA level was decreased with LKB1 transfection (Fig. 6A). To assess how LKB1 regulates VEGF transcription, we generated four luciferase plasmids progressively truncated for the mouse VEGF promoter (Fig. 6B). LKB1 transfection repressed luciferase activities in all truncated constructs (Fig. 6C), which suggests that the responsive element, regulated by LKB1, is located within the small and proximal fragment spanning from \u2013150 base pairs to the transcription start site. Moreover, the LKB1 kinase-dead mutant plasmid (D194A) inhibited VEGF expression (Fig. 6C), so LKB1 kinase activity may not be required for VEGF inhibition. The Sp1-responsive element is localized at the region between \u2212150 base pairs and the transcription start site of the VEGF promoter. Therefore, LKB1 may regulate VEGF expression through Sp1. AMPK activity was decreased in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 cells.16 To determine whether AMPK is involved in the regulatory activity of LKB1 in VEGF expression, VEGF-luc plasmids were transfected into WT and LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 cells, followed by AICAR (AMPK activator) treatment. AICAR did not change the VEGF expression (Fig. 6D), which suggests that AMPK is not involved in the regulatory activity of LKB1 in VEGF transcription. To determine whether LKB1 can bind to Sp1, HEK293T cells were transfected with WT LKB1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Sp1 plasmid. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with IgG or anti-LKB1 antibody, then examined by western blot analysis with anti-GFP antibody. LKB1 bound to Sp1 (Fig. 6E). This finding was further confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with cell lysates transfected with WT Sp1 and GFP-LKB1 (Fig. 6F). To further determine the association of LKB1 and Sp1 in ECs, mouse lung EC lysates were immunoprecipitated with IgG or anti-LKB1 antibody, then examined by western blot analysis with anti-Sp1 antibody. LKB1 was able to bind to Sp1 under physiological conditions (Fig. 6G). The colocalization of LKB1 and Sp1 was observed in the nuclei of ECs (Fig. 6H). However, LKB1 overexpression did not change Sp1 levels (Fig. 6I). Overall, these data indicate that LKB1 negatively regulates VEGF expression. To map their binding domains, we constructed different truncated Sp1 and LKB1 plasmids (Fig. 7A). When the truncated Sp1 plasmids were co-transfected with LKB1 into HEK293T cells, only the C-terminal domain of Sp1 could bind to LKB1 (Fig. 7B). However, Sp1 could not bind to the truncated LKB1 plasmids (data not known), which suggests that full-length LKB1 is required for its binding to Sp1. To detect whether LKB1 can affect the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter, LacZ, WT or D194A LKB1 plasmid was transfected into A549 cells, and ChIP was performed. Both WT and D194A LKB1 inhibited Sp1 binding to the VEGF promoter (Fig. 7C). In ECs, ChIP assay showed more Sp1 binding with VEGF promoter in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 ECs (Fig. 7D). In addition, LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 ECs were transfected with LacZ plasmid, WT or D194A LKB1 plasmids followed by DNA ChIP assay. Compared with LacZ, both WT and D194A plasmid inhibited Sp1 to bind with VEGF promoter (Fig 7E), which suggests that the kinase activity of LKB1 is not required in regulating Sp1 binding to the VEGF promoter in ECs. In addition, LKB1 inhibited VEGF promoter activity in control siRNA-transfected A549 cells but could not inhibit VEGF expression in Sp1-deficient cells (Fig. 7F), which suggests that LKB1 inhibits VEGF expression via Sp1. Moreover, mutation of the Sp1 element completely abolished the LKB1-mediated repression of the VEGF promoter (Fig. 7G). Overall, these results demonstrate that LKB1 negatively regulated VEGF expression by competitively binding Sp1. In mammals, two splice variants of LKB1 are expressed because of alternate use of 3\u2032-exons. The long form is the main form widely expressed in tissues, whereas the short form has a unique 39-residue format instead of the last 63 residues in the long form and is a minor form in most tissues but is highly expressed in haploid spermatids.23,24 In our Cre/LoxP system, both LKB1 isoforms could be deleted in the endothelium. Our study is the first to show that EC-specific LKB1 knockout in mice increased VEGF levels, thus increasing angiogenesis and tumor growth. In WT ECs, LKB1 bound to the VEGF transcription factor Sp1 and decreased VEGF level. However, in LKB1-deficient ECs, the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter was increased, and VEGF level, angiogenesis, and tumor growth were enhanced (Fig. 7H). Moreover, treatment with VEGF-neutralizing antibody decreased angiogenesis and tumor growth in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, LKB1 plays a critical role in regulating VEGF expression via Sp1 to maintain normal angiogenesis. VEGF expression can be regulated by many transcription factors such as Sp1.8 Sp1 can directly interact with the E3 ligase pVHL, thereby inhibiting Sp1 binding to the VEGF promoter.25 In addition, p53 can form a complex with Sp1 to inhibit its binding with the VEGF promoter.26 VEGF mRNA levels in LKB1\u2212/\u2212 embryos at embryonic day (E) 8.5 and E9.5 are elevated, so LKB1 negatively regulates VEGF expression under normal conditions.18 A recent study reported that LKB1 overexpression decressed Sp1 level, thereby downregulating VEGF.27 However, we found that LKB1 did not alter Sp1 protein levels (Fig. 6I). We demonstrate that LKB1 could bind to Sp1 and inhibit its binding to the VEGF promoter, which may explain why LKB1 overexpression is significantly associated with a decrease in microvessel density28 and LKB1 loss enhances the vascularity of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome polyps.29 Besides affecting VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, LKB1 can affect other endothelial functions such as decreasing eNOS activity with its deletion.16 Knockdown of LKB1 with shRNA significantly lowers VEGF, so tumor cells are important sources of VEGF. Beside tumor cells, other cells including macrophages and ECs can be potential sources of VEGF. To determine the relative contributions of ECs versus macrophages, we first co-stained VEGF with ECs (CD31) or macrophages (CD68). As expected, we found a strong co-staining of CD31 and VEGF in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice, with no difference of CD68 and VEGF co-staining in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice. To further determine the contributions of macrophage-derived VEGF, LLC cells were implanted in WT and macrophage-specific LKB1 knockout (LKB1macro\u2212/\u2212) mice. As expected, LLC tumors from WT and LKB1macro\u2212/\u2212 mice did not differ in size, which suggests that macrophage-derived VEGF did not contribute to the tumor growth in LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice. Findings from this study may have broad implications beyond cardiovascular diseases. Because the generation of blood supply in tumor is a rate-limiting step for tumor growth, any therapy for normalizing LKB1 expression or activity will suppress intra-tumoral microvessel formation, which will lead to limiting the supply of circulating blood that is crucial for tumor growth. Indeed, anti-angiogenic therapy has been found effective in preclinical cancer studies, and numerous anti-angiogenic agents are being clinically evaluated. Notably, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved several anti-angiogenic drugs that target the VEGF signaling pathway. In summary, this study identified the molecular mechanism of increased angiogenesis and tumor growth with LKB1 deficiency. LKB1 loss triggered the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter, thereby enhancing VEGF expression. The development of therapeutic agents that target LKB1 in the treatment of pathological angiogenesis and tumor progression should be considered. The generation and characteristics of endothelium-specific LKB1-knockout mice (LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212) and macrophage-specific LKB1-knockout mice (LKB1macro\u2212/\u2212) were previously described.16,30 The animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with a 12-hr light/dark cycle with food and water freely available. At least 5 mice in each group were used in the animal study. A neutralizing monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody (2G11-2A05, Bio-legend) or an isotype-matched control (RTK2758) was injected intravenously at 100 \u03bcg twice weekly, starting on the day of tumor implantation. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of Georgia State University. A total of 1 million Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) or B16F10 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into the backs of male WT or LKB1endo\u2212/\u2212 mice (6-8 weeks old). Tumors developed for 14 or 28 days and were measured every 2 days with use of calipers to assess tumor volume (length \u00d7 height \u00d7 width \u00d7 0.5236). In addition, LLC or B16F10 cells were infected with control or LKB1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles to silence LKB1, then implanted into WT mice. A549 cells or ECs were transfected with the VEGF promoter-driven firefly luciferase plasmid, thymidine kinase promoter-driven renilla luciferase construct, and the \u03b2-galactosidase (LacZ) control or LKB1 construct by using the 4D-Nucleofecto System (LONZA, Walkersville, MD). At 24 hr after transfection, luciferase activity was measured by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SE. After confirming the normal distribution of data by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, differences between two groups were analyzed by Student t test. Assuming \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b2 = 0.90, and a ratio of (expected effect size)/ (expected standard deviation) = 1.20, we needed at least 5 samples per group. P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant."}, "26411452": {"pmid": "26411452", "pmcid": "PMC4715509", "title": "Putative Prostate Cancer Risk SNP in an Androgen Receptor\u2010Binding Site of the Melanophilin Gene Illustrates Enrichment of Risk SNPs in Androgen Receptor Target Sites", "abstract": "\nABSTRACT\nGenome\u2010wide association studies have identified genomic loci, whose single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predispose to prostate cancer (PCa). However, the mechanisms of most of these variants are largely unknown. We integrated chromatin\u2010immunoprecipitation\u2010coupled sequencing and microarray expression profiling in TMPRSS2\u2010ERG gene rearrangement positive DUCaP cells with the GWAS PCa risk SNPs catalog to identify disease susceptibility SNPs localized within functional androgen receptor\u2010binding sites (ARBSs). Among the 48 GWAS index risk SNPs and 3,917 linked SNPs, 80 were found located in ARBSs. Of these, rs11891426:T>G in an intron of the melanophilin gene (MLPH) was within a novel putative auxiliary AR\u2010binding motif, which is enriched in the neighborhood of canonical androgen\u2010responsive elements. T\u2192G exchange attenuated the transcriptional activity of the ARBS in an AR reporter gene assay. The expression of MLPH in primary prostate tumors was significantly lower in those with the G compared with the T allele and correlated significantly with AR protein. Higher melanophilin level in prostate tissue of patients with a favorable PCa risk profile points out a tumor\u2010suppressive effect. These results unravel a hidden link between AR and a functional putative PCa risk SNP, whose allele alteration affects androgen regulation of its host gene MLPH.\n", "fulltext": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer\u2010related death in Western men [Siegel et\u00a0al., 2012]. In 56% of primary tumors and in almost all tumor metastases, androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed and deregulated [Taylor et\u00a0al., 2010]. Therefore, AR signaling has been both a main target for therapy and a focus in research for understanding the molecular mechanisms of PCa development and progression. AR regulates a wide variety of genes involved in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Recently, the identification of AR targets in both PCa cell lines and tumor tissues has been greatly extended by high\u2010throughput techniques, such as gene expression profiling and chromatin\u2010immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with microarray analysis or DNA sequencing (ChIP\u2010seq) [Lin et\u00a0al., 2009; Massie et\u00a0al., 2011; Sharma et\u00a0al., 2013]. These approaches enable the identification of key signal pathways, as well as clarification of the changes of AR signaling during PCa tumorigenesis and progression. A discovery of great importance disclosed by genetic analysis of prostate tumors was the identification of gene rearrangements involving the promoter regions of androgen\u2010regulated genes. Most frequent among these genetic alterations in PCa are fusions of ETS transcription factor genes to 5\u2032\u2010regions of AR\u2010regulated genes, which results in androgen\u2010stimulated overexpression of ETS proteins [Tomlins et\u00a0al., 2005]. Among a variety of fusion genes in PCa, the TMPRSS2\u2010ERG fusion is the most common one with a prevalence of 40%\u201370% in primary tumors [Schaefer et\u00a0al., 2013]. ERG overexpression was reported to increase stemness of prostate tumor cells [Casey et\u00a0al., 2012]; however, the full functional importance and clinical implications of the fusion gene remain to be unraveled. Interestingly, ERG was also found to inhibit transactivation of the AR via direct and indirect mechanisms, thus modulating AR signaling in ERG fusion gene\u2010positive cancers [Yu et\u00a0al., 2010]. Despite extensive studies on the AR transcriptome and cistrome, these have been largely focused on LNCaP cells, which do not harbor a TMPRSS2\u2010ERG fusion gene. There is a need, therefore, to study the deregulated AR signaling in fusion gene\u2010positive PCa tumor cells. Genome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely applied to identify the association of common genetic variants with cancer risk. Single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genetic loci such as 8q24, 22q13 and 17q12 were reported to be linked to PCa susceptibility, early onset of the disease, and tumor aggressiveness [Witte, 2007; Levin et\u00a0al., 2008; Salinas et\u00a0al., 2008; Thomas et\u00a0al., 2008; Chang et\u00a0al., 2009; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2009; Eeles et\u00a0al., 2009; Gudmundsson et\u00a0al., 2009; Takata et\u00a0al., 2010; Schumacher et\u00a0al., 2011; Eeles et\u00a0al., 2013; Al Olama et\u00a0al., 2014; Berndt et\u00a0al., 2015; Helfand et\u00a0al., 2015]. Although little is known about the functional aspect of risk SNPs, some studies showed cancer SNPs predominately present in multiple putative regulatory elements [Sille, et\u00a0al., 2012]. SNPs in the promoter of the KLK3 gene, encoding the commonly used PCa marker protein prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA), were reported to increase serum PSA and PSA promoter activity [Cramer et\u00a0al., 2003], whereas a C\u2192 T substitution of SNP rs10993994:C>T in the 5\u2032 region of the PCa\u2010suppressor gene MSMB was shown to affect gene expression level [Chang et\u00a0al., 2009]. By combining GWAS susceptibility genes with expression profiling studies, genes involved in cytoskeleton and cell adhesion were found to be overrepresented among the PCa risk genes [Gorlov et\u00a0al., 2009]. This finding indicates the feasibility to identify causal variants that regulate the candidate genes and the molecular mechanisms of tumor risk modulation by integrating high\u2010throughput datasets, for example, GWAS and gene expression profiling. In this study, by coupling AR ChIP\u2010seq and microarray expression profiling of androgen\u2010regulated genes, we identified multiple AR regulatory elements (AREs) in the TMPRSS2\u2010ERG fusion gene\u2010positive DUCaP PCa cells and identified a novel auxiliary AR\u2010binding motif enriched in the vicinity of canonical androgen response elements. Correlation with GWAS data revealed enrichment of PCa risk SNPs in AR\u2010binding sites (ARBSs). A common SNP, rs11891426:T>G, which is in moderately high\u2010linkage disequilibrium with the GWAS SNPs rs2292884:A>G and rs7584330:A>G, was found located within one of the auxiliary ARE motifs within the ARBS in the seventh intron of the MLPH gene (OMIN accession number: *606526). We further showed that the variant allele of rs11891426:T>G is negatively correlated with melanophilin (MLPH) expression. A higher protein expression in prostate tissues of cancer patients was associated with a favorable PCa risk profile, suggesting a causal relationship between PCa development and progression with modulation of MLPH expression. Human PCa cell lines LNCaP and PC\u20103 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). DUCaP was a generous gift from Dr. Jack Schalken (Center for Molecular Life Science, The Netherlands). LNCaP cells were originally derived from a lymph node metastasis of a PCa patient (Horoszewicz et\u00a0al., 1983). Their AR harbors a point mutation in the ligand\u2010binding domain, leading to a promiscuous receptor activated by estrogens, progestins, and by flutamide in addition to androgens [Kokontis et\u00a0al., 1991]. DUCaP PCa cells were obtained from a dura mater metastasis of a PCa patient [Lee et\u00a0al., 2001] and harbor a TMPRSS2\u2010ERG gene rearrangement (found in 50%\u201370% of all prostate tumors). These cells express a high level of wild\u2010type AR. LNCaP and DUCaP cells are both androgen sensitive, whereas PC\u20103 cells, originally isolated from a bone metastasis of a PCa patient [Kaighn et\u00a0al., 1979], do not express AR and are androgen unresponsive [Sampson et\u00a0al., 2013]. Introduction of AR into PC\u20103 cells through transient transfection of an expression vector, however, restores AR signaling and response to androgens. LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (PAA, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA), 2 mM l\u2010glutamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 2.5 g/l d\u2010glucose (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES, and 1 mM Na\u2010Pyruvat (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). PC\u20103 and DUCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 2 mM l\u2010glutamine. Before steroid hormone treatment cells were held in phenol\u2010red\u2010free RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran\u2010treated fetal calf serum (CCS; Fisher) for up to 3 days. Stimulation with 1 nM of the synthetic androgen R1881 or vehicle was performed for the indicated durations. Patients\u2019 tissue samples for DNA, RNA, and protein analysis were obtained from the Prostate Cancer Bioresource of the Department of Urology, Innsbruck Medical University. The clinical samples have been collected within the framework of the Tyrolean prostate cancer early detection program [Bartsch et\u00a0al., 2008]. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Innsbruck Medical University (Study AM 3174 and amendment 2). All samples were obtained from patients with biopsy\u2010proven, clinically localized PCa, who were at least 40 years old and who had received no previous PCa therapy. A total of 126 patients were enrolled in the study. For 108 cases, DNA genotyping was performed, mRNA expression was determined in 77 cases, and 68 cases were available for immunohistochemistry analysis. Patients\u2019 variables such as age, total PSA, percent\u2010free PSA, prostate tumor volume, and clinical and histological tumor characteristics are recorded in Table 1. ChIP\u2010seq was performed as described [Bu et\u00a0al., 2013]. AR antibodies used for ChIP were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) and Upstate (PG\u201021, UB 06\u2010680). Rabbit IgG was used as antibody control. After adjustment to steroid hormone\u2010free condition, DUCaP cells were treated with 1 nM R1881 or vehicle control and cells were harvested at different time points and subjected to ChIP. The enrichment of AR to its target genes at different time points was monitored by normal or qPCR amplification of well\u2010established AR target sites, for example, the AR enhancer in the PSA gene promoter (F: 5\u2032\u2010GGGGTTTGTGCCACTGGTGAG\u20103\u2032 and R: 5\u2032\u2010GGGAGGCAATTCTCCATGGTTC\u20103\u2032). AR enrichment was highest after 1 hr of hormone treatment and this time point was chosen for CHIP\u2010seq analysis. Samples including appropriate control samples (vehicle control, IgG control \u00b1 androgen) were prepared once and DNA was immunoprecipitated and purified. After a quality check using qPCR as described above, DNA samples were used for library preparation and sequenced on a Solexa platform (Illumina Genome Analyzer II; Illumina, San Diego, CA). Raw sequencing data were analyzed by the Illumina analysis pipeline software and reads were aligned to the unmasked human reference genome (NCBI v36, hg18) using Bowtie [Langmead et\u00a0al., 2009]. All reads that mapped to simple tandem repeats [Benson, 1999] or duplicated regions >1,000 bp were discarded. MACS tool (v1.4) was used to identify AR\u2010enriched regions in a genome\u2010wide manner in comparison to control IgG\u2010enriched regions [Zhang et\u00a0al., 2008]. AR\u2010enriched regions in androgen\u2010treated samples were compared with control vehicle\u2010treated samples to identify androgen\u2010dependent AR\u2010binding peaks. The AR\u2010binding peaks with \u221210log10 P values more than 50 were counted as ARBSs. If an ARBS occurred within 50 kb upstream or downstream of a gene start site or within the body of a gene, we regarded that gene as a potential AR target gene. ChIP\u2010seq data have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession Nr. GSE70679). DUCaP or LNCaP cells were steroid starved for 3 days before treatment with 1 nM R1881 or equivalent ethanol for 8 or 24 hr. Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biological triplicate (24\u2010hr treatment) and duplicate (8\u2010h treatment) RNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix HuGene\u20101.0 st v1 expression arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) [Irizarry et\u00a0al., 2003] in the Core Facility of the Medical University of Innsbruck. Raw microarray data were preprocessed in R (http://www.r\u2010project.org) using the RMA algorithm and the custom CDF HuGene10stvs1_Hs_ENSG version 12 [Smyth, 2004]. Raw and preprocessed microarray data have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession Nr. GSE63693). Significance for differential expression was estimated using the moderated t\u2010test and the resulting P values were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg correction method [Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995]. Probe sets with a B\u2010H\u2010corrected P value \u2264 0.05 were considered to represent androgen\u2010regulated genes. MEME (version 4.70) was run with default options, allowing detected motif sites to be on forward or reverse strand (\u2010revcomp). A file of 100 bp sequences centered around the binding peaks of 5,571 ARBSs of the 1,490 AR primary targets was used as the input to the program. Novelty of the detected motifs was determined based on comparison of the motifs against those in JASPAR using TomTom [Gupta et\u00a0al., 2007]. This study utilized the high\u2010performance computational capabilities of the Biowulf Linux cluster at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (http://biowulf.nih.gov). SNPs reported to be associated with PCa (P value <5\u00d710\u22128) were obtained from the NHGRI GWAS catalog (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies, accessed Dec 31, 2011) and defined as GWAS index SNPs. Linked SNPs were identified as those that have \u2265specified r 2. For simulation analysis, r 2 = 0.2, 0.5, and 0.7 were used, whereas r 2 \u2265 0.5 was chosen for further analysis of SNPs linked with the index SNPs based on the genotypes of the 1000G project (phase 1, v3). For analysis of GWAS SNPs enrichment in the AR ChIP\u2010seq peaks, 10,000 random sets of simulated ChIP\u2010seq peaks, matching chromosome, and size of the actual peaks were picked across the genome. The number of the index and linked SNPs in the random regions was counted and compared against the observed one in ChIP\u2010seq peaks. A permutation P value was estimated using Wilson score interval [Wilson, 1927] to quantify the significance of enrichment of the index and linked SNPs overlapping the ARBSs compared with the ones identified in simulated peaks. Firefly luciferase reporter vectors harboring the ARBS of the MLPH gene, with the major T allele of SNP rs11891426:T>G, were constructed according to the procedures previously described [Bu et\u00a0al., 2013]. Briefly, the MLPH ARBS was PCR amplified using primers F: 5\u2032\u2010 TATCCAACACACGGGCTGAT \u20103\u2032 and R: 5\u2032\u2010 AGCTTTGGGGATTTCATTTCA \u20103\u2032, purified and first ligated to the PCR fragment cloning vector PSC\u2010B (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and then inserted into the KpnI/SacI sites of the PGL3 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The minor G allele counterpart of the reporter vector or mutations of the two putative androgen\u2010responsive elements (AREs) were generated using the QuikChange II site\u2010directed (Agilent) or the Q5 site\u2010directed mutagenesis (NEB, Ipswich, MA) kits. Primers used for mutagenesis were 5\u2032\u2010CAGCTCCCTGCTGCCAGCCTGGGG for G allele alteration, 5\u2010GCTTCCAGCCTGGGGTGCGTTCTGCACGCCTCCCTGAAATG for mutation of AR binding motif 3 and 5\u2032\u2010GCCAGCCCACAGCGTTCTGCACGCAGCCTGGGGTGGGAC for mutation of AR\u2010binding motif 2. AR\u2010negative PC\u20103 cells were seeded at a density of 50% confluence in a 96\u2010well plate. On the next day, they were transfected with 40 ng of AR expression vector PSG5\u2010AR together with 40 ng of the firefly reporter vectors harboring either the wild\u2010type ARBS or a mutated counterpart and 4 ng of renilla luciferase normalization control vector (PGL4.73; Promega). AR\u2010positive DUCaP cells were seeded at a density of 175,000 cells per well in 24\u2010well plates and transfected with 0.5 \u03bcg per well of one of the firefly reporter vectors and a SV40 promoter\u2010driven renilla luciferase normalization control vector. One day following transfection, cells were treated with 1 nM R1881 for 48 hr, followed by cell lysis and quantification of luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase control activity. Total RNA was extracted from carefully macrodissected benign and malignant areas of frozen tissue sections derived from radical prostatectomy specimens (n = 77), using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). RNA concentrations and purity were determined spectrophotometrically. Reverse transcription was performed on 500 ng of total RNA using the iScript select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules CA) and random hexamer primers (Promega). qPCR control samples for monitoring assay insensitivity for DNA contaminations were prepared by omitting reverse transcriptase during cDNA synthesis. Quantitative PCR (40 cycles) was performed in triplicates using 8 ng total RNA equivalents of cDNA for each 10 \u03bcl reaction. Samples without cDNA and reverse transcription control samples were included to control for unspecific signals. The following primer/probe combination or Taqman assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used: AR: 5\u2032\u2010AGGATGCTCTACTTCGCCCC\u20103\u2032 (fwd), 5\u2032\u2010ACTGGCTGTACATCCGGGAC\u20103\u2032 (rev), 5\u2032\u2010TGGTTTTCAATGAGTACCGCATGCACA\u20103\u2032 (probe), MLPH: Hs00225445_m1; TBP: Hs00427620_m1. Target gene expression was normalized against the reference housekeeping gene TBP. Standard curves for each PCR assay were generated with a serially diluted calibrator sample (cDNA mix of three benign and three malignant tissue sections, 100, 20, 2, 0.2, 0.02 ng RNA equivalents). The relative expression ratio (R) was computed based on assay efficiency of target gene and reference gene and the Ct deviation of each sample to the calibrator sample using the following formula: R = (E target \u22c0\u0394C target[calibrator \u2013 sample])/(E reference \u22c0\u0394Ctreference[calibrator \u2013 sample]) (Pfaffl, 2001). Genomic DNA was isolated from carefully macrodissected benign and malignant areas of frozen tissue sections (n = 108) using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH). DNA concentrations and purity were determined spectrophotometrically. SNP analysis was performed in triplicate on 3 ng/\u03bcl DNA using the 7900HT\u2010Real Time PCR System. SNP genotyping assays (GenXpress, V\u00f6sendorf, Austria) designed against reference sequences rs11891426:T>G, rs2292884:A>G, rs7584330:A>G were applied. Calling rate was 97.87%. Protein expression in malignant and nonmalignant (benign) PCa tissue was analyzed using a tissue microarray (TMA). For the TMA construction, formalin\u2010fixed and paraffin\u2010embedded (FFPE) human tissue samples derived from radical prostatectomy (n = 68) were selected. From each prostate specimen, three cancer and three benign tissue cores were punched and assembled in a TMA using a manual tissue arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI). A double immuostaining was performed on 5 \u03bcm sections using antibodies directed against cytokeratin 5/6 and \u03b1\u2010methylacyl\u2010CoA racemase (AMACR) or MLPH and AR on a Discovery\u2010XT staining device (Ventana, Tucson, AZ). Target antibodies and concentrations used were as follows: anti\u2010cytokeratin 5/6 1:300, anti\u2010AMACR 1:300 (#M7237, #M3616; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), anti\u2010MLPH 1:200 (HPA014685; Sigma), and anti\u2010AR 1:400 (#3165\u20101; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Images were acquired using an Axio Imager Z2 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and TissueFAXS software (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria) and MLPH and AR immunostaining intensity analysis was performed using the HistoQuest IHC analysis software (TissueGnostics) under the supervision of an experienced uropathologist (GS). Cytokeratin 5/6/AMACR stains were used to control assignment of benign and malignant tissue areas. For each TMA spot, the mean intensity and percentage of positively stained cells were evaluated and a score was calculated by multiplying those two values. The mean immunointensity score value for each patient was calculated as the average of the three tissue cores, stratified according to cancer and benign tissue. The GraphPad Prism 5 (Graph Prism Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) software package was used for statistical analysis. Numerical data are presented as the mean and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. The differences of the relative luciferase activities between the reporter vectors harboring wild\u2010type and mutated sequences were calculated using the unpaired t\u2010test. Differences of MLPH expression levels according to different tissue types, genotypes, as well as patients\u2019 variables and tumor characteristics (age, total PSA, % free PSA, histopathological grade and stage, tumor volume, tumor percentage, and PSA recurrence) were analyzed using the Welch\u2010corrected unpaired t\u2010test. The Pearson's test was used to calculate the correlation of AR and MLPH protein or mRNA expression and the Chi\u2010square test to estimate differences of the distribution of MLPH genotypes among subgroups of patients. P values of \u22640.05 were considered statistically significant and are indicated in graphs as *P \u2264 0.05, **P \u2264 0.01, and ***P \u2264 0.001. In this study, we used DUCaP cells as a model to investigate the AR\u2010regulated transcriptional program in PCa cells. This cell line expresses a high level of wild\u2010type AR, which mimics AR upregulation seen in the majority of androgen\u2010refractory PCa [Edwards et\u00a0al., 2003]. Furthermore, it harbors a TMPRSS2\u2010ERG gene rearrangement found in 40%\u201370% of prostate tumors [Schaefer et\u00a0al., 2013]. Overexpression of the encoded ERG fusion protein was reported to modulate AR signaling [Yu et\u00a0al., 2010]. The dynamics of androgen\u2010dependent AR enrichment to its target genes was monitored at different time points (0, 20 min, 1, 4, and 18 hr) following R1881 treatment by PCR or qPCR amplification of a PSA enhancer fragment from isolated ChIP\u2010DNA. As expected, androgen treatment induced a recruitment of AR to the target site. Highest enrichment was seen at the early time points (20 min and 1 hr) and it decreased afterwards (4 and 18 hr; Supp. Fig. S1). One hour androgen treatment was therefore chosen as the time point for the identification of genome\u2010wide ARBS by ChIP\u2010deep sequencing analysis. AR ChIP\u2010seq of androgen\u2010stimulated DUCaP cells identified 39,156 ARBSs. The MACS P values of the AR binding peaks are shown in Supp. Figure S2A. In vehicle\u2010treated DuCaP cells only one ARBS in the CDK12 gene proximal promoter was identified. Further validation using independent ChIP samples could not confirm this site, indicating a false\u2010positive ChIP\u2010seq signal (data not shown). These results indicated the dependence on androgen stimulation for receptor activation and genomic targeting by the AR. The DUCaP genomic ARBSs were compared with Lin's ChIP\u2010seq dataset of PC3\u2010AR cells [Lin et\u00a0al., 2009]. Of the 4,165 ARBSs identified in PC3\u2010AR cells, 2,804 (67%) overlapped with our dataset and a further comparison with Massie's ChIP\u2010seq data of LNCaP cells [Massie et\u00a0al., 2011] revealed 8,899 of 11,054 (80.5%) overlapping ARBSs. Of the 51,811 total VCaP cell line binding sites published in the same study, 29,823 (58%) were in common with the DUCaP ARBSs. These results support the presence of common AR genomic\u2010targeted sites even in distinct molecular subtypes of PCa. To identify those ARBSs that are actively involved in transcription, we first integrated the DUCaP genomic AR sites with DNaseI hypersensitivity chromatin sites across a range of cell types (table wgEncodeRegDnaseClustered V1 of http://genome.ucsc.edu; UW ENCODE). Fifty\u2010nine percent (23,155) of the 39,156 ARBSs overlapped with this marker for transcriptionally active chromatin. We next defined potential AR target genes based on the distance to ARBSs. Regulatory sites targeted by AR can reside quite a distance upstream from the transcription start sites of target genes or lie within the gene regions [Jariwala et\u00a0al., 2007; Massie et\u00a0al., 2011]. Therefore, we considered a gene to be an AR target if it was located within a 50\u2010kb distance to an ARBS or an ARBS was located within the gene. A total of 19,123 UCSC annotated genes fulfilled these criteria. Notably, well\u2010known androgen\u2010regulated genes such as KLK3, FKBP5, and TMPRSS2 [Cleutjens et\u00a0al., 1997; Wang et\u00a0al., 2007; Makkonen et\u00a0al., 2009) were called by our analysis algorithm (Fig. 1A). The androgen\u2010induced transcriptional program was determined in DUCaP cells using Affymetrix gene array expression profiling. Androgen\u2010regulated genes were identified following 8 and 24 hr of androgen stimulation. The early time point was chosen in an attempt to identify the primary AR response genes. Using a BH\u2010corrected P value cutoff of \u22640.05, a total of 2,879 and 6,308 out of the 17,837 genes probed on the microarray were regulated upon androgen stimulation of 8 and 24 hr, respectively. Two thirds of genes regulated after 8 hr (65%, 1,871 genes) were also modulated in the same direction after 24 hr of treatment (Fig. 1B). The majority of genes regulated at either time point harbor ARBSs (8 hr: 76%, 24 hr: 70%) indicating that AR binding is a prerequisite for androgen\u2010mediated regulation in most of these genes (Fig. 1C). Considering both time points, 1,873 genes were regulated in the same direction, either up or down (Fig. 1B; Supp. Table S1). When these genes were integrated with the genomic AR target site genes, 80% of them (1,490 genes) overlapped indicating that these are primary AR target genes (Fig. 1C; Supp. Table S1). One\u2010third of the 1,490 primary AR target genes (478) overlapped with androgen\u2010regulated genes harboring ARBSs in PC3\u2010AR cells (Wang et\u00a0al., 2009). The comparison with Massie's list of androgen\u2010regulated genes in LNCaP cells showed an overlap of only 91 genes (6%). We cross\u2010validated androgen stimulation of gene expression in LNCaP cells using Affymetrix gene array analysis under the same conditions as for DuCaP cells. Of 740 genes regulated after 8 hr, 607 (82%) were also modulated in the same direction after 24 hr (Fig. 1D). Less than half of these (247, 44%) overlapped with DUCaP primary genes (Fig. 1E), which is significantly less than the percentage of shared ARBSs, which showed an overlap of 80.5%. These divergences among different AR\u2010positive cell lines indicate that AR binding is not the only key player determining androgen\u2010dependent gene expression. Rather, different cell lines seem to display distinct AR primary target genes despite a high conformity of common ARBSs. To answer the question whether the distance of ARBSs relative to the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of genes affects androgen regulation, we compared the distribution of ARBS\u2013TSS distances in the DuCaP 1,490 androgen\u2010regulated primary AR target genes with the distances in all the other genes containing ARBSs. The pattern of distribution is similar in both sets: the ARBSs are preferentially enriched in close proximity to the TSSs of the genes and distances are independent of androgen regulation (Supp. Fig. S2B). In addition, the ARBSs are also relatively evenly distributed at distal enhancer regions within 25 kb upstream or downstream of the TSS. This result is in agreement with several other reports that ARBSs are not limited to the proximal promoter immediately upstream of the TSS [Jariwala et\u00a0al., 2007; Takayama et\u00a0al., 2007; Wang, et\u00a0al. 2007; Waltering et\u00a0al., 2009]. We further characterized the 5,571 ARBSs of the 1,490 AR primary targets and searched for common sequence motifs and putative androgen\u2010responsive elements. Using MEME [Bailey et\u00a0al., 2009], we took 100 bp sequences centered at the ARBS peaks to identify potential ARE motifs. Three motifs are consistently found in high frequency across different parameter settings with an incidence of 622, 1,085, and 971 for motif 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Fig. 2A). Among them, TomTom [Gupta et\u00a0al., 2007] comparison showed that only motif 3 has a high level of similarity to a consensus ARE, namely, Ar (id MA0007.1; [Roche et\u00a0al., 1992]) in the JASPAR database (http://jaspar.binf.ku.dk) (Fig. 2A), which is described in the Transfac database as well (id V$AR_01) (http://www.gene\u2010regulation.com/pub/databases.html). The other two motifs are not associated with any known AREs in both databases. Fourteen percent of motif 1 (n = 87) and 13.7% of motif 2 (n = 149) are within 100 bp distance to a motif 3. Considering the random coincidence rates that estimated 1.9% coenrichment for motif 1 and 3, and 3.3% for motif 2 and 3, respectively, this indicates a nonrandom clustering of the motifs. An analysis of the distance of the motifs to the TSS of the nearest genes shows that motif 2 is preferentially enriched around TSSs, followed by motif 3, whereas motif 1 seems to be randomly distributed in the genetic context (Supp. Fig. S2C). The recent advances in GWAS have greatly extended our knowledge of genetic loci related to human disease risk and genetic traits. SNPs associated with a disease or a phenotype are enriched within noncoding functional elements such as transcription factor\u2010binding sites [Ortiz\u2010Barahona et\u00a0al., 2010; ENCODE Project Consortium et\u00a0al., 2012]. We asked the question whether PCa risk loci colocalize with ARBSs. For that purpose, GWAS PCa risk index SNPs and their linked SNPs were retrieved from the NHGRI GWAS catalog ([Hindorff et\u00a0al., 2009], http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies) and linked to ARBSs. Of the 48 GWAS index PCa risk SNPs and their 3,917 linked SNPs (r 2\u22650.5 defined by the 1000G project phase 1, v3), 80 were found to be localized in ARBSs (Supp. Table S2). We recognized a SNP to be overlapping with an ARBS if it was located anywhere in the binding peak region called by the peak calling software MACS. Simulation of random ChIP\u2010seq peaks showed that the observed ChIP\u2010seq peaks are highly enriched with GWAS risk SNPs and their linked SNPs, as none of 10,000 simulated sets of random peaks across the genome achieved more than the observed number of risk SNP overlaps (permutation P value 0.00024, Wilson score 95%, confidence interval 0\u20130.00038; Supp. Fig. S3). Different r 2 cutoffs (0.7 and 0.2) in the analysis showed the same level of enrichment of GWAS SNPs in ARBSs. This indicates a nonrandom enrichment of GWAS PCa risk index and linked SNPs in ARBSs. Integration of the GWAS risk and linked SNPs with the ARBSs of the 1,490 primary AR target genes revealed 20 SNPs localized in ARBSs of five androgen\u2010regulated genes (Table 2). Among them, the SNP rs11891426:T>G (G is the risk allele) is located within the putative AR\u2010binding motif 2 of the respective ARBS in the 7th intron of the MLPH gene (OMIN accession number: *606526). Exchanging T\u2192G abolishes the motif 2. In addition, this MLPH\u2013ARBS contains a putative motif 3 ARE, just in 11 bp distance from the motif 2 element (Fig. 3). rs11891426:T>G has a r 2 of 0.37 with the reported PCa risk SNP rs7584330:A>G (G is risk allele) (Kote\u2010Jarai, et\u00a0al., 2011a) and a r 2 of 0.53 with rs2292884:A>G (G is risk allele), another PCa risk SNP [Haiman et\u00a0al., 2011] (Supp. Fig. S4). Although MLPH is in close proximity to the PCa\u2010associated SNPs, a possible molecular mechanism for disease causality has not yet been reported. These findings prompted us to further investigate the influence of the two ARE motifs and their resident SNP rs11891426:T>G on MLPH gene regulation. The MLPH gene expression was enhanced upon androgen treatment for 24 hr by 2.2\u2010fold in LNCaP cells and 1.8\u2010fold in DuCaP cells according to our gene array expression data. In order to analyze the functional importance of the novel AR\u2010binding motif 2 and the canonical motif 3 within the ARBS on AR transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter vectors harboring motifs 2 and 3, and its flanking sequences (illustrated in Supp. Fig. S5) were constructed and mutations that abolish motifs 2 or 3 were introduced as well. In AR\u2010positive DUCaP cells, androgen treatment significantly induced the reporter gene containing the MLPH major allele ARBS element (MLPHwt\u2010T) over nonstimulated cells (49\u2010fold induction; Fig. 2B). Mutation of motif 3 in the ARBS completely abolished the androgen regulation of the reporter gene, whereas destruction of motif 2 did not, and even increased androgen regulation (125\u2010fold induction; Fig. 2B). This result indicated the prerequisite of ARE motif 3 for androgen regulation, whereas motif 2 seems to modulate androgen regulation by motif 3. To investigate the effect of the minor G allele in the putative risk SNP rs11891426:T>G on androgen regulation, the reporter vector containing G at position 10 of ARE motif 2 was constructed (Supp. Fig. S4). In PC\u20103 cells, in which androgen regulation was re\u2010established by AR overexpression, androgen treatment induced the wild\u2010type T reporter gene significantly by 6.4\u2010fold, whereas the risk allele G reporter gene was induced by 4.5\u2010fold only (Fig. 3A). In DUCaP cells, similar differences, although less significant, were seen (Fig. 3B). This result indicated that the presence of the risk G allele in the ARE motif 2 attenuates AR\u2010dependent regulation of MLPH gene expression. The link of the risk G allele of rs11891426:T>G with reduced AR transactivation activity in vitro prompted us to further study the association of the SNP genotype with MLPH expression in PCa tissues. We genotyped rs11891426:T>G, as well as two associated SNPs, rs7584330:A>G and SNP rs2292884:A>G, in prostate tissue DNA samples of 108 PCa patients. For the majority of cases, paired benign and tumor DNA samples were available and the genotypes were identical in all paired samples. The detected minor allele frequencies were 13% for rs11891426:T>G, 21% for rs2292884:A>G, and 21% for rs7584330:A>G. In order to correlate the expression of MLPH with the distinct SNP allele, MLPH immunohistochemistry analysis was carried out employing a TMA containing benign and tumor tissue cores of radical prostatectomy specimens obtained from 68 patients. Of 52 of them, the genotype was also available. Overall, 126 benign or cancer tissue samples originating from these 68 patients, each sample represented by three tissue cores, were analyzed by IHC and mean immunoreactivity scores were calculated for each case and used for statistical analysis. MLPH protein immunoreactivity was significantly lower in samples harboring a rs11891426:T>G risk G allele (G/G n = 1, T/G n = 19) compared with those harboring the nonrisk T allele (T/T n = 77; P = 0.019; Fig. 4A). This confirmed the finding of the in vitro reporter gene assay that the risk G allele may attenuate gene expression (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the tissue samples with one or two risk G alleles (A/G n = 23 or G/G n = 3) in SNP site rs2292884:A>G, a GWAS index SNP that has an r 2 of 0.53 with rs11891426:T>G, also showed a significantly lower expression of the protein when compared with tissue samples with two major A alleles (n = 71, P = 0.0021; Fig. 4A). The difference was less significant with regard to different alleles of the second GWAS index SNP rs7584330:A>G, which has a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0.37 with rs11891426:T>G (G/G n = 6 and A/G n = 24 vs. G/G n = 67, P = 0.057; Fig. 4A). Overall, there was no significant difference in the expression of MLPH protein in benign (Ben; n = 65) compared with cancer (Ca; n = 61) tissues (Fig. 4B). However, in both tissue types, MLPH immunoreactivity was lower in cases with the rs11891426:T>G G (risk) allele when compared with the T allele, with a statistically significant difference for the benign tissue type (P = 0.020; Fig. 4C). A similar expression pattern of MLPH was also found for the rs2292884:A>G SNP (P = 0.0084 in benign, P = 0.058 in tumor tissue; Fig. 4D). For rs7584330:A>G, a lower expression was only evident in tumor tissue (P = 0.047; Fig. 4E). To further confirm the influence of AR on MLPH expression, we correlated the expression of AR and MLPH proteins in the prostate tissues and found a significant positive correlation of immunoreactivities (r = 0.548, P < 0.0001; Fig. 4F). In addition, we investigated the effect of the SNP genotypes on MLPH mRNA expression in prostate tissues by qRT\u2010PCR. Overall, different alleles of rs11891426:T>G, rs2292884:A>G, and rs7584330:A>G were not associated with significantly different mRNA expression levels (Supp. Fig. S6A). A stratification into benign and cancer\u2010derived RNA samples showed decreased mRNA expression associated with the minor allels of rs11891426:T>G, rs2292884:A>G, and rs7584330:A>G in cancer tissues; however, a close to statistical significance was obtained only with rs2292884:A>G (Supp. Fig. S6B\u2013D). Again, there was a significant positive correlation of MLPH and AR mRNA levels (r = 0.265, P = 0.001; Supp. Fig. S6E). Different to protein levels, MLPH mRNA levels in tumor (n = 77) were significantly higher compared with benign tissues (n = 74) (Supp. Fig. S6F). An analysis of the correlation of MLPH genotypes and disease characteristics revealed an association of the AG and GG genotypes of rs7584330:A>G with lower pathological stages (pT2 vs. pT3 and pT4; P = 0.021). All other genotypes showed no significant association with any clinicopathological parameters (Supp. Table S3). In order to further investigate a possible role of MLPH in PCa, we correlated MLPH expression with clinical characteristics and clinical outcome. Higher MLPH immunoreactivity in radical prostatectomy specimens was associated with lower Gleason scores (Gleason score \u22643+4 vs. \u22654+3; Fig. 5A) and with lower pathological stages (pT2 vs. pT3 and pT4; Fig. 5B), whereby the latter failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.1). A significant higher protein expression was also associated with lower relative tumor mass (tumor mass <10% vs. \u226510%), although the expression level was not associated with tumor volume itself (Fig. 5C and D). In line with these observations, higher immunoreactivity scores were found in patients without a biochemical (PSA) tumor recurrence (statistically significant in benign samples, close to significance in all samples; Fig. 5E), and in patients with a lower serum PSA (\u22644 vs. > 4 ng/ml; Fig. 5F). Higher expression was also associated with younger age at tumor diagnosis (\u226460 vs. >60 years; Fig. 5G), whereas no association was observed with % free PSA (>13.05% vs. \u226413.05%; Fig. 5H). With regard to MLPH mRNA expression differences, no parameter used for patient stratification showed a significant association (Supp. Fig. 7A\u2013H). Solely within several stratification groups, the expression level was significantly higher in tumor compared with benign tissue. Taken together, the pattern of MLPH expression reveals higher protein levels mainly associated with lower risk tumor parameters thus indicating a tumor\u2010suppressive function of this protein in PCa. Using ChIP\u2010seq, we profiled genome\u2010wide androgen\u2010dependent ARBSs in DUCaP cells, which harbor a TMPRSS2\u2010ERG gene rearrangement, a genetic alteration found in 40%\u201370% of prostate tumors [Rubin et\u00a0al., 2011; Schaefer et\u00a0al., 2013]. A total number of 39,156 ARBSs were detected in the DUCaP cells, which is markedly higher than the number of binding sites found in the LNCaP cell line and comparable to the binding sites identified in the VCaP cells, a bone\u2010metastasis counterpart of DUCaP derived from the same patient [van Bokhoven et\u00a0al., 2003; Massie et\u00a0al., 2011]. Higher expression levels of AR in DUCaP and VCaP cells were proposed to be responsible for a higher number of genomic binding sites. This is in line with increasing numbers of ARBSs in LNCaP cells manipulated to express higher levels of AR [Urbanucci et\u00a0al., 2012]. Despite different numbers of ARBSs and different molecular characteristics of LNCaP and DUCaP cells, more than 80% of the LNCaP ARBSs overlapped with DUCaP\u2010binding sites, indicating that AR binding to chromatin target sites is mainly dependent on genomic sequences and less on the molecular cell characteristics. Interestingly, of the 19,123 genes with ARBSs, only 1,490 were actually identified as primary AR target genes in DUCaP cells upon their uniform regulation after 8 and 24 hr of androgen stimulation. Although there is a high degree of overlap of genes harboring ARBSs in different AR\u2010positive PCa cell lines, the concordance of actually androgen\u2010regulated genes among different cellular models is much smaller. For example, less than half of the LNCaP genes we found androgen\u2010regulated in our gene array analysis were also androgen regulated in the DUCaP cells, suggesting a more pronounced influence of molecular properties and cellular phenotype on the actually androgen\u2010regulated gene set. The distribution of ARBSs in DUCaP cells is similar in both androgen\u2010responsive and androgen\u2010unresponsive genes, indicating that other mechanisms, for instance, location of ARBS\u2010harboring genes in regions of either active or inactive chromatin, play a crucial role in addition. Several interacting transcription factors that interrupt AR signaling might also account for this unexpected finding. The TMPRSS2\u2010ERG fusion gene present in DUCaP cells was reported to disrupt AR signaling [Yu et\u00a0al., 2010], and forkhead protein FoxA1 can modulate AR function through either pioneering or masking the pathway [Sahu et\u00a0al., 2011]. A comparative analysis of all ARBSs in the authentic AR primary target genes, identified three dominant AR\u2010binding motifs, two of them, termed motif 2 and 3, are enriched around the transcription start sites of nearby target genes. These two motifs also tend to cluster with each other. Motif 3 is highly similar to a known motif bound by AR (MA0007.1), whereas motif 2 is a potential novel AR\u2010binding motif. By analyzing the activity of this novel motif in an ARBS located in an intron of the MLPH gene, where it is 11 bases distant to a motif 3 element, we found that motif 2 alone could not mediate androgen regulation. It seems to be an auxiliary AR motif and play a modulatory role, fine\u2010tuning AR signaling. Investigating an involvement of PCa risk SNPs in modulating AR signaling, we found that PCa GWAS SNPs and their proxies are highly over\u2010represented in the identified ARBSs. We have chosen rs11891426:T>G located in the novel auxiliary motif 2 in the MLPH AR enhancer to test the functional impact of this SNP in modulating AR transcriptional activity on the respective gene. Reporter gene assays showed a reduced AR transactivation activity when the major T allele was changed to the risk G allele, corroborating the role of this SNP and its host motif 2 in modulating AR regulation of MLPH expression. This role is similar to another SNP located in the TMPRSS2 enhancer that also reduces AR transactivation [Clinckemalie et\u00a0al., 2013]. These findings indicate a potential function of PCa risk SNPs to promote tumorigenesis via modulating AR signaling. In agreement with the enrichment of PCa risk SNPs in ARBSs, recent efforts to prioritize genetic variants for downstream functional evaluation by overlapping risk SNPs with epigenetic marks and expression quantitative trait loci analysis identified genetic variants of which a majority is localized within promoter and enhancer regions [Han et\u00a0al., 2015]. In a similar approach, Al Olama et\u00a0al. (2015) defined a new index risk SNP in the MLPH gene, rs11891348:T>G, which is even closer to rs11891426:T>G in the ARBS than the old index SNP rs2292884:A>G. Genotype\u2013phenotype association analysis of rs11891426:T>G in benign and malignant prostate tissues revealed reduced expression of MLPH in the presence of a risk G allele. This is consistent with the reporter assay result, indicating that this SNP is negatively modulating androgen regulation of MLPH expression. Previous GWAS studies have identified two PCa susceptibility loci at 2q37.3 with the two SNPs, rs2292884:A>G and rs7584330:A>G, located either within or next to the MLPH gene [Haiman et\u00a0al., 2011; Kote\u2010Jarai et\u00a0al., 2011a, 2011b; Schumacher et\u00a0al., 2011]. The risk G allele of rs2292884:A>G, which has a stronger linkage disequilibrium with rs11891426:T>G compared with rs7584330:A>G, also strongly correlated with reduced MLPH gene expression in human prostates. Along with the evidence of rs11891426:T>G as a putative risk SNP within the MLPH\u2010ARBS and the correlation of MLPH and AR expression in prostate tissue at protein and mRNA level, these data further imply a predisposition to PCa via modulating MLPH gene expression. MLPH is a member of the exophilin subfamily of Rab effector proteins, an interaction partner of the small Ras\u2010related GTP\u2010ases Rab27A and Rab27B on one hand and of the motor protein myosin on the other [Fukuda et\u00a0al., 2002]. The complex MLPH/Rab27/myosin is required for the polarized transport of melanosomes along the actin cytoskeleton in melanocytes [Matesic et\u00a0al., 2001], for the pigmentation of the hair and skin [Menasche et\u00a0al., 2000] and for the secretion pathway [Fukuda, 2013]. Little is known about a possible functional impact in carcinogenesis or tumor progression. Dysregulation of MLPH was found in several types of tumors, for example, lung cancer, meningiomas, and breast cancer [Fevre\u2010Montange et\u00a0al., 2009; Pio et\u00a0al., 2010; Thakkar et\u00a0al., 2010; Molina\u2010Pinelo et\u00a0al., 2014]. A very recent study found association of expression of MLPH (and some other genes) with nearby SNPs in prostate tissue [Penney et\u00a0al., 2015]. In non\u2010small cell lung cancer MLPH mRNA was identified as a target of differentially expressed miRNAs [Molina\u2010Pinelo et\u00a0al., 2014]. Interestingly, MLPH was found to be significantly overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer suggesting a regulation of this protein by estrogen hormones [Thakkar et\u00a0al., 2010]. In our study, we found both androgen regulation in PCa cells and significant positive correlations of MLPH and AR mRNAs and proteins in benign and malignant prostate tissue implying AR involvement in MLPH regulation in vivo. Most interestingly, correlation of MLPH expression to clinicopathological variables of patients revealed a clear correlation of higher expression with a favorable risk profile, including lower Gleason grades, lower pathological stages, smaller relative tumor mass, absence of biochemical tumor recurrence, and lower serum PSA. Solely, the correlation with lower patients\u2019 age at diagnosis does not fit into this line. Taken together, the expression pattern of MLPH points toward a tumor\u2010suppressive function of MLPH, which is weakened in the presence of a rs11891426:T>G risk G allele by attenuation of androgen and AR\u2010regulated expression of MLPH. Our work took advantage of next\u2010generation sequencing for genome wide profiling of ARBSs in the DUCaP PCa cell line that represents tumors harboring ERG gene rearrangements. We deciphered a possible regulatory mechanism of a PCa GWAS candidate gene, MLPH, and its link to the androgenome. The mechanism of MLHP regulation in benign and malignant prostate tissues identified a highly likely causative SNP, rs11891426:T>G, around 50 kb away from the originally associated PCa risk index SNPs. Higher expression of MLPH in the prostate tissue of cancer patients with a favorable risk profile provides evidence for a tumor\u2010suppressive function of this protein. Collectively, our study reveals that identifying the plausible causative SNP for a complex disease requires careful functional assessment of each SNP around the GWAS index SNPs. Further work is needed to clarify in\u2010depth its role in disease development and the function of MLPH in benign and malignant prostate cells.

However, bypassing the deleterious stop codon can lead to a mild disease outcome. Splicing at NAGNAG tandem splice sites has been reported to result in insertion or deletion (indel) of three nucleotides. We identified such a mechanism as the origin of the mild to asymptomatic phenotype observed in cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the E831X mutation (2623G>T) in the CFTR gene. Analyses performed on nasal epithelial cell mRNA detected three distinct isoforms, a considerably more complex situation than expected for a single nucleotide substitution. Structure-function studies and in silico analyses provided the first experimental evidence of an indel of a stop codon by alternative splicing at a NAGNAG acceptor site. In addition to contributing to proteome plasticity, alternative splicing at a NAGNAG tandem site can thus remove a disease-causing UAG stop codon. This molecular study reveals a naturally occurring mechanism where the effect of either modifier genes or epigenetic factors could be suspected. This finding is of importance for genetic counseling as well as for deciding appropriate therapeutic strategies.\n", "fulltext": "Premature termination codons (PTCs) are usually associated with severe phenotypes. However, mild disease outcomes can occur by at least three different mechanisms. First, translation can be initiated at an internal start codon located downstream from the PTC. Second, PTCs can trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a pathway that protects the cell from aberrant transcripts. Third, nonsense-associated alternative splicing (NAS) can remove the exon harboring the PTC. Subtle changes in alternative splicing events have recently been reported at particular tandem acceptor splice sites, NAGNAG sites (where N represents any nucleotide)\u2013. The use of the intron proximal or distal splice site results in the production of two distinct isoforms distinguished by three nucleotides (NAG). This alternative splicing could result in the creation or deletion of a stop codon. The latter event would thus constitute another mechanism of PTC removal, but has never been described in human pathophysiology. Splice events at short-distance tandem sites are widespread and contribute to transcriptome and proteome complexity. NAGNAG acceptor motifs are present in 30% of human genes and several studies based on computational analysis using expressed sequence tag (EST) databases showed that at least 5% of human genes contain an experimentally confirmed NAGNAG tandem site. A subtle splice event associated with Stargardt's disease 1, in which a mutation in the ABCA4 gene produced an indel of one amino acid in 50% of the transcripts from one patient, has been described. Nonetheless, the involvement of mutations that alter tandem sites have not been extensively studied in disease. Therefore, to explore further the effect of mutations located within a NAGNAG acceptor motif, we studied the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Querying the Tandem Splice Site DataBase (TassDB), a comprehensive online database dedicated to recognizing tandem acceptor sites, identified two NAGNAG motifs in CFTR. Mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a cAMP-regulated Cl\u2212 channel located at the apical membrane of epithelial cells, cause cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is the most common severe autosomal recessive genetic disorder in Caucasians and affects the physiology of the lung, gastrointestinal tract, reproductive organs, and sweat glands. Mutations in the CFTR gene induce a continuum of phenotypes ranging from mild manifestations with isolated features such as congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), or nasal polyposis, to severe disease symptoms. Therefore, CF is a good model to identify novel modifier mechanisms. Here, we show that alternative splicing at a tandem acceptor site removes a premature UAG stop codon and leads to synthesis of a functional protein. This novel PTC removal mechanism explains the mild phenotype detected in several patients. In this study, we focused on the rare E831X mutation (2623G>T) which affects the first nucleotide of exon 14a which forms part of one of the two NAGNAG acceptor sites detected in the CFTR gene. We had the opportunity to study a consanguineous family of Turkish origin which included three patients (Figure 1A) homozygous for the E831X mutation (Figure 1B). To evaluate the functional consequences of this mutation in a tandem splice motif, we performed transcript analysis on epithelial cells obtained from patient III10 (Figure 1A) by nasal brushing, which is the least invasive technique and provides the most reliable cells to study CFTR mRNA. Mutations that generate PTCs can reduce the steady-state level of mRNA via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Total RNA from nasal epithelial cells of patient III10 was first quantified to evaluate the amount of CFTR transcripts. Quantitative analysis by real-time PCR was normalized to that of keratin 18 (KRT18), a marker of ciliated and secretory epithelial cells,. The results clearly showed that the level of CFTR mRNA was reduced by half in the sample from patient III10 compared to three control samples (48%\u00b19% compared to WT, Figure 2A), showing that the CFTR mRNAs were subject to NMD. To evaluate the mRNA pattern associated with the 2623G>T mutation, a semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed and the products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. In control samples, two peaks could be detected: a major peak corresponding to the full-length mRNA (97%\u00b10.5%) and a minor peak corresponding to exon 14a skipping (3%\u00b10.5%) (Figure 2B), a feature of CFTR splicing that has been described previously. In the patient III10 sample, a more complex pattern appeared, with the presence of three distinct peaks (Figure 2B) that were subsequently identified by sequencing: a major peak corresponding to exon 14a skipping (76%\u00b12%) (Figure 2B and 2C) and two additional peaks corresponding to a full-length mRNA containing the stop codon (16%\u00b12%) and an mRNA lacking these three nucleotides (8%\u00b10.8%) (Figure 2B and 2D). Hence, the 2623G>T substitution induced two effects: a reduced level of full-length mRNA containing the stop codon by NMD and the generation of additional mRNA isoforms. These mRNAs were identified as an mRNA lacking exon 14a, a full-length mRNA containing the premature UAG stop codon, and a third mRNA lacking the three nucleotides encoding the UAG stop codon. To investigate whether the alternative splicing was due to the 2623G>T mutation, we constructed a hybrid minigene containing CFTR exon 14a and approximately 400 nucleotides of its flanking intronic regions. After transfection in the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, RT-PCR samples were separated by capillary electrophoresis analysis and isoforms were identified by sequencing. As in the direct transcript analysis, the wild-type construct revealed a low level of exon 14a skipping (7%\u00b10.8%). The 2623G>T substitution increased exon 14a skipping up to 92%\u00b12%. In addition, two peaks could be detected corresponding to full-length mRNA (7%\u00b12%) and to the isoform lacking three nucleotides (0.8%.\u00b10.5%) (Figure 3A and 3C). To focus on these two lower abundance isoforms, a reverse primer within exon 14a was used to amplify mRNAs containing exon 14a specifically. A single peak was detected in mRNA obtained from cells transfected with the wild-type construct, whereas two peaks were detected in mRNA from cells transfected with the 2623G>T construct. The major peak corresponded to full-length mRNA containing the UAG stop codon (88%\u00b10.5%) and the mRNA in the minor peak lacked these three nucleotides (12%\u00b10.5%) (Figure 3B and 3C). The ratio between these two isoforms was comparable using either reverse primer. The relative amounts of the three isoforms differed from the amounts measured for endogenous CFTR, but the minigene construct containing the mutated exon 14a sequence reproduced the in vivo splicing pattern. Therefore, the single nucleotide substitution (2623G>T) is the main determinant of alternative splicing at this site. Recognition of the 3\u2032 splice site upstream of exon 14a generates full-length mRNA leading to synthesis of the entire CFTR protein. The CFTR channel is composed of two transmembrane spanning domains, two nucleotide binding folds, and a regulatory domain (R domain). The regulatory domain is encoded by exon 13 (orange) and exon 14a encodes the region linking the regulatory domain to the seventh transmembrane segment (blue) (Figure 4A). The 2623G>T mutation which occurs at the first base of exon 14a induced multiple splicing defects, including exon skipping. An mRNA lacking exon 14a encodes a protein missing the linker domain between the R domain and the seventh transmembrane segment (CFTR-del831-873, Figure 4B). In addition to the full-length mRNA containing the UAG stop codon, alternative splicing at the NAGNAG site generated an mRNA lacking this stop codon. The resulting proteins would be either truncated after the regulatory domain (CFTR-E831X, Figure 4C) or missing one amino acid (CFTR-\u0394E831, Figure 4D), respectively. The processing of CFTR can be assessed by examining its glycosylation state. Western blot analysis of wild-type CFTR protein, transiently (Figure 5A, left panels) or stably (Figure 5A, right panel) expressed in HEK293 cells, revealed two bands. The diffuse band of 170 kDa (band C) corresponds to the mature, fully glycosylated protein and the thin band of approximately 140 kDa (band B) represents the core-glycosylated immature CFTR. Similar analysis of transiently expressed CFTR-del831-873 revealed a unique thin band indicating a maturation defect (Figure 5A, higher left panel) that was further investigated using an N-Glycosidase F assay (Figure S1). After enzymatic treatment of CFTR-WT, both bands B and C were converted to the lower apparent molecular weight non-glycosylated band A. CFTR-del831-873 was not affected by the enzymatic treatment, indicating an absence of glycosylation of this protein, thus identifying the first naturally occurring non-glycosylated CFTR mutant. Stably expressed CFTR-E831X protein was detected as a single band at the expected size (Figure 5A, right panel), while transiently expressed CFTR-\u0394E831 showed a normal maturation profile with the presence of both bands B and C (Figure 5A, lower left panel). Immunostaining of transiently transfected HeLa cells confirmed a processing defect in both the CFTR-del831-873 and CFTR-E831X mutant proteins as they could only be detected in intracellular compartments close to the nucleus, whereas both CFTR-WT and CFTR-\u0394E831 showed clear cell surface staining (Figure 5B). Finally, functional assays showed the absence of CFTR-dependent anion transport in cells expressing either CFTR-del831-873 or CFTR-E831X. In contrast, a high level of anion transport was observed with CFTR-WT and CFTR-\u0394E831, in accordance with the biochemical and immunocytochemical results above (Figure 5C and 5D). Therefore, we conclude that CFTR-\u0394E831 represents the functional form accounting for the mild phenotype observed within this family. CF was suspected in the first year of life in patient III10 (Figure 1A) due to recurrent bronchitis, and this was confirmed by a positive sweat test (70 mmol/L). The patient was tested and found to be homozygous for the nonsense mutation E831X. After familial study, CF was diagnosed in his 18-year-old sister (III5), who also had a positive sweat test and the same genotype. However, the two siblings, now aged 13 and 30, are in good health with no evidence of pancreatic insufficiency, and have normal lung function tests. The female patient married her first cousin who was found to be an E831X carrier. Their son (IV1) is homozygous for the E831X mutation. Now 5 years of age, he presents with a positive sweat test (74 mmol/L), but yearly clinical assessments are normal (Table 1). Interestingly, this mutation was first described in a female CF patient carrying the severe missense substitution G551D on the other allele. E831X was considered as a severe mutation because she presented with meconium ileus at birth, a neonate pulmonary infection and an elevated sweat test. Given our results, we requested yearly clinical assessments, which indicated no pulmonary exacerbation, an almost normal chest radiograph, moderate pancreatic insufficiency and normal abdominal ultrasound. Thus, her clinical outcome was better than expected at birth. This mutation was also reported in two 13-year-old male twins of Turkish origin carrying an in-frame deletion on the other allele (591del18). These twins had persistent nasal polyps and elevated sweat tests, but no pancreas or lung involvement. Subsequently, E831X was reported to be the allele present in cohorts of men with CBAVD and mild to severe mutations, such as \u0394F508, for the other allele\u2013. These clinical observations and our data bring the deleterious nature of the E831X mutation into question; but how can the minor functional CFTR-\u0394E831 isoform lead to such mild phenotypes? The minimal level of CFTR mRNA required to maintain normal function differs between organs, with the vas deferens being the most sensitive tissue. CFTR-\u0394E831 mRNAs did not appear to reach this threshold in all tissues, leading to mild phenotypes such as nasal polyposis or CBAVD in compound heterozygotes. In the nasal epithelial cells of patient III10, mRNAs encoding functional CFTR-\u0394E831 were estimated at 8%. As total CFTR transcripts were reduced to 48% compared to WT levels, this amount can be corrected down to 4%, a level comparable to previous studies associated with mild lung disease,. However, the relative level of each transcript may differ between patients, as the same PTC has been shown to elicit NMD with variable efficiency in CF nasal epithelial cells, thus reducing the amount of full-length mRNA containing the stop codon. The intron 13/exon 14a boundary, illustrated in Figure 6, shows the presence of a proximal acceptor site in the intron and a distal acceptor site in the exon, typical of a NAGNAG motif. The use of the proximal or distal acceptor site is regulated by multiple factors. First, the strength of the acceptor site depends on the site itself (CAG>TAG>AAG), the polypyrimidine tract, and the branch point sequences. In addition, the branch point sequence-to-NAGNAG region in the 3\u2032 tandem splice site was shown to participate in 3\u2032 splice-site selection. This selection could also be modulated by RNA-binding proteins because exonic or intronic splicing enhancer (ESE, ISE) and silencer (ESS, ISS) sites have been described as overabundant in the vicinity of tandem 3\u2032 splice sites compared to constitutively spliced exons. Lastly, the nucleotides composing the NAGNAG acceptor site are also tightly implicated in the recognition of either the proximal or distal splice site. NAGNAG acceptor sites have been classified with respect to their splicing plausibility. Plausible sites allow the use of both acceptor sites, whereas implausible ones allow the use of a single site. The 2623G>T substitution converts the NAGNAG acceptor motif from an implausible CAGGAG (use of the proximal site) into a plausible CAGTAG motif (use of either proximal or distal splice sites). Therefore, the mutation would favor the use of the distal splice site, resulting in bypass of the PTC and explaining the mechanism leading to an mRNA lacking three nucleotides (Figure 6). In silico analysis using software dedicated to analyzing NAGNAG motifs (BayNAGNAG) predicted a shift in the probability of using both the proximal and distal acceptor sites from 0.2% to 81.2%, consistent with our in vivo results (Table 2). The first description of a disease-causing mutation in a NAGNAG splice site was reported in the ABCA4 gene, before the description of the NAGNAG motif by Hiller et al. in 2004. This mutation (2588G>C) was shown to produce two isoforms leading to either an indel of Gly863 or to a missense defect, Gly863Ala, by shifting the NAGNAG motif from an implausible sequence (TAGGAG) into a plausible sequence (TAGCAG). Similarly, in silico analysis predicted an increase in the probability of using either distal or proximal acceptor sites from 0.1% to 57.7% (Table 2). Our study demonstrated that disease-causing mutations in NAGNAG are predictive of alternative splicing, as previously proposed for single nucleotide polymorphisms in NAGNAG acceptors. Therefore, in the absence of mRNA samples, such splicing events could be anticipated by in silico analysis. The removal of a deleterious PTC could apply to many genes, as the configuration we have described is frequent in the human genome. Indeed, NAGGAG represents the most frequent NAGNAG motif recognizable upstream of a coding exon. Querying the TassDB retrieved 4882 occurrences of the NAGGAG motif with GAG in a coding exon, representing 4597 genes. Among these NAGGAG motifs, 52.2% (n\u200a=\u200a2551) are in intron phase 0, a configuration that leads to the first amino acid of the exon being a Glu, as shown in this study. We can therefore hypothesize that bypass of a deleterious PTC could occur when similar GAG to TAG mutations affect one of the 2551 NAGGAG motifs within the human genome. In addition to contributing to proteome plasticity, alternative splicing at tandem 3\u2032 acceptor sites can also result in in vivo removal of a premature UAG stop codon. This feature differentiates the UAG stop codon from UAA or UGA and may help explain phenotype/genotype discrepancies. The novel PTC removal mechanism would be expected to lead to mild phenotypes, with the deletion of a single amino acid being potentially less deleterious than a truncating mutation. This study also emphasizes the biological significance of alternative splicing at tandem acceptor sites in the context of disease-causing mutations. Subtle splicing events could be considered simply as noise tolerated by the cell; however, considering point mutations at NAGNAG acceptor sites clearly provides evidence of their functional relevance. Alternative splicing at these acceptor sites could define a novel phenotype-modifying mechanism buffering deleterious nonsense mutations. Overall, this study highlights the importance of thoroughly characterizing the molecular defects in patients with milder than expected phenotypes. Indeed, such molecular studies can reveal naturally occurring mechanisms where modifier genes or epigenetic factors have been suspected to have an effect. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the local ethics committee approved the study. Cells obtained from nasal brushings were immediately transferred into RNA-Later buffer (Qiagen) and total RNA was purified as recommended by the manufacturer using QiaQuick Spin columns (Qiagen). Two independent RT-PCR assays were performed with 400 ng of total RNA for each sample (Applied Biosystems). CFTR and KRT18 primers and probes (TaqMan FAM/NFQ-MGB probe format) were designed by Applied Biosystems. PCR reactions contained the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay Mix, TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, no AmpErase UNG, and 1 \u00b5l cDNA (or 1 \u00b5l of DNase/RNase free water for the No Template Control) in a final volume of 20 \u00b5l. Samples were placed in 96-well plates and amplified in an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Amplification conditions were 10 min at 95.0\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95.0\u00b0C and 1 min at 60.0\u00b0C. All reactions were run in triplicate and each sample was run in two QPCR assays. To correct for variations in the amount of input RNA and efficiency of the reverse transcription, KRT18 (which is specifically expressed in ciliated and secretory epithelial cells) was quantified and results were normalized to these values. Relative amounts of CFTR mRNA were measured using the 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394CT method. A control sample was chosen as a calibrator, i.e., as the baseline for the comparative results. Semi-quantitative RT-PCRs were performed using 1 \u00b5l cDNA templates with a sense FAM-labeled primer in exon 13 (5\u2032-AGTGTCACTGGCCCCTCAG-3\u2032) and a reverse primer in exon 17 (5\u2032-GTGTCGGCTACTCCCACGTA-3\u2032) or in exon 14a (5\u2032-CATGTAGTCACTGCTGGTATGCT-3\u2032) in a 20 \u00b5l total volume. PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 5 min followed by linear phase amplification of 29 cycles or 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 20 sec, 60\u00b0C for 20 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 20 sec. All samples were then extended at 72\u00b0C for 1 min and, finally, cooled to 4\u00b0C in a 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Capillary electrophoresis analysis (GeneScan) was performed using 1 \u00b5l of the diluted PCR mixture (1/40) added to 18.5 \u00b5l of formamide and 0.1 \u00b5l of ROX 400 HD fluorescent size standards (Applied Biosystems). The mixture was then denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and cooled to 4\u00b0C. Amplified products were separated on an ABI 3130 XL DNA analyzer using 3130 POP6 and analyzed with the GeneMapper 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Ratios of splicing isoforms were determined as the peak area for the CFTR isoform divided by the total peak areas for the three isoforms. Data represent the mean\u00b1SE of at least two independent measurements performed in triplicate. For sequencing of the different splice variants, PCR was performed using 1 \u00b5l of cDNA templates with a sense primer in exon 13 (5\u2032-AGTGTCACTGGCCCCTCAG-3\u2032) and a reverse primer in exon 17 (5\u2032-GTGTCGGCTACTCCCACGTA-3\u2032) or in exon 14a (5\u2032-CATGTAGTCACTGCTGGTATGCT-3\u2032) using the same conditions as described previously for 40 cycles. Following RT-PCR, products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and bands of interest were excised and purified using a gel extraction kit (Promega). Samples were subsequently sequenced using both forward and reverse primers. HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% SVF and 1% PS. BEAS-2B cells (CRL-9609) cells were grown in LHC-8 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells stably expressing CFTR-WT or CFTR-E831X were selected using Zeocin (50 \u00b5g/mL). CFTR-WT cDNA was subcloned in pTracer and CFTR-E831X, CFTR-\u0394E831 and CFTR-del-831-873 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and each construct was sequenced. A fragment comprising exon14a, 387 bp of the upstream intron 13 and 371 bp of the downstream intron 14a was PCR amplified from genomic DNA obtained from a healthy volunteer or from patient III10 using the following primers: 5\u2032-GGACCCCTGAAGAAACAGGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCCTTCTACTTTGAGCTTTCG-3\u2032. PCR products were subcloned into pCR II (Invitrogen) and inserts sequenced before subcloning into the pET01 vector (Mobitec) at the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites. Minigenes containing either the exon 14a-WT or the 2623G>T mutation and flanking introns (387 bp upstream and 371 bp downstream of exon 14a) were transfected in BEAS-2B cells seeded in 6-well plates. Total RNA was purified as recommended by the manufacturer using QiaQuick Spin columns (Qiagen). The mRNA concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The mRNA (1.5 \u00b5g in a final volume of 20 \u00b5l) was DNAse treated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C before heat denaturation of the enzyme (Quiagen). Treated mRNA (400 ng) was used to perform RT-PCR using the High capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Ten percent of the RT-PCR product was PCR amplified using primers specific to the splice donor and splice acceptor exons of the pET01 plasmid (5\u2032-FAM-GTGACAGCTGCCAGGATCG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAGTGCCAAGGTCTGAAGGT-3\u2032). PCR was conducted at 94\u00b0C for 5 min followed by linear phase amplification of 20 cycles or 21 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 20 sec, 60\u00b0C for 20 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 20 sec. All samples were then extended at 72\u00b0C for 1 min and, finally, cooled to 4\u00b0C in a 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Capillary electrophoresis analysis of the PCR products was performed as previously described. Ratios of splicing isoforms were determined as the peak area of the considered isoform divided by the total peak areas. Sequencing was performed on the 21 cycle PCR products generated with the internal primer using an unlabeled forward primer located within the splice donor exon of the pET01 plasmid. Data represent the mean\u00b1SE of at least two independent measurements performed in duplicate. HEK293 cells were plated on 100 mm dishes and transiently transfected with CFTR-WT, CFTR-del831-873 or CFTR-\u0394E831. Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described with a C-terminal directed anti-CFTR antibody (24-1, R&D systems). Cells stably expressing CFTR-E831X or CFTR-WT were lysed in 1X RIPA buffer and samples containing 30 \u00b5g total protein were analyzed by Western blot. After gel electrophoresis and transfer, membranes were probed using the MM13-4 antibody (Millipore) directed against the N-terminal region of CFTR. Direct recording of the chemiluminescence was performed using the CCD camera of the GeneGnome analyzer and quantification using the GeneTools software (Syngene BioImaging Systems, Synoptics Ltd). HEK293 cells were plated on 60 mm dishes and transiently transfected with CFTR-WT or CFTR-del831-873. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and lysed in N-Glycosidase F buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Igepal, supplemented with protease inhibitors. N-Glycosidase F (3 Units, Roche) was added to lysates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C and one tenth of the volume of each sample was analyzed by Western blot. HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected with the appropriate construct. The following day, cells were fixed using ice-cold methanol. Cells were permeabilized (1% BSA, 0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS) and, then, incubated with the primary antibody, MM13-4 anti-CFTR, diluted 1/200, for 2 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody (1/500 dilution, AlexaFluor 488 conjugated, Invitrogen) was then added and incubated 1 h. Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (4, 6-Diamino-2-phenylindol) and analyzed using a Leica DMR epifluorescence microscope. CFTR activity was determined in transiently transfected HEK293 cells using the halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein YFP-H148Q/I152L as described previously. Cells were plated in 96-well microplates (2.5\u00d7104 cells/well) and co-transfected with CFTR and halide-sensitive YFP. The CFTR functional assay was carried out 48 h after transfection. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes with PBS containing forskolin (20 \u00b5M) before being transferred to an Olympus IX 50 fluorescence microscope (Chroma; excitation: HQ500/20X; emission: HQ535/30M; dichroic: 515 nm), equipped with a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu) for detection of fluorescence. Cell fluorescence was continuously measured before and after addition of NaI (final NaI concentration: 100 mM). The signal was digitized using a PowerLab 2/25 acquisition system (ADInstruments). Cell fluorescence recordings were normalized to the initial average value measured before addition of NaI. Signal decay was fitted to a double exponential function to derive the maximal slope corresponding to initial influx of I\u2212 into the cells. Maximal slopes were converted to rates of change in intracellular I\u2212 concentration (in mM/s) using the equation: d[I\u2212]/dt\u200a=\u200aKI[d(F/F0)/dt] where KI is the affinity constant of YFP for I\u2212 and F/F0 is the ratio of the cell fluorescence at a given time vs. initial fluorescence.

In order to comprehensively characterize the genome of this cell line and to serve as a model of broad cancer genome sequencing, we have generated greater than 30\u00d7 genomic sequence coverage using a novel 50-base mate paired strategy with a 1.4kb mean insert library. A total of 1,014,984,286 mate-end and 120,691,623 single-end two-base encoded reads were generated from five slides. All data were aligned using a custom designed tool called BFAST, allowing optimal color space read alignment and accurate identification of DNA variants. The aligned sequence reads and mate-pair information identified 35 interchromosomal translocation events, 1,315 structural variations (>100 bp), 191,743 small (<21 bp) insertions and deletions (indels), and 2,384,470 single nucleotide variations (SNVs). Among these observations, the known homozygous mutation in PTEN was robustly identified, and genes involved in cell adhesion were overrepresented in the mutated gene list. Data were compared to 219,187 heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms assayed by Illumina 1M Duo genotyping array to assess accuracy: 93.83% of all SNPs were reliably detected at filtering thresholds that yield greater than 99.99% sequence accuracy. Protein coding sequences were disrupted predominantly in this cancer cell line due to small indels, large deletions, and translocations. In total, 512 genes were homozygously mutated, including 154 by SNVs, 178 by small indels, 145 by large microdeletions, and 35 by interchromosomal translocations to reveal a highly mutated cell line genome. Of the small homozygously mutated variants, 8 SNVs and 99 indels were novel events not present in dbSNP. These data demonstrate that routine generation of broad cancer genome sequence is possible outside of genome centers. The sequence analysis of U87MG provides an unparalleled level of mutational resolution compared to any cell line to date.\n", "fulltext": "Grade IV glioma, also called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most common primary malignant brain tumor with about 16,000 new diagnoses each year in the United States. While the number of cases is relatively small, comprising only 1.35% of primary malignant cancers in the US, GBMs have a one-year survival rate of only 29.6%, making it one of the most deadly types of cancer. Recent clinical studies demonstrate improved survival with a combination of radiation and Temozolomide chemotherapy, but median survival time for GBM patients who receive therapy is only 15 months. Due to its highly aggressive nature and poor therapeutic options, understanding the genetic etiology of GBM is of great interest and therefore, GBM has been selected as one of the three initial cancer types to be thoroughly studied in the TCGA program. To that end, numerous cell line models of GBM have been established and used in vast numbers of studies over the years. It is well recognized that cell line models of human disorders, especially cancers, are an important resource. While these cell lines are the basis of substantial biological insight, experiments are currently performed in the absence of genome-wide mutational status as no cell line that models a human disease has yet had its genome fully sequenced. Here, we have sequenced the genome of U87MG, a long established cell line derived from a human grade IV glioma used in over 1,700 publications. A wide range of biological information is known about this cell line. The U87MG cell line is known to have a highly aberrant genomic structure based on karyotyping, SKY, and FISH. However, these methods neither provide the resolution required to visualize the precise breakpoint of a translocation event, nor are they generally capable of identifying genomic microdeletions (deletions on the order of a megabase or less in size) in a whole genome survey of structural variation. SNP genotyping microarrays can be used to detect regions of structural variation in the forms of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number (CN) based on probe intensity, but do not reveal chromosomal joins. To assess the genomic stability of U87MG, the genome was genotyped by Illumina Human 1M-Duo BeadChip microarray. In spite of being cultured independently for several years, the regions of LOH and the CN state of our U87MG genome matched exactly with data retrieved from the Sanger COSMIC database for U87MG, which had been assayed on an Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. This suggests that although U87MG bears a large number of large-scale chromosomal aberrations, it has been relatively stable for years and is not rapidly changing. This suggests that prior work on U87MG may be reinterpreted based on the whole genome sequence data presented here. The first draft of the consensus sequence of the human genome was reported in 2001,. The first individual human diploid sequence was sequenced using capillary-based Sanger sequencing. Since then, a few additional diploid human genomes have been published utilizing a variety of massively parallel sequencing techniques to sequence human genomes to varying degrees of coverage, variant discovery, and quality typically costing well over $200,000 and several machine months of operation\u2013. For the sequencing of U87MG, we utilized ABI SOLiD technology, which uses a ligation-based assay with two-base color-encoded oligonucleotides that has been demonstrated to allow highly accurate single nucleotide variant (SNV) and insertion/deletion (indel) detection. Additionally, long mate-paired genomic libraries with a mean insert size of 1\u20132kb allowed higher clone coverage of the genome, which improved our ability to identify genomic structural variations such as interchromosomal translocations and large deletions. While longer insert sizes would improve resolution of some structural variants, during genomic shearing the highest density of large fragments occurs at 1.5kb, allowing a sufficiently complex library to be generated from only 10 micrograms of genomic DNA while still being well powered to identify structural variations. Here, we demonstrate that aligning the two-base color-encoding data with BFAST software and decoding during alignment allows for highly sensitive detection of indels, which have in the past been difficult to detect by short read massively parallel sequencing. For cancer sequencing, it is important to assess not only SNVs, but indels, structural variations and translocations, and it is preferable to extract this information from a common assay platform. A major characteristic of the U87MG cell line that differentiates it from the samples used in other whole genome sequencing projects published thus far is its highly aberrant genomic structure. Due to its heavily rearranged state, we thoroughly and accurately assessed each of these major classes of mutations and demonstrated that small indels, large microdeletions and interchromosomal translocations are actually the major categories of mutations that affect known genes in this cancer cell line. These analyses provide a model for other genome sequencing projects outside major genome centers of how to both thoroughly sequence and assess the mutational state of whole genomes. From ten micrograms of input genomic DNA, we performed two and a half full sequencing runs on the ABI SOLiD Sequencing System, for a total of five full slides of data. Utilizing the ABI long mate-pair protocol, we produced 1,014,984,286 raw 50bp mate-paired reads (101.5Gb). In some cases the bead was recognized by the imaging software for only one read, thereby producing an additional 120,691,623 single end reads (6.0Gb). In aggregate, we generated a total of 107.5Gb of raw data (Table 1). We also performed an exon capture approach designed to sequence the exons of 5,253 genes (10.7Mb) annotated in the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) V38, Cancer Gene Census, Cancer Genome Project Planned Studies and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM gene list using a custom-created Agilent array. This approach used the Illumina GAII sequencing system to sequence captured DNA fragments using a paired end sequencing protocol. This resulted in 9,948,782 raw 76bp paired end reads (1.51Gb), and a mean base coverage of 29.5\u00d7. These reads were used to calculate concordance rates with the larger whole genome sequence dataset. The Blat-like Fast Accurate Search Tool (BFAST) version 0.5.3 was used to align 107.5Gb of raw color space reads to the color space conversion of the human genome assembly hg18 from University of California, Santa Cruz (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/bigZips/, based on the March 2006 NCBI build 36.1). Duplicate reads, typically from the same initial PCR fragment during genomic library construction, were inevitable and accounted for 16.4% of the total aligned data. These were removed using the alignment filtering utility in the DNAA package (http://dnaa.sourceforge.net). A total of 390,604,184 paired end reads (39.06Gb), 266,635,829 (13.33Gb) unpaired reads, and 62,336,824 (3.12Gb) single end reads were successfully mapped to a unique location in the reference genome with high confidence for a total of 55.51Gb of aligned sequence (Table 1). For the exon capture dataset, we uniquely aligned 8,142,874 paired end reads (1.2Gb) and 1,097,000 (83Mb) unpaired reads for a total of 1.32Gb of raw aligned sequence (Table 2). Using the ABI SOLiD reads, we identified small insertions and deletions (indels), single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and structural variants such as large-scale microdeletions and translocation events. The exon capture Solexa reads were used to validate SNVs identified in the SOLiD sequencing. The overall pattern of base sequence coverage from the shotgun reads changes across the genome, and as expected is highly concordant with the copy number state as determined by Illumina 1M Duo and Affymetrix 6.0 SNP analysis (Figure 1). Regions of two normal copies, such as chromosome 3, showed even base sequence coverage across their entire length (12.4 reads/base, excluding centromeric and telomeric regions which are not represented accurately in hg18). Meanwhile, regions with one-copy state according to the SNP chip, such as the distal q-arm of chr11 and the distal p-arm of chr6, show about half the base sequence coverage (7.2 reads/base) as a predicted two-copy region. Likewise, predicted three-copy state regions, such as the distal q-arm of chr13, show about 1.5 times the base sequence coverage of a predicted two-copy region. A complete deletion spanning the region on chromosome 9 that includes the CDKN2A gene is also seen in both the SNP chip and ABI SOLiD base sequence coverage. These data show at a very large scale that sequence placement is generally correct and supports the copy number state calls from the array based data. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions ranging from 1 to 20 bases (indels) were identified from the alignment data using the MAQ consensus model as implemented in the SAMtools software suite. SAMtools produced variant calls, zygosity predictions, and a Phred-scaled probability that the consensus is identical to the reference. To improve the reliability of our variant calls, variants were required to have a Phred score of at least 10 and further needed to be observed greater than or equal to 4 but less than 60 times and at least once on each strand. In total, we identified 2,384,470 SNVs meeting our filtering criteria. Of these, 2,140,848 (89.8%) were identified as exact matches to entries in dbSNP129. Exact matches had both the variant and observed alleles in the dbSNP entry, allowing for the discovery of novel alleles at known SNP locations. In total, 243,622 SNVs (10.2%) were identified as novel events not previously recorded in dbSNP 129. This rate of novel variant discovery is consistent with other whole human normal genome sequences of European ancestry relative to dbSNP. These SNVs were further characterized based on zygosity predictions from the MAQ consensus model, separating SNVs into homozygous or heterozygous categories (Table 3). The observed diversity value for SNVs (\u03b8SNV, number of heterozygous SNVs/number of base pairs) across autosomal chromosomes was 4.4\u00d710\u22124, which is generally consistent with the normal human genome variation rate. For small (<21bp) insertions and deletions, 191,743 events were detected with 116,964 not previously documented in dbSNP 129. The same criteria as used for SNVs was used for determining if an indel was novel and they were further classified as homozygous or heterozygous using the SAMtools variant caller (Table 4). The observed diversity value (\u03b8indel, number of heterozygous indels/number of base pairs) across autosomal chromosomes was 0.38\u00d710\u22124. A subset of 38 variants meeting genome-wide filtering criteria, including a 20-base deletion, was tested by PCR and Sanger sequencing with 34 being validated. In summary, 85.2% of SNVs (23/27), and 100% of small insertions (3/3), deletions (4/4), translocations (3/3) and microdeletions (1/1) were validated in this manner (Table S1). While this is a small sample, it demonstrates an overall low false positive rate. The size distribution of indels identified in U87MG is generally consistent with previous studies on coding and non-coding indel sizes in non-cancer samples\u2013. Small deletion sizes ranged from 1 to 20 bases in size and their distribution approximates a power law distribution in concordance with previous findings (Figure 2A). There is a small deviation from the power law distribution with an excess of 4-base indels in U87MG's non-coding regions (Figure 2A, red bars),. A similar trend is seen with insertions in non-coding sequence with the maximum observed insertion size of 17 bases (Figure 2B, red bars). The maximum insertion size observed is less than the maximum deletion size because it is easier to align longer deletions than it is to align insertions. Some small insertions and deletions are likely to be larger than the upper limit of 17 and 20 bases actually observed, but the 50-base read length limits the power to align such reads directly. In coding regions, there is a bias towards events that are multiples of 3-bases in length that maintain the reading frame despite variant alleles, suggesting that many of these are polymorphisms (Figure 2A-deletions, Figure 2B-insertions, blue bars). In non-coding regions, only 10.8% of indels are a multiple of 3 bases in size, while in coding regions, 27.0% are 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 bases in size. This trend is expected based on past observations of non-cancer samples,. Observed SNV base substitution patterns were consistent with common mutational phenomena in both coding sequences and genome wide. As expected, the predominant nucleotide substitution seen in SNVs is a transition, changing purine for purine (A<->G) or pyrimidine for pyrimidine (C<->T). Previous studies have observed that two out of every three SNPs are transitions as opposed to transversions, and we observed that 67.4% of our SNVs were transitions, while 32.6% were transversions, a 2.07\u22361 ratio. (Figure 3) However, in coding regions, there appears to be an increase in C->T/G->A transitions and a decrease in T->C/A->G transitions, whereas genome-wide these transitions were approximately equivalent. To assess the coverage depth of the U87MG genome sequence, we followed Ley at al. and required detection of both alleles at most positions in the genome. We utilized the Illumina 1M-Duo BeadChip to find reliably sequenced positions in the genome with an understanding that this may lead to bias towards more unique regions of the genome. In order to best use the SNP genotyping array data, we included only those regions that are diploid based on normal frequency of heterozygous calls and copy number assessment. This effectively permitted us to use the heterozygous calls for assessing accuracy of the short read data for variant calling (Figure 1). Only SNPs both observed to be heterozygous and that the Illumina genotyping chip called \u2018high quality\u2019 were used, which provided a total of 219,187 high quality heterozygous SNPs for comparison. 99.71% of these were sequenced at least once. After applying variant detection filtering criteria (see Materials and Methods) and assessing concordance between the sequence calls and genotyping array calls, 93.71% of the genome was sequenced at sufficient depth to call both alleles of the diploid genome. This is roughly equivalent to the likelihood of sufficient sampling of the whole genome when repeats and segmental duplications are excluded. Notably, a variant allele was observed at every position called heterozygous by SNP chip, while a reference allele was observed at 201,414 (97.94%) positions. In other words, the SNV detection algorithm uniformly miscalled the homozygous variant allele. Filtering for quality causes a bias toward identifying SNVs at sites that have higher coverage. That said, after SNV quality filtering, diploid coverage of the cytogenetically normal portions of the genome was 10.85\u00d7 for each allele, which is clearly adequate for calling over 90% of the base variant positions on each allele at high accuracy. Because the positions of the genome included on SNP arrays is not a random sampling of the genome, we also assessed mapping coverage genome-wide. Of all bases in the haploid genome, 78.9% of the whole reference genome was covered by at least one reliably placed read. Of that portion of the genome, 91.9% of all bases were effectively sequenced based on passing variant calling filters (Phred>10, >4\u00d7 coverage, <60\u00d7 coverage). Thus, a total of 72.5% of the whole genome was sequenced, including repeats and duplicated regions, which is typical of short sequence shotgun approaches. 10.9Mb of genomic sequence was targeted consisting of the amino acid encoding exons of 5,235 genes and were sequenced to a mean coverage of 30\u00d7 using the Illumina GAII sequencer. Given the larger variability of coverage from the capture data, only a subset of these bases (8.5Mb) was evaluable to determine the false positive variant detection rate from the complete genomic sequence data. This region contained 1,621 SNPs present in dbSNP129. Within the 8.5Mb of common and well-covered sequence in the genomic sequence data and the capture sequence, there were 1,780 SNVs called from the genomic sequence. The same non-reference allele was concordantly observed at 1,631 positions within the capture data. At 149 positions, the non-reference allele was not observed in the capture data, but the reference allele was detected. However, the mean coverage at these 149 positions was significantly lower than that of the other 1,631 positions (p\u200a=\u200a0.0003), suggesting that the non-reference allele was not adequately covered and is under called in the capture data. Moreover, of the 1,621 dbSNPs in the region, the capture adequately covered only 1,515. In these data there was a bias for the pull down data to under observe the non-reference allele (Figure S1). The 106 dbSNP positions detected in the ABI whole genome sequence dataset were observed to all call the reported alternate allele from dbSNP. In theory, if these were errors, then non-reference base calls should be randomly distributed to the three alternate base calls. Thus, no discrepancies are reliably identified within the dbSNP overlap when a variant was called in the ABI genomic sequence data. There were a total of 100 novel SNVs detected in the ABI genomic sequence dataset that were also very well evaluated in the Illumina pull down data with at least 20 high quality Illumina reads, such that the ABI sequence could be well validated. Of these, 2 of the 100 discovered variants in the genomic sequence dataset were not observed in the Illumina pull down sequencing dataset. Thus, of the entire 8.5mb interval there are 2 unconfirmed variants for an estimated false positive error rate of about 3\u00d710\u22127 for the whole interval. Alternatively viewed, there were 100 novel SNVs, with a 2% error rate in those novel positions. Thus, the de novo false discovery rate may be as high as 2%. Extrapolating to the whole set of 243,622 novel SNVs, we expect up to 4,872 false positives SNVs. These observations are roughly concordant with a sampling of 37 novel SNVs (not in dbSNP) in the whole genome set selected for testing by Sanger sequencing. Of these, 34 out of 37 (92%) were validated. There are now several publicly available complete genomes sequenced on next generation platforms. We compared the SNVs discovered in U87MG to two of these published genomes: the James D. Watson genome and the first Asian genome (YanHuang). Further, we simultaneously compared each of these to dbSNP version 129. Compared with dbSNP, 10.2% of U87MG SNVs, 9.5% of Watson SNVs, and 12.0% of YanHuang SNVs were not present within dbSNP (Figure 4). As U87MG was derived from a patient of Caucasian ancestry, which is confirmed by genotyping, it is unsurprising to see a higher overlap with dbSNP for U87MG than for YanHuang. Between the three genomes themselves, 44.7% of U87MG SNVs overlapped with Watson SNVs while 60.0% of SNVs were in common with YanHuang SNVs. Only 8.5% of dbSNP SNVs were shared between Watson and U87MG, while 11.3% of them were shared between YanHuang and U87MG. Thus, there is not a substantially higher amount of SNVs in the U87MG cancer genome relative to normal genomes. We utilized the predictable insert distance of mate-paired sequence fragments to directly observe structural variations in U87MG. Our target insert size of 1.5kb gave us a normal distribution of paired end insert lengths ranging from 1kb to 2kb with median around 1.25kb and mean around 1.45kb in the actual sequence data (Figure S2). We identified 1,314 large structural variations, including 35 interchromosomal events, 599 complete homozygous deletions (including a large region on chromosome 9 containing CDKN2A/B, which commonly experience homozygous deletions in brain cancer), 361 heterozygous deletion events, and 319 other intrachromosomal events (Table 5). The 599 complete microdeletions summed up to approximately 5.76Mb of total sequence, while the 361 heterozygous microdeletions summed to 5.36Mb of total sequence. Most of the microdeletions were under 2kb in total size. Because of the high sequence coverage and mate pair strategy each event was supported by an average of 138 mate pair reads. Mispairing of the mate pairs did occur occasionally due to molecular chimerism in the library fabrication process, but such reads occur at a low frequency (<1/40 of the reads). Thus, the true rearrangement/deletion events were highly distinct from noise in well-mapped sequences. Interchromosomal events included translocations and large insertion/deletion events where one part of a chromosome was inserted into a different chromosome, sometimes replacing a segment of DNA. All together, these structural variations show a highly complex rearrangement of genomic material in this cancer cell line (Figure 5). All identified structural variants are summarized in Table S2. We note as well that even when breakpoints are within genome-wide common repeats there can be sufficient mapping information to reliably identify the translocation breakpoint (Figure S3). The thirty-five interchromosomal events often coincided with positions of copy number change based on the average base coverage (Figure 5). Figure 6 shows two interchromosomal events between chromosomes 2 and 16. The events on chromosome 16 are less than 1kb apart while those on chromosome 2 are about 160kb apart. Based on the average base coverage, there appears to be a loss of genomic material between the event boundaries on their respective chromosomes, shifting from two to one copy. Although we are unable to determine the origin of such an event, it appears that there was an interchromosomal translocation between chromosomes 2 and 16 with a loss of the DNA between the identified regions on each chromosome. A subset of 3 translocations were confirmed by amplifying DNA from the breakpoint-spanning region by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing by dideoxy Sanger sequencing (Table S1). Each confirmed the predicted breakpoint to within 100 nucleotides of the correct position. In a subset of cases, unmapped short read fragments could be identified from the shotgun short read data that span the breakpoint and are concordant at base resolution with Sanger sequencing of PCR amplified product spanning the breakpoint The SNVs and indels identified in U87MG were assessed for their potential to affect protein-coding sequence. We considered variants predicted to be homozygous and to affect the coding sequence of a gene through a frameshift, early termination, intron splice site, or start/stop codon loss mutation as causing a complete loss of that protein. We chose to focus on homozygous null mutations for two major reasons. First, this is an interesting set of genes that we can predict from the whole genome data are non-functional within this commonly used cell line. Although heterozygous mutations can certainly affect gene products in multiple ways, it is difficult to assess their effect from genomic data alone. Second, by cross-referencing such null mutations with known regions of common mutation in gliomas we can pick out specific candidates that are of interest to the glioma community. Of the 2,384,470 SNVs and 191,743 small indels in U87MG, a total of 332 genes are predicted to have loss-of-function, homozygous mutations as a consequence of small variants (Table S3). Of these, 225 genes contained variants matching alleles annotated in dbSNP (version 129), while 107 contained novel variants not observed in dbSNP. We further divided these homozygous mutant genes by variant type. Of genes mutated by SNVs, 146 contained variants present in dbSNP while only 8 were knocked out by variants not in dbSNP. The ratio of known SNPs causing loss-of-function mutations to total known SNPs (146/2,140,848\u200a=\u200a6.82\u00d710\u22125) was not significantly different from the ratio of novel SNVs causing loss-of-function mutations over total novel SNVs (8/243,622\u200a=\u200a3.28\u00d710\u22125; p\u200a=\u200a0.04). This indicates that many of the possible de novo point mutations may indeed be rare inherited variants made homozygous by chromosomal loss of the normal allele. In contrast to the trend in SNVs, small indels that homozygously mutated genes were more often novel. There were 79 genes predicted homozygously mutated by indel variants reported in dbSNP while 99 were predicted mutated by novel indels. Despite this trend, however, there was not a significant enrichment of deleterious indels among the novel indels (99/191,743\u200a=\u200a5.16\u00d710\u22124) compared to the known indels (79/116,964\u200a=\u200a6.75\u00d710\u22124; p\u200a=\u200a0.08) This suggests that the difference in ratios of novel versus documented SNVs (8 vs. 146) and indels (99 vs. 79) is the result of compositional bias in dbSNP129, which contains a far greater number of SNPs compared to indels. We also assessed the structural variants in U87MG for whether or not they were likely to affect a gene. Two different criteria were used to determine if translocations and microdeletions impacted a coding region, both predicted to produce an aberrant or nonfunctional protein. Using the UCSC known gene database, we identified 35 genes affected by interchromosomal translocations, 145 affected by complete deletions, 91 affected by heterozygous deletions and 166 affected by other intrachromosomal translocations (Table 4). Interchromosomal translocation events were significantly enriched for occurring at positions where they would affect genes with 32 out of 35 events (91.4%) occurring within 1kb of a gene (p<0.0001), while only 44.1% of the reference genome is within 1kb of a known gene. In total, intrachromosomal events did not display this enrichment with 145/319 (45.5%) falling within 1kb of a gene (p\u200a=\u200a0.67). However, we ran a set of simulations to assess whether microdeletions were enriched to overlap exons because we noted that 585 of our 599 complete microdeletions were less than 10kb in length with a mean size of 1.8kb. We ran 100,000 simulations randomly placing 600 microdeletions of 2kb lengths and determined how many times a microdeletion spanned an exon. In this way, we demonstrated that complete (homozygous) microdeletions under 10kb in size spanned exons slightly more often than by chance with a simulated p-value of .046. Similar assessment of microdeletions greater than 10kb in size did not find evidence of enrichment. These findings suggest that small microdeletions may preferentially occur within genes as opposed to being randomly distributed across the genome, but the signal is not strong from the available data. Genes affected by structural variations are summarized in Table S4. The annotation tool DAVID was used to further examine the biological significance of the list of likely knockout mutations (including genes affected by SNVs, indels, microdeletions and translocation events) using the EASE analysis module. After gene ontology (GO) analysis, 18 GO terms were nominally enriched and associated with the mutated gene with a p-value <\u200a=\u200a0.01 (Table S5). These GO enrichments include cell adhesion (GO:0007155 and GO:0022610), membrane (GO:0044425), and protein kinase regulator activity (GO:0019887). The list of genes was also compared to the list of cancer-associated genes maintained by the Cancer Gene Census project (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/). For SNVs and small indels, eight were observed in the census list, but this is not unexpected given the large number of mutations found in this cell line (p\u200a=\u200a0.21). Two CGC genes were affected by complete microdeletions (CDKN2A and MLLT3), and one gene each was affected by heterozygous microdeletions (IL21R) and interchromosomal translocations (SET). These included genes previously annotated as mutated in instances of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia (TCRA and MLLT3), glioma (PTEN), endometrial cancer (PTEN), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (CLTCL1), prostate cancer (ETV1 & PTEN), Ewing sarcoma (FLI1 and ETV1), desmoplastic small round cell tumor (FLI1), acute lymphocytic leukemia (FLI1 and MLLT3), clear cell sarcoma (FLI1), sarcoma (FLI1), myoepithelioma (FLI1), follicular thyroid cancer (PAX8), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (IL21R), acute myelogenous leukemia (SET), fibromyxoid sarcoma (CREB3L2), melanoma (XPC), and multiple other tumor types (PTEN and CDKN2A). We also explored the overlap of genes with mutations in GBMs according to the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with those we predicted are homozygously loss-of-function mutated in U87MG (Table S5). Seven genes mutated in U87MG by SNVs or indels were also found mutated within the TCGA sample (PTEN, LTF, KCNJ16, ABCA13, FLI1, MLL4, DSP). This overlap is not statistically significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.16). Ten additional genes overlapped, including two genes mutated by interchromosomal translocations (CNTFR, ELAVL2), three genes mutated by intrachromosomal translocations (ANXA8, LRRC4C, ALDH1A3), and five by homozygous microdeletions (CDKN2A, CDKN2C, MTAP, IFNA21, TMBIM4). Finally, in order to place the homozygous mutations of U87MG in context relative to GBM mutational patterns as a whole, the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) method was applied to 293 glioblastoma samples with genome wide copy number information available from the TCGA. This yielded a list of significant, commonly deleted regions present across glioblastomas as a group and highlights genes commonly mutated in GBMs. These data indicate that all or parts of chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, and 22 are commonly deleted within GBMs as a group. In total, these regions comprise 915,306,764 bases, covering roughly 30 percent of the genome. In order to highlight genes homozygously mutated in U87MG that are within the regions of common loss, we cross-referenced these lists and found that 62/332 (19%) are within the GISTIC defined regions. This does not suggest a significant overlap of homozygously mutated genes in U87MG with commonly deleted regions, but those mutated genes that do overlap may be of increased relevance to cancer. Two of the 62 genes are also in the Cancer Gene Census: PTEN and TCRA. We propose that a subset of the genes mutated in U87 within these commonly deleted regions may be the specific targets of mutation and should be assessed on larger sample sets. (Table S5 and Figure S4). Reported individual human genome sequencing projects using massively parallel shotgun sequencing with alignment to the human reference genome clearly indicate the practicality of individual whole genome sequencing. However, the monetary cost of data generation, data analysis issues, and the time it takes to perform the experiments have remained substantial limitations to general application in many laboratories. Here we demonstrate enormous improvements in the throughput of data generation. Using a mate-pair strategy and only ten micrograms of input genomic DNA, we generated sufficient numbers of short sequence reads in approximately 5 weeks of machine operation with a total reagent cost of under $30,000. We believe this makes U87MG the least expensive published genome sequenced to date signaling that routine generation of whole genomes is feasible in individual laboratories. Further, the two-base encoding strategy employed within the ABI SOLiD system is a powerful approach for comprehensive analysis of genome sequences and, in concert with BFAST alignment software, is able to identify SNVs, indels, structural variants, and translocations. Of particular interest in whole-genome resequencing studies such as this one is how much raw data must be produced to sequence both alleles using a shotgun strategy. Here, 107.5Gb of raw data was generated. Of this, 55.51Gb was mapped to unique positions in the reference genome. In effect, this results in a mean base coverage of 10.85\u00d7 per allele within non-repetitive regions of the genome. Repetitive regions are of course undermapped, as their unique locations are more difficult to determine. This level of oversampling is adequate for high stringency variant calling (error rate less than 5\u00d710\u22126) at 93.71% of heterozygous SNP positions. There may be some biases in library generation resulting in bases that are not successfully covered even if they are relatively unique, but solutions to this may be found in performing multiple sequencing runs with varied library designs, as suggested in other studies. With rapid advances in the generation of massively parallel shotgun short reads, one of the major computational problems faced is the rapid and sensitive alignment of greater than 1 billion paired end reads needed to resequence an individual genome. We demonstrate a practical solution using BFAST, which was able to perform fully gapped local alignment on the two-base encoded data to maximize variant calling in less than 4 days on a 20-node 8-core computer cluster. Comparing U87MG SNVs with the James Watson and YanHuang genome projects' SNVs displays differences in SNV detection between the three projects. Being derived from a Caucasian individual, U87MG and James Watson are expected to share more SNVs than U87MG and YanHuang. However, when we compared SNVs between U87MG and these two genomes, more SNVs were actually shared between U87MG and YanHuang. Meanwhile, the YanHuang project called significantly more SNVs in total than both our U87MG sequencing project and the James Watson project. These results stress that utilizing different sequencing platforms (U87MG-ABI SOLiD, James Watson-Roche 454, YanHuang-Illumina Solexa), alignment tools (U87MG-BFAST, James Watson-BLAT, YanHuang-SOAP) and analytical approaches results in finding different quantities of SNVs. The higher genomic coverage in our U87MG sequence relative to James Watson and the increased sensitivity of BFAST relative to BLAT and SOAP were counted on to find highly robust variants. This is particularly important when sequencing a cancer genome because of the interest in finding novel cancer mutations as opposed to common polymorphisms. The genomic sequence demonstrates global differences in variant type across the coding and non-coding portions of the human genome. By increasing the sensitivity of indel detection, we revealed that small indels have mutated genes at a higher rate than SNVs. A larger proportion of the indels identified are predicted to cause a protein coding change compared to SNVs (178/191,743 indels vs. 154/2,384,470 SNVs). In U87MG, there is a relative increase in 4-base indels genome-wide, which has been observed in other normal genomes\u2013 (Figure 2, red bars). However, indels found in coding regions exhibit a bias toward events that are multiples of 3-bases in length (Figure 2, blue bars) presumably selected to maintain reading frame. Thus, many of these events are likely to be polymorphisms and not disease related genomic mutations. Similarly, the nucleotide substitution frequencies demonstrate a bias in coding regions compared to non-coding. Two-thirds of the substitutions were transitions genome-wide, as expected, but there was an enrichment of CG->TA transitions in coding regions (Figure 3). It is well established that the most common source of point mutations and SNPs in primates is deamination of methyl-cytosine (meC), causing transition to a thymine (T),, and there is circumstantial evidence of that in U87MG's genome as well. The resolution of genome-wide chromosomal rearrangements is substantially improved by the mate-pair strategy, coupled with sensitive and independent alignment of the short 50-base reads (Figure 5). Based on published SKY data, we anticipated 7 interchromosomal breakpoints. However, whole-genome mate-paired sequence data revealed the precise chromosomal joins of 35 interchromosomal events, which account for previously observed chromosomal abnormalities in U87MG but at additional finer scale resolution (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). The translocation events were enriched in genic regions with 32/35 (91.4%) occurring within 1kb of genes. A weaker, but still noticeable enrichment over genes occurs with microdeletions as well, which are generally missed by other experimental techniques like DNA microarrays. Thus, within the overall mutational landscape of this cancer cell line, translocations and structural variants preferentially occurred over genes, supporting a model where cancer mutations occur via structural instability rather than novel point mutations. Delving into the functional effects of the mutations in U87MG through gene ontology and cross-referencing the literature, we found a large number of known and predicted cancer mutations present in the cell line. There is always a concern when dealing with a cancer cell line that mutations will be more related to its status as a cell line than to the cancer it was derived from. While this remains a concern, the large number of predicted and known cancer genes present in U87MG suggests other genes mutated in it have relevance to cancer as well. Using GISTIC to find regions with common deletions in glioma samples, we highlight 60 genes that are mutated in U87MG and are located in regions that are commonly deleted in GBMs that are not included within the Cancer Gene Census list as potential candidate mutational targets in GBMs (Table S5). Cancer cell lines are commonly used as laboratory resources to study basic molecular and cellular biology. It is clearly preferable to have complete genomic sequence for these valuable resources. U87MG is the most commonly studied brain cancer cell line and is highly cytogenetically aberrant. While this made the sequencing and mutational analysis more challenging, it serves as a model for future cultured cell line genomic sequencing. Through custom analyses, we found that the mutational landscape of the U87MG genome is vastly more complicated than we would have expected based on the variants discovered in previously published genomes. It is our hope that the increased genomic resolution presented here will direct researchers and clinicians in their work with this brain cancer cell line to create more effective experiments and lead to a greater ability to draw meaningful conclusions in the future. The NCBI reference genome (build 36.1, hg18, March 2006), genome annotations, and dbSNP version 129 were downloaded from the UCSC genome database located at http://genome.ucsc.edu. A local mirror of the UCSC genome database (hg18) was used for the subsequent analysis of variants using included gene models and annotations. The Watson genome variants were downloaded from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (http://jimwatsonsequence.cshl.edu) with bulk data files available from ftp://jimwatsonsequence.cshl.edu/jimwatsonsequence/. The YanHuang variants were downloaded from the Beijing Genomics Institute at Shenzhen (http://yh.genomics.org.cn/) with bulk data files available from http://yh.genomics.org.cn/download.jsp. U87MG cells were ordered from ATCC (HTB-14) and cultured in a standard way. Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured U87MG cells using Qiagen Gentra Puregene reagents. DNA was stored at \u221220C until library generation. Long-Mate-Paired Library Construction: The U87MG genomic DNA 2\u00d7 50bp long mate-paired library construction was carried out using the reagents and protocol provided by Applied Biosystems (SOLiD 3 System Library Preparation Guide). A similar protocol was reported previously. Briefly, 45ug of genomic DNA was fragmented by HydroShear (Digilab Genomic Solutions Inc) to 1.0\u20132.5kb. The fragmented DNA was repaired by the End-It DNA End-Repair Kit (Epicentre). Subsequently, the LMP CAP adaptor was ligated to the ends. DNA Fragments between 1.2\u20131.7kb were selected by 1.0% agarose gel to avoid concatamers and circularized with a biotinylated internal adaptor. Non-circularized DNA fragments were eliminated by Plasmid-Safe ATP-Dependent DNase (Epicentre) and 3ug of circularized DNA was recovered after purification. Original DNA nicks at the LMP CAP oligo/genomic insert border were translated into the target genomic DNA about 100bp by nick translation using E. coli DNA polymerase I. Fragments containing the target genomic DNA and adaptors were cleaved from the circularized DNA by single-strand specific S1 nuclease. P1 and P2 adaptors were ligated to the fragments and the ligated mixture was used to create two separate libraries with 10 cycles of PCR amplification. Finally, 250\u2013300bp fragments were selected to generate mate paired sequencing libraries with average target genomic DNA on each end around 90bp by excision from PAGE gel and use as emulsion PCR template. Templated Beads Preparation: The templated beads preparation was performed using the reagents and protocol from the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 Templated Beads Preparation Guide). SOLiD 3 Sequencing: The 2\u00d750b mate-paired sequencing was performed exactly according to the Applied Biosystems SOLiD 3 System Instrument Operation Guide and using the reagents from Applied Biosystems. We used an array pull-down capture strategy established in our lab. An Agilent custom array for capturing 5,253 \u201ccancer-related\u201d genes was designed through Agilent e-array system (www.agilent.com). Only the amino acid encoding regions were targeted with 60mer oligos spaced center-to-center 20\u201330bp. The probes were randomly distributed across two separate 244K arrays. The library for cancer gene capture sequencing was generated following the standard Illumina paired-end library preparation protocol. 5ug of genomic DNA was used for the starting material and 250\u2013300bp fragments were size-selected during the gel-extraction step. In the last step, 18 cycles of PCR were performed in multiple tubes to yield 4ug of product and mixed with 50ug of Human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), 52ul of Agilent 10\u00d7 Blocking Agent, 260ul of Agilent 2\u00d7 Hybridization Buffer and 10\u00d7 molar concentration of unpurified Illumina paired-end primer pairs custom made according to the sequences provided by Illumina (Oligonucleotide sequences, 2008, Illumina, Inc: available on request from Illumina). The mix was then diluted with elution buffer for the final volume of 520ul and then incubated at 95\u00b0C for 3 min and 37\u00b0C for 30min. 490ul of the hybridization mix was added to the array and hybridized in the Agilent hybridization oven (Robins Scientific) for 65 hrs at 65\u00b0C, 20rpm. After hybridization, the array was washed according to the Agilent wash procedure A protocol. The second wash was extended to 5 minutes to increase the wash stringency. After washing, the array was stripped by incubating it in the Agilent hybridization oven at 95\u00b0C for 10min, 20rpm with 1.09\u00d7 Titanium Taq PCR Buffer (Clonetech). After the incubation and collection of the solution, 4 tubes of PCR were performed with each tube containing 96ul of the collected solution, 1ul of dNTPs (10mM each), 1ul of Titanium Taq (Clonetech) and Solexa primers, 1ul each. 15 cycles of PCR was performed at the following condition: 30sec at 95\u00b0C, (10 sec at 95\u00b0C, 30 sec at 65\u00b0C, 30 sec at 72\u00b0C)\u00d718 cycles, 5 min at 72\u00b0C and hold at 4\u00b0C. The amplified product was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit and eluted in 30ul of EB. After confirming the size of the amplicon on 2% agarose gel and measuring the concentration, the amplicon was diluted to 10nM, the working concentration for cluster generation. The Illumina flowcell was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and the Genome Analyzer was run using standard manufacturer's recommended protocols. The image data produced were converted to intensity files and were processed through the Firecrest and Bustard algorithms (1.3.2) provided by Illumina to call the individual sequence reads. We used Blat-like Fast Accurate Search Tool version 0.5.3 (BFAST http://bfast.sourceforge.net) to perform sequence alignment of the two-base encoded reads off the ABI SOLiD to the NCBI human reference genome (build 36.1). Utilizing the local alignment algorithm included in BFAST, we were able to simultaneously decode the short reads, while searching for color errors (encoding errors), base changes, insertions, and deletions. We found candidate alignment locations (CALs) for each end independently. We utilized ten indexes to be robust to up to six color errors, equating to a 12% per-read error rate: 1111111111111111111111 111110100111110011111111111 10111111011001100011111000111111 1111111100101111000001100011111011 111111110001111110011111111 11111011010011000011000110011111111 1111111111110011101111111 111011000011111111001111011111 1110110001011010011100101111101111 111111001000110001011100110001100011111 We also set parameters to use only informative keys when looking up reads in each index (BFAST parameter -K 8), and to ignore reads with too many CALs aggregated across all indexes (BFAST parameter -M 384). If reads mapped to greater than 384 locations, then they were categorized as \u2018unmapped\u2019. We then performed local alignment for each of the returned CALs, simultaneously decoding the read from color space searching for color errors (encoding errors), base changes, insertions, and deletions. We choose the \u201cbest scoring\u201d alignment, accepting an alignment only if it was at least the equivalent edit distance of two color errors away from the next best alignment. This is approximately similar to a \u2018mapping quality\u2019 of 20 or better from the MAQ program output, for reference. We removed duplicate reads using the alignment filtering utility found in DNAA (http://dnaa.sourceforge.net). For single-end and mate-paired reads where only one end mapped, we removed duplicates based on reads having identical stat positions. For mate-paired reads, we removed duplicates where both ends had the same start position. Illumina generated sequence was aligned to the NCBI human reference genome (build 36.1) using BFAST with the following parameters applied. Each end of the fragment library was mapped independently to identify CALs, utilizing ten indexes to be robust to errors and variants in the short (typically 36bp) reads: 1111111111111111111111 1111101110111010100101011011111 1011110101101001011000011010001111111 10111001101001100100111101010001011111 11111011011101111011111111 111111100101001000101111101110111 11110101110010100010101101010111111 111101101011011001100000101101001011101 1111011010001000110101100101100110100111 1111010010110110101110010110111011 We also set parameters to use only informative keys when looking up reads in each index (BFAST parameter -K 8), and to ignore reads with too many CALs aggregated across all indexes (BFAST parameter -M 1280). We then performed a standard local alignment for each CAL. Reads were declared mapped if a single unique best scoring alignment was identified within the genome. Duplicate reads were filtered out in the same manner as for the ABI SOLiD data. To find SNVs including SNPs and small indels, we assumed the MAQ consensus-calling model utilizing the implementation in SAMtools. We used a value of 0.0000007 for the prior of a difference between two haplotypes (-r parameter). This was chosen based on ROC analysis of a test dataset (data not shown). Structural variations were detected using custom algorithms designed to comprehensively search for groups of mate-pair reads with aberrant paired-end insert size distributions that are consistently identifying a unique structural variant in the genome. We utilized the \u201cdtranslocations\u201d utility in the DNAA package (http://dnaa.sourceforge.net) for the primary structural variation candidate search. The utility first selected all pairs for which each end is uniquely mapped to a single location in the human genome and for which the mate-pair reads are not positioned in the expected size range relative to the consensus genome. Then we filter out false positives that are not consistent with a chromosomal difference on an allele. Briefly, the genome was divided into 500-base bins sequentially stepped 100-bases apart from their start positions. Each bin was then paired with other bins on the basis of containing similar \u2018mismapped\u2019 mate-pair reads. The aberrant mate-paired reads were defined as reads that were mapping less than 1000 or greater than 2000 bases apart within the reference genome sequence, which is selected based on the insert size distribution calculated from the aggregate dataset (Figure S2). These were then rank-ordered based on the number of mate-pairs meeting criteria, and the destination bin with the most reads within it was paired with a given source bin to create a \u2018binset\u2019. Binsets containing less than 4 reads were filtered out, removing 98.3% of the candidates based on having too little evidence supporting them. The resulting list of filtered binsets was then scanned for clusters of binsets. Binset clusters are groups of binsets where the source bins occur within 2000 bases of each other and the destination bins occur within 2000 bases of each other. Redundant binsets were combined and those binset clusters that contain too few (less than 9 binsets spanning at least 1000 bases) or too many binsets (greater than 29 binsets spanning at most 3000 bases\u2014higher is impossible given our insert size distribution) were removed as artifacts. The resulting binset clusters represent the reads immediately flanking structural breakpoint events. This detection process is currently being automated as Breakway (http://breakway.sourceforge.net), but was done using custom scripts at the time of analysis. The structural variations were then separated into interchromosomal and intrachromosomal events. Intrachromosomal events of less than 1Mb are assessed for deletion status by averaging base coverage within the bounds of the event and comparing it to base coverage 200kb outside the event on both sides. Those that have average interior base coverage less than 25% of the average exterior base coverage are classified as \u201ccomplete\u201d deletions. Those with average interior base coverage between 25% and 75% that of average exterior base coverage are classified as \u201cheterozygous deletions\u201d (deletions of at least one copy of the region, but with at least one copy remaining). Variant calls from the SAMtools pileup tool were first loaded into a SeqWare QueryEngine database and subsequently filtered to produce BED files. This filtering criteria required that a variant be seen at least 4 times and at most 60 times with an observation occurring on each strand at least once. For SNVs we further enforced the criteria that SNVs should only be called in reads lacking indels and the last 5 bases of the reads were also ignored. This reduced the likelihood that spurious mismappings were used to predict SNVs and eliminated the lowest quality bases from consideration. For small indels (<21bp) we enforced a slightly different filter by requiring that any reads supporting an indel were only allowed to contain one contiguous indel and these reads were not considered if the indel occurred on either the beginning or end of the read. These criteria, like the SNV criteria, were used to reduce the likelihood of using mismapped reads or locally misaligned reads in the variant calling algorithm. The elimination of reads with indels at the beginning or end of the read was intended to remove potential alignment artifacts caused by ambiguous gap introduction due to lack of information at the ends to guide proper alignment. Together, these filtering criteria reduced the likelihood that sequencing errors were identified as SNV or indel variants. We used scripts available in the BFAST toolset and SeqWare Pipeline to filter and annotate the variant calls. Variants passing these filters were further annotated by their overlap with dbSNP version 129. Variants were required to share the same genomic position as a dbSNP entry along with matching the allele present in the database to be considered overlapping. Mapping to dbSNP allowed us to filter out known SNPs from de novo variants. Filtered SNV and indel variants were then analyzed for their affect within the genome that is annotated with gene models. This analysis used scripts from the SeqWare Pipeline project and gene models downloaded from the UCSC hg18 human genome annotation database. Six different gene model sets from hg18 were considered: UCSC genes (knownGene), RefSeq genes (refGene, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq), Consensus Coding Sequence genes (ccdsGene, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS), Mammalian Gene Collection genes (mgcGenes, http://mgc.nci.nih.gov), Vertebrate Genome Annotation genes (vegaGene, http://vega.sanger.ac.uk), and Ensembl genes (ensGene, http://www.ensembl.org). Each variant was evaluated for overlap with genes from each of the 6 gene models. If overlap was detected the variant was examined and tagged with one or more of the following terms depending on the nature of the event: \u201cutr-mutation\u201d, \u201ccoding-nonsynonymous\u201d, \u201ccoding-synonymous\u201d, \u201cabnormal-ref-gene-model-lacking-stop-codon\u201d, \u201cabnormal-ref-gene-model-lacking-start-codon\u201d, \u201cframeshift\u201d, \u201cearly-termination\u201d, \u201cinframe-indel\u201d, \u201cintron-splice-site-mutation\u201d, \u201cstop-codon-loss\u201d, and/or \u201cstart-codon-loss\u201d. The variant was also tagged with the gene symbol and other accessions to facilitate lookups. This information was loaded into a SeqWare QueryEngine database to allow for querying and filtering of the variants as needed. Genes affected by structural variations were assessed in two ways depending on the structural variation type. For interchromosomal translocation events, a gene was considered \u201caffected\u201d when either end of an interchromosomal translocation event fell in a genic region (including the entire coding region plus 1kb up- or down-stream of the gene's coding region). The same criteria were used for all intrachromosomal translocation events. For events that were classified as complete or heterozygous deletions, a gene was considered affected if all or part of a coding exon was deleted. Homozygous SNVs, small indels, large deletions, and translocation events for variants that included predicted coding sequence changes were tallied. This became a reference list of variants with serious homozygous mutations that likely completely disrupted, or \u201cknocked out\u201d, the normal function or synthesis of the target protein. For the SNVs and small indels, a \u201cknockout\u201d variant was defined as a homozygous call by the SAMtools variant caller where the variant was predicted by the SeqWare Pipeline scripts to change coding sequence with one or more of the following annotations: \u201cearly-termination\u201d, \u201cframeshift\u201d, \u201cintron-splice-site-mutation\u201d, \u201cstart-codon-loss\u201d, and/or \u201cstop-codon-loss\u201d. The \u201cearly-termination\u201d event represented a stop codon introduced upstream of the annotated stop codon. The \u201cframeshift\u201d represented an indel that resulted in a shifting of the reading frame of the gene resulting in, typically, early termination and non-sense coding sequence. The \u201cintron-splice-site-mutation\u201d referred to a mutation in the two consensus splice site intronic bases flanking exons (GT at the 5\u2032 splice site and AG at the 3\u2032 splice site). Finally, \u201cstop-codon-loss\u201d and \u201cstart-codon-loss\u201d simply refer to variants that interrupt the stop or start codons. We chose to not include \u201ccoding-nonsynonymous\u201d and \u201cinframe-indel\u201d annotations in this list of knocked out variants because, while potentially serious as these mutations are, they are not guaranteed to result in an unexpressed or non-functional protein. However, homozygous frameshift, early termination, splice site, and stop/start codon loss mutations are very likely to interrupt a gene's expression and translation to functional protein. As described above, large microdeletions that removed all or part of an exon and interchromosomal translocation events that fell within 1kb of a gene's coding region were also classified as mutated genes. Once suspect knockout variants were identified, a mapping process was used to translate one or more variants to the gene symbol. This mapping allowed us to condense multiple variants affecting multiple gene models to a more abbreviated list of gene symbols likely to be affected by these knockout mutations. The mapping from variants to gene symbols used variants identified with gene models from the refGene and the knownGene tables in the UCSC hg18 database and mapped these variants to gene symbols using queries against the name field of the knownGene table and the alias field of the kgAlias table. The UCSC table browser was used to accomplish these queries and map the knownGene identifiers to gene symbols via the kgXref table. A similar approach was used for homozygous large-scale microdeletions and translocation events. The list of knockout genes was uploaded to the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, version 2008) to identify enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms\u2013. Overlap with GO terms from the biological process, cellular component, and molecular function ontologies were considered. The default parameters were used and a p-value cutoff of <\u200a=\u200a0.01 was considered significant. The overlap between the Cancer Gene Census genes and those identified as knockouts in U87MG were compared. The Cancer Gene Census project is an ongoing effort to catalog genes with mutations that have been implicated in cancer. It is a highly curated list that includes annotations for each gene including tumor types, class of mutations, and other genetic properties. We used the gene symbol list from the September 30th, 2009 complete working list, which includes 412 gene symbols. The overlap between mutations in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and those identified as knockouts in U87MG was analyzed. TCGA is an ongoing effort to understand the molecular basis of cancer through large-scale copy number analysis, expression profiling, genome sequencing, and methylation studies among other techniques. It provides information on mutations found by Sanger sequencing on many patient samples. For glioblastoma this includes sequence data aberrations detected in 158 patient samples and 1,177 genes. The Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) method was used to find significant areas of deletion in 293 samples from the TCGA. The GISTIC technique was designed to identify and analyze chromosomal aberrations across a set of cancer samples, based on the amplitude of the aberrations as well as the frequency across samples. This approach produced a series of commonly deleted regions across the set of TCGA GBMs. To calculate the areas of deletion, we used 293 Affymetrix SNP 6.0 samples segmented using the GLAD SNP analysis module. Default parameters of GISTIC were used. GISTIC produces peak limits, wide peak limits, and in addition broader region limits. These commonly deleted broader regions were then scanned for predicted knockout genes in U87MG. The distribution of small indel sizes was examined for both deletions and insertions. Indels classified as affecting coding-sequence by the SeqWare Pipeline (see above) were compared to those outside coding regions. Raw counts were collected, recalculated as percents of total, and compared directly. Similarly, nucleotide substitution frequency was examined for SNVs from U87MG both genome-wide and only in coding regions. Once binned appropriately, the SNV nucleotide substitutions were counted, tallied in a table, and graphed as percents of total. Variants from the Watson and Yan Huang genome were downloaded from each respective project from the following URLs: ftp://jimwatsonsequence.cshl.edu/jimwatsonsequence/watson-454-snp-v01.txt.gz and http://yh.genomics.org.cn/do.downServlet?file=data/snps/yhsnp_add.gff. These files contained variant calls for each genome along with annotations describing the variant as novel or occurring in dbSNP. The Watson genome only contained SNV calls so our comparison was limited to just SNVs. The Yan Huang genome also contained calls indicating heterozygous or homozygous. However, a variant was considered to match between genomes regardless of zygosity state. We compared the overlap of the U87MG genome, dbSNP and each of these genomes in turn. SNVs from U87MG that were considered for comparison had to meet our criteria; variants had to be observed at least 4 times, at most 60 times, at least once per strand, and with a minimum phred score of 10. SNVs in the three-way comparison were said to match if the position and allele matched between the genomes. If both variants matched between U87MG and the other genome and one was annotated in dbSNP, then the other was considered in dbSNP as well. If neither contained annotations from dbSNP the variant was considered novel. A similar process was carried out for variants distinct to each genome. The results were recorded as Venn diagrams showing the overlap between dbSNP, U87MG, and the Watson or Yan Huang genome. Genomic DNA from U87MG was submitted to the Southern California Genotyping Consortium to be run on the Illumina Human 1M-Duo BeadChip, which consists of 1,199,187 probes scattered across the human genome. The Illumina Beadstudio program was used to analyze the resulting intensity data. Loss of heterozygosity was determined by analyzing B-allele frequency as determined by the Beadstudio program. Normal two-copy regions of the genome are represented by long stretches of probes with B-allele frequencies of 0, 0.5 or 1. Regions of LOH, on the other hand, deviate from this pattern significantly. Copy number was determined by looking at probe intensity. Primers for validation were designed by targeting regions immediately flanking the event predicted by our whole genome sequence analysis using the Primer3 tool (http://frodo.wi.mit.ed/primer3/). Polymerase chain reaction was performed following standard protocols using Finnzymes Phusion Hot-Start High Fidelity polymerase. Products were run on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and product purity and size was assessed by staining with ethidium bromide. Sanger sequencing was performed at the UCLA Genotyping and Sequencing core facility using an ABI 3730 Capillary DNA Analyzer. Sequence trace files were analyzed using Geospiza FinchTV. Validation status and PCR primers are listed in Table S1. Intensities, quality scores, and color space sequence for the genomic sequence of U87 SOLiD were uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive under the accession SRA009912.1/Sequence of U87 Glioblastoma Cell-line. Intensities, quality scores, and nucleotide space sequence for the exon capture U87 Illumina sequence were also uploaded to the Short Read Archive under the same accession. For both datasets, alignment files have been uploaded to the Short Read Archive as additional analysis results. Variant calls for both datasets are available via a SeqWare QueryEngine web service at http://genome.ucla.edu/U87. This tool allows for querying the variants using a variety of search criteria including coverage, mutational consequence, gene symbol, and others. SeqWare QueryEngine produces results in both BED and WIG format making it compatible with the majority of genome browsers such as the UCSC genome and table browsers. Variant data will be uploaded to SRA as metadata along with the raw sequences. For the whole genome SOLiD alignment, small indels (<21bp), SNVs, large deletions, and translocation events can be queried. For the exon capture Illumina alignment, small indels and SNVs can be queried. Most software used for this project is open-source and freely available. We created two software projects that were instrumental in the analysis of the U87MG data: BFAST and SeqWare. The color- and nucleotide-space alignment tool BFAST can be downloaded from http://bfast.sourceforge.net and many of our alignment filtering as well as the primary step in structural variation detection can be found in the DNAA package at http://dnaa.sourceforge.net. The SeqWare software project was used throughout the analysis of variant calls. We used the SeqWare LIMS tool for sample tracking, the SeqWare Pipeline analysis programs for annotating variants with dbSNP status and mutational consequence predictions, and SeqWare QueryEngine was used to database and query variant calls and annotations. This software and documentation can be downloaded from http://seqware.sourceforge.net."}, "24477591": {"pmid": "24477591", "pmcid": "PMC4013450", "title": "The \u2212930A>G polymorphism of the CYBA gene is associated with premature coronary artery disease. A case\u2013control study and gene\u2013risk factors interactions", "abstract": "\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). NADPH oxidases are the main source of ROS in the vasculature. p22phox is a critical component of vascular NADPH oxidases and is encoded by the CYBA (cytochrome b245 alpha) gene. The \u2212930A>G CYBA polymorphism (rs9932581:A>G) modulates the activity of the CYBA promoter, and influences CYBA transcriptional activity. The aim of the present study was to analyze a possible association between the \u2212930A>G polymorphism and CAD and to search for gene\u2013traditional risk factors interactions. 480 subjects were studied: 240 patients with premature CAD, 240 age and sex matched blood donors. The \u2212930A>G polymorphism was genotyped using the TaqMan\u00ae Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems). The \u2212930G allele carrier state was a risk factor for CAD (OR 2.03, 95\u00a0% CI 1.21\u20133.44, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). A synergistic effect of the \u2212930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a025) and cigarette smoking was found. The estimated CAD risk for BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a025 and the \u2212930G allele interaction was about 160\u00a0% greater than that predicted by assuming additivity of the effects, and about 40\u00a0% greater for interaction of cigarette smoking and the \u2212930G allele. Overweight/obesity was a risk factor for CAD only in the \u2212930G allele carriers (P\u00a0<\u00a010\u221210) but not in the AA homozygotes (P\u00a0=\u00a01.00). In conclusion the \u2212930A>G CYBA polymorphism is associated with CAD in the Polish population. The \u2212930G allele carriers are particularly at risk of consequences of obesity and tobacco smoke exposure.\n", "fulltext": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis almost at every stage. Their participation is already noticeable at the stage of promotion of the endothelial dysfunction and is often evident during the development and destabilization of the atherosclerotic plaque. NADPH oxidases are considered as the main source of superoxide anion (O2 \u2212) in the cardiovascular system. They are multicomponent enzymes composed of the membrane-bound cytochrome b558 (catalytic NOX protein and p22phox) and many auxiliary cytoplasmic subunits for different types of NOX proteins. NOX proteins differ in their tissue distribution and regulation of the activity and expression [1, 2]. The expression of NOX1, NOX2, NOX4 and NOX5 was demonstrated in endothelial cells as well as vascular smooth muscle cells. The most important role in the vascular production of O2 \u2212 is assigned to NADPH oxidases containing the NOX2 protein, which is most strongly expressed in phagocytic cells. p22phox is a common and constant element of NADPH oxidases complexes containing NOX1\u2013NOX4 proteins, and plays a key role in the cytochrome b558 stabilization and is necessary to the initiation of O2 \u2212 production by NOX1\u2013NOX4 proteins. p22phox is encoded by the CYBA (light chain of cytochrome b558, cytochrome b245 alpha) gene (16q24). A significant number of genetic polymorphisms has been reported both in the exons and non-coding sequences, especially in the promoter region of CYBA [2, 3]. For some of them an impact on the CYBA expression and the superoxide production by NADPH oxidases was suggested. The \u2212930A>G polymorphism (rs9932581:A>G) is one of the promoter polymorphisms, located at the nucleotide position \u2212930 from the ATG codon. This polymorphism is situated in the potential binding site of C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein) transcription factors. It was speculated that the \u2212930A>G polymorphism modulates the activity of the CYBA promoter, and therefore transcriptional activity of CYBA, through the differential allele-dependent binding of C/EBP. The \u2212930G allele was the one that increased the affinity of C/EBP to the promoter. A functional analysis revealed that the \u2212930G allelic CYBA promoter has a 30\u00a0% higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) gene expression than the \u2212930A allelic promoter. However, the studies on the functional impact of the \u2212930A>G polymorphism on the NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production often revealed conflicting results. In some studies, especially those conducted in hypertensive individuals [5, 6], the \u2212930G allele was related to an increased O2 \u2212 production. In other cases, it did not affect the superoxide synthesis at all [7\u20139]. These discrepancies may result from intra- and inter-individual variability in the NADPH oxidase activity, different methods of O2 \u2212 measurements and the use of different cell lines in the experiments. Association studies of the \u2212930A>G polymorphism with cardiovascular diseases are numerous. To date, the \u2212930G allele was considered as a genetic marker associated with hypertension in the Spanish population [4, 6] and Japanese males. In the present work, we tried to analyze a possible association between the \u2212930A>G polymorphism and coronary artery disease and to analyze potential interactions of CYBA alleles and traditional risk factors of atherosclerosis and CAD. We studied 480 subjects. Group 1: 240 patients with angiographically proven premature CAD, 72 women and 168 men, aged 27\u201355\u00a0years (mean 44.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.09). Group 2: 240 blood donors (BD) including 70 women and 170 men, aged 27\u201355\u00a0years (mean 43.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.21). CAD subjects were selected from (1) patients admitted to the 1st Department and Clinic of Cardiology at the Upper Silesian Centre of Cardiology in Katowice; (2) patients admitted to the 1st Department of Cardiac Surgery at the Upper Silesian Centre of Cardiology in Katowice. Patients were classified for the study by the same cardiologist. Controls were recruited from the Regional Centre of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment in Katowice and the Regional Centre of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment in Raciborz. Following nationwide recommendations of the Polish Centres of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment, blood samples were obtained only from subjects with systolic blood pressure (BP) <140 and diastolic BP <90 on the day of blood collection. All subjects were Polish Caucasians, inhabitants of Upper Silesia. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of the medical interview, diagnosis and evaluation as well as criteria for CAD, MI and traditional risk factors were described previously. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice (Poland) and all subjects gave written informed consents. Total serum cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-chol) and triacylglycerols (TG) were measured by enzymatic methods (commercial Analco kit, Warsaw, PL). LDL-cholesterol (LDL-chol) levels were calculated according to the Friedewald formula in subjects with TG levels below 4.4\u00a0mmol/l. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes using the MasterPure genomic DNA purification kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, USA). The \u2212930A>G polymorphism of the CYBA gene was genotyped using the TaqMan\u00ae Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). The total volume of 20\u00a0\u03bcl of reaction mix included: 10\u00a0\u03bcl of TaqMan\u00ae Genotyping Master Mix (Cat.# 4371355), 1\u00a0\u03bcl of probe (TaqMan\u00ae Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay, Cat.# 4351376, C_11291925_10), 1\u00a0\u03bcl of DNA template (15\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) and 8\u00a0\u03bcl of deionized water. The probe was diluted with the TE buffer (1:1) before the reaction. The polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Genotyping was performed using the 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using Statistica 10.0 (STATSOFT, Tulusa, OK, USA) and SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., NC, USA) software. Normality of distribution was checked by Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and then a comparison of quantitative data was performed by Mann\u2013Whitney U test (for variables with non-normal distribution) or the student\u2019s t test (for variables with normal distribution). Allele frequencies were deduced from the genotype distribution. Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium was tested in all groups by a \u03c7 2 test. Comparisons of genotypes and alleles frequencies between cases and control subjects were performed by a \u03c7 2 test. When the number of subjects in the sample was lower than ten the Fisher\u2019s correction was used. Statistical significance was accepted at P\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Odds ratios (OR) as well as their 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using an univariate analysis (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 tables) and a multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, sex and traditional risk factors of coronary artery disease. Risk ratio values (95\u00a0% CI) were used when the number of individuals in any of the analyzed subgroups was 0. The effective sample size and statistical power of association analyzes were computed using Epi Info\u2122 7.1.1.0 developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between CYBA variants and clinical and biochemical parameters were calculated. To determine possible synergistic/antagonistic interactions between CYBA genotypes and traditional risk factors of CAD, the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 table approach of biological interactions was used. The synergy measures in an additive model were used to interpret the amount of interaction. The interaction of the \u2212930G allele with the respective factor was analyzed and AA homozygous subjects, not exposed to any specific risk factor, were used as a reference group (00 code). They were compared with subgroups of subjects exposed to only one of the factors (01\u2014only traditional, 10\u2014only genetic) and with a subgroup exposed to both factors (11 code). Odds ratio values, obtained from 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 table comparisons, were used for a calculation of the synergy index (SI). The SI is a ratio of the observed effect with the joint exposure to genetic and traditional factors (OR11) divided by the effect predicted for the joint exposure assuming additivity of the effects observed in the presence of either a traditional or genetic factor (OR01 and OR10). No interaction corresponds to SI\u00a0=\u00a01, whereas SI\u00a0>\u00a01 can be interpreted as a measure of relative increase and SI\u00a0<\u00a01 of decrease in the effect among those exposed to both factors. The following formula of SI was used:SI=OR11-1/OR01-1+OR10-1, 95\u00a0% CI for SIes were calculated using the SAS program described by Lundberg et al.. An analysis of additive effects of traditional risk factors and CYBA genotypes was also performed in a standard univariate and multivariate logistic regression model. These were used to compare the frequency of carriers of the \u2212930G allele or AA homozygotes exposed to traditional risk factor between CAD and blood donors groups. Clinical and biochemical parameters of patients and controls are shown in Table\u00a01. There were 72.1\u00a0% cases who had suffered from MI (n\u00a0=\u00a0173) and 60.4\u00a0% patients with critical stenoses (>90\u00a0%) in coronary vessels (n\u00a0=\u00a0145). CAD patients showed an increased level of TC, LDL cholesterol and TG, and a higher BMI value. The level of HDL cholesterol was significantly lower in CAD patients. The high value of the OR for hypertension (Table\u00a01) resulted from the fact that, according to the nationwide recommendations of Polish Centres of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment, the blood samples were obtained only from blood donors with systolic BP less than 140 and diastolic BP less than 90\u00a0mmHg on the day of blood collection. Genotype frequencies were compatible with the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium in both groups. Data from genotyping of the \u2212930A>G polymorphism are shown in Table\u00a02. Frequencies of the \u2212930G allele carriers (GG+AG genotypes) were significantly higher in patients than in controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Results of logistic regression analysis confirmed that the \u2212930G allele carrier state was a risk factor for CAD in the analyzed population (OR 2.03). The power of test was 77\u00a0%, with a 95\u00a0% two-sided confidence level. The \u2212930A>G polymorphism was associated with CAD also after adjustment for traditional risk factors like sex, age, TC, LDL-chol, HDL-chol, TG, BMI (qualitative variable), diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking status, hypertension and familial history of CAD. The results of multivariate analysis were: for the \u2212930G allele carrier state: OR 2.22, 95\u00a0% CI 1.17\u20134.20, P\u00a0=\u00a00.015, for the AA genotype: OR 0.45, 95\u00a0% CI 0.24\u20130.86, P\u00a0=\u00a00.015. There was no correlation between genotype variants of the \u2212930A>G polymorphism and MI or the severity of atherosclerosis estimated on the basis of the number of coronary stenoses or critical arterial occlusions observed during a coronary angiography (data not shown). In the next step, we analyzed potential associations of respective genotypes and classical risk factors of CAD using the Pearson\u2019s correlation model and we showed that the \u2212930G allele carrier state was correlated with overweight/obesity (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a025) (r\u00a0=\u00a00.36, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and the AA genotype with cigarette smoking (r\u00a0=\u00a00.22, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Other tested parameters such as serum lipid levels, age, gender, a familial history of CAD, hypertension and diabetes mellitus did not correlate with genotypic variants of the CYBA gene polymorphism (data not shown). Further statistical analyzes focused on interactions of the CYBA \u2212930A>G polymorphism variants and the two classical risk factors of CAD. We found a synergistic effect of the \u2212930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a025) and cigarette smoking (Table\u00a03). Overweight/obese \u2212930G carriers had an increased risk of CAD (OR 6.03, P\u00a0<\u00a010\u22126) compared with AA homozygous subjects with overweight/obesity (OR 2.50, P\u00a0=\u00a00.08) and \u2212930G allele carriers with BMI\u00a0<\u00a025 (OR 1.44, P\u00a0=\u00a00.28). Estimated CAD risk was about 160\u00a0% greater than that predicted by assuming additivity of the effects (SI\u00a0=\u00a02.59). We also found that the \u2212930G allele increased the risk of CAD associated with an exposure to cigarette smoking (Table\u00a03). The observed effect was about 40\u00a0% greater than that predicted from the effects\u2019 additivity (SI\u00a0=\u00a01.39). We confirmed the obtained results using an additive model of association. Overweight/obese \u2212930G allele carriers (n\u00a0=\u00a0135 in CAD group, n\u00a0=\u00a056 in BD group) were more frequent in the CAD group (56.3 vs. 23.3\u00a0%, P\u00a0<\u00a010\u221210). The power of this comparison was 99 with 99.9 CI. The frequency of overweight/obese \u2212930A allele carriers (n\u00a0=\u00a011 in CAD group, n\u00a0=\u00a011 in BD group) did not differentiate groups of patients and blood donors (4.6 vs. 4.6\u00a0%, P\u00a0=\u00a01.00). Similar tendency was observed in the case of cigarette smoking. Smokers carrying the \u2212930G allele (n\u00a0=\u00a0119 in CAD group, n\u00a0=\u00a054 in BD group) were more frequent in the patients group (49.6 vs. 22.5\u00a0%, P\u00a0<\u00a010\u221210). The power of this test was 99 (99.9 CI). Figure\u00a01 shows OR values obtained from these comparisons in a univariate analysis (Fig.\u00a01). In the present study the overweight/obesity was a risk factor only in carriers of the \u2212930G allele (Fig.\u00a01a). Similarly, the risk of CAD associated with cigarette smoking was significantly lower in AA homozygotes than in \u2212930G allele carriers (Fig.\u00a01b). Both SI values as well as the results of additive association analyses indicate that overweight/obesity and cigarette smoking increase the risk of CAD especially in the \u2212930G allele carriers. Finally, we compared BMI values between AA homozygotes and \u2212930G allele carriers in both patients and controls (Table\u00a04), and we have shown that the BMI values differentiated only \u2212930G allele carriers (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004), while were almost identical in AA homozygotes from the groups of patients and controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.98). BMI values of patients carrying the \u2212930G allele correlated with triglycerides levels (r\u00a0=\u00a00.36, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and negatively correlated with HDL levels (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.24, P\u00a0=\u00a00.015). Interestingly, these correlations were not observed in carriers of the \u2212930G allele from the control group. In the present study we showed that the \u2212930G allele carrier state of the CYBA \u2212930A>G polymorphism is associated with premature coronary artery disease. To date, there was only one study analyzing the association of the \u2212930A>G polymorphism with CAD conducted on the Austrian population. Surprisingly, the authors found that the \u2212930G allele was prevalent in the control group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.045). It seems that the observed contradictions resulted mainly from differences such as ethnicity and inclusion/exclusion criteria between Polish and Austrian populations. Both CAD patients as well as controls of the Austrian study were younger and not age matched (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), in contrast to the Polish groups. The groups were not numerous (n\u00a0=\u00a0100 for CAD patients, n\u00a0=\u00a0200 for controls) and, it should also be added, that such a low frequency of \u2212930G allele carriers (76.5\u00a0% in Austrian CAD group) was not observed in any of the major studies on the \u2212930A>G polymorphism. We did not find any associations of the analyzed polymorphism with hypertension. However, hypertension seems to be one of the main ways by which the \u2212930G allele affects vascular functioning, according to the current state of knowledge [4\u20136, 10]. There are also other probable mechanisms of actions of the \u2212930G allele, independent from hypertension like insulin resistance mediation and influence on the vascular wall structure, which will be discussed below. It was shown that the \u2212930G allele influences the expression of CYBA, especially in hypertensive subjects. CYBA mRNA levels were higher in GG than AA/AG hypertensives (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No differences in CYBA mRNA levels were found between genotypes of normotensive subjects. Additionally, the superoxide production was increased only in hypertensive GG subjects but not in GG homozygous normotensives [5, 6]. Interestingly, a more recent study demonstrated that the \u2212930A>G polymorphism may be a determinant of peripheral and central pressures also in normotensive individuals. Finally, the \u2212930A>G polymorphism was reported to be associated with hypertension in the Spanish population [4, 6] and Japanese males. We also found a synergistic effect of the \u2212930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a025) on CAD risk. The results of alternative, logistic regression model analysis showed that overweight/obesity is a risk factor for CAD only in carriers of the \u2212930G allele. We also observed that BMI values differentiated only carriers of the \u2212930G allele from the groups of patients and controls, while they were almost identical in AA homozygotes. There are many interactions between NADPH oxidases and overweight/obesity. Fortuno and colleagues demonstrated that phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity was increased in obese subjects (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and was related to preclinical atherosclerosis in this condition. Also animal studies have provided interesting results of diet-induced obesity on the NADPH oxidases activity and expression of its subunits. In the study conducted on obese rats, NOX4 expression was increased by three-fold in the aorta. Additionally, upregulations of p22phox and p47phox in the adipose tissue as well as NOX4, p22phox, and p47phox in kidney were observed. Very recent studies on mice provided evidence that dietary obesity increased both vascular and hepatic NADPH oxidase activity, which was associated with an enhanced expression of NOX2 [19, 20], p22phox and p47phox. Another aspect of linking the NADPH oxidases with overweight/obesity is the impact of free radicals on insulin resistance condition. The study of Sukumar et al. identified NOX2 as a central molecule in insulin resistance-mediated oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction. They demonstrated that higher levels of O2 \u2212 in insulin-resistant endothelial cells were inhibited by gp91ds-tat (NOX2 inhibitor). Double transgenic mice with endothelial-specific insulin resistance and deletion of NOX2 showed a reduced O2 \u2212 production and an improved vascular function. These findings were complemented by results of another study. Aortic vessels from obese mice after middle age had significant increases in NOX2 expression and ROS production, which were accompanied by a reduced insulin receptor expression. Interestingly, there are presumptions that the \u2212930G allele of the CYBA polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance in obese adult humans (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the present work we also found that the risk of CAD associated with cigarette smoking was significantly higher in \u2212930G allele carriers than in AA homozygotes. Many studies demonstrated the role of NADPH oxidases in the promotion of cigarette smoking-dependent oxidative stress. NADPH oxidases were activated by many water-soluble components of cigarette smoke [23, 24]. Short exposure of human and animal endothelial cells to cigarette smoke extracts resulted in a large increase in O2 \u2212 production, which was inhibited by several NOX inhibitors. An increased NADPH oxidase activity was observed among others in the ventricular remodeling induced by tobacco smoke exposure. The \u2212930A>G CYBA polymorphism was also analyzed in the context of an association between cigarette smoking and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. The \u2212930G allele modified the strength of the association between cigarette smoking and IMT in young healthy adults. The differences in the mean and maximal IMT were most significant in subjects with the GG genotype, borderline significant for the GA genotype, and nonsignificant for the AA genotype. GG homozygotes had a higher mean and maximal IMT compared with the carriers of the A allele among smokers (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012, respectively). In our previous studies we showed associations of other CYBA gene polymorphisms with smoking, namely the 242C>T polymorphism and the 640A>G polymorphism. Carriers of 242T and 640G alleles were particularly at risk of the effects of exposure to tobacco smoke. It should be mentioned that there was no independent association of the analyzed polymorphisms with CAD, neither in these studies nor in the study on genetically related Slovenian population, where the C242T polymorphism was not associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type two diabetes. Although the results of the current meta-analysis have indicated that the 242T allele carriers have a marginal CAD risk increase (21\u00a0%) but only among Caucasians. These two functional polymorphisms are not in linkage disequilibrium with \u2212930A>G. It is however possible that the latter also affects the susceptibility to CAD, especially in smokers. A limitation of the present study is the fact that the analyses were performed on multiple subgroups with a relatively small number of participants. Neither did we analyze the activity of NADPH oxidases nor the expression of p22phox. The relatively low frequency of hypertension in the control group (2.3\u00a0%) should also be discussed here as a potentially interfering factor. Such a low incidence may result from two main reasons. The first are the guidelines of the Polish Centres of Blood Donation and Blood Treatment, according to which the blood samples can be obtained only from patients with systolic BP less than 140 and diastolic BP less than 90\u00a0mmHg, on the day of blood collection. The second reason may be the recruitment criteria, which excluded donors with a familial history of CAD. This could have led to a further decrease in the observed incidence of hypertension. It is possible, however, that the frequency of hypertension is underestimated in this group, especially in the context of research conducted in a different group of Polish blood donors, where the frequency of hypertension exceeds 50\u00a0%. In comparison, the frequency of hypertension in the general Polish population is in the range 30\u201345\u00a0% due to heterogeneous results of numerous epidemiological studies. We do not think, however, that the declared low incidence of hypertension in the control group has influenced the outcome of the present study. Underestimating of hypertension frequency would affect the results of association studies on hypertension. However, we did not analyze such a relationship in our study, but the association of the \u2212930A>G polymorphism and coronary artery disease. In summary, we found that the \u2212930A>G polymorphism is associated with coronary artery disease in the Polish population. The synergistic effects of this polymorphism with overweight/obesity and cigarette smoking increase the risk of CAD, and the \u2212930G allele carriers are particularly at risk of consequences of obesity and tobacco smoke exposure."}, "24442316": {"pmid": "24442316", "pmcid": "PMC3933741", "title": "Cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis protects liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in acute liver injured mice", "abstract": "\nCultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis (CMCS) was widely used for a variety of diseases including liver injury, the current study aims to investigate the protective effects of CMCS on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in acute injury liver and related action mechanisms. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and d-galactosamine (D-GalN). 39 male BABL/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: normal control, model control, CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment groups. The Serum liver function parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were assayed with the commercial kit. The inflammation and scaffold structure in liver were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and silver staining respectively. The LSECs and sub-endothelial basement membrane were observed with the scanning and transmission electronic microscope. The protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in liver were analyzed with Western blotting. Expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) was investigated with immunofluorescence staining. The lipid peroxidation indicators including antisuperoxideanion (ASAFR), hydroxyl free radical (\u00b7OH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were determined with kits, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2/9) activities in liver were analyzed with gelatin zymography and in situ fluorescent zymography respectively. The model mice had much higher serum levels of ALT and AST than the normal mice. Compared to that in the normal control, more severe liver inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis, worse hepatic lipid peroxidation demonstrated by the increased ASAFR, \u00b7OH and MDA, but decreased SOD and GST, increased MMP-2/9 activities and VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and vWF expressions, which revealed obvious LSEC injury and scaffold structure broken, were shown in the model control. Compared with the model group, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly improved serum ALT/AST, attenuated hepatic inflammation and improved peroxidative injury in liver, decreased MMP-2/9 activities in liver tissue, improved integration of scaffold structure, and decreased protein expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. CMCS could protect LSECs from injury and maintain the microvasculature integration in acute injured liver of mice induced by LPS/D-GalN. Its action mechanism was associated with the down-regulation of MMP-2/9 activities and inhibition of peroxidation in injured liver.\n", "fulltext": "The liver contains a myriad of network of vessels, including microvascular system, nourishing the parenchymal cells. The hepatic sinusoid is unique, dynamic microvascular structure that serves as the principal site of exchange between the blood and the perisinusoidal space. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are the major cell types in hepatic sinusoid, with the characteristic of fenestration in cell and endothelial matrix, the latter is called as \u201cendothelial basement membrane\u201d, which in normal liver consists of non-fibril-forming collagen including type IV collagen and proteoglycan and glycoproteins. This normal endothelial matrix is critical for maintaining the differentiated functions of resident liver cells such as hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells and LSECs, etc. LSECs injury occurred early when the liver suffered the insults, since it was exposed to higher blood levels than systematic concentrations toxins, while many toxins or metabolites absorbed from gastrointestinal tract were taken up into portal venous blood. In addition, the detachment of LSECs from endothelial matrix plate was critical component of injuries, while the inflammatory cells could improve matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) secretion at earlier liver injury and led to LSECs detachment. Recently, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is becoming an increasingly popular form of complementary medicine in western countries. Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.) Sacc., as a well-known tonic herb in TCM, is a highly valued fungus in China as playing an important role in regulating the disorder of biological activity. In recent years, cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis (CMCS) was successfully developed and widely used as the alternative of natural Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.) Sacc. Accumulated evidences from both animal and human studies indicated that Cordyceps sinensis was capable of anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammation. Furthermore, it acted as an anti-tumor, anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, insecticidal and anti-bacterial compound. In our previous studies, CMCS showed superior effects of anti-liver injury. Simultaneously, it was able to decreasing the injury and phenotype shift of LSECs. In the study, we observed the effect of CMCS on hepatic sinusoid in liver injury, including LSECs phenotype, basement membrane and matrix metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMP-2/9) activities, in order to investigate CMCS action mechanism against liver injury. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), d-galactosamine (D-GalN) and 1,10-phenanthroline were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. All other chemicals and solvents were of the highest grade commercially available. The powder of CMCS (1.0\u00a0kg), were provided from Shanghai Sundise Chinese Medicine Technology Development Co., Ltd, and were extracted successively three times with 6\u00a0l of water under reflux, and the combined extract were concentrated under vacuum at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and then dried by lyophilization to afford the extraction of CMCS (150\u00a0g). The end extraction contained 150\u00a0mg/ml of CMCS drug. The quantitative analyses of active compounds were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which performed on Waters2695 systerm (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA), equipped with an Waters PDA2996 analyzer. Alliance software was used for the data analysis and the result was shown in Fig.\u00a01. Male BABL/c mice weighing 18-22\u00a0g, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) level, were provided by Sino-British SIPPR/BK Lab Animals (Shanghai, China). They were housed in a room under controlled temperature (22\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C), humidity (46-52\u00a0%), and lighting (12-hour artificial light and dark cycle), with free access to tap water and mouse chow. The standard diet pellets contained not less than 20\u00a0% protein, 5\u00a0% fibers, 3.5\u00a0% fats, and 6.5\u00a0% ash and vitamins mixture. This experiment was conducted according to the local ethical guidelines (Shanghai University of TCM, Shanghai, China). All the mice were randomly divided into four experimental groups: normal control (n\u00a0=\u00a08), model control (n\u00a0=\u00a012), CMCS treatment (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group (n\u00a0=\u00a09). Mice in normal control and model control were administered orally by gavage with distilled water once a day, for four consecutive days at a dose of 4\u00a0ml/kg of body weight, respectively. Mice in CMCS treatment group were treated orally with CMCS at a daily dose of 120\u00a0mg/kg of body weight at the same time, which was equivalent to 10 times of the 60\u00a0kg adult dose. In 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1,10-phenanthroline twice a day, for four consecutive days at a daily dose of 25\u00a0ml/kg of body weight. 1,10-phenanthroline was used as the positive control medicine and its dosage was based on our previous trial experiment. On the fourth day, 1\u00a0h after the last intragastrical administration, the normal control group was received intraperitoneal injections of saline at a dose of 2\u00a0ml/kg of body weight. The other mice were received intraperitoneal injections of LPS and D-GalN at the dose of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg and 900\u00a0mg/kg of body weight respectively. All mice were sacrificed 7\u00a0h after the last injection. Measurement of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities were measured by using SpectraMax-M5 Multifunctional microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, California, USA) according to the manufacture\u2019s instructions. Liver function tests kits were supplied by Nanjing Jian Cheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). Hepatic homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0r/min for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Supernatants were immediately collected and assayed for enzyme activities. Levels of antisuperoxideanion (ASAFR), hydroxyl free radical (\u00b7OH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were assayed according to the protocols of kits purchased from NanJing Jian Cheng Bioengineering Institute. All these parameters were expressed by gram protein which was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Liver specimens were fixed in 10\u00a0% formaldehyde solution and dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, embedded in paraffin blocks, and cut into 4\u00a0\u03bcm thick slices. Slices for histopathological examination were stained by using standard procedure of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and silver, respectively. Fresh liver tissue was fixed in 10\u00a0% formaldehyde solution, embedded in paraffin, and sliced into 4-\u03bcm sections. Induction of apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) (ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit, S7100, Merck Millipore, Chemicon International, Inc, Billerica, MA). The apoptotic cells were stained brown, and nuclei were counterstained with Hematoxylin. TUNEL staining were analyzed with light microscope (Olympus BX40, Japan). To quantify the histologic findings, semi-quantification data for apoptosis in TUNEL staining were determined with the computer-assisted image analysis system. Besides, some of the liver tissues were embedded in OCT compound and stored at \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C. The frozen tissue block was sectioned using a crytome (Leica CM1850, Germany). Ten-micrometer-thick cryostat sections were cut and transferred to poly-l-lysine-coated slides. Cell apoptosis detection was performed with the one step TUNEL kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, the sections were permeabilized with 0.1\u00a0% Triton X-100 for 2\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C followed by TUNEL for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00b0. After washing, tissues were double stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visualize the nuclei. Images were obtained using a confocal microscope (Fluoview FV10i, Olympus, Japan) equipped with the Ultraviolet/Visible light LD laser combination. Photographs were taken with Olympus confocal software. Livers were thoroughly cleared by perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) of room temperature through the portal vein at a flow rate of 3\u00a0ml/min. One minute later, 2.5\u00a0% glutaraldehyde was perfused for an additional one minute at the same flow rate. Subsequently, livers were carefully removed and quickly immersed in 2.5\u00a0% glutaraldehyde for 48\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C as described previously. For transmission electron microscope (TEM), several 1-mm3 cubes were harvested from the liver, washed three times in PBS, and fixed in aqueous 1\u00a0% osmicacid, 1\u00a0% potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) Red prussiate of potash for 1\u00a0h. After another three times washes, blocks were dehydrated through a graded series of 30\u2013100\u00a0% ethanol, 100\u00a0% propylene oxide, and infiltrated for 1\u00a0h in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide: Polybed 618 epoxy resin (Shanghai Resin Factory Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). After several changes of 100\u00a0% resin over 24\u00a0h, blocks were embedded in molds and cured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight, followed by additional hardening at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. Ultrathin (60\u00a0nm) sections were collected onto 200-mesh copper grids, stained with 2\u00a0% uranyl acetate in 50\u00a0% methanol for 10\u00a0min and 1\u00a0% lead citrate for 7\u00a0min, respectively. Sections were photographed with a Tecniai-12 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the 3-mm-thick fragments were cut from the fixative, washed three times with PBS, and then immersed in aqueous 1\u00a0% Osmicacid for 2\u00a0h. After three times washes in PBS, slices were dehydrated through a graded series of 30\u2013100\u00a0% ethanol. Before critical point drying, washing with absolute ethanol was necessary. Slices were mounted onto aluminum stubs, sputter coated with gold/palladium, and viewed in a XL-30 scanning electron microscope (Philips, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) at 20.0\u00a0kV. Frozen tissues embedded in OCT compound were cut into ten-micrometer thick and fixed in 4\u00a0% formaldehyde (Dingguo, Shanghai, China). After washing, sections were incubated with primary antibody for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a moist chamber. Rabbit anti-human von Willebrand Factor antibody (ab6994) was purchased from Abcam and used as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:200 to examine the integrity of endothelial cells. To visualize the primary antibodies, cells were stained with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. After washing, cells were double stained with DAPI to visualize the nuclei. Images were obtained using a confocal microscope and photographs were taken with Olympus confocal software. The semi-quantification data for vWF protein level in the liver tissue were determined with the computer-assisted image analysis system. MMPs activities in liver tissue were analyzed by gelatin zymography and in situ fluorescent zymography respectively. MMPs zymography assay was modified as previously described. Briefly, liver tissues were homogenized and supernatant was aliquoted according to protein concentrations determined as the same procedures mentioned above. Aliquots (30\u00a0\u03bcg protein/lane) of liver tissue were prepared by dilution in the zymogram sample buffer (5\u00a0\u00d7) containing 0.4\u00a0mol/l Tris, pH 6.8, 5\u00a0% SDS, 20\u00a0% glycerol and 0.03\u00a0% bromphenol blue, separated with electrophoresis in 10\u00a0% SDS-PAGE containing 1\u00a0mg/mL gelatine as a substrate under non-reducing conditions. Afterwards, gels were washed in the reaction buffer containing 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, 5\u00a0mM CaCl2, 1\u00a0\u03bcM ZnCl2 and 2.5\u00a0% Triton-X 100 (pH 7.5). The reaction buffer was changed to a fresh one, and gels were incubated at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for 18\u00a0h. Gelatinolytic activity was visualized by staining the gels with 0.1\u00a0% Coomassie brilliant blue G-250, destained with 30\u00a0% methanol/20\u00a0% acetic acid water and destained with 30\u00a0% methanol/10\u00a0% acetic acid respectively. Clear zones in the background of blue staining exhibit the presence of gelatinase activities. The intensity of the bands was scanned and assayed by Furi Gel Image software (Furi, Shanghai, China). Fluorescent in situ zymography of liver section was performed according to Ben Wielockx\u2019s methods with modifications. Briefly, 1\u00a0mg/ml fluorescein-conjugated gelatine (Molecular Probes, USA) solution is diluted 1: 10 in the agarose-containing solution. Liver sections were mounted to the glass slide with the gelatin agarose mixture and incubated with 40\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in 0.5\u00a0mol/l Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.6), 50\u00a0mmol/l CaCl2 and 1.5\u00a0mol/l NaCl for 6\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Sections were washed three times with water, and subsequently Nuclei was counterstained by adding Hoechst (Beyotime, Haimen, China). Gelatinase activity in situ was visualized using Olympus fluorescent microscopy. Western blot analyses were performed essentially as described. Snap-frozen liver tissues were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0% NP-40, 0.1\u00a0% SDS, 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.4, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM PMSF and 1\u00d7 complete mini (Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min to separate cytosolic-enriched supernatant from nuclei- and membrane-enriched pellets. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay kit mentioned above. Equal amount of proteins were separated by 10\u00a0% SDS gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under denaturing and non-reducing condition, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Even transfer was confirmed by staining with 0.2\u00a0% Ponceau Red S in 3\u00a0% trichloroacetic acid. Membranes were blocked with 5\u00a0% nonfat milk in TBST (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.1\u00a0% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1\u00a0h, incubated with primary antibody ICAM-1(1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and VCAM-1 (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight, respectively. After washing with TBST, blots were incubated with horseradish-coupled secondary antibody in wash buffer. Signals were developed with the immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and quantified using a ChemiDoc image analyzer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). All data were expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (SD). Differences between the groups were assessed by nonparametric One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the least significant difference (LSD) post hoc tests. Statistical significance was taken at the p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 level. In order to evaluate the effect of CMCS on LPS/D-GalN induced acute liver injury, serum levels of ALT and AST were determined. After LPS/D-GalN treatment, serum ALT and AST activities significantly elevated in mice (Table\u00a01). In the vicinity of hepatic lesions, particularly alongside the lesion border, pronounced apoptotic bodies, necrotic and cytolytic hepatocytes with widely mononuclear cell infiltration were shown in the model mice (Figs.\u00a02b, 3). Obviously, CMCS treatment group significantly decreased the elevated levels of ALT and AST activities (Table\u00a01), ameliorated liver inflammation (Fig.\u00a02c) and alleviated hepatocellular apoptosis in extent (Fig.\u00a03) in comparison to the LPS/D-GalN treated group. Mice treated with 1,10-phenanthroline showed weak hepatic lesions alongside the central vein, with few apoptotic hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a03). Liver tissues in normal control showed intact scaffold structure with black continuous reticular fibers paralleled the hepatic cords (Fig.\u00a04a). Obviously, liver sections of model mice exhibited severe broken hepatic scaffold structure (Fig.\u00a04b) with fragmentized silver nitrate deposits scattering in hepatic tissue. By contrast, CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment maintained hepatic scaffold structure in extent, respectively (Fig.\u00a04c, d). Herein, we observed the electron micrograph of the LSECs and vWF expression in liver tissue, aiming to survey the potential effect of CMCS on protecting liver sinusoid endothelial cell. SEM and TEM revealed the protective effects of CMCS on LPS/D-GalN induced LSECs injury, respectively. Generally, fenestrations, with laminar extensions containing abundant rounded pores were organized in sieve plates (Fig.\u00a05a) and LSECs were lack of basement membrane, exhibiting very thin and flattened cellular expansions with distally laminal-shaped endochylema (Fig.\u00a06a) in control mice. Besides, levels of vWF in model mice expressed much higher than that of in the normal control (Fig.\u00a07A-a, A-b). After LPS/D-GalN treatment, larger pores of LSECs were exhibited in model mice (Fig.\u00a05b). Meanwhile, red blood cells (RBCs) from sinusoidal lumen overflowed through haemorrhagia regions of severe lesioned LSECs (Fig.\u00a06b). CMCS was demonstrated relatively to reduce the amplification of the pores and to relieve the broken structures of basement membrane, with the mildly lesion and small amounts of haemorrhagia (Fig.\u00a05c). Similarly, 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group showed smaller pores than that of the model control group (Fig.\u00a05d). Furthermore, LSECs from mice treated with 1,10-phenanthroline demonstrated relatively unbroken hepatic scaffold structure (Fig.\u00a06d) Coincidentally, vWF, a golden marker of endothelial function, was virtually increased in CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group, respectively(Fig.\u00a07A-c, A-d). In order to evaluate endogenous antioxidant defense, hepatic oxidant/antioxidant system was examined. Levels of tissue ASAFR, \u00b7OH, SOD and GST in mice receiving LPS/D-GalN were significantly higher than those of in the normal control group while tissue MDA levels were significantly lower (Table\u00a02). When compared with the model control group, levels of tissue ASAFR, \u00b7OH, SOD and GST of mice receiving CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline were lower than those of the model group, respectively. In CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group, levels of MDA were significantly decreased, respectively. In order to understand the effects of CMCS upon the expression and activity of gelatinases in hepatic tissues, we examined the hepatic MMP-2/9 activities by gelatin zymography (Fig.\u00a08a, b) and in situ fluorescent zymography (Fig.\u00a08c) respectively. The results illustrated significantly lower MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in the normal control group compared with those of the model control group (Fig.\u00a08b). By contrast, mice treated with CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly inhibited activities of MMP-2/9 respectively (Fig.\u00a08b). Interestingly, MMP-9 activities and active MMP-2 in CMCS treatment group expressed about two-folder higher than that of in 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group (Fig.\u00a08b). Western blot analysis (Fig.\u00a09a, b) showed protein expressions of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 respectively. Expressions of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were significantly increased in model mice while CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline could decrease the protein expressions of those. Graphic values were represented as the densities of ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 versus GAPDH (%) (Fig.\u00a09c). Oftentimes, the role of microvascular system in liver injury pathobiology is neglected, although heterogeneous disturbances in portal blood flow have profound consequences on organ function and dysfunctions. Actually, the LSECs, a main cell type of hepatic microvascular system or sinusoids, play a pivot role in maintaining structure and function of the liver. Recent documents demonstrated that LSECs not only were the primary targets of drugs, pharmacological agents and other pathological disturbances, but also might be the initial stimulus for hepatic fibrogenesis. Bacterial LPS, the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, could induce intrahepatic inflammation to produce various proinflammatory cytokines by activation of Kupffer cells. D-GalN, as a specific hepatotoxic agent, was used to increase the susceptibility to the lethal effects of endotoxin. In the present study, LPS and D-GalN intoxication caused obvious acute liver injury in mice, demonstrated by the elevated serum ALT and AST activities, obvious liver inflammation lesion, widely vWF expressions and scaffolds structure broken among sinusoids, etc. However, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline (MMPs inhibitor) could ameliorate the liver injury compared to the model control, evidenced by the decreasing levels of serum liver function, attenuating the inflammation with widely mononuclear cell infiltration, apoptotic bodies, necrotic and cytolytic hepatocytes in liver. Furthermore, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline could maintain the hepatic scaffold structure from breaking. Significantly, CMCS treatment could inhibit the expression of vWF with increased level, which might be an original finding in the liver disease and the study of its mechanism. It indicated that CMCS had potential effects against acute liver injury as well as hepatic microvasculature damage. Remarkably, 1,10-phenanthroline acted as a better role in protecting hepatocytes and hepatic scaffold structure than CMCS. LSECs, as the major cell types of microvasculature, are very sensitive to toxins from circulation. In the normal liver, LSECs were located on the hepatic sinusoid walls, with un-continuous matrix membrane under LSECs (scaffold structure) and fenestrations among cytoplasm. LSECs constitutively expressed the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which along with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), were up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli either in a direct manner or by mediators released from stimulated Kupffer cells. Once acute liver injury occured, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were consequently up-regulated on the endothelial surface, mediating the transmigration of leukocytes into the liver parenchyma. More importantly, the fenestrations became large and endothelial matrix was broken, which would lead to dysfunctions of microcirculations. In the study, the model mice had larger pores were presented in LSECs under SEM and damaged endothelial matrix under TEM observation, with a lot of haemorrhagia and broken scaffold structure stained by silver solution under light scope, and increased expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. However, we found that both CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline could restore the fenestration, decrease haemorrhagia in sinusoids, attenuate scaffold structure damage, and down-regulate the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. These results indicated that CMCS might have the effects of protecting LSECs from liver injury and keep the structural integration of hepatic sinusoids. LSECs injury was associated with its detachment from matrix membrane, which was mainly regulated by MMP-2/9. In our study, 1,10-phenanthroline, an MMPs inhibitor, was selected as the positive control. As expected, CMCS could decrease the expressions and activities of MMP-2/9 of model mice, which demonstrated that CMCS down-regulated MMP-2/9 activities, and protected endothelial matrix degradation, resulting in protection of LSECs detachment and injury. Besides, LSECs are very vulnerable to oxidative stress, in the experiment, the hepatic lipid peroxidation in the model mice was obviously demonstrated by decreased SOD and GSH but increased MDA etc., while in CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment group, levels of MDA were decreased and ASAFR, \u00b7OH, SOD and GST were increased significantly, respectively. All these data revealed that anti-oxidation might be another action mechanism of CMCS against LSECs injury. In the study, we also found that 1,10-phenanthroline could relieve the acute liver injury by down-regulating levels of serum liver functions, protecting hepatocyte from lesion, resisting oxidative stress, etc., suggesting this MMP inhibitor might had potential application in LPS/D-GalN induced acute liver injury. LPS alone or combined with D-GalN could induce the liver injuries with complicated mechanism. In addition to peroxidative stress and MMP-2/9 regulation, it could mediate the TLR-4 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, inhibit the expression of vWF with increased level, and result in regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAME-1 expression and LSEC injury. In the current study, we focused on the effects of CMCS on LSECs in acute injured liver, and the action mechanisms relating to MMP-2/9 activities as well as liver peroxidation. Whether CMCS could regulate LPS induced TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway remains unknown, this possible underlying molecular action mechanisms of CMCS will be our future investigation. CMCS is effective on alleviating LSECs damage and restoring microvasculature integration in acute liver injured mice induced by LPS/D-GalN. Its action mechanism was associated with down-regulation of MMP-2/9 and protection of peroxidation in injured liver."}, "26991973": {"pmid": "26991973", "pmcid": "PMC5021142", "title": "\nMOL1 is required for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis", "abstract": "\nSummary\nPlants maintain pools of pluripotent stem cells which allow them to constantly produce new tissues and organs. Stem cell homeostasis in shoot and root tips depends on negative regulation by ligand\u2013receptor pairs of the CLE peptide and leucine\u2010rich repeat receptor\u2010like kinase (LRR\u2010RLK) families. However, regulation of the cambium, the stem cell niche required for lateral growth of shoots and roots, is poorly characterized. Here we show that the LRR\u2010RLK MOL1 is necessary for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana. By employing promoter reporter lines, we reveal that MOL1 is active in a domain that is distinct from the domain of the positively acting CLE41/PXY signaling module. In particular, we show that MOL1 acts in an opposing manner to the CLE41/PXY module and that changing the domain or level of MOL1 expression both result in disturbed cambium organization. Underlining discrete roles of MOL1 and PXY, both LRR\u2010RLKs are not able to replace each other when their expression domains are interchanged. Furthermore, MOL1 but not PXY is able to rescue CLV1 deficiency in the shoot apical meristem. By identifying genes mis\u2010expressed in mol1 mutants, we demonstrate that MOL1 represses genes associated with stress\u2010related ethylene and jasmonic acid hormone signaling pathways which have known roles in coordinating lateral growth of the Arabidopsis stem. Our findings provide evidence that common regulatory mechanisms in different plant stem cell niches are adapted to specific niche anatomies and emphasize the importance of a complex spatial organization of intercellular signaling cascades for a strictly bidirectional tissue production.\n", "fulltext": "The coordinated determination of cell fate during the transformation of pluripotent stem cells to specialized body cells is crucial for the development of higher organisms. Intercellular communication between stem cells and their immediate derivatives is a common motif in this context (Seuntjens et\u00a0al., 2009; Doma et\u00a0al., 2013). However, how stem cell properties are controlled without strict determination by cell lineage and how directionality of tissue production is achieved in these cases is unknown. Plants are extraordinary in this regard, because cell fate is constantly readjusted allowing indeterminate increase in body size by the constant formation of new tissues. Stem cells facilitating longitudinal growth of organs are embedded in protective niches located at shoot and root tips, called the shoot and root apical meristems (SAM and RAM) (Heidstra and Sabatini, 2014). Although the orientation of cell divisions is tightly controlled in cases such as the Arabidopsis RAM, divisions in apical meristems of higher plants are often random (Heimsch and Seago, 2008; Aichinger et\u00a0al., 2012). In contrast, lateral growth of roots and shoots predominantly depends on strictly oriented cell divisions in the cambium, a bifacial meristem producing secondary vascular tissue (Brackmann and Greb, 2014). Interestingly, although plant meristems are anatomically distinct, limited numbers of comparative studies have shown commonalities in their regulation (Sarkar et\u00a0al., 2007; Stahl et\u00a0al., 2013; Zhou et\u00a0al. 2014), suggesting the existence of common motifs promoting plant stem cell attributes. One set of regulatory components found in all plant stem cell niches is composed of specific members of the LRR\u2010RLK family, their ligands belonging to the CLAVATA3/ESR\u2010RELATED peptide (CLEp) family and members of the WUSCHEL\u2010RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) transcription factor family (Lenhard and Laux, 2003; DeYoung et\u00a0al., 2006; Hirakawa et\u00a0al., 2008, 2010; Ogawa et\u00a0al., 2008; Guo et\u00a0al., 2010; Depuydt et\u00a0al., 2013). In the SAM, binding of the CLE peptide CLAVATA3 (CLV3p) to the LRR\u2010RLK CLV1 inhibits transcription of the stem cell promoting WUSCHEL (WUS) transcription factor gene (Schoof et\u00a0al., 2000; Ogawa et\u00a0al., 2008). In turn, the WUS protein moves from the center of the meristem to the apical stem cells to activate CLV3 expression, thus completing a feedback loop that balances stem cell proliferation (Mayer et\u00a0al., 1998; Yadav et\u00a0al., 2011; Daum et\u00a0al., 2014). In the RAM, CLV1 acts together with the receptor kinase ARABIDOPSIS CRINKLY4 (ACR4) to inhibit the WOX5 transcription factor gene maintaining root stem cells (Sarkar et\u00a0al., 2007; De Smet et\u00a0al., 2008; Stahl et\u00a0al., 2009, 2013). In this case, CLE40p is most likely produced in differentiated root tip cells and binds to CLV1, which is expressed in the distal stem cells (Sarkar et\u00a0al., 2007; Stahl et\u00a0al., 2009, 2013; Guo et\u00a0al., 2010). While regulatory mechanisms underlying stem cell homeostasis in the two apical meristem types (SAM and RAM) have been studied intensively, it is not well understood how proliferation of the stem cells in lateral meristems, for instance the cambium, is controlled. Only a positive regulatory cascade has been found there: The CLE41/44p is generated in differentiated phloem cells, a cambium\u2010derived vascular tissue produced toward the organ periphery (distally). From there it moves to the stem cells within the cambium where it binds to the LRR\u2010RLK PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM (PXY, also known as TDR). Thereby, CLE41/44p inhibits differentiation of xylem, the vascular tissue produced toward the organ center (proximally) (Fisher and Turner, 2007; Hirakawa et\u00a0al., 2008; Etchells and Turner, 2010; Kondo et\u00a0al., 2014). In addition, the binding enhances expression of WOX4, another member of the WOX transcription factor family, which in turn promotes cambial cell divisions (Hirakawa et\u00a0al., 2010; Suer et\u00a0al., 2011; Etchells et\u00a0al., 2013). The distinct directionality of the CLE41/PXY\u2010dependent signaling seems to provide spatial information for instructing the almost strictly periclinal (parallel to the organ surface) orientation of cell divisions in the cambium (Etchells and Turner, 2010). However, considering the bifacial character of the cambium, a more complex system for providing spatial and directional information than the unidirectional CLE41/PXY system may be predicted to act in the cambium zone. Furthermore, in analogy to the apical meristems, a negative regulation for cambium homeostasis is to be expected. Although several LRR\u2010RLKs have been detected to be expressed associated with the cambium in woody species (Wang et\u00a0al., 2015), no such negative regulation has been characterized to date. Thus, it is unclear how strictly bidirectional tissue production is achieved and how the regulatory networks that are involved are spatially organized to produce such a tightly controlled system. Here, we use fluorescent promoter reporters to show that the LRR\u2010RLK MORE LATERAL GROWTH1 (MOL1) is expressed in the distal domain of the cambium. Histological and genetic analyses demonstrate that MOL1 contributes to stem cell homeostasis within the cambium and niche organization and that PXY and WOX4 act epistatically to MOL1. MOL1 is closely related to PXY but by swapping the promoters of these genes we found that PXY and MOL1 are not interchangeable. Interestingly, MOL1 is able to replace CLV1 in the SAM but this does not hold true for PXY. We also show that MOL1 represses stress\u2010related hormonal signaling pathways that positively influence cambium activity. Altogether, we identify MOL1 as a member of a predicted intercellular communication cascade acting antagonistically to the CLE41/PXY/WOX4 cascade and connecting distinct niche areas. This signaling module is functionally relevant for the dynamics of the anatomically complex cambium and, thus, provides scenarios for the evolution of plant stem cell niches. As MOL1 was an excellent candidate for representing a negative signaling cascade repressing cambium activity (Agust\u00ed et\u00a0al., 2011b), we set out to analyze the role of the MOL1 gene in cambium regulation. To determine spatial organization of MOL1 activity in the cambium area, we generated Arabidopsis lines carrying a proMOL1:YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (YFP) reporter harboring MOL1 promoter regions sufficient to fully complement the mol1 mutant phenotype when driving MOL1 expression (see below). The reporter was combined with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)\u2010based reporters driven by the promoters of PXY or APL, which are active in the predicted stem cells within the cambium or in the differentiated phloem, respectively (Agust\u00ed et\u00a0al., 2011a). Analysis of laterally growing stems showed that the MOL1 promoter was mostly active distally to the area of proPXY:CFP activity (Figure\u00a01a\u2013f) and overlapped with proAPL:CFP activity (Figure\u00a01g\u2013l), but also included APL\u2010negative developing phloem cells and phloem parenchyma (Figure\u00a01g,h). A similar arrangement of activity domains was found in hypocotyls from seedlings and mature plants and in primary vascular bundles from inflorescence stems (Figure\u00a0S1a\u2013g). These expression patterns together with the observation that cambium activity is enhanced in mol1 mutants (Agust\u00ed et\u00a0al., 2011b) suggested that MOL1 either represses stem cell divisions or, alternatively, regulates the transition of cambium stem cells to phloem cells delivered toward the organ periphery. To decide between both possibilities, we first examined the expansion of secondary vascular tissues in mature mol1\u20101 mutant (Agust\u00ed et\u00a0al., 2011b) hypocotyls. The overall hypocotyl diameter was increased in mol1\u20101 compared with wild type, with an increase in both phloem and xylem production (Figure\u00a02a,e,f). This alteration was similar to the increase in lateral growth in the inflorescence stem (Figure\u00a02b,g,h). To verify that tissue extension is a good proxy for the number of cells within these tissues we prepared new samples and counted the number of cells along the line of measurement in the inflorescence stem. This analysis showed that mol1\u20101 not only displayed a significantly larger extension of the interfascicular cambium\u2010derived tissues (Figure\u00a02b,g,h), but that there are indeed more cells within these regions (Figure\u00a0S1h). In contrast with mol1\u20101 mutants, expression of MOL1 fused to YFP under the control of the strong and ubiquitous CaMV 35S promoter (Benfey and Chua, 1990) led to a reduction in the amount of phloem and xylem cells in the hypocotyl (Figure\u00a02c,i,j) and a reduction in lateral growth at the base of the inflorescence stem (Figure\u00a02d,k,l). In addition, the production of well aligned files of compact cells derived from cambial divisions was strongly reduced in the inflorescence stem (Figure\u00a02k,l). Furthermore, cambium cells were poorly organized and often absent in mature hypocotyls (Figure\u00a02i,j), indicating that enhanced and/or ectopic MOL1 activity alters the organization of the cambium zone and that MOL1 negatively regulates cambium attributes. Consistent with the latter conclusion, enhanced tissue production in mol1\u20101 mutants was not observed when these mutants also carried wox4\u20101, or pxy\u20104 mutations, which diminish cambium activity (Fisher and Turner, 2007; Suer et\u00a0al., 2011) (Figure\u00a02b,m\u2013p) but do not alter MOL1 mRNA abundance on the organ level (Agust\u00ed et\u00a0al., 2011b; Suer et\u00a0al., 2011; Etchells et\u00a0al., 2012) (Dataset S1). This favors the conclusion that WOX4 and PXY act epistatically to MOL1 and that MOL1 acts on a fully functional cambium. Collectively, these observations argue for a primary role of MOL1 in repressing the division rate of cambium stem cells. In order to determine whether MOL1 has additional effects on plant growth outside the cambium we counted the primary rosette leaves to gauge floral transition and measured the fresh weight of the aerial parts at the same growth stage as was analyzed above. This analysis revealed a small but statistically significant delay in floral\u00a0transition of mol1\u20101 mutants (Figure\u00a03a). In addition, mol1\u20101 mutants were slightly heavier than wild type plants (Figure\u00a03b). However, the time until plants reached 15 to 20\u00a0cm shoot height was almost identical (49.1\u00a0days for wild type and 50.8\u00a0days for mol1\u20101), indicating that these differences most likely were due to changes in growth rate, rather than the length of the growth period. In spite of these changes the overall morphology of mol1\u20101 mutants did not appear to be different to wild type plants (Figure\u00a03c,d). These findings were in line with a role of MOL1 predominantly in cambium regulation and underlined the specificity of the observed effects. Supporting this conclusion, the anatomy of primary vascular bundles was not altered in mol1\u20101 mutants (Figure\u00a0S1i,j) and a \u03b2\u2010glucuronidase (GUS)\u2010based transcriptional proMOL:GUS reporter demonstrated an activity of MOL1 exclusively in the mature vascular system harboring an established cambium\u2010like stem cell niche (Figure\u00a0S1k\u2013o). To see whether there is a direct interaction between MOL1 and the positively acting PXY/CLE41/WOX4 signaling cascade, we compared transcriptional profiles of mol1\u20101 and wild type from the bottom\u2010most centimeter of inflorescence stems harboring a secondary tissue conformation (Sehr et\u00a0al., 2010). Consistent with increased lateral growth in mol1\u20101 mutants, we identified genes linked to the stress\u2010related ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling pathways, which are positively associated with lateral stem growth (Love et\u00a0al., 2009; Sehr et\u00a0al., 2010; Etchells et\u00a0al., 2012), to be more expressed in mol1\u20101 (Figure\u00a0S2a and Dataset S1). Particularly striking was the observation that 20% (38/190) of genes that are upregulated in mol1\u20101 are also upregulated in pxy mutants, including several ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) transcription factor genes which partly compensate the loss of PXY activity (Etchells et\u00a0al., 2012), (Figure\u00a0S2b and Dataset S1). In contrast, CLE41, WOX4 or PXY were not found to be differentially expressed. These findings were confirmed by qRT\u2010PCR analysis (Figure\u00a03e,f) and by analyzing proWOX4:YFP and proPXY:YFP promoter reporters which did not display an altered pattern of activity when comparing wild type and mol1\u20101 mutant backgrounds (Figure\u00a0S2c). Analysis of transcriptomes from the second elongated internode, with primary tissue conformation, revealed just 16 genes, again not including PXY, CLE41 or WOX4, to be significantly (adjusted P\u2010value <0.1) changed in mol1\u20101 (Dataset S1). In addition to supporting the idea of a role of MOL1 predominantly in the regulation of lateral growth, these observations imply that MOL1 does not directly repress PXY, CLE41 or WOX4 gene activities. Importantly, although the extracellular domain of PXY is the most similar one to the extracellular domain of MOL1 within the Arabidopsis proteome (Figure\u00a04a) both LRR\u2010RLKs were not able to functionally replace each other when their respective promoters were swapped (Figure\u00a04b\u2013k). This was although all transgenes were actively expressed (Figure\u00a0S3a\u2013d). In contrast, a proMOL1:MOL1 transgene was able to fully complement the mol1\u20101 mutant phenotype and a proPXY:PXY transgene partly restored cambium dynamics in pxy\u20104 mutant backgrounds (Figure\u00a04b\u2013k). This finding suggests that both MOL1 and PXY act in distinct signaling cascades. To investigate whether MOL1 activity in the distal cambium domain is essential, we expressed MOL1 under the control of the PXY promoter in wild type and in mol1\u20101 mutants. Interestingly, we observed severe disorganization of the cambium in some cases (n\u00a0=\u00a01/7 for proPXY:MOL1 in wild type and 2/6 for proPXY:MOL1 in mol1\u20101) (Figure\u00a04l\u2013o) underlining the importance of a proper spatial organization of MOL1 for organized cambium activity. More generally, our observations underline the importance of a MOL1 and PXY\u2010dependent regulation of distinct regulatory programs in discrete cambium domains. To see whether MOL1 is able to act as a general repressor of stem cell activity, we expressed MOL1 under the control of the CLV1 promoter in clv1\u201020 mutants (Durbak and Tax, 2011) (Figure\u00a0S4). We found that MOL1 rescued the petal number defect of clv1\u201020 mutants in a similar manner as CLV1 itself (Figure\u00a05a\u2013e). In contrast, when we expressed PXY under the control of the CLV1 promoter (Figure\u00a0S4), we found that the primary apical meristem was prematurely terminated and numerous axillary inflorescence stems developed (Figure\u00a05f). This showed that MOL1 and CLV1, two LRR\u2010RLKs negatively influencing meristem activity, are able to replace each other in the SAM, while PXY behaves differently in this context. Regulation of stem cell activity is a paradigm for cell fate determination in multicellular organisms (Sanchez Alvarado and Yamanaka, 2014). Due to the lack of cell motility and of fixed cell lineages in plants, the spatial arrangement of the signaling networks that are involved is essential for creating a cellular environment promoting stem cell properties. Here we identified MOL1 as a negative regulator of cambium activity acting antagonistically to the CLE41/PXY/WOX4 cascade. We revealed that the expression domain of MOL1 is strongly associated with the radial tissue organization within the cambium area suggesting that MOL1 represents an intercellular communication module that is important for stem cell homeostasis within the cambium. In contrast with the SAM and RAM, for which negative regulatory feedback loops via LRR\u2010RLK/CLE cascades are well characterized (Schoof et\u00a0al., 2000; Stahl et\u00a0al., 2009, 2013; Daum et\u00a0al., 2014), only local regulators acting positively on cambium stem cell activity were previously known (Fisher and Turner, 2007; Hirakawa et\u00a0al., 2008, 2010; Etchells and Turner, 2010). Based on its influence on both phloem and xylem production, the epistasis of WOX4 and PXY to MOL1 and its capacity to replace CLV1 in the SAM, we identified MOL1 as a negative regulator of cambium homeostasis. We also show that it is expressed in the distal cambium domain including differentiated phloem cells and mostly distinct from the PXY activity domain. Similarly to the RAM (Bennett and Scheres, 2010), the cambium delivers cells in opposite directions, in this case, by strongly favoring periclinal cell divisions along the longest cell axis. In light of these tightly controlled dynamics, reciprocal signaling cascades connecting the central stem cells with their progenitors and providing positional and directional information can be expected. CLE41p is produced in the phloem and travels to the central cambium domain where it promotes cambium activity via PXY and WOX4 (Hirakawa et\u00a0al., 2008; Etchells et\u00a0al., 2012). Although MOL1 and the positive cambium regulators CLE41 and CLE44 seem to be expressed in similar domains (Hirakawa et\u00a0al., 2008; Etchells and Turner, 2010), neither CLE41 nor CLE44 transcript accumulation was detectably altered in mol1\u20101 mutants arguing against a MOL1\u2010dependent non\u2010cell autonomous regulation of cambium activity by influencing CLE41/44 transcription. This view is also supported by our finding that WOX4, whose activity is stimulated by CLE41, is not altered in mol1\u20101 mutants (Hirakawa et\u00a0al., 2010). Of note, the finding that WOX4 activity is not altered in mol1\u20101 is in contrast to our previous analysis during which we detected higher WOX4 mRNA levels in stems from mol1 mutants (Agust\u00ed et\u00a0al., 2011b). We propose that enhanced WOX4 activity was previously detected due to an enhanced acropetal progression of cambium initiation along the stem in mol1 mutants leading to an altered overall anatomy with more cambium\u2010related cells in analyzed stem fragments, but not due to an enhanced WOX4 activity at a given position. In addition, because PXY and MOL1 are not able to replace each other when expressed in the respective expression domains, we suggest that two largely independent signaling cascades exist in the cambium acting antagonistically in functional terms and, potentially, in their spatial directionality of intercellular signaling. Although the three BARELY ANY MERISTEM (BAM1\u20103) LRR\u2010RLKs have partly opposing functions to CLV1 in the SAM (DeYoung et\u00a0al., 2006; Deyoung and Clark, 2008), counteracting LRR\u2010RLKs/CLE cascades with a prominent spatial specificity have not been observed in apical plant stem cell niches in which tissue production is not strictly bidirectional. Thus, it is possible that the spatial contrast of the PXY/CLE41 cascades with MOL1 reflects the necessity for a radial communication between cambium\u2010related tissues during lateral growth. Interestingly, ERF transcription factor genes that are expressed in the central cambium domain and known to promote lateral stem growth downstream of WOX4 and PXY (Etchells et\u00a0al., 2012) are more active in mol1\u20101 mutants. Because these stress\u2010related signaling components are more active, even in primary mol1 stems in which tissue anatomy is not altered, it is possible that MOL1 primarily acts on cambium activity by repressing ethylene signaling independently of WOX4 and PXY. Cambium activity results in the expansion of peripheral organ tissues and mechano\u2010sensitive stress signaling has been suggested to play a major role in the coordination of tissue dynamics (Ko et\u00a0al., 2004; Sehr et\u00a0al., 2010). The current view is that lateral meristems, like the cambium, evolved after the apical meristems and allowed plants to adapt to a plethora of ecological niches on land (Rowe and Speck, 2005; Spicer and Groover, 2010; Hirakawa and Bowman, 2015). The diversification and adjustment of signaling networks involved in apical meristem regulation during the evolution of lateral plant growth, in particular CLE/LRR\u2010RLK signaling modules seem to have been essential for this major breakthrough in the establishment of a broad range of different plant growth forms (Miwa et\u00a0al., 2009). The identification of MOL1 as being important for cambium regulation and the spatial association with this particular stem cell niche suggests that they belong to a regulatory program diversified to regulate lateral plant growth. Its specific capacity to replace CLV1 in the SAM further demonstrates a functional similarity between the regulatory systems in both stem cell niches. Thus, the establishment of a complex spatial organization of signaling components might have been instrumental for developing a novel stem cell niche with a strict demand for directionality of tissue production. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. plants of the accession Columbia were used for all experiments and grown as described previously (Suer et\u00a0al., 2011). Protein sequences were aligned by CLC Main Workbench 6.9 (CLC bio, Denmark) using the default parameters (gap opening cost: 10; gap extension cost: 1.0; gap separation distance: 8) and visualized by the Create Tree tool of the same software. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the neighbor\u2010joining (NJ) method and the Jukes Cantor method for estimating the number of amino acid substitutions between sequences. Bootstrap values were obtained by 1000 bootstrap replicates. qRT\u2010PCR was carried out using SensiMix\u2122 SYBR\u00ae\u00a0Green (Bioline Reagents Ltd, London, UK) mastermix and gene specific primers as detailed in Table\u00a0S1, in a Roche Lightcycler480, with standard three\u2010step amplification and detection protocols. Raw amplification data were exported and analyzed with LinRegPCR (Ruijter et\u00a0al., 2009; Tuomi et\u00a0al., 2010) software. Further analysis and statistical tests were done using Microsoft Excel\u00ae. Confocal microscopy of inflorescence stems was based on the protocol of (Suer et\u00a0al., 2011). Stem cross\u2010sections were hand\u2010cut with a razor blade (Classic Wilkinson, Wilkinson, Solingen, Germany) and mounted in water. For seedling hypocotyls, the plants were first mounted in 4% low melting point agar (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in water to facilitate handling during sectioning. Micrographs were taken using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) with separate tracks for excitation and detection of each fluorophore. CFP was excited at 458\u00a0nm and imaged by collecting emissions between 463 and 508\u00a0nm. YFP was excited at 514\u00a0nm and emissions were collected between 517 and 543\u00a0nm. Propidium iodide (1:5000 v/v in water) was used to counter\u2010stain secondary cell walls. Propidium iodide was excited by laser at 561\u00a0nm and emissions were collected between 561 and 608\u00a0nm. Transmitted light from the 561\u00a0nm laser was collected to make the bright field images. All fluorescent reporter proteins were targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the appropriate target sequences (Haseloff et\u00a0al., 1997). For MOL1 promoter constructs, initially two genomic fragments (1296\u00a0bp upstream of the start codon and 490\u00a0bp downstream of the stop codon) were inserted between NotI and ApaI sites of pGreen0229 or pGreen0029 (Hellens et\u00a0al., 2000) resulting in pMS40 and pMS94, respectively. The open reading frames of YFP\u2013ER or GUS were then inserted into restrictions sites introduced between the two genomic fragments in pMS40 (resulting in pNG1 and pMS92, respectively) and the MOL1 open reading frame was inserted into pMS94 (resulting in pMS95). For proMOL1:PXY (pKG49), the same strategy was used except that in this case pGreenII0179 served as a backbone. The proPXY:CFP, proAPL:CFP and proWOX4:YFP reporters were described previously (Agust\u00ed et\u00a0al., 2011a; Suer et\u00a0al., 2011). For proPXY:PXY (pMS85) and proPXY:MOL1 (pMS84) constructs the sequence of the CFP was replaced by the respective open reading frames. For the pro35S:MOL1\u2013YFP construct (pMS90), a DNA fragment encoding the MOL1\u2013YFP fusion was cloned into pGreen0229 containing the 35S promoter. All constructs were sequenced and, after plant transformation, single copy lines were identified by Southern blot\u00a0analyses and representative lines were used for further investigations. Histological analyses of the stem were performed as described previously (Agust\u00ed et\u00a0al., 2011a). All samples compared histologically were grown in parallel. Measurements were made blind to sample identity. RNA in\u00a0situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (Greb et\u00a0al., 2003). For probe synthesis, PCR products (Table\u00a0S1) generated using cDNA as a template were cloned into the pGEM\u2010T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and used as a template for transcription from the T7 or SP6 promoter. MOL1 and PXY probes were described before (Agust\u00ed et\u00a0al., 2011b). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol\u00ae (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For RNA sequencing, total RNA was isolated from the bottom\u2010most centimeter of the elongated inflorescence stem of 20\u00a0cm tall plants or from above the first node. Library preparation and Deep RNA sequencing comparing wild type and mol1\u20101 mutants with two replicates each in which RNA from two plants was pooled (single\u2010end, 50\u00a0bp reads, at least 27.5 million aligned fragments for each sample) was performed at the Vienna Biocenter Core Facilities GmbH (VBCF) (Vienna, Austria). RNA sequencing of samples from above the first node comparing wild type, mol1 used three replicates per genotype and each replicate contained RNA pooled from two or three plants. Each replicate produced at least 37 million aligned reads (single read 50\u00a0bp). HiSeq machines (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) were used in all cases. All reads were aligned using CLC Genomics Work Bench 7 (CLC bio, Denmark). For statistical analysis the DESeq package from the R/Bioconductor software was used. Normalization and analysis of microarray data published previously was done by the Robust Multi\u2010Array (RMA) method using the affy and Limma packages from the R/Bioconductor software (Gautier et\u00a0al., 2004; Gentleman et\u00a0al., 2004; Anders and Huber, 2010). An adjusted P\u2010value of 0.1 was chosen as a threshold for selecting differentially expressed genes in Dataset S1. BioMaps analysis using the Virtual Plant software [version 1.3, www.virtualplant.org (Katari et\u00a0al., 2010)], was done using the following parameters: gene ontology (GeneOntology_biological processes), method (Fisher), background (whole genome), cutoff (0.01). Raw and processed data generated in this study have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et\u00a0al., 2013) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE61293 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61293)."}, "24014394": {"pmid": "24014394", "pmcid": "PMC4028993", "title": "A Homozygous Mutation in LYRM7/MZM1L Associated with Early Onset Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Severe Reduction of Mitochondrial Complex III Activity", "abstract": "\nMutations in nuclear genes associated with defective complex III (cIII) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are rare, having been found in only two cIII assembly factors and, as private changes in single families, three cIII structural subunits. Recently, human LYRM7/MZM1L, the ortholog of yeast MZM1, has been identified as a new assembly factor for cIII. In a baby patient with early onset, severe encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and profound, isolated cIII deficiency in skeletal muscle, we identified a disease-segregating homozygous mutation (c.73G>A) in LYRM7/MZM1L, predicting a drastic change in a highly conserved amino-acid residue (p.Asp25Asn). In a mzm1\u0394 yeast strain, the expression of a mzm1D25N mutant allele caused temperature-sensitive respiratory growth defect, decreased oxygen consumption, impaired maturation/stabilization of the Rieske Fe\u2013S protein, and reduced complex III activity and amount. LYRM7/MZM1L is a novel disease gene, causing cIII-defective, early onset, severe mitochondrial encephalopathy.\n", "fulltext": "Mitochondrial complex III (cIII; ubiquinol\u2013cytochrome c reductase, bc1 complex, E.C.1.10.2.2) catalyzes the transfer of electrons from coenzyme Q to cytochrome c (cyt c). The energy liberated by this reaction sustains the translocation of four protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), which contributes to the formation of the electrochemical potential (\u0394P). Complex III is composed of 11 subunits. Cytochrome b (cyt b) is the only cIII subunit encoded by a mtDNA gene, whereas the remaining 10 are encoded by nuclear DNA genes. Several other nuclear genes are required for the proper formation and function of cIII [Crivellone et\u00a0al., 1988]. The assembly of cIII in mammalian cells is a still poorly understood process, including the very mechanisms leading to the module-based, stepwise formation of the mature enzyme, the exact subunit composition of the assembly intermediates, and the complete set of specific cIII assembly factors. We report here the identification of the first LYRM7/MZM1L pathogenic mutation in a patient with early onset, severe encephalopathy and lactic acidosis. LYRM7 (LYR motif containing 7) gene product is the human ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein MZM1 (Mitochondrial-Zinc-Maintenance 1); in both organisms, this protein is a cIII assembly factors that participates in the incorporation of the Rieske Fe\u2013S protein into nascent cIII [Atkinson et\u00a0al., 2011; S\u00e1nchez et\u00a0al., 2013]. The proband was one of four siblings born from Moroccan first-cousin parents; two of them are both alive and well, whereas one has isolated, static mental delay. The patient was born at the 39th week of gestation after uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Weight at birth was 2.8\u00a0kg (5\u201310 percentile). Her development was normal during the first 20 months of life, when she manifested rapidly progressive weakness with reduced spontaneous motor activity and alertness, and polypnea. The laboratory tests showed anemia (hemoglobin 7.3\u00a0g/dl, n.v. 13\u201316) associated with low plasma iron (15\u00a0mg/dl, n.v.\u00a0>\u00a050), treated by iron supplementation. At 21 months, during an infectious episode with fever, the patient developed acute, severe dyspnea and stupor, requiring ICU treatment. The clinical examination showed generalized hypotonia, a central breathing pattern, and a fluctuating comatose state with hardly any reaction to external stimuli. Laboratory tests showed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.78, pCO2 16.5; O2 saturation 96%), with increased plasma lactate (11, 2\u00a0mg/dl, n.v.\u00a0<\u00a02) and ammonia (279\u00a0\u03bcM, n.v.\u00a0<\u00a080), and severe anemia (Hb 6.8). A blood culture was positive for Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The profiles of urinary organic acids, plasma amino acids, and acylcarnitines were normal. Heart and liver were normal as well. A CT scan showed marked bilateral hypodensity of the centrum semiovale, later confirmed by brain MRI, indicating severe demyelinization and vacuolization of the white matter, and global atrophy with a thin corpus callosum (Fig.\u00a01A and B). The patient was intubated for forced ventilation, and treated with blood transfusions and intravenous bicarbonates. In the next several days, the clinical features improved, with recovery of spontaneous breathing, and oral alimentation was resumed. Nevertheless, severe psychomotor regression persisted with reduction of consciousness, no head control, inability to walk, and severe spastic tetraparesis with reduced spontaneous movements. The patient died at 28 months of respiratory failure. Informed consent, approved by the Ethical Committee of the Foundation IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \u201cC.Besta,\u201d Milan, Italy, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, was signed by the parents of the patient.

The initiation codon is codon 1. (E) Phylogenetic alignment of the LYRM7/MZM1L orthologs. The aspartic acid in position 25, mutated in our patient, is in bold red (arrowhead). Muscle morphology showed normal COX reaction with no ragged-red fibers. Biochemical assays showed severe, isolated decrease of cIII specific activity normalized to citrate synthase (CS) activity (22.2, n.v. 70\u2013130). The other respiratory chain enzymes were normal, although the cI/CS ratio was at the lower limit of the control range (13.4, n.v. 13.6\u201327.7) (Fig.\u00a01C). The CS-specific activity was also slightly below the lower control limit (74.7\u00a0nmol/min\u00a0mg\u22121, n.v. 80\u2013210). Because of the profound cIII deficiency, we sequenced cIII-related genes, including those encoding cyt b, BCS1L, and TTC19, which were all normal. Contrariwise, analysis of the recently reported LYRM7 gene revealed a homozygous c.73G>A transition (NM_181705.2), predicting a Asp25Asn amino-acid change in the corresponding protein (NP_859056.2) (Fig.\u00a01D). The c.73G>A variant was absent in 100 alleles from subjects of North-Africa origin and is not reported in any public SNP databases, including dbSNP and the Exome Variant Server, which contains >10,000 alleles; this variant has been submitted to LSDB (http://www.lovd.nl/LYRM7). The Asp25 residue is highly conserved in the phylogenesis (Fig.\u00a01E). The mutation was present in heterozygosis in both parents and in all three unaffected siblings, according to autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease trait. Neither fibroblast cells, nor other tissues of the proband were available. However, the LYRM7 gene is the human ortholog of MZM1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Atkinson et\u00a0al., 2011; S\u00e1nchez et\u00a0al., 2013] and the Asp25 residue is conserved between the two species (Fig.\u00a01E). We then introduced the change equivalent to the c.73G>A, p.Asp25Asn of human LYRM7 into the yeast MZM1 wild-type (wt) gene, cloned in a centromeric monocopy vector. The MZM1 and mzm1D25N constructs were used to transform a mzm1\u0394 mutant, giving rise to mzm1\u0394/MZM1 and mzm1\u0394/mzm1D25N yeast strains. In order to reveal a possible respiratory growth defect, serial dilutions of the strains were incubated on minimum medium supplemented with either dextrose or glycerol, at 28\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. A clear growth defect of the mzm1\u0394/mzm1D25N was observed in glycerol-containing plates incubated at 37\u00b0C but not at 28\u00b0C, (Fig.\u00a02A), similar to, albeit less pronounced than, the mzm1\u0394 mutant [Atkinson et\u00a0al., 2010]. To further analyze the respiratory deficiency, we measured oxygen consumption, cIII activity and cyt spectra. The O2 consumption rates of mzm1\u0394/mzm1D25N and mzm1\u0394 were 36% and 54% less than that of mzm1\u0394/MZM1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02B). Likewise, the cIII activity was reduced in mzm1\u0394/mzm1D25N (65% residual activity) and mzm1\u0394 (50%) mitochondria (Fig.\u00a02C). Moreover, the mzm1\u0394/mzm1D25N strain showed marked reduction of the peak at 570\u00a0nm, corresponding to respiratory cyt b (not shown). These results are consistent with the temperature-sensitive respiratory growth defect observed in the mzm1\u0394/mzm1D25N serial dilution spot test. Figure 2 Phenotypes of the yeast model (A) oxidative growth. Mzm1\u0394 strains harboring a wild-type MZM1 allele, the mzm1D25N allele or the empty vector were serially diluted from 107 to 103\u00a0cells/mL. Five microliters of each dilution was spotted on YNB minimum agar plates minus uracil with dextrose or glycerol. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 days. (B) Oxygen consumption rate was recorded on cells grown at 37\u00b0C in YNB medium without uracil, supplemented with 0.6% dextrose. Values were normalized to wild-type rate of oxygen consumption (35\u00a0nmol\u00a0O2\u00a0min\u22121\u00a0mg\u22121) and represented as the mean of at least three values\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. One-tail, unpaired Student's t-test was applied for statistical significance (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). (C) Complex I\u2013III specific activity was recorded on purified mitochondria from cells grown at 37\u00b0C as in B. Values were normalized to that of MZM1 parental strain (413.5 units per mg of mitochondrial proteins) and represented as the mean of at least two independent experiments (D) ISP immunoblot analysis. Fifteen micrograms of total purified mitochondrial proteins was separated by a 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane; the ISP protein was immunovisualized by a specific antibody. (E) Western-blot immunovisualization of first dimension (1D) blue-native gel electrophoresis. An antibody against Core1 and 2 was used to detect complex III (cIII); an antibody against CoxII (cytochrome c oxidase, subunit II) was used for complex IV (cIV). Signal quantification and normalization were carried out using QuantityOne (Bio-Rad). The signal of the mzm1\u0394/MZM1 (wild-type) strain, taken as 1.00, was used to normalize those of the other samples. (F) Western-blot immunovisualization of second dimension (2D) blue-native gel electrophoresis. Antibodies against Core1 and 2 were used to detect complex III (cIII). Mzm1p plays a role in the last steps of cIII assembly, being involved in the maturation of the Rieske iron\u2013sulfur protein (Rip1p in yeast), an essential catalytic subunit of cIII [Atkinson et\u00a0al., 2011; Cui et\u00a0al., 2012]. Before incorporation into nascent cIII, the Rip1p precursor undergoes two proteolytic cleavages, which remove a 30-amino-acid import signal at the N-terminus. The mitochondrial matrix peptidase removes the first 22 N-terminal residues, giving rise to a partially processed, immature form of Rip1 (i-ISP). Next, eight additional N-terminal residues are removed by Oct1p, to generate the mature form (m-ISP), which is eventually incorporated in the nascent cIII [Graham et\u00a0al., 1994; Nett and Trumpower, 1999]. MZM1 deletion impairs Rip1p maturation and causes marked decrease in its steady state level. In order to evaluate the effects of the mzm1D25N mutation on Rip1p biogenesis and cIII function, we studied mitochondria purified from mzm1\u0394/MZM1, mzm1\u0394/mzm1D25N, and mzm1\u0394 strains, cultured at 37\u00b0C in YNB medium. Mitochondrial proteins were resolved by SDS-page and both i-ISP and m-ISP were immunovisualized by Western-blot analysis. As shown in Figure\u00a02D, m-ISP and i-ISP levels were strongly reduced in the mzm1D25N compared with the MZM1 parental strain, resembling the mzm1\u0394 strain defects [Cui et al. 2012]. The reduced level of Rip1p was associated with a clear reduction of cIII holocomplex (Fig.\u00a02E), with no trace of stable subassembly intermediates (Fig.\u00a02F). These data indicate that the Mzm1D25N mutant protein impairs the stabilization/maturation of ISP and, as a consequence, the assembly of the cIII holoenzyme, thus supporting the pathogenic role of its human ortholog. Whilst numerous mutations of the gene encoding cyt b, a mtDNA-encoded cIII subunit, have been associated with slowly progressive, usually adult onset, mitochondrial myopathy, mutations in nuclear genes associated with cIII deficiency are much rarer, and characterized by severe clinical course. In fact, only a handful of nucleus-encoded proteins related to cIII biogenesis have been linked to disease in humans: three small structural subunits, Ubiquinol cyt c-reductase binding protein (UQCRB), Ubiquinol-cyt c-reductase subunit VII (UQCRQ), and Ubiquinol-cyt c-reductase core 2 protein (UQCRC2), and two cIII assembly factors, BC-synthesis-1 like (BCS1L) and tetra-trico-peptide repeat domain 19 (TTC19) [Miyake et\u00a0al., 2013; Ghezzi and Zeviani, 2011]. Only one mutation in each of the cIII encoding subunits UQCRB, UQCRQ, and UQCRC2 has been reported, each in single families, and with clinical presentations of variable severity and features [Ghezzi and Zeviani, 2011]. However, several mutations in BCS1L are known, encompassing a clinical spectrum ranging from Biornstad syndrome (nerve deafness and pili torti) (MIM #209900), to isolated early onset encephalopathy (MIM #124000), to multisystem GRACILE syndrome (MIM #603358), linked to a founder mutation that is part of the Finnish disease heritage. TTC19-mutant patients are characterized by slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder, usually starting in infancy or childhood, although a late-onset rapidly progressive neurological syndrome has also been described, resembling Jacob-Creutzfeldt Disease [Ghezzi et\u00a0al., 2011]. LYRM7 is a novel human cIII assembly factor containing a LYR motif. LYRM7 is involved in the maturation of the Rieske iron\u2013sulfur protein, an essential catalytic subunit containing a (2Fe\u20132S) cluster, which is incorporated late during cIII assembly [Cui et\u00a0al., 2012]. Interestingly, small LYR proteins are deemed to be involved in the biogenesis of iron\u2013sulfur cluster containing structures, including respiratory chain complex I, where several LYR proteins are present as ancillary subunits, and complex II, for which a LYR-containing assembly factor, SDHAF1, was recently identified [Ghezzi and Zeviani, 2011]. The role of LYRM7 in maturation/incorporation of the Rieske protein in cIII explains the specific biochemical phenotype and the severe, early onset encephalopathy with lactic acidosis found in our patient, who carried a disease-segregating homozygous missense mutation in LYRM7, affecting a highly conserved amino-acid residue. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the ortholog of LYRM7 is MZM1, which plays the same role on cIII assembly. We took advantage of the phylogenetic conservation of both gene and mutant residue, to demonstrate the pathogenic role of the human variant in a yeast recombinant model carrying the equivalent mutant allele. We clearly showed that the mutant yeast strain has impaired oxidative growth, low cIII activity, reduced amount of cyt b and cIII holocomplex; the mature Rieske protein steady state level is also strongly decreased. Taken together, these results confirm the pathogenicity of the mutation, according to a recessive trait, and provide genetic evidence for a role of LYRM7 in a terminal step of cIII assembly, relevant to warrant OXPHOS proficiency in cells and tissues."}, "28472177": {"pmid": "28472177", "pmcid": "PMC5417601", "title": "Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1) is associated with stem-like cancer cell functions in pediatric high-grade glioma", "abstract": "\nPediatric high-grade gliomas represent 8\u201312% of all primary tumors of the nervous system in children. Five-year survival for these pediatric aggressive tumors is poor (15\u201335%) indicating the need to develop better treatments for pediatric high-grade gliomas. In this work we used SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cell lines to study the function of the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1), a deubiquitinase de-regulated in several cancers, in pediatric high-grade gliomas. UCHL1 depletion in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 glioma cells was associated with decreased cell proliferation and invasion, along with a reduced ability to grow in soft agar and to form spheres (i.e. self-renewal measure). A 70% reduction in Wnt signaling was also observed in the SF188 and SJ-GBM2 UCHL1 knockdowns (KDs) using a TCF-dependent TOPflash reporter assay. Transcriptome comparisons of UCHL1 KDs versus vector control identified a list of 306 differentially expressed genes (at least 2-fold change; p <0.05) which included genes known to be involved in cancer like ACTA2, POSTN, LIF, FBXL7, FBXW11, GDF15, HEY2, but also potential novel genes such us IGLL5, ABCA4, AQP3, AQP4, CALB1, and ALK.

While FGF2, IL1B, TNF and PDGFB were predicted as top upstream regulators (p < 2x10-16) of the UCHL1 KD-associated transcriptome. Aberrant expression of UCHL1 in pediatric high-grade gliomas may promote cell invasion, transformation, and self-renewal properties, at least in part, by modulating Wnt/Beta catenin activity. UCHL1 might act as an oncogene in glioma within the gene network that imparts stem-like characteristics to these cancer cells.\n", "fulltext": "Childhood high-grade astrocytoma, although rare, is extremely difficult to treat. For a vast majority of the patients, the disease quickly relapses following an initial response to aggressive multimodality treatments and about 80% of the affected children will die from their disease. Malignant gliomas show substantial genetic and histological heterogeneity, which supports the notion of pathway pliability. The clinical presentations, which includes invasion of surrounding tissue, and the response of these patients to therapy supports the concept that a pool of stem-like cancer cells responsible for long-term remission failure that exits within these tumors [3\u20135]. In this scenario, identifying pathways that impart stem-like characteristics to glioma cells can offer radical advances to the treatment and diagnosis of this devastating childhood cancer. Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), the major cellular machinery that regulates protein homeostasis. The UPS is responsible for intracellular protein degradation and regulation of many key biological processes, such as breakdown of transcription factors, cell cycle control, and cell differentiation [6, 7]. Defect in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is observed in several human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases [8, 9] and in certain types of malignant tumors [10, 11]. In this regard, UCHL1 is differentially expressed in various cancers, and has been proposed to have oncogenic or tumor suppressive properties depending on the cellular context. UCHL1 activity in tumorigenesis has been linked to cell cycle regulation, possibly, by targeting p53, \u03b2-catenin, and Akt pathways [13\u201316]. UCHL1 has been shown to promote metastasis via the activation of HIF-1 and its overexpression also correlates with poor prognosis in patients with breast and lung cancers. Several lines of evidence suggest that UCHL1 is essential for the onset of neurogenesis and that is a determinant of asymmetric distribution during germ-line stem cell self-renewal and differentiation [18, 19]. Data from the Protein Atlas Database (http://www.proteinatlas.org/), shows a distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear UCHL1 immunoreactivity in glioma samples. Although the clinical relevance of UCHL1 expression in glioma seems possible, whether UCHL1 overexpression contributes to the malignant transformation/phenotype in astrocytoma has not been ascertain, and the molecular mechanism underlying its action in this context is also unclear. The ubiquitin proteasome system has emerged as a promising target for cancer therapy with two drugs targeting the proteasome (bortezomib and carfilzomib) currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Improved oral bioavailability and specificity of action together with targeting \u201cundruggable\u201d oncoproteins (e.g. MYCN, Beta-catenin) are areas of interests in cancer therapy research (reviewed in). Therefore, DUB enzymes found to be deregulated in cancer, such UCHL1, may give rise to alternative cancer therapies as upstream regulators of \u201cundruggable\u201d oncoproteins. Also, increased selectivity of DUB enzymes over the currently FDA approved proteasome inhibitors is a driving force for exploring DUBs as potential anticancer targets. Using a lentiviral knockdown system, we investigated the effect of UCHL1 inhibition on astrocytoma cell invasion, cell proliferation, and on the stem-like cancer cell population. To gain some insight in the UCHL1-associated pathways, we then conducted transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses with the control and knockdown cell lines. Our loss of function studies using these pediatric high-grade gliomas cell lines showed that UCHL1 promoted cell growth, invasiveness, and self-renewal characteristics in vitro. Using a luciferase reporter system, we found significant downregulation of Wnt/Beta catenin signal transduction in the UCHL1 KDs, which suggested this pathway as a possible candidate mediating, at least in part, the observed effects. Subsequent transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses identified angiogenesis, neuron development and differentiation, or cell motility among the potential functions of the UCHL1-associated gene network. Endocytosis, chemokine signaling, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction were also identified in our model system as possible pathways associated to the UCHL1-KD transcriptome. To gain some insight in the potential role of UCHL1 in high-grade glioma, we mined its levels of expression in human glioma tissue microarrays reported in the publicly available Protein Atlas Database; http://www.proteinatlas.org/. The expression levels of UCHL1 in these tissue microarray glioma samples from the database is summarized in Table 1. This tissue microarray consists of 20 adult and 2 childhood glioma samples. A distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear UCHL1 immunoreactivity was reported in 19 of the 22 samples in the microarray which included the two pediatric cases and 13 of 16 high-grade adult astrocytoma cases (http://www.proteinatlas.org/). Then, using well-characterized pediatric astrocytoma cell lines as a model system, we observed elevated UCHL1 mRNA expression with correlating protein expression in UW479, a WHO grade III anaplastic astrocytoma, SF188, and SJ-GBM2, WHO grade IV glioblastoma mutiforme cell lines but no expression in Res186, a WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma cell line. The mean densitometry values with SEM of three western blots along with the digitalized image of one of the blots is shown in Fig 1A. Thus, the tissue microarray and cell lines data suggested a possible role for UCHL1 in the higher grade glioma cancer cells. To explore the relevance of UCHL1 in glioma growth and invasion, we carried out several in vitro analyses using a loss of function strategy. We knocked down UCHL1 expression in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cells utilizing two different shRNA constructs (herein called UCHL1 KD1 and KD2). At least a 70% reduction in UCHL1 transcript levels as measured by ddPCR and confirmed by RNAseq was achieved in all the four KDs compared to their shRNA controls. The mean and SEM densitometry values for UCHL1 protein levels, and their representative western blots in the SJ-GBM2 and SF188 knockdowns are shown in Fig 1B. As shown in this figure, UCHL1 expression was knocked down to 0.16 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.23 \u00b1 0.03 in SJ-GBM2 KD1, and SJ-GBM2 KD2 respectively, and to 0.28 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.20 \u00b1 0.04 in the SF188 KD1, and SF188 KD2 respectively. To assess the role UCHL1 in vitro tumorigenicity, a colony formation assay (ie, soft-agar growth assay) was used. As shown in Fig 2B, close to 50% reduction in clonogenicity was observed in the SF188 and SJ-GBM2 UCHL1 KDs, suggesting a functional role of UCHL1 in glioma malignant transformation. The ability of forming colonies in soft agar was 0.45 \u00b1 0.06 and 0.56 \u00b1 0.15 for SF188 KD1 and KD2 respectively, and 0.44 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.47 \u00b1 0.08 for SJ-GBM2 KD1 and KD2, respectively. Table 2 shows that depletion of UCHL1 increased the population doubling times to 50\u201370 hours, suggested that UCHL1 might play a role in promoting cell proliferation. To elucidate the possible role of UCHL in cell proliferation, cell cycle analysis was performed. As shown in Fig 2A, depletion of UCHL1 increased the percentage of cells in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle from 13% in the control cells to 21% in the UCHL1 knockdowns. A key feature of malignant gliomas is their ability to migrate and to invade normal surrounding tissue. Invasive cells produce proteolytic enzymes that enable them to detach from their basement membrane, to digest the extracellular matrix, and to migrate. To investigate possible differences invasiveness between the knockdowns and controls, an in vitro Matrigel assay was done. Fig 2C shows that UCHL1 depleted cells were significantly less invasive than the control cells. Approximately, a 90% decrease in the number of cells able to migrate through the basement membrane inserts was found in the knockdown samples. We scored the number of cells invading 8 fields (magnification, 40x) of the Matrigel inserts of the controls and knowndowns. The average number of invasive cells in the 8 fields of the Matrigel were: 7 in the case of SJ-GBM2 KD1, 4 in SJ-GBM2 KD2 cells, 5 in SF188KD1, and 5 in SF188 KD2 compared to 56 in the SJ-GBM2, and 40 in the SF188 control cells, respectively. Thus our cell-based assays suggested a potential role of UCHL1 in glioma cell transformation and cell invasiveness. Our data suggested that UCHL1 might affect glioma growth and invasiveness, these are known properties associated with stem-like cell populations. Spheroid cultures have been demonstrated to enrich in glioblastoma stem-like cancer cells and are considered a surrogate marker of self-renewal capability. Using this well-established protocol for glioma CSC culture, first we determine the optimum cell density at plating so that cells were dispersed to ensure that each third generation sphere is derived from a single cell, which is a requirement to assess self-renewal in vitro. As shown in Fig 3A, we determined that plating cell densities from 50 to 200 cells per well of a 96-well plate provided a reproducible results, with a sphere formation rate of ~10% in the control and ~2% in the UCHL1 KD. As shown in Fig 3B, there was an approximately 60% reduction in the number of third generation spheres in the SF188 KDs (i.e. 8 \u00b1 1 and 13 \u00b1 1 in the KD1 and KD2 compared to 23 \u00b1 3 in the control shRNA construct). A 80% reduction was observed in the SJ-GBM2 KDs (i.e. 1.3 \u00b1 0.6 and 3.1 \u00b10.6 in the KD1 and KD2 versus 10.2 \u00b1 0.7 in the control shRNA construct). These results suggested a potential role of UCHL1 in pediatric high-grade glioma stem-like cells. De-regulation of p53, \u03b2-catenin, and Akt pathways have been linked to the activity of UCHL1 in tumorigenesis [13\u201316]. In this regard, UCHL1 has been proposed to form a positive feedback loop with \u03b2-catenin, whereby UCHL1 promotes translocation of \u03b2-catenin into the nucleus where it binds to the TCF/LEF complex and activates transcription of its downstream targets, which may also include UCHL1. Furthermore, abnormal of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling has been reported in glioma stem-like cancer cells. Thus, we sought to determine whether UCHL1 was involved in Wnt/Beta-catenin activity in our model system. We used a TOPflash luciferase reporter assay to assess Beta-catenin-mediated activation of downstream target genes in our model system. We found, on average, a 70% decrease in Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling when UCHL1 was depleted. As shown in Fig 4, the mean and SEM arbitrary units of luminescence were 0.26 \u00b1 0.05 (SJ-GBM2 KD1), 0.28 \u00b1 0.09 (SJ-GBM2 KD2), 0.24 \u00b1 0.04 (SF188 KD1), and 0.34 \u00b1 0.13 (SF188 KD2), normalized to their respective control cells. These data suggested the beta-catenin pathway as a mediator, at least in part, of the effects of UCHL1 in SJ-GBM2 and SF188 glioma cells. To obtain additional insights in the UCHL1-associated gene networks and potential mechanisms mediating the UCHL1 effects, we performed transcriptome comparisons of the cells transduced with the UCHL1 shRNA constructs and those transduced with the shRNA control plasmid. Three hundred and six differentially expressed genes were found by RNAseq in the SJ-GBM2 UCHL1 knockdowns and control cells (S1 File), the top 32 differentially expressed genes are listed in Table 3. In silico gene ontology (GO) analysis of these 306 differentially genes identified 11 annotation clusters with enrichment scores above 2.5 (DAVID,). Table 4 summarizes the top GO annotated clusters and biological processes identified in the bioinformatics analyses. The top 4 clusters (with enrichment scores 8.33, 6.87, 3.65, and 3.61 respectively) were related to \u201csignal peptides\u201d, \u201cextracellular matrix\u201c, \u201csecreted proteins\u201d, and \u201cplasma membrane (proteins)\u201d GO Terms (S2 File). Specifically, top enriched GO Terms identified with this analysis were \u201csignal peptide\u201d (with 97 genes involved; 32.33% enrichment; p = 4.07x10-11), extracellular region\u201d (63 genes; 21% enrichment, p = 9.78x10-7), \u201cglycoprotein\u201d (103 genes; 34% enrichment; p = 1.13x10-6), and \u201cintegral to plasma membrane\u201d (40 genes; 13.33% enrichment; p = 4.33x10-5). Additional biological process showing significant cluster enrichment in the GO analysis included \u201cangiogenesis and blood vessel development\u201d, (enrichment score 2.89) \u201cneuron differentiation/development\u201d (2.79), \u201ccell adhesion\u201d (2.65), and \u201ccell migration\u201d (2.56). Thus these GO analyses seemed to suggest a potential role for UCHL1 in extracellular matrix composition or extracellular matrix-cell communication. Intriguingly, our Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) also identified, inflammation, endocytosis, metastasis related functions and \u201cHigh Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB1) Signaling\u201d within the top canonical pathways possibly affected by UCHL1 in SJ-GBM2 cells (i.e. \u201cRole of Macrophages, Fibroblasts and Endothelial Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis\u201d; p = 3.68x10-5, \u201cClathrin-mediated Endocytosis Signaling\u201d; p = 5.14x10-4, \u201cVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\u201d; p = 6.15x10-4, \u201cHMGB1 Signaling\u201d; p = 6.15x10-4, \u201cColorectal Cancer Metastasis Signaling\u201d; p = 8.18x10-4), also in line with a possible role of UCHL1 in cell-extracellular matrix interaction. These UCHL1-associated pathways and upstream regulators are summarized in Table 5. The top three potential upstream regulators of the UCHL1-KD transcriptome predicted by IPA software (S3 File) were coagulation factor II (F2, p = 5.96x10-9; with 18 targets in our differentially expressed genes), nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1, p = 1.17x10-4; with 18 target genes), and P53 (TP53; p = 2.14x10-15; with 58 target genes). Of note, expression of NUPR1 (a transcription factor involved in progression of liver and other cancers) was about 8-fold increased in our UCHL1 knockdown (p = 1.20x10-8). Within the list of top differentially expressed genes, in the UCHL1 KDs we found downregulation of the Wnt targets POSTN, SP7, and DLL1, of the transporter ABCA4, of the homeobox gene DLX4, and of genes recently linked to cancer progression ACTA2, AQ4, GRAP2, and ALK. Tumorigenesis is a complex process that involves abnormal changes in the pathways mediating cell proliferation, survival, and motility. Cancer cells usually achieve these functions by hijacking developmental pathways including Wnt/Beta-catenin, Sonic Hedgehog, Akt or Notch to name some. High-grade gliomas are very heterogeneous tumors that may resemble a developmental program going awry with glioma cancer stem cells positioned at the top of the hierarchy. These cancer stem cells are defined operationally in analogy to normal adult stem cell, as cells with the dual capacity to regenerate themselves through self-renewal mechanism and to perpetuate the production of phenotypically heterogeneous progeny with limited proliferative ability. High-grade gliomas are the most aggressive type of primary brain tumors and their great tendency to invade surrounding tissue represents a real therapeutic challenge [1, 26]. Cancer cells with stem-like properties have been identified in high-grade gliomas and have been proposed as the basis for the plasticity and survival of these malignant tumors. These CSCs are able to regenerate themselves, to differentiate into the cells forming the bulk of the tumor, and to communicate with their microenvironment to increase angiogenesis or to recruit inflammatory cells that sustain tumor growth and survival. Thus, novel strategies in high-grade gliomas, and in many other types of cancers, aim to target these CSC populations is warranted. UCHL1 is a deubiquitinase highly expressed in the nervous system and its role in different types of cancer is starting to be elucidated. Recent studies have demonstrated that UCHL1 can affect invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, chemosensitivity, and cell cycle among other functions [14, 28\u201330]. The available protein expression data from tumor samples (Protein Atlas database; http://www.proteinatlas.org/) supported a potential role of UCHL1 in high-grade glioma. Using cell lines as model system we confirmed that UCHL1 was highly expressed in high-grade pediatric glioma SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cells compared to low-grade Res186 cells. As shown in Fig 1A, SJ-GBM2 cells exhibited higher levels of UCHL1 protein compared to SF188 and UW479 cells. This data provided us with the rationale to explore whether UCHL1 was involved in high-grade glioma malignancy. Future work will explore the biological relevance of the differences in UCHL1 expression among the various WHO grade astrocytomas. In this study, we knocked down the expression of UCHL1 in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cell lines using a lentivirus transduction system of two different UCHL1 shRNA vectors, providing us a model system to elucidate the potential function of UCHL1 in glioma malignancy. We assessed the effects of UCHL1 depletion upon sphere formation, cell invasion, and cell proliferation. A decrease on cell proliferation and in cellular invasiveness, together with an impaired sphere formation (in vitro surrogate assay for self-renewal), was observed in the knockdowns, which suggested a potential role for UCHL1 in high-grade glioma CSC function. Although activating mutations in beta-catenin do not seem frequent in gliomas, intracellular accumulation of beta-catenin and Wnt pathway activation occur in glioblastoma and they contribute to CSC maintenance and cell invasion. For example, PLAGL2 (Pleomorphic adenomas gene-like 2) and Dishevelled-2 (DVL2) have been shown to activate Wnt pathway in glioblastomas and to sustain self-renewal in glioma CSCs independently of beta-catenin mutations [23, 32]. UCHL1 has also been proposed to activate Wnt signaling through deubiquitination and stabilization of beta-catenin. In this study, using TCF-dependent TOPflash reporter system we found approximately, a 70% decrease in the activity of Wnt pathway in our KDs model system, thus suggesting that Wnt or of its downstream effectors could be influencing sphere formation, cell proliferation, and/or invasion. Of note, in the UCHL1 KDs we found a marked decrease in the gene expression of the Wnt targets SP7 (a transcription factor involved in osteoblast differentiation; ~19-fold decrease), DLL1 (delta like canonical Notch ligand 1; ~11-fold decrease), and POSTN (~6-fold decrease), thus consistent with a reduced activity of the pathway in these cells. POSTN gene encodes for periostin; an extracellular protein secreted by glioma cancer stem cells that recruits macrophages to the CSC niche, promotes angiogenesis (in part by increasing HIF-1\u03b1 expression), cell invasion and glioblastoma progression in mouse models [27, 34, 35]. Interestingly, in the UCHL1 KDs we found downregulation of additional proangiogenic genes such as ELK3, CXCL12, ANGPT1, HMOX1, or DLK1 and upregulation of the anti-angiogenic gene THBS1. UCHL1 has been shown to increase metastasis through deubiquitination and stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1, a central protein in tumor angiogenesis. Thus, a positive feedback loop between UCHL1, HIF-1\u03b1, and POSTN might be proposed where UCHL1 may promote angiogenesis directly via HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization and indirectly via POSTN upregulation. Additional mechanisms mediating self-renewal and invasion in our model system such as activation of Akt and Erk1/2 pathways [30, 36], or stabilization of the oxidase NOX4 and of membrane receptors like the cell adhesion protein NCAM among other yet to uncover targets [37, 38] should not be ruled out. For instance aberrant expression of the brain aquaporin 1 (AQ1) and 4 (AQ4), which regulate water flow in and out of the cells, have been found in glioblastoma sphere cultures and their role in this tumor has just started to be elucidated [39, 40]. Of note, AQ4 was the second most downregulated gene in the UCHL1 KDs (~37-fold reduction compared to controls), thus consistent with a possible function of UCHL1 in glioma CSCs. Nevertheless, UCHL1 is highly expressed in the brain and retina, and inactivation of this protein is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson\u2019s disease [41\u201344]. Thus, the UCHL1-KD associated transcriptome may be able to uncover cancer associated genes, but also additional genes not involved in cancer per se but rather be considered within the context of neuroprotective functions associated with UCHL1. For example, the observed downregulation in ABCA4, a gene encoding a member of the of the ABC family of transporters that is expressed in retinal photoreceptors and its defect causes retinal degeneration such as Stargardt\u2019s disease (reviewed in). Finally, within the list of upregulated genes in the UCHL1 KD we also found several cancer-associated genes such as SERPINB4, FGF21, NUPR1, SBSN, GDF1, HMOX1, or SOCS2, which suggested the activation of potential compensatory mechanisms in these KDs cells. Future work will evaluate whether these genes exert a biological effect in our model system. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms driving UCHL1 de-regulation in glioma cells and whether the UCHL1 aberrant expression can influence the progression from low to high-grade glioma remains unknown. In summary, our data indicated that UCHL1 might be an important factor in pediatric high-grade glioma progression, by sustaining the cancer stem cell population. The potential role of UCHL1 in modulating pathways involved in the niche of glioma CSCs such us angiogenesis, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, or receptor endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, may point to promising targets for treatment in pediatric high-grade gliomas by either targeting directly UCHL1 or its associated pathways. Our in vitro functional studies and gene expression data demonstrated that UCHL1 regulates glioblastoma CSCs populations and suggested wnt as a potential pathway mediating UCHL1 activity. Angiogenesis, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, and endocytosis were also identified as processes associated to the UCHL1-KD transcriptome. Given the relevance of the cancer microenvironment in sustaining the CSC niche, future work will aim to explore UCHL1 as a potential mediator of the interactions between glioma cancer cells and the tissue microenvironment and to explore UCHL1 as a prospective therapeutic target for high-grade pediatric glioma. SJ-GBM2 was obtained from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Cell Culture and Xenograft Repository. SF188 was kindly provided by Dr. Daphne Haas-Kogan (University of California at San Francisco, USA) and Res186 by Dr. Michael Bobola (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA). SJ-GBM2 cells were maintained in Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Medium with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Atlanta\u00ae Biologicals, Inc., Lawrenceville, GA), 4mM L-Glutamine, and 1X ITS (5 \u03bcg/mL insulin, 5 \u03bcg/mL transferrin, 5 ng/mL selenous acid) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). SF188 and Res186 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 Ham\u2019s medium (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics. All cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert\u2122 Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Anaheim, CA). All the experiments shown here were performed with cells free of mycoplasma contamination. Stable UCHL1 knockdowns (KDs) were obtained through a lentiviral transduction system (Addgene) using puromycin (2 \u03bcg/mL) as marker for selection. Viral packaging and titration were performed as per Addgene\u2019s standard protocols. Two different shRNA constructs targeting different sequences within the UCHL1 coding region were used (KD1; TRCN0000011079, NM_004181.3-400s1c1, and KD2; TRCN0000007276, NM_004181.3-236s1c1). UCHL1 KD efficiency was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels (see RT-PCR and western blot sections below for details) and compared to control cells infected with a shTurboGFP vector. For western blot analysis, protein was isolated and then quantified using the Bradford assay. Briefly, cells were disrupted in CelLytic (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) buffer. Twenty \u03bcg of protein were solubilized in NuPAGE\u00ae Sample Reducing Agent and NuPAGE\u00ae LDS Sample Buffer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Protein extracts were run in precast NuPAGE\u00ae 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Life Technologies) using the semi-dry iBlot system (Life Technologies). Membranes were stained with Ponceau Red (Sigma-Aldrich) to confirm protein transfer, washed with 0.1% Tween 20/1x TBS and then were blocked in 0.1% Tween 20/1x TBS with 5% w/v nonfat dry milk overnight at 4\u00b0C. After three washes with 0.1% Tween 20/1x TBS blots were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in 0.1% Tween 20/1x TBS containing 5% w/v nonfat dry milk and antibodies of interest; polyclonal anti-UCHL1 (AB_2210628; 1:5,000 dilution factor; Cell Signaling, Boston, MA), and polyclonal anti-\u03b2-Actin (AB_956497; loading control; 1:12,000 dilution factor, Abcam, Inc.) following manufacturers recommendations. After washing with 0.1% Tween 20/1x TBS, membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (AB_10679812; 1:15,000 dilution factor; Abcam, Inc.) conjugated to secondary antibody for one hour at room temperature. Blots were developed using SuperSignal\u00ae West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Pierce Protein Biology Products, Rockford, IL). Band density was measured using a G-BOX CHEMI imaging system (Syngen, Sacramento, CA). Three independent experiments were performed, and one-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance using p = 0.05 as cutoff value for statistical significance. To determine if UCHL1 was involved in the proliferation of glioma cells we measured the population doubling times (PDT) in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 control and UCHL1 knockdown cells. Briefly, cells were seeded on a 6-well plate (20,000 cells/well) and the number of viable cells counted 2, 4, and 6 days post-plating using trypan-blue exclusion assay on trypsinized cells. The PDT for each cell line was then determined using the formula PDT = (t-t0)/(log(n) -log(n0))/log(2); where (t-t0) indicates the time in culture; n indicates the number of cells at a given time; and n0 the number of cells plated. Two independent experiments were performed in duplicates. SF188 and SJ-GMB2 control and UCHL1 KDs, cells were synchronized in G0/G1 by serum removal (24-hour treatment) in order to study the kinetics of cell cycle progression. Synchronized cells were then incubated over-night in the presence of complete medium followed by ethanol fixation and propidium iodine staining using standard protocols. Flow cytometry data was obtained using a FACS Canto II, (BD Biosystems, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using MoFlo software. At least three independent experiments with duplicates were performed. Anchorage-independent growth was assessed in vitro using CytoSelect\u2122 96-Well Cell Transformation Assay, Soft Agar Colony Formation (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA) as per manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. One of the main advantages of this method is that colony formation can be quantified with fluorescence thus giving more accurate results than manual colony count. The high sensitivity of this method enables reduced incubation times (at least a 2-fold change) compared to conventional manual methods. Briefly, the wells of the microplate were coated with a 1.2% agar solution. Once this agar layer solidifies, cell suspensions prepared in 0.6% agar-containing medium were added to the microplate wells. After 10 days of incubation, cells were lysed and their DNA (indicator of cell proliferation) stained with CyQuant GR Dye. Anchorage-independent growth was then determined in control and UCHL1 KD cells with a fluorescent plate reader (GloMax II, Promega Madison, WI) using a 485/520 nm filter set. The invasive potential of SJ-GBM2 and SF188 control and UCHL1 KD cells was tested in vitro using CytoSelect 24-Well Cell Invasion Assay (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA) as per manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Briefly, cells were seeded in invasion medium, 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and DMEM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at 5 x 104 cells/chamber in a 24-well plate. Cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Non-invading cells were removed with sterile cotton swabs. The cells that were able to migrate through the membrane were then fixed using ethanol, stained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis, MO), and counted under 40x magnification. At least eight fields were counted per well from two independent experiments. We used a well-defined protocol, to generate spheroid cultures from glioblastoma cell lines in serum-free Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and in the presence basic fibroblastic (bFGF) and epidermal (EGF) growth factors. To evaluate self-renewal, individual 1st generation spheres were harvested, mechanically dispersed into single-cell suspensions and 8 x 105 of these cells plated onto 100 mm diameter ultra-low attachment plates (Corning\u00ae, Manassas, VA) containing 10 mL of serum-free Neurobasal medium (Neurobasal\u00ae-A Medium +B27 and N-2 supplements, 2mM L-glutamine, 10 ng/mL bFGF and EGF, and 0.005% BSA; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to generate second and third generation of spheres. Fresh growth factors were added every three days to the spheroid cultures. All the experiments described here were performed using third generation of spheres. For the neurosphere limiting dilution assay, spheres from the second generation of control and UCHL1 knockdowns were dispersed and re-plated in ultra-low attachment 96-well plates using serial limiting dilution (1 to 200 cells/well range). Third generation sphere formation was scored in each well after 10 days of incubation to provide the optimal cell densities. All subsequent experiments were initiated by plating 2000 cells/mL from dispersed second generation spheres in ultra-low attachment 96-well plates. The number of third generation spheres with a diameter of at least 50 \u03bcm was scored after seven days in culture. Three experiments with triplicates were performed. We used a TOPflash luciferase reporter assay to measure the effect of UCHL1 on the Wnt/Beta-catenin pathway activity. Briefly, SJ-GBM2 cells infected with either the UCHL1 shRNA or control plasmids were plated on a 96-well plate (5,000 cells/well). Cells were allowed to recover from the trypsin treatment for 12\u201318 hours and then transfected with the Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) and either the TOPflash or the FOPflash (mutant TCF/LEF binding sites; control) plasmid using Lipofectamine2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Mock transfections were included as baseline during luminescence analyses. Forty-eight hours post-transfection the Wnt ligand Wnt3a (beta-catenin activator; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to all wells and, 12\u201318 hours later, the activity of the luciferase reporter activity measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System and GloMax-Multi 96-well Microplate reader (Promega, Madison, WI) using Renilla luminescence as control and as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Three independent experiments were performed in duplicates. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using a phenol-free total RNA extraction kit (Norgen Biotek, ON, Canada). Quality and concentration of the extracted RNA was determined by spectrophotometric methods (NanoDrop 8000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The levels of expression of the UCHL1 and housekeeping gene (HPRT1) were measured in the glioma cell lines and in the UCHL1 KDs using droplet digital PCR (QX100 ddPCR System, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and Taqman Gene Expression primer/probes sets (Human HPRT1 (FAM-labeled) and UCHL1 (VIC-labeled); Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). RT reactions were conducted on a Veriti PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using 100 ng of total RNA, and iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad) as per manufacturer\u2019s guidelines (i.e. 5 min at 25\u00b0C, 30 min at 42\u00b0C, 5 min at 85\u00b0C followed by an end cycle at 4\u00b0C). Quantitative PCR reactions were prepared using 2 \u03bcL of the RT reactions (diluted 1/10), Taqman Gene Expression Assays, and ddPCR Supermix for probes (Bio-Rad) as per manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Differences in UCHL1 mRNA expression across samples were determined using QX100 Droplet Reader and QuantaSoft TM Software (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, cells were lysed with Buffer RLT and homogenized using a syringe. RNA was isolated in a spin column and treated with DNaseI. RNA was eluted with DNase and RNase free water. Integrity checks (measured as RNA Integrity Number; RIN) and sample quantitation was performed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNAseq was performed at GCCRI Genome Sequencing Facility. In short, mRNA was isolated by oligo-dT purification and fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature. cDNA fragment libraries were synthesized following the TruSeq mRNA-seq Library Preparation protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system using a 100 bp paired-end sequencing protocol. On average, we obtained ~35 million paired reads per sample. After sequencing, sequence reads were aligned to human genome (UCSC hg19) using TopHat aligner then reads aligned to known transcripts were counted using HTSeq. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq to obtain fold-change, p-value, and adjusted p-value by Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple tests. We selected differentially expressed genes based on the following criteria: 1) fold-change > 2, 2) adjusted p-value < 0.05, and 3) expression level RPKM (Read Per Kilobase of transcript per Million reads mapped) > 1. A total of 306 genes were selected based on these criteria. Functional assessment of differentially expressed genes was performed by using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) and Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA, Qiagen, http://www.ingenuity.com) were conducted to identify UCHL1-associated gene networks. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software version 5.0c). The data were displayed as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).

Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of pathological changes in the desminopathies at the earliest stage. The molecular mechanisms of mitochondria dysfunction in desminopathies remain exclusive. VDAC1 regulates mitochondrial uptake across the outer membrane and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Relationships between desminopathies and Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) remain unclear. Here we successfully constructed the desminopathy rat model, evaluated with conventional stains, containing hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Gomori Trichrome (MGT), (PAS), red oil (ORO), NADH-TR, SDH staining and immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence results showed that VDAC1 was accumulated in the desmin highly stained area of muscle fibers of desminopathy patients or desminopathy rat model compared to the normal ones. Meanwhile apoptosis related proteins bax and ATF2 were involved in desminopathy patients and desminopathy rat model, but not bcl-2, bcl-xl or HK2.VDAC1 and desmin are closely relevant in the tissue splices of deminopathies patients and rats with desminopathy at protein lever. Moreover, apoptotic proteins are also involved in the desminopathies, like bax, ATF2, but not bcl-2, bcl-xl or HK2. This pathological analysis presents the correlation between VDAC1 and desmin, and apoptosis related proteins are correlated in the desminopathy. Furthermore, we provide a rat model of desminopathy for the investigation of desmin related myopathy.\n", "fulltext": "Desminopathies, also known as genetically skeletal myopathy and/or cardiomyopathy, is the most common subtype of protein aggregated myopathies. This disease ranged from childhood to late adulthood is severely disabling disease, was due to the mutation of human desmin gene on chromosome 2q35. Most of patients with desminopathy loss their kinetism for 10 to 20 years of pathogenesis and died of cardiomyopathy or respiratory failure. The muscle pathology is characterized by enlarged myofibrillar diameter, desmin protein aggregate. The precise pathology of myopathies is myofibrillar intermediate sediments. Desminopathies are mainly reported in Northern American, less in China and Japan. Desminis an important muscle-specific type III intermediate filament cytoskeletal protein, containing the 470 amino acids. Its spherical ends mainly interact with intracellular proteins and a variety of substances and the middle rod-shaped are mainly \u03b1- helix cytoskeleton. Protein filaments within the muscle cells formed skeleton, and are widely connected to the fascia, Z-disc, nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and other structures. Meanwhile, special spiral-helix domain of desmin molecule can play a perfect role in power transmission, so that when the muscle fiber contraction or relaxation, the junction cytoskeleton structure will constitute an integrated whole body, muscle cells and organelles make their effective adaptation in systolic and diastolic changes. Mutant desmin will lose the function of the previous frame, resulting in not only mechanical power transmission dysfunction of myocyte, but also the obstacle of the mechanical signals of different molecules within the cells and myocytes. However, why the desmin gene mutations lead to abnormal accumulation of more than 60 proteins appeared in muscle cells, muscle cells, and what kinds of pathophysiological changes in organelles happened after desmin mutation, these problems have still not been fully understood clearly. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of the disease has been the research highlights. It has been confirmed, and mitochondria are the principal target of pathological mechanisms involved in a variety of inflammatory muscle disease and hereditary muscle disease. Recent studies have found that after the desmin gene mutation, mitochondrial morphology and function of muscle cells also appeared abnormal pathological changes. Desmin knockout mouse muscle cells, mitochondrial dysfunction are the earliest pathological changes, mainly increased the number of mitochondria, mitochondrial swelling and abnormal accumulation in the muscle membrane, mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, and decreased activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes. In the mutant desmin L345P transgenic mice, the muscle fibers within the mitochondrial function and morphology also showed abnormal mitochondrial Ca2+levelsincreased considerably apoptosis start the mitochondria-mediated pathway at the same time. Schroder R et al. found that mutant desmin K239fsX242 patient muscle cells appear abnormal distribution of mitochondria, the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes I and IV decreased. Above clinical and basic studies have shown that abnormal muscle mitochondria is one of the earliest pathological changes in the desmin mutations, not only for structural mitochondrial abnormalities and abnormal position, but also, the performance of the energy metabolism and Ca2+dysregulation. Mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also called mitochondrial membrane pore protein, is an imperative mitochondrial membrane permeability material transport channel. The main functions of VDAC include the following aspects: (1) VDAC controls the transport of metabolites between the mitochondria and cytoplasm, VDAC polymers form channels to modulate ATP transportation the outer mitochondrial membrane; (2) VDAC is an important part of mitochondrial permeability transformation channels (permeability transition pore, PT hole), PT hole is composed of mitochondrial proteins and cytoplasmic proteins (including: VDAC, creatine kinase, adenylate transporter, cyclophilin D, etc.), mainly localised in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the outer membrane contact sites. cytochrome C (CytoC), apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), Smac/DIABLO, nucleic acid within various apoptotic factors, endonuclease G, etc. were released into the cytosol when the mitochondrial PT pore are opening; (3) VDAC is the important protein cross-talk between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, VDAC connected to endoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel IP3R physically with chaperone GRP75 (glucose-regulated protein 75) and play an important regulatory role in modulating the inner mitochondrial Ca2+ levels. In addition, VDAC connected to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum through phosphorylation cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS2), regulating Bid of Bcl2pro-apoptotic factor family mediated apoptotic pathways; (4) VDAC is involved in the regulation of intracellular redox substances. On the one hand, VDAC can promote mitochondrial free oxygen radicals to release into the cytoplasm, on the other hand, nitric oxide (NO) and VDAC interacts directly, inhibits VDAC channel permeability, thereby inhibiting the opening of the mitochondrial PT pores. In conclusion, VDAC is the important intersectional target of mitochondrial regulation of cell survival and death pathways. Apoptosis is completed through the extrinsic pathway and intrinsic pathway, the extrinsic pathway is considered to be leaded by a number of extracellular signals, such as Fas or tumor necrosis factor (TNF); intrinsic pathway usually begins with the mitochondria response to different stimuli. VDAC is uniquely positioned in the outer mitochondrial membrane channel, control crosstalk between mitochondria and other parts of cell metabolism. VDAC is a powerful lever in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism.There are a lot of proteins interacting with VDAC1 in the cell, adjusting the permeability of PT pore and the release of the apoptotic material of mitochondrial membrane gap, thereby regulating cell apoptosis. The bcl-2 protein family is one of the key factors in the regulation of apoptosis, and plays an important role in apoptosis signal transduction pathway. Bcl-2 and bax are the most representative the anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic genes of bcl-2 family respectively, and bax is the main regulator of bcl-2 activity. bax can interact with VDAC to increase VDAC aperture and increases mitochondrial permeability, promoting apoptosis. The bcl-2 protein is an essential anti-apoptotic proteins, preventing the release of cytochrome C and the activity of caspase. The proper proportion of bax and bcl-2 maintains the cell homeostasis to ensure cell survival. In the studies of tumor cells, it was found that tumor cells still maintain energy supply even in the presence of oxygen by enhancing the glucose anaerobic glycolysis, this enhanced characteristics of tumor cell is called aerobic glycolysis tile Berg effects (Warburg effect). Further studies showed that the conjunction of mitochondrial and hexokinase is the key of Warburg effect. Additional studies showed that hexokinase (HK) and mitochondrial outer membrane through VDAC associated. There are four genes encoding four kinds of HK subtypes in the human genome. HK\u2160and HK\u2161are positioned in the outer mitochondrial membrane.HK\u2162is localized in the nucleoside, HK\u2163is localized in the cytoplasm. Evidences suggest that HK\u2161of four subtypes is really related to VDAC in 1998. HK\u2161and VDAC mitochondrial membrane gap prevents the release of binding protein and apoptosis. Evidence suggested that activated into factor (ATF2) of cytoplasmic localization is associated with the cell death and stress of disease process. Genotoxic stress stimulates nuclear ATF2 to translocate to the cytoplasm. ATF2 within the cytoplasm is positioned on the outer membrane of mitochondrial, and then mitochondrial membrane potentially reduced, causing mitochondrial depolarization, which increases the permeability of mitochondria, causing mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis. ATF2-Bim-VDAC1 hierarchically regulates apoptosis, ATF2 damages HK-VDAC1 complex, inspires Bim-mediated BAX-VDAC complex formation to increase the permeability and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome C, resulting in induction of apoptosis. In mammals, VDAC have three kinds of isoforms: VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3, which VDAC1 is the most abundant and mainly studied. In HeLa cells, the amount of VDAC1 is ten times more than VDAC2, 100 times more than VDAC3. Desmin is the most important protein in muscle cells intermediate filament cytoskeletal.Whether there is interaction between desmin and VDAC, and when desmin changes, what changes of VDAC function will occur, how mitochondrial happen to change, it is not clear. The study adenovirus coated protein gene mutation junction constructs desmin disease animal model, by contrasting immunohistochemical results of desminopathy patient-related diseases and animal models of desminopathy disease, we found that desmin mutation and VDAC1, bax, bcl-2, HK\u2161, ATF2 are closely related, it provided ideas for the study of other neurological protein aggregation diseases, also provides a new approach for drug development. HEK-293 cells were purchased from ATCC (USA).Incision enzymes were purchased from NEB Company and Takara Company. LR Clonase\u2161was bought from Invitrogen. METAFECTENETM (Biotex, USA) were used for transduction in HEK-293 cells. Adenovirus vectors ofrAd5-DES were performed by Jingsai biotechnology (Wuhan, China), coated with mutation protein of DES at c.821T>C; L274P (S5 Fig). Vectors of pad-DES were transferable intoHEK-293 cells with METAFECTENETM followed the manufactural instruction. The titer of adenovirus was obtained by Tissue Culture Infectious dose 50 Assay. All animal works were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. They were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shanghai Jiao tong University and monitored by the Department of Experimental Animals of Shanghai Jiao tong University. Clinical specimens of desminopathy patients were acquired by surgery or biopsy from desminopathy patients, which were approved by the Ethical Committee of Central Hospital of Minhang District of Shanghai. Written Informed consent was provided by all patients in this study. Male SD rats (18\u201325 days old) were supplied by the Animal Scientific Department of Shanghai Jiaotong University. The rats were maintained in the accredited animal facility of Shanghai Jiao tong University, and animal care was in accordance with institutional guidelines. The rats were received intramuscular injection with rAd5-DES (1010pfu per rat) at the left legs with 9 palace grids method, every grid is 0.5cm\u00d70.5cm (S6A Fig),and accordingly the rats were received intramuscular injection with the same voltage of normal saline as control. The rats run in a wheel at the time of 6 and 9 o\u2019clock everyday (S6B Fig). Rats were sacrificed at d14 after injection. The muscle tissues of left or right legs were collected and stored in the -80\u00b0C. The skeletal muscle was cut by using CM1950 frozen section machine (Leica, Germany) and prepared for the Conventional stain or Immunohistochemistry. We have any efforts to alleviate suffering for rats used in this study as the following steps: Anesthesia: The chloral hydrate was formulated into 5% solution with sterile saline. Rats were received intraperitoneal injection of 5% chloral hydrate following 0.6ml / 100g, and the anesthetic into three equal parts, injection of 1each at interval 3min, observe the effect before the third injection, cancel the third injection if it has entered the anesthesia; and the injection continues if it fails to reach anesthesia. After injection of narcotic drugs, pull out the needles lightly to avoid leakage. Two rats of each were sacrificed respectively at the time points: 2 days, 7 days 14 days, 21 days or 28 days. After we accessed the rat model of different time points, 14 days were chosen in this model for further immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. Eight rats of each group were performed in the further experiment. The rats were received intramuscular injection with rAd5-DES (1010pfu per rat) at the left legs with 9 palace grids method. Select the patients(S1 Table) diagnosed with desmin myopathy in the neurological department of our hospital between October 2014 and January 2016, and the patients with the same electrophysiological neuromuscular symptoms and muscle biopsy but the normal final diagnosis in the same period, were set as the control group. After obtaining the approval of the hospital ethics committee, and patients and their families signed the informed consent of patients and routine physical examination, an open surgical incision was selected at the left biceps biopsy site after local anesthesia to obtain muscle specimens between October 2014 and January 2016. The frozen sections of the skeletal muscle of desminopathy patients and desminopathy rat model were prepared for conventional stain, containing hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Gomori Trichrome (MGT), (PAS), red oil (ORO), NADH-TR, SDH stain, the method of these staining followed the previously published. Tissue sections were prepared and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis or immunofluorescence. Murine anti-desmin Ab (Abcam) and Goat anti-murine second Ab (DAKO) were used for immunohistochemistry. Murine anti-desmin monoclonal Ab (Abcam), Rabbit anti-bcl-xl monoclonal Ab (Abcam), Rabbit anti-ATF2 polyclonal Ab (Abcam), Rabbit anti-bax polyclonal Ab (Protein Tech), Rabbit anti-HK2 polyclonal Ab (Protein Tech), Rabbit anti-bcl-2 polyclonal Ab (GeneTex), TRITC-labeled goat anti murine IgG (Protein Tech) and FITC-labeled goat anti rabbit IgG (Protein Tech) were used for immunofluorescence. Images were obtained using a NIKON-Ds-RIL microscope at 40 x10 magnifications. Statistics of these proteins were analyzed by using Image-pro plus 6.0. Firstly, we collected the frozen sections of the left biceps of patients with desmin-related myopathy, then analyze by using routine staining and immunohistochemical staining. It suggested that the border of muscle cross-section is still clearly displayed and mild hyperplasiain the connective tissues within the muscle bundle. Small blood vessels were normal without significant cardiovascular infiltration of the inflammatory cells and deposits of abnormal materials. There are some angular muscle fibers within the bundle loosely arranged due to the proliferation of internal connective tissues.The muscle fiber diameters displayed the unimodal distribution. Normal muscle fiber diameter is between 30\u201390 microns, and the group scattered distribution of small circular or angular muscle fiber atrophyhas a diameter of between 5\u201330 microns. Little muscle fibers hypertrophy occurs; the maximum diameter is 110 microns. Eosinophilic materials appeared in the visible part of the muscle fibers lumps or patchy distribution, the phenomenon of some muscle fibers shift in the nucleus occurs (Fig 1A), there are rimmed vacuoles within few muscle fibers. Individual muscle fiber necrosis, necrotic muscle fibers with the old phagocytic cell infiltration, and necroticfresh-like muscle fibers showed homogeneous changes. Basophilic material deposited appears in broken individual muscle fiber therein. We found no muscle membrane-like changed fibers without regeneration occurred, or cyclic, spiral and split changed. Homogeneous substances and visible individual atypical RRF (Fig 1B) occurred within few muscle fibers. The fat droplets increased substantially inindividual muscle fibers (Fig 1B). PAS staining showed no stained muscle fibers and lack of glycogen substance in abnormal material deposition zone (Fig 1A). NADH-TR staining showed few stained atrophic muscle fibers, the material deposited activity within abnormal muscle fibers appeared flaky deletion (Fig 1A). SDH staining showed that the lack of activity in the central portion of the muscle fibers, and a small amount of residual activity (Fig 1A) at its periphery. NSE staining showed the lesions visible stained part of muscle fibers and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Immunohistochemical staining of desmin revealed that corresponding positive deposits also emerged in the majority of MGT stained muscle fibers (Fig 1A). Normal desmin displayed grid-like pulp diffuse expression under sarcolemma and package (Fig 1C and S1A Fig), while desmin aggregated in muscle fiber of patients with desminopathy, which appeared the following characteristics: (1) diffuse positive aggregation within the package pulp or under sarcolemma (Fig 1C and S1A Fig); (2) strong positive lumpy deposits in the package pulp, pellet-like deposition (Fig 1C and S1A Fig); (3) strongly positive irregularly aggregates in the pulp (Fig 1C and S1A Fig). VDAC1 is involved in desmin aggregation in the patients with desminopathy. Immunofluorescence analysis of desminand VDAC1 in the frozen sections of left biceps of patients with double detection of muscle fibers within desmin strong positive irregular mass gathering like high signal (Fig 1D and S1B Fig), VDAC1 fluorescent display appears VDAC1 high in the corresponding muscle fibers signal aggregates (Fig 1D and S1B Fig); Skeletal desmin in muscle membrane, evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig 1D and S1B Fig), VDAC1 normally evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig 1D and S1B Fig). VDAC1 are closely related to the apoptosis of cells, especially bax interacts with VDAC1 to enhance the permeability of mitochondria, and then promote the apoptosis. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, which maintains the survival of cells with bax at the proper percentage. ATF2 forms a complex ATF2-Bim-VDAC1, which regulates the apoptosis. So we analyze bax, bcl2,bcl-xl, and HK2 expression and location in the muscle fibersof patients with desminopathy by using immunofluorescences. Fluorescent desmin displayed irregular aggregation high signal (Fig 2 and S2 Fig) muscle fibers, bax fluorescent display high signal accumulation also appear in the corresponding muscle fibers (Fig 2A and S2 Fig); Skeletal desmin in muscle membrane, evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig 2A and S2 Fig); bax evenly distributed within the normal muscle fibers, muscle fibers showed a mosaic-like distribution (Fig 2A and S2 Fig). Immunofluorescence staining of bax in muscle fibers appeared the mosaic distribution of lightly stained, stained (Fig 2A and S2 Fig), corresponding to HE staining (Fig 2A, right and S2 Fig) type 1, type 2 muscle fibers. bax fluorescence was lightly stained in Type 1 muscle fibers and thickly stained in type 2 muscle fibers. Fluorescent desmin showed diffuse hyperintensity in the muscle fibers of patients(Fig 2B and S2 Fig), bcl-2 fluorescence display no significant abnormality between fluorescence the corresponding muscle fibers and normal muscle fibers(Fig 2B and S2 Fig); desminevenly distributed in muscle membrane and the cytoplasm of normal skeletal muscle (Fig 2B and S2 Fig), bcl-2displayeduniformly low signal within the normal muscle fibers(Fig 2B and S2 Fig). Fluorescent desmin in muscle fibers diffusely display high signal (Fig 2C and S2 Fig), fluorescent bcl-xl display no significant differences between corresponding muscle fibers and normal muscle fibers (Fig 2C and S2 Fig); desmin evenly distributed in the normal cytoplasmand the normal muscle membrane (Fig 2C and S2 Fig), bcl-xl displayed uniformly low signal within normal skeletal muscle (Fig 2C and S2 Fig). High fluorescent desmin signal appeared in sarcolemma and their regular lumps aggregation of muscle fibers (Fig 2D and S2 Fig), high signal of fluorescent ATF2 display in the correspondingly irregular aggregation of the muscle fibers (Fig 2D and S2 Fig); Skeletal desmin in muscle membrane, evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig 2D and S2 Fig), ATF2 distributed evenly in the cytoplasm of normal human skeletal muscle (Fig 2D and S2 Fig). Fluorescent desmin display muscle fibers diffuse hyperintensity (Fig 2E and S2 Fig), HK2 fluorescent display corresponds to the fluorescence signal than normal muscle fibers slightly reduced (Fig 2E and S2 Fig); normal desmin in muscle membrane, evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig 2E and S2 Fig), HK2 within normal muscle fibers evenly distributed (Fig 2E and S2 Fig). We constructed the plasmid pad-DES which including the point mutation of desmin. Then pad-DES was injected into skeletal muscle of SD rats (see methods in detail). 14 days later rats were sacrificed and skeletal muscle was collected for frozen section. The desmin aggregation displayed typically in the desminopathy-like muscle fibers by immunohistochemistry (Fig 3A and S3A Fig). Then we repeated that 4 SD rats were injected with pad-DES and rats displayed the desmin aggregation in the muscle fibers (Fig 3A and S3A Fig). In this model, desmin aggregates in the muscle fibers (Fig 3B) within a small amount of occasional eosinophilic material deposition (Fig 3B). Parts of the muscle fibers shift to the nucleus with the occasional nuclear aggregation. MGT staining showed no abnormalities (Fig 4B). PAS staining showed no abnormal desmin deposition within the muscle fibers (Fig 3B). NADH staining showed the individual stained muscle fibers were atrophy; desmin deposition in muscle fibers appears the patchy lack of enzyme activity (Fig 3B). SDH staining confirmed the lack of activity in the muscle fibers (Fig 3B). Desminand VDAC1 were detected in the frozen sections of skeletal muscle specimens of model using the immunofluorescence staining, The diffuse high signal or strong positive expression of abnormal desmin regularly aggregated in muscle fibers (Fig 3C and S3B Fig), VDAC1 aggregates within the corresponding muscle fibers (Fig 3C and S3B Fig), and the normal desmin distributed in the muscle membrane or cytoplasmic (Fig 3C and S3B Fig), normal VDAC1 expressed diffuse in the cytoplasm (Fig 3C and S3B Fig). Desmin, bax, bcl-2, bcl-xl, ATF2 and HK2were detected in the frozen sections of muscle fibers by using immunofluorescence staining. In the abnormal muscle fibers, it showed the diffuse high signal or strong positive expression of desmin aggregationin the muscle fibers (Fig 4 and S4 Fig); sarcolemma, bax positively aggregated in pulp (Fig 4A and S4 Fig); Bcl-2 expressed weaker compare to the normal muscle fibers(Fig 4B and S4 Fig); There was no significant difference of bax expression compare to the normal muscle fibers (Fig 4A and S4 Fig); The signaling of ATF2 aggregated highly in the corresponding muscle fibers of abnormal desmin (Fig 4D and S4 Fig). There was no difference of the expression of HK2 between the normal muscle fibers and abnormal ones (Fig 4E and S4 Fig). Correspondingly, in the normal muscle fibers, desmin distributed in normal muscle membrane, evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig 4 and S4 Fig); bax distributed evenly within the muscle fibers (Fig 4A and S4 Fig), where type 1 muscle fibers were lightly stained, type 2 muscle fibers were thickly stained. Bax exhibits the pale stain mosaic-like stained in the muscle fibers. Bcl-2 distributed evenly in the skeletal muscle(Fig 4B and S4 Fig the distribution of Bcl-xl was even in the muscle fibers (Fig 4C and S4 Fig). ATF2 was distributed evenly in the nucleus or cytoplasm (Fig 4D and S4 Fig). HK2 be distributed evenly in the normal skeletal muscle membrane and cytoplasm (Fig 4E and S4 Fig). Desminopathyis hereditary myopathy caused by mutations of desminin the skeletal or cardiac muscle [25, 26]. In this study, we have successfully constructed desminopathy disease animal model by direct intramuscular transduction with adenovirus coding mutations of the gene desmin, the high stability of the model was validated. In frozen sections of skeletal muscle of the desminopathy patients or animal model, we found that desmin and VDAC1 deposition with high signals in muscle fibers, and the related pro-apoptotic proteins (bax, ATF2) also appeared high signal aggregation, and about related anti-apoptotic proteins (bcl-2, bcl-xl, HK2), HK2 in patients and bcl-2 in desminopathy rat model are slightly lower expressed than the normal ones, the other anti-apoptotic proteins are unclear. Thus, we propose the following model: (1)gathered desmin caused bax from polymerization channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane, bax and VDAC1 are combined. (2) bcl-2 was reduced caused by desmin aggregation, the ratio of bax and bcl-2 is more than 1.(3) desmin aggregation caused the increase of ATF2, stimulating the formation of bim-mediated bax-VDAC1 complex, or ATF2 was directly targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential. (4) Desmin aggregation inhibited the expression of HK2, reducing the formation of HK2-VDAC complex and increasing bax/bak formed polymerization hole channel in the outer mitochondrial membranes. High expression of VDAC1 increased the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, then the pro-apoptotic factors released from the mitochondrial membrane gap to the cytoplasm, eventually leading to apoptosis. In the previous study, Pierre Joanne constructed desminopathy model by direct intramuscular transduction with the protein of the mutant desmin coated adeno-associated virus. Because adenoviral vector can also be transfected into the dividing or non-dividing cells, the virus titer is high and is easily prepared and purificated, does not integrate into the host cell genome, the current adenovirus has become recognized the most ideal gene vectors. In this study, desminopathy model was constructed by direct intramuscular transduction with the adenoviral vector containing mutations of desmin(c.821T> C; L274P). We successfully constructed the desminopathy rat model with intramuscular transduction and re-verify the high stability of the model. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the progress of the disease has been a highlighted topic. Muscle mitochondrial morphology and function showed the abnormal significantly increased Ca2+ levels in mitochondria starts mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Varying amounts of cytochrome C negative (COX-) muscle fibers and not the typical ragged red muscle fibers (RRF) appeared in the muscle biopsy specimens of desminopathy patients. The clinical and basic studies have shown that mutations mitochondria abnormality is one of the earliest pathological changes in the abnormal muscle with desmin mutation, not only for structural mitochondrial abnormalities and abnormal position, but also the dysregulation of the energy metabolism and Ca2+. Permeability transition (PT) pore were formed by the combination of mitochondrial proteins and cytoplasmic protein comprising: a voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), creatine kinase, adenylate transporter, cyclophilin D etc. PT hole was mainly located in the contact sites of the mitochondrial inner membrane and the outer membrane. Cytochrome C (CytoC) apoptosis inducing factor (apoptosis inducing factor, AIF), Smac / DIABLO, a variety of apoptotic factors endonuclease G, etc. were released into the cytosol when the mitochondrial PT pore is opening and induce apoptosis; VDAC also called mitochondrial porin is an important part of PT holes, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Further Ca2+, ATP, glutamate, and many other proteins of NADH and VDAC interaction regulate the permeability of the VDAC channel. Eukaryotic VDAC have VDAC1, VDAC2, VDAC3 subtype III, respectively, by three distinct genes encoding, which VDAC1 is the most studied subtype currently. In this study, patients and desmin Construction disease model, row frozen section of skeletal muscle desmin and VDAC1 double staining detected desmin accumulation in muscle fibers VDAC1 there gathered high signal. Tip desmin and muscle disease VDAC1 highly expressed genes are closely related. There are many proteins combining with VDAC to regulate the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and apoptosis. Bcl-2 family proteins play a key role in the regulation of apoptosis, so far, there are at least 19 kinds of proteins of human bcl-2 family are found. This family includes seven kinds of anti-apoptotic proteins:bcl-2, bcl-Xl, Mcl-1, Bcl-B, Bcl-w, A1 / Bfl1; and other pro-apoptotic proteins: Bax, Bak, Bok, bim, Bmf, Puma, Noxa, Bad, Bid, Bcl-Xs, BiNP3, Hrk, respectively. Bcl-2 and bax of Bcl-2 family proteins in apoptosis are most important [31, 32]. Bax mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of the package and is shifted to mitochondrial outer membrane to form dimers, trimers, and adenylate transporter combination response to the stimulation of apoptosis signaling, or combines with VDAC directly to induce VDAC open and increases the permeability of mitochondrial membrane, thereby causing induction of apoptosis. The major anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is an integral membrane protein of bcl-2 family proteins, mainly anchored in the outer membrane of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic side of the nuclear membrane, and competitive inhibition of bax, thereby inhibiting apoptosis [34, 35]. The ratio of bax/bcl-2 regulates the apoptosis or inhibition of apoptosis, while bax / bcl-2 is more than 1, the cells tend to apoptosis; when bax / bcl-2 is less than 1, the cell s tend to anti-apoptosis. Bcl-xl and bcl-2 are highly homological.The overexpression of bcl-xl will protect the hippocampus and cortex nerve cells against ischemia and hypoxia. Under hypoxic-ischemic brain damage condition, bcl-xl gene may also inhibit caspase-3, caspase-9 activity, inhibiting the shift of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) to the nucleus. Overexpression of bcl-xl can also protect primary neurons antioxidant sugar deprivation and hypoglycemia stress in rats. Studies have shown that bcl-xl plays an important role in the number of mitochondria and its division or integration, and also maintains the stability of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthase effect. Recent studies have shown that theBH4 area of bcl-xl, targeting the VDAC1, reduces mitochondrial Ca2+ influx mediated by VDAC1 to inhibit apoptosis. Abnormal accumulation of bax appears in skeletal muscle fibers of desminopathy patients and desminopathy the content of baxin type 1 muscle fibers is lower than type 2 muscle fibers; there is no difference of bcl-2 and bcl-xl in muscle fibers withdesmin aggregation of between patients and normal people,. Within desminopathy animal models, bcl-2 signal is slightly lower in muscle fibers with desmin aggregation of animal model than normal, while bcl-xl no significant difference compared with normal. It suggested that desmin deposition in muscle fibers tends to apoptosis. Under normal circumstances, activated into factor 2 (ATF2) can be found in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Overexpression of Cytoplasmic ATF2 predicts low malignancy and good prognosis. ATF2 aggregation can be observed in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer rafter radiotherapy. Overexpression of cytoplasmic ATF2 induced cell death in melanoma, thereby reducing the transcriptional activity of endogenous ATF2. Evidence suggested BH3 protein (BH3s), such as Bim, can induce BAX and VDAC restructure in the mitochondrial outer membrane to form the new channels [47, 48]. Recent studies have found that ATF2, Bim, VDAC1 hierarchically regulate apoptosis, ATF2 damages HK-VDAC1 complex, stimulating Bim-mediated the formation BAX-VDAC complex to increase permeability and the release mitochondrial cytochrome C, and induce death. We have found that ATF2 deposited in the skeletal muscle fibers with desmin deposition of desminopathy patients and animal models, which suggests that desmin deposition in muscle fibers and tends to apoptosis. HK\u2161-VDAC complexes interfere the conjunction of bcl-xl with VDAC, leading to an increase of free bcl-xl. Increased bcl-xl and bax binding inhibits the formation of bax/bak in the outer mitochondrial membrane, inhibiting apoptosis. Recent studies showed that mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase inhibitor (mTOR-KI) promotes HK\u2161to bind to VDAC binding to shut down the PT hole, while the dissociation of HK2 from the VDAC loss the function of mTOR-KI. Our study found that HK\u2161slightly weakened within muscle fibers of the desminopathy patients than normal, Indicating that the occurrence of desminopathy is related to the reduction of HK\u2161. In this study, there are also some shortcomings. First of all, a small sample volume and the lack of large sample statistics. Secondly, it is a short time observed in this animal model, discrepancies of proteins in animal models and patients with desminopathy. Thirdly, proteins are lack of quantitative comparison in this study observed morphological changes of muscle fibers. However, we have successfully constructed desmin disease animal models with the validation of high stability of the model. Furtherly, we present the understanding of desmin related myopathies by studying the mitochondrial apoptotic proteins. All above, we presented powerful evidences that VDAC1 are correlated with the desminopathies. Moreover, apoptosis related protein are also associated with desmin mutation in the patients with desminopathies or rat desminopathies model. The deeply mechanism of VDAC1 in the desminopathies need to be furtherly explored, so as to the mitochondrial dysfunction."}, "26937641": {"pmid": "26937641", "pmcid": "PMC4777566", "title": "Serum Amyloid A Induces Inflammation, Proliferation and Cell Death in Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells", "abstract": "\nSerum amyloid A (SAA) is an evolutionary highly conserved acute phase protein that is predominantly secreted by hepatocytes. However, its role in liver injury and fibrogenesis has not been elucidated so far. In this study, we determined the effects of SAA on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main fibrogenic cell type of the liver. Serum amyloid A potently activated I\u03baB kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Erk and Akt and enhanced NF-\u03baB-dependent luciferase activity in primary human and rat HSCs. Serum amyloid A induced the transcription of MCP-1, RANTES and MMP9 in an NF-\u03baB- and JNK-dependent manner. Blockade of NF-\u03baB revealed cytotoxic effects of SAA in primary HSCs with signs of apoptosis such as caspase 3 and PARP cleavage and Annexin V staining. Serum amyloid A induced HSC proliferation, which depended on JNK, Erk and Akt activity. In primary hepatocytes, SAA also activated MAP kinases, but did not induce relevant cell death after NF-\u03baB inhibition. In two models of hepatic fibrogenesis, CCl4 treatment and bile duct ligation, hepatic mRNA levels of SAA1 and SAA3 were strongly increased. In conclusion, SAA may modulate fibrogenic responses in the liver in a positive and negative fashion by inducing inflammation, proliferation and cell death in HSCs.\n", "fulltext": "Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a 12.5 kd acute phase protein which is highly conserved among all vertebrate species [1\u20133]. Serum amyloid A has been shown to play a protective role during inflammation. After infection or injury, SAA levels increase up to 1000-fold reaching serum concentrations of up to 80 \u03bcM in total. While the majority of SAA is found in association with high density lipoproteins, up to 15% of SAA exists in a lipid-free or lipid-poor form. Human SAA1 and SAA2, and murine SAA1, SAA2 and SAA3 are the main acute phase SAA proteins and predominantly produced by hepatocytes, whereas SAA4 is constitutively expressed. Hepatic acute-phase SAA production is stimulated by LPS and TNF\u03b1 in a NF-\u03baB dependent manner, and accounts for up to 2.5% of protein produced in inflamed liver in humans and up to 10% in other species. SAA has been suggested to play a role in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease [7\u201310]. Other studies propose functions for SAA in cholesterol transport [2, 3, 11]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that SAA may elicit cytokine and chemokine production, cell migration and upregulation of MMPs [6, 12\u201315]. On the molecular level, SAA has been shown to stimulate several proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways including NF-\u03baB, C/EBP, JNK, Erk, Akt and p38 [10, 14\u201316]. Its role in liver injury and fibrogenesis is, however, yet ill-defined. In this study, we investigate whether SAA may be involved in a potential crosstalk between hepatocytes as its major producing cell type and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). HSCs are a pericyte-like cell population in the liver that normally store a large proportion of the body\u2019s vitamin A. Following hepatic injury, HSCs undergo an activation process to become the predominant extracellular matrix producing cell population [17, 18]. Here we demonstrate that SAA levels are strongly elevated in 2 mouse models of hepatic fibrosis, and that SAA elicits inflammation, proliferation and apoptosis in HSCs suggesting SAA as a potential mediator of hepatocyte-HSC crosstalk in the injured liver. Primary HSCs were isolated by a 2-step collagenase perfusion from surgical specimens of healthy human livers (n = 3), from livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats (300\u2013450 g, n = 20) or male Balb/c mice (n = 15) followed by Nycodenz (Nycodenz, Oslo, Norway) two-layer discontinuous density gradient centrifugation as described [19\u201322]. All tissues were obtained by qualified medical staff, with written donor consent and the approval of the Ethics Committee of Columbia University, according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Purity of human, rat and mouse HSC preparations was 88, 94 and 96%, respectively, as assessed by autofluorescence at day 2 after isolation. Hepatic stellate cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and standard antibiotics on uncoated plastic tissue culture dishes. Culture-activated human HSCs were used between passages 2 to 7. Rat and mouse HSCs were not passaged and considered culture-activated between day 7 and 14 after isolation. Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from mouse from C57BL/6J wt, IL-1R knockout, TNF-R1 knockout and IL-1R, TNF-R1 double knockout mice by skin excision and culture in DMEM media plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Skin fibroblasts were used between passage 2 and 4. TRAF2- and RIP-1-knockout MEFs (a gift from Dr. Michael Karin) have been described previously. The animals were sacrificed by a lethal dose of ketamine under anesthesia. All animals received humane care and all procedures were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Commitee for Animal Studies in North Rhine-Westphalia (LANUV 84\u201302.05.20.11.249) and are in accordance with the requirements set by the National Institutes of Health and the German Protection of Animals Act. Hepatic fibrosis was induced by injecting Balb/c mice with 0.5 \u03bcl CCl4/g body weight intraperitoneally once per week for 8 weeks or by performing bile duct ligation as previously described. Human cells were treated with recombinant human SAA (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or recombinant human soluble Fas receptor (sFasR, PeproTech), murine cells were treated with recombinant human SAA or recombinant murine SAA, rmTNF\u03b1 or rmIL-1\u03b2 (all R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, as indicated) in the presence or absence of adenoviral GFP or I\u03baBsr, or SP600125 (20 \u03bcM) or LY294002 (10 \u03bcM) as described above. Recombinant human SAA corresponds to the sequence of human SAA 1 isotype except for addition of an N-terminal Met and substitution of Asp for Asn at position 60 and substitution of His to Arg at position 71. RNA was extracted by homogenizing tissue or cells in Trizol according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Real time PCR was performed for 40 cycles of 15s at 95\u00b0C and 60s at 60\u00b0C using an ABI 7000 sequence detection system as described. Each sample was measured in duplicate and quantification was performed by comparing the Ct values of each sample to a standard curve. Probes and primers for human RANTES, human MCP-1, human IL-8, human MMP9, 18s, mouse SAA1, mouse SAA3 and mouse GAPDH were designed by ABI. RANTES, MCP-1, IL-8 and MMP9 levels were normalized to 18s, SAA1 and SAA3 levels were normalized to GAPDH and are expressed as fold induction compared to untreated control. PCR products were partly analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Human HSCs were infected with AdGFP or AdI\u03baBsr at a multiplicity of 500 particles/cell one day before treatment or pretreated with LY294002 (10 \u03bcM), SP600125 (20 \u03bcM) or DMSO (0.1%) for 30 minutes where indicated followed by treatment with rhSAA (5 \u03bcg/ml) for 18h. Levels of human IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES were determined by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems) as previously described. Protein extracts were run on 10\u201312% SDS acrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose as previously described [19\u201321]. Blots were incubated with anti-caspase-3, anti-PARP, anti-phospho-Erk, anti-phospho(S536)-p65, anti-phospho(S473)-Akt (all Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-I\u03baB\u03b1, anti-phospho(S63)-c-Jun (both Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After incubation with secondary horseradish-peroxidase conjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence light method (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to X-omat film (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, CT) or a chemiluminescence imager (Image Station 2000R, Eastman Kodak Co.). Blots were reprobed with monoclonal anti-actin (MP Biomedicals) or GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology) to demonstrate equal loading. Human HSCs were serum starved for 12h followed by treatment with rhSAA or rhTNF\u03b1. IKK activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay as previously described [19, 26]. Briefly, 300 \u03bcg protein were immunoprecipitated with 2 \u03bcl anti-IKK\u03b3 (Santa Cruz) and washed three times. The kinase reaction was performed in 25 \u03bcl kinase buffer containing 0.5 \u03bcCi 32P-labeled ATP, 5 \u03bcM ATP and 80 \u03bcg/ml substrate (either GST-I\u03baB (1\u201354), GST-p65 (354\u2013551) or GST-p65 (354\u2013551, 536 A) for 30 minutes at 30\u00b0C. Plasmids for GST-p65 substrates were a gift from H. Sakurai (Tanabe Seiyaku Co., LTD., Osaka, Japan). JNK activity was determined by an in vitro kinase assay as previously described. Briefly, 25 \u03bcg of whole cell extract were precipitated with GST-c-Jun sepharose beads, washed three times and subjected to a kinase reaction for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently the beads were boiled in Laemmli-buffer and run on a 10% SDS-acrylamide gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie blue to confirm equal substrate loading, dried, exposed to Kodak Biomax film and/or to a Phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, Ca) for quantification of the bands. Human HSCs were infected with an adenovirus containing a NF-\u03baB-driven luciferase using a multiplicity of infection of 250. 12h later, the supernatant was changed and cells were serum starved for 12h followed by treatment with rhSAA or rhTNF\u03b1 for 6h. Luciferase activity was detected by luminescence (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) on a Fluostar Optima platereader (BMG, Durham, NC) and normalized to protein content as determined by the Bradford method. Serum-starved HSCs (0.4\u00d7105/well) were incubated with rhSAA or PDGF-BB (Sigma) in the presence or absence of PD. 16h later, the cells were pulsed with 1 \u03bcCi/ml [3H]-thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 8h, followed by TCA-precipitation, lysis, and measurement in a scintillation counter. Activated rat HSCs were infected with AdI\u03baBsr or AdGFP at 500 moi for 12h followed by serum starvation for 12h and rhSAA (5 \u03bcM) or rhTNF\u03b1 (R&D Systems; 10 ng/ml) treatment for 8h. For some experiments, HSCs were co-cultured with FasL-expressing 3T3 fibroblasts or control 3T3 fibroblasts at a HSC to 3T3 ratio of 1:5. Primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with rmSAA (5 \u03bcM) or rmTNF\u03b1 (30 ng/ml, R&D Systems) with or without ActD (0,2 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma) after 12h of serum starvation. Cell death in HSCs or hepatocytes was measured by LDH release into the culture medium according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Caspase 3-cleavage and PARP cleavage were determined by western blot. Apoptosis was visualized by fluorescent microscopy of PI- and Annexin V-staining (Roche). All data represent the mean of 3 independent experiments \u00b1 SD, if not otherwise stated. For the determination of statistical significance, unpaired Student\u2019s t-tests were performed using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). P values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. SAA is secreted by hepatocytes and represents one of the most abundant proteins in the liver during the acute phase response [2, 3]. To assess whether SAA may influence the fibrogenic response in the liver, we determined its effect on proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways in cultured HSC, which are believed to play an essential role in HSC activation and perpetuation [29, 30]. First, we measured activation of IKK and JNK, which are upstream activators of the NF-\u03baB and the AP-1 pathways. Recombinant human SAA induced a strong activation of IKK as determined by western blot for its target I\u03baB\u03b1, which was completely degraded after 15 and 30 minutes of stimulation (Fig 1A). Additionally, we observed a strong S536 phosphorylation of p65, a second target of IKK. SAA also strongly induced the JNK pathway as determined by western blotting for the phosphorylation of its target c-Jun (Fig 1A). These results were confirmed by an in vitro-kinase assay which showed potent activation of IKK towards GST-I\u03baB\u03b1 and GST-p65 and JNK toward GST-c-Jun with a maximum activation occurring after 15 minutes (Fig 1B). To rule out unspecific effects of SAA, e.g. by contaminants, we used human recombinant soluble Fas receptor, sFasR, as control and checked for I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. In contrast to SAA and to TNF\u03b1 as positive control, sFasR did not degrade I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig 1C). Notably, SAA-induced IKK and JNK activation were as potent as TNF\u03b1-induced IKK activation (Fig 1A and 1B). These results were further confirmed by a reporter gene assay in which human HSCs were infected with an adenovirus containing 3x\u03baB driven luciferase. SAA induced a dose-dependent increase in NF-\u03baB-dependent luciferase activity and exceeded the effects of TNF\u03b1 at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM (Fig 1D). Next we tested whether this effect also occurred in primary rat HSCs. Similar to the results obtained with human HSCs, we observed a potent activation of the JNK and IKK pathways culture-activated rat HSCs (day 4 and day 8), but only a weak activation in quiescent HSCs (day 2) (Fig 1E). In activated rat HSCs, SAA-induced NF-\u03baB driven luciferase activity reached or even exceeded levels of those induced by TNF\u03b1 (Fig 1F). To test whether the increased activity of IKK after SAA stimulation resulted in an increased transcription of NF-\u03baB dependent genes in HSCs, we measured the secretion of the NF-\u03baB-dependent chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES by ELISA. Recombinant human SAA strongly induced the secretion of all three chemokines (Fig 2A). To address the question whether the IKK and JNK pathways are responsible for driving the induction of these chemokines, we pretreated HSCs with pharmacological inhibitors of JNK and Akt, or infected them adenovirus expressing I\u03baBsr, a potent inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Whereas inhibition of NF\u03baB and JNK resulted in a complete or partial inhibition of chemokine secretion, respectively, we did not observe a significant inhibition of chemokine secretion with the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig 2A). Thus JNK and NF-\u03baB, but not PI-3kinase/Akt are signaling pathways that mediate the upregulation of IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES in human HSCs in response to SAA. Next we investigated whether NF-\u03baB and JNK inhibition also reduce chemokine production at the mRNA level. Real time PCR measurements showed that I\u03baBsr almost completely reduced the SAA-induced secretion of all 3 chemokines, whereas the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced chemokine secretion 50 to 80% (Fig 2B). Additionally, we also investigated whether SAA upregulated the levels MMP9 and MMP13, two crucial regulators of extracellular matrix and inflammation in the liver [31, 32]. Whereas we did not find detectable levels of MMP13 in the presence or absence of SAA (data not shown), we detected a strong induction of MMP9 after SAA treatment, which was blocked after incubation with either SP600125 or infection with AdI\u03baBsr (Fig 2C, upper panel). The induction of MMP9 by SAA was confirmed by zymography which showed an increased MMP9 activity after SAA or TNF\u03b1 (Fig 2C panel), yet to a much lower extent than the induction found at the mRNA level. Next we determined whether SAA activated Erk and Akt in HSCs as previously reported in other cell types. Both Akt and Erk have been implicated in HSC proliferation [33, 34]. Erk phosphorylation was strongly activated by SAA with a maximum between 5 and 30 minutes after stimulation, and inhibited by MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig 3A). We observed a strong activation of Akt after SAA as apparent by S473 phosphorylation already after 5 minutes of stimulation which lasted for up to two hours (Fig 3B). SAA-induced Akt S473 phosphorylation was completely blocked by the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 demonstrating that SAA-induced Akt activation is mediated by its upstream activator PI-3 kinase. To determine whether activation of Akt and Erk in response to SAA had any effect on HSC proliferation, we investigated SAA-induced [3H]-thymidine uptake in the presence or absence of PI-3 kinase and MEK inhibitors. SAA-induced a strong induction of [3H]-thymidine uptake which was almost 60% of that induced by 5 nM PDGF (Fig 3C). Pharmacological inhibition of PI-3 kinase and MEK as well as of JNK completely blocked SAA-induced [3H]-thymidine uptake suggesting that activation of these pathways is responsible for the proliferative effects of SAA (Fig 3C). Many of the signaling pathways induced by SAA resembled those activated by TNF. Therefore, we next investigated whether SAA induces apoptosis in HSCs. Since human HSCs are highly resistant to TNF\u03b1-induced cell death, we investigated SAA-induced cell death in primary unpassaged rat HSCs which are susceptible to TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis after NF-\u03baB inhibition. As expected, we did not detect an increase in cell death in primary HSCs that were treated by SAA alone. However, when NF-\u03baB activation was blocked by I\u03baBsr in primary rat HSCs, we observed almost 50% cell death after 24h of SAA treatment (Fig 4A). To determine whether cell death was apoptotic, we checked for the presence of cleaved caspase 3 and the 89kd PARP cleavage fragment, two hallmarks of apoptosis. After 8h of SAA treatment, we detected the occurrence of caspase-3 cleavage products at 17kd and 19kd as well as the 89kd PARP cleavage product (Fig 4B). To confirm these results, we stained HSC with AnnexinV and propidium iodide. After 8h of SAA, the majority of I\u03baBsr-expressing cells were AnnexinV-positive indicating the onset of apoptotic cell death (Fig 4C). Interestingly, SAA treatment alone or after inhibition of NF\u03baB activation by ActD did not cause cell death in primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig 4D), indicating a possible selective induction of cell death in HSCs and hepatocytes by SAA during hepatic injury and fibrogenesis. However, SAA treatment of hepatocytes also led to potent phosphorylation of Erk, and c-Jun and to a lesser extent of Akt and p65 (Fig 4E). SAA signaling is not well defined and several receptors including formyl peptide receptor like 1 (FPRL1) and SR-BI have been proposed as receptors for SAA. We did not see any effects on SAA-induced JNK activation when we blocked FPRL1 signaling by pertussis toxin or SR-BI by a blocking antibody (Fig 5A). Our previous observation showed that SAA activated pathways that are induced in similar manner by TNF\u03b1, and to some extent by LPS and IL-1\u03b2 (Figs 1\u20134). To investigate whether SAA-induced signals may be due to minute contamination with LPS, we first investigated SAA-induced p65 phosphorylation in TLR4-deficient fibroblasts. LPS did not induce p65 phosphorylation in these cells whereas TNF\u03b1 and SAA induced p65 phosphorylation effectively excluding that SAA-mediated effects were due to LPS contamination (Fig 5B). To exclude involvement of TNF-R1 and IL-1R, we treated fibroblasts deficient in TNF-R1 and/or IL-1R with SAA. Whereas TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling was completely abolished in these cells, SAA-induced c-Jun phosphorylation as well as UV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation (serving as positive control) was present demonstrating that TNF-R1 and IL-1R are not involved in the SAA pathway (Fig 5C). Similarly, we found an induction of NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation in IL-1R- and/or TNFR1-deficient cells. To explore whether SAA-induced pathways are similar to the TNF pathway downstream of the TNF receptor at the level of adapter molecules, we treated RIP1- and TRAF2-deficient MEFs with SAA, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Whereas TNF\u03b1 signaling was completely blocked in RIP1- and TRAF2-deficient cells, SAA and IL-1\u03b2 induced a strong activation of the JNK pathway (Fig 5D). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that SAA signals through an unknown receptor in fibroblasts and this pathway is independent of TLR4, IL-1R, TNFR1, TRAF2 and RIP1, and not sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin. To determine whether SAA levels are increased during hepatic fibrogenesis and may thus influence HSCs in vivo, we measured SAA mRNA levels in 2 models of hepatic fibrogenesis by quantitative real time PCR. While SAA1 is the main acute phase SAA produced by hepatocytes, SAA3 is predominantly produced by macrophages during the acute phase response. The levels of SAA1 and SAA3 mRNA were induced 28-fold and 8-fold, respectively, in mice after 8 injections of CCl4 (Fig 6A). In mice that underwent bile duct ligation to induce fibrogenesis, we measured a 55-fold and 2-fold increase in SAA1 and SAA3 mRNA three days after bile duct ligation, respectively (Fig 6A). Five days after bile duct ligation, SAA1 and SAA3 mRNA were increased 23-fold and 19-fold, respectively. Three weeks after bile duct ligation the mRNA levels of SAA1 and SAA3 still remained elevated, but were significantly lower than at day 5. In freshly isolated quiescent HSCs, we found only low levels of SAA1 mRNA in quiescent HSCs, which were 76000 times lower than those of hepatocytes and attributable to the small degree of hepatocyte contamination (data not shown). After 5 days of culture-activation, the levels of SAA1 became undetectable in HSCs consistent with the disappearance of hepatocyte contamination in culture (Fig 6b, left panel). In contrast, the levels of SAA3 were markedly upregulated during HSC culture-activation (Fig 6b, right panel). Thus, HSCs are likely to be a target of SAA1 and a source of SAA3 in the liver. Although SAA is one of the most abundantly expressed hepatic proteins during infection and inflammatory conditions, its functions remain incompletely understood. The present study provides evidence that SAA modulates fibrogenic responses in the liver by inducing proliferation and inflammation in HSCs under some conditions and by promoting HSC cell death under other conditions. Previous studies have reported that SAA exerts cytokine-like properties in many cell types. Consistent with these observations, we detected the activation of a large number of proinflammatory and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in HSCs and hepatocytes. Surprisingly, the effects of SAA on mouse and human HSCs on pathways such as NF-\u03baB and JNK were as strong as those exerted by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, one of the most potent proinflammatory cytokines in HSCs and other cell types [19, 25]. Stimulation with SAA led to a dramatic increase in the production of chemokines such as IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES. To exclude that signals mediated by SAA were due to a contamination with LPS or by TLR-agonistic activity of SAA as suggested by recent publications [37\u201339], we investigated proinflammatory signaling pathways in cells from TLR4-mutant mice. We found no difference between TLR4 wild-type and TLR4-mutant cells effectively excluding LPS as a contaminating agonist. Additionally, we investigated whether SAA might directly or indirectly activate receptors for TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. Again, there was no significant inhibition of SAA signals in cells deficient for TNFR1, IL-1 receptor or both receptors. Previous reports have suggested several receptors to mediate SAA effects, among these FLRP-1 and SR-BI [11, 14]. However, we could not find a role for these receptors in mediating proinflammatory effects of SAA in primary HSCs. Inflammation is tightly associated with hepatic fibrogenesis and considered a key event that promotes the activation of HSCs [29, 40, 41]. Increased production of chemokines by HSCs allows HSCs to recruit cell populations such as Kupffer cells whose presence is required for HSCs to fully activate [42, 43]. Moreover, secretion of chemokines is thought to exert autocrine and paracrine effects on HSCs further leading to activation and to the recruitment of additional HSCs to the site of injury [45, 46]. Thus, SAA-mediated chemokine secretion in activated HSCs is likely to contribute to fibrogenesis and may represent a novel link between hepatocytes and HSCs in the injured liver. Induction of HSC proliferation represents a second mechanism by which SAA may enhance fibrogenesis in the liver. Following activation, HSCs become highly proliferative and thus expand to a pool of activated HSCs to enhance fibrogenic responses. Accordingly, blockade of PDGF, the most potent mitogen for HSCs, significantly reduces hepatic fibrogenesis. We found that the pro-proliferative effects of SAA were weaker than those exerted by PDGF, yet stronger than those reported other agonists including insulin, leptin and chemokines such as MCP-1 and RANTES [25, 45, 47, 48]. Our results are similar to studies that show SAA-induced proliferation in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes, and suggest that SAA may exert similar functions in chronic inflammatory conditions of different organs. Blockade of SAA-induced signaling pathways revealed specific functions in regards to proliferation and inflammation. While NF-\u03baB and JNK activation were required for SAA-mediated proinflammatory gene expression and MMP9 expression, JNK, Akt and Erk were essential for SAA-induced proliferation. Blocking NF-\u03baB was more efficient in reducing chemokine expession than blocking JNK. These findings are similar to previous results in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2 induced chemokine regulation in HSCs suggesting that NF-\u03baB plays a more prominent role in regulating these genes than the JNK/AP-1 pathway [25, 49]. Previous studies have demonstrated that both Erk and Akt are required for HSC proliferation. Thus, our study provides evidence that SAA utilizes well-characterized pathways to induce inflammatory gene expression and proliferation in HSCs. Amyloids are believed to be responsible for organ damage in diseases such as systemic amyloidosis and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Not only has SAA been shown to induce lysis of bacterial cells by forming ion-channels in lipid bilayer membranes, but has been reported to prevent cell death in eukaryotic cells [51, 52]. One study reported induction of nuclear changes consistent with apoptotic cell death after SAA treatment, but this study did not specify the type of SAA that was used for cell death induction nor did it provide quantification of cell death. Here we show for the first time that NF-\u03baB can act as a switch between SAA-induced cell death and proliferation. Similar to TNF\u03b1, SAA induced cell death in HSCs only in the absence of NF-\u03baB activity. Thus, it seems that the anti-apoptotic effects of NF-\u03baB regulated genes override proapopototic signals after SAA stimulation. SAA-mediated cell death was apoptotic as demonstrated by the appearance of caspase 3- and PARP-cleavage products and Annexin V membrane staining. This novel function of SAA suggests that in a fashion similar to TNF, SAA may act as double-edged sword in chronic inflammatory states: Induction of inflammation under most conditions, but induction of cell death when NF-\u03baB dependent genes cannot be transcribed. In view of the abundance of SAA in the injured liver and its upregulation not only during liver injury but many other infectious and inflammatory conditions, it is unlikely that SAA is a primary stimulator of HSC activation and inflammation. This notion is further supported by our finding that SAA did not induce I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in quiescent (day 2) HSCs and only weak phosphorylation of the JNK target c-Jun. We therefore suggest that SAA modulates inflammatory and proliferative response in HSCs after they have initiated the activation process. SAA plays a similar role in other chronic inflammatory conditions and stimulates wound healing response in atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis [7, 8]. While SAA is likely to promote HSC activation under many circumstances, the induction of cell death after inhibition of NF-\u03baB suggest that SAA can also exert opposite effects. When the underlying liver disease is eradicated and liver injury ceases, activated HSCs are either eliminated by induction of cell death or by deactivation [54\u201357]. Recently, it has been shown that inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation during hepatic fibrogenesis is associated with an increase in HSC cell death and accelerates recovery from experimental liver fibrosis. It is conceivable that SAA may contribute to the increased rate of HSC apoptosis in mice treated with NF-\u03baB inhibitors such as sulfasalazine. Moreover, hepatocytes were not effectively killed by SAA even after NF-\u03baB inhibition, suggesting that abundant SAA production during liver injury and fibrogenesis may contribute to a controlled clearance of activated HSCs thus leading to containment of an excessive wound healing response. In conclusion, our study suggests that SAA represents a novel cytokine-like molecule that may mediate a crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs in the injured liver. Future studies need to define its receptor target and to confirm the potential pro- and antifibrogenic effects of SAA during liver fibrosis induction and resolution for potential therapeutic exploitation."}, "25946186": {"pmid": "25946186", "pmcid": "PMC4422750", "title": "TIPE2 Inhibits Lung Cancer Growth Attributing to Promotion of Apoptosis by Regulating Some Apoptotic Molecules Expression", "abstract": "\nRecent studies found that TIPE2 was involved in cancer development. However, little is known about TIPE2 in lung cancer. Our study aims to clarify the role of TIPE2 in lung carcinogenesis. We examined the expression of TIPE2 in lung squamous cancer (LSC), small cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (AdC) tissues and found that TIPE2 expression was lost in small cell lung cancer, compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. Overexpression of TIPE2 significantly inhibited the growth of lung cancer cell H446 in vitro and even suppressed tumor formation in vivo. Flow cytometry analysis found TIPE2 overexpression promoted apoptosis of H446. In TIPE2 over-expression cells, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax were significantly up-regulated while Bcl-2 was down-regulated. Moreover, coincident results were shown by immunohistochemistry in tumors from nude mice. TIPE2 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, while promoting the phosphorylation of P38, but had no effect on I\u03baB\u03b1 and ERK pathway. Taken together, TIPE2 promoted lung cancer cell apoptosis through affecting apoptosis-related molecules caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2 and Bax, possibly via regulating P38 and Akt pathways, indicating that TIPE2 might be a novel marker for lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.\n", "fulltext": "Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. There are approximately 1000,000 new lung cancer cases and more than 800,000 estimated deaths every year in the world. Despite recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, the 5-year overall survival rate of lung cancer patients is still less than 15%. Therefore, it is an urgent need to reveal the molecular mechanism of lung cancer and find novel candidate biomarkers with potential clinical value, which will facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced protein 8-like 2 (TNFAIP8L2), also known as TIPE2, is a member of the TNFAIP8 family and a newly described negative regulator of both innate and adaptive immunity. It prevents hyper-responsiveness and maintains immune homeostasis via suppressing TLR and TCR function, and its deficiency in mice leads to multi-organ inflammation. Moreover, in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and hepatitis, TIPE2 expression is also down-regulated and inversely correlates with disease progression. However, different from murine TIPE2, which is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, human TIPE2 is also expressed in a wide variety of non-hematopoietic cell types. Human TIPE2 shares approximately 53% identity and 78% similarity amino acid sequence with TNFAIP8, and about 94% homologous with murine TIPE2. Initial studies showed that other members of TIPE family such as TNFAIP8 and TIPE1 play roles in carcinogenesis in most human cancers [9\u201311]. The high-resolution crystal structure of TIPE2 reveals that it contains a large hydrophobic central cavity, which appears to be a DED-like domain differs from caspase-8 or cFLIP. Murine TIPE2 inhibits MAPKs and NF\u03baB signaling pathways which promote Fas-induced apoptosis. Additionally, overexpression of TIPE2 in mice results in cell death and significantly inhibits Ras-induced tumorigenesis. However, TIPE2 is not detectable or poorly expressed in most human carcinoma cell lines. These results suggest that in addition to inflammation, TIPE2 may also be involved in cancer development. Increasing studies have been focused on TIPE2 and human cancers in recent years. TIPE2 suppresses TLR4-mediated development of colon cancer by inhibiting caspase-8 activity, while its expression is positively correlated with TNM staging in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. Recently, TIPE2 is proved to be an endogenous inhibitor of Rac1 in liver by which it suppressed invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of TIPE2 in lung cancer is unclear. In present study, we provide evidences firstly indicate that TIPE2 suppresses the growth and promotes apoptosis of lung cancer through regulating the Bcl-2/Bax balance and then leads to the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 possibly via affecting P38 and Akt pathway. The study was approval by the Institutional Research Ethics Committees of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All specimens were handled and made anonymous according to the ethical and legal standards. All animal procedures in this study were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of Xiamen University. The paraffin-embedded lung cancer specimens were used for immunohistochemical analysis. The paraffin-embedded lung cancer specimens consisted of 25 lung squamous cancer specimens, 20 lung adenocarcinoma specimens, 15 small lung cancer specimens and 30 adjacent non-tumor lung specimens. All the patients recruited in this study received neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy before the surgery. The human NCI-H446 cell lines were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Shanghai, China). The H446 cell was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. Full-length human TIPE2 gene was generated from the cDNA clone by PCR and then cloned into the pRK5 vector by standard molecular techniques and verified by sequencing. Transfection of tumor cells with vector was performed using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To generate stable transfected cell lines, transfected cells were selected in RPMI 1640 medium containing 500 \u03bcg/ml G418 for two weeks to isolate the formed colonies for further expansion. At the end of the transfection, TIPE2 expression was verified by Western Blotting. Paraffin-embedded specimens (4 \u03bcm) were used for analysis as the standard immunohistochemical technique. Briefly, sections were incubated with anti-TIPE2 antibody (Abnova) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Secondary staining was performed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody using a Max Vision kit. Immunoreactivity was visualized using a DAB Peroxidase Substrate kit (Maixin Co, Fuzhou, China) and counterstained with hematoxylin. In negative controls, primary antibodies were replaced by PBS. All IHC staining was independently evaluated by two experienced pathologists in an effort to provide a consensus on staining patterns according to a scoring method, as described previously. At least 10 high-power fields, selected randomly, and >1000 cells were counted for each specimen. Each case was scored according to the intensity and area of staining. The intensity of staining was graded on the following scales: 0, no staining; 1+, mild staining; 2+, moderate staining; 3+, intense staining. The area of staining was evaluated as follows: 0, no staining of cells in any microscopic fields; 1+, <30% of tissue stained positive; 2+, 30\u201360% stained positive; 3+, >60% stained positive. A combined staining score (intensity + extension) of between 0 and 3 was considered to be low expression, whereas a score between 4 and 6 was considered to be high expression. Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer with proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and PMSF (Sigma). Then 30 \u03bcg lysates from each sample was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and probed overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: anti-TIPE2 (dilution, 1:800; Abnova), anti-caspase-3 p17 (dilution, 1:400; Santa Cruz), anti-caspase-9 (dilution, 1:400; Santa Cruz), anti-Bcl-2 (dilution, 1:200; Santa Cruz), anti-Bax (dilution, 1:1000; Santa Cruz), anti-ERK (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-phospho-ERK (dilution, 1:1000; R&D), anti-P38 (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-phospho-P38 (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-Akt (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-phospho-Akt (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 (dilution, 1:1000; CST), anti-phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 (dilution, 1:1000; CST), and anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (dilution, 1:4000; Abcam), then followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti rabbit or mouse IgG, 1:5000; Santa Cruz) for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, the blots were developed using ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and quantitated by densitometry using ImageQuant image analysis system (Storm Optical Scanner). All the experiments were performed independently three times at least. Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 500 cells per well, and replaced the medium every 3 days. Two weeks later, cells were washed by PBS, and fixed with methanol for 15 minutes, then stained with crystal violet. Colonies which consisted of more than 50 cells were counted and calculated as a percentage of that of the control group. The experiment was performed independently three times at least. Cell viability was detected by MTT assay. A total of 3000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates with three triplicate wells. After incubation for 24 hours, 10 \u03bcl MTT (500 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium and cultured for another 4 hours. Then the medium was discarded and 150 \u03bcl dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to dissolve the formation product. At last, the absorbance of each well was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm. Each assay was repeated three times at least. The effect of TIPE2 on cell apoptosis was determined by FITC Annexin V staining followed by flow cytometric analysis. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 1\u00d7 binding buffer (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. 100 \u03bcl of the solution was transferred to a 5 ml culture tube, then 5 \u03bcl FITC Annexin V (BD Biosciences) and 10 \u03bcl PI (BD Biosciences) were added into the tube. After that, the cells were mixed gently and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Finally, 1 ml PBS was added to each tube and samples were analyzed by flow cytometric within 1 hour. All experiments were repeated in triplicate. Six week old male BALB/c nude mice were purchased from Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China) and maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions. 5 \u00d7 106 H446 cells transfected with TIPE2 over-expressing vector (TIPE2 group) in 100 \u03bcl of PBS were injected subcutaneously into right flank while control vector (control group) into left flank of the nude mice, 10 nude mice were used in this experiment. Tumor size was measured every two days and the tumor volume was calculated according to the following formula: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 width \u00d7 0.5. About six weeks later, all the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, then the tumors were removed, weighed, and fixed in formalin for the subsequent analysis. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 13.0 software. The \u03c72 test was used for analysis of TIPE2 expression between lung cancer subtypes and adjacent non-tumor tissues. The student\u2019s t-test was used for comparison among different groups. The differences in tumor growth and weight between two groups of nude mice were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Recent studies already revealed that TIPE2 expression were significantly correlated with some cancers such as RCC and HCC. However, the TIPE2 expression pattern in lung cancer is unclear so far. To assess the relationship of TIPE2 expression and lung cancer tissues, we detected the expression status of TIPE2 in common histological types of lung cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry, including 25 lung adenocarcinoma tissues, 20 lung squamous carcinoma tissues, 15 small cell lung cancer tissues and 30 adjacent non-tumor lung tissues. As shown in (Fig 1A and 1B), in non-tumor lung tissues, TIPE2 strong staining was observed in lung epithelial alveolar cells and bronchial cells. And in bronchial epithelials with squamous metaplasia, TIPE2 still had strong staining (Fig 1C). In lung cancer tissues, TIPE2 showed strong staining in primary lung adenocarcinoma and lymph node metastasis tissue (Fig 1D, 1E and 1F), but exhibited very weak staining in lung squamous cancer and even almost no staining in most of small cell lung cancer (Fig 1G, 1H and 1I). Interestingly, (Fig 1H) showed very weak TIPE2 expression in the nests of lung squamous cancer cells (red arrows) and strong staining of TIPE2 in the adjacent bronchial epithelials simultaneously. In lung cancer stroma, no stain of TIPE2 was found in fibroblasts cells, but strong staining could be found in inflammatory cells such as plasmocytes and macrophagocytes. In positive cancer cells, TIPE2 staining was predominantly found in the cytoplasm but seldom in nuclear. Statistical analysis (Table 1) indicated TIPE2 expression was significantly down-regulated in lung squamous cancer and small cell lung cancer tissues compared to the non-tumor lung tissues, while no difference between lung adenocarcinoma and non-tumor lung tissues. The results demonstrated that TIPE2 was down-regulated in some histological subtypes of lung cancer, which encouraged us to further inquire into the specific role and underlying mechanism of TIPE2 in lung cancer development. To investigate the potential biological function of TIPE2 in lung cancer, we examined the effects of TIPE2 on cell growth of lung cancer cell H446 by MTT assay and colony formation assay, and apoptosis by flow cytometric. To up-regulate TIPE2 expression in H446, TIPE2 over-expressing vector was constructed and transfected stably in H446 cells. Western blotting validated the TIPE2 expression in H446 cells untransfected (H446/Null), control vector-transfected (H446/Control) and TIPE2 over-expressing vector transfected (H446/TIPE2). As shown in (Fig 2A), H446/Null and H446/Control showed almost no TIPE2 expression, while H446/TIPE2 revealed high level of TIPE2 expression. MTT assay (Fig 2B) and colony formation assay (Fig 2C) analysis showed reduction of cell viability and fewer colonies observed in H446/TIPE2 respectively, compared with H446/Control and H446/Null cells, which indicated TIPE2 could inhibit lung cancer cell growth. Cancer cell growth is affected by two main factors including proliferation and apoptosis. It was reported that murine TIPE2 could promote Fas-induced apoptosis. Has TIPE2 potential role on apoptosis of lung cancer? Therefore, we applied flow cytometric to reveal effect of TIPE2 on apoptosis of H446. As shown in (Fig 2D), the early apoptosis rate of H446/TIPE2, H446/Control and H446/Null was 21.08%, 9.21% and 9.15% respectively, which showed over-expressing TIPE2 could significantly increase the apoptosis rate. These results suggested TIPE2 can effectively suppress the growth and promote the apoptosis of H446 cells in vitro. The results above-mentioned showed TIPE2 could promote apoptosis of H446 cells. Then, we were further interested in the underlying mechanism of it. It has been well known that Bcl-2/Bax balance plays an important role in cell apoptosis, so we investigated the effect of TIPE2 expression on Bcl-2/Bax balance. As shown in Fig 3, over-expressing TIPE2 could increase the Bax expression while decrease the Bcl-2 expression, which implied that the function of TIPE2 on cell apoptosis may be associated with Bcl-2/Bax balance. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that caspase plays a critical role in executing the final pathway of apoptosis. We further investigated whether TIPE2 would affected the activation of apoptotic molecular caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-9. Therefore, we detected the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 in H446/Null, H446/Control and H446/TIPE2. As shown in Fig 3, TIPE2 enhanced the cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression levels, which suggested TIPE2 could promote the activation of caspase-3 and capase-9. We also explored the effect of TIPE2 on several signaling pathways by analyzing key signaling molecules involved. We found that P38 and Akt pathway, but not ERK pathway and NF-\u03baB pathway, were targets of TIPE2 action. High level expression of phosphorylated P38 MAPK was detected in H446 cells over-expressing TIPE2, while relatively low level expression in null and control cells (Fig 4), which indicated that TIPE2 may activate P38 MAPK pathway. However, the level of phosphorylated Akt was significantly decreased in H446 cells over-expressing TIPE2 compared to null and control cells (Fig 4). In addition, we also examined the expression of other signal molecules such as phospho-ERK, phospho-MEK, and phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 in H446/Null, H446/Control and H446/TIPE2, among which little or no difference was noted (Fig 4). Taken together, these data indicated that TIPE2 could regulate P38 and Akt pathway, in which TIPE2 was a positive regulator of P38 pathway while negative regulator of Akt pathway. The above-mentioned results showed TIPE2 could effectively suppress the growth and promote the apoptosis of H446 cells in vitro. Next, we investigated its effect on tumorigenesis in vivo. H446 cells transfected with control vector or TIPE2-expressing vector were injected subcutaneously into nude mice to initiate tumor formation. From the curve of tumor growth (Fig 5B), the tumor volume of TIPE2-expression groups were significantly decreased compare to the vector groups. About six weeks later, all groups of nude mice were sacrificed and the tumors were isolated and weighted (Fig 5A). The overall mean tumor size of TIPE2-expression groups was significantly smaller than that of the vector groups, which was consistent with the tumor weights (Fig 5C). All these results demonstrated that overexpression of TIPE2 could inhibit the subcutaneous tumor growth in vivo obviously. As above-mentioned, over-expression of TIPE2 had significant impacts on the expression of some apoptotic molecules in H446 cells in vitro, such as Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9. So, it is necessary to elucidate the effect of TIPE2 on these molecules expression in the tumors from nude mice in vivo. The tumors from nude mice were isolated, fixed, embedded and made into sections, which were then stained by immunohistochemistrical analysis. Results showed overexpression of TIPE2 while a increased expression of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 and a reduced expression of Bcl-2 in TIPE2-overexpression tumors (Fig 6), which were similar to the results in vitro. We also detected the expression of Ki-67, a proliferation marker, in above tumors. No alteration on Ki-67 expression was detected regardless of TIPE2 over-expression (Fig 6), by which we speculated that TIPE2 inhibits tumor growth mainly attributing to its function of promoting apoptosis of H446 cells, but not via affecting proliferation. TIPE2 belongs to TIPE (TNFAIP8) family, which is a recently identified group of proteins including four members, TNFAIP8, TIPE1, TIPE2 and TIPE3. TNFAIP8 is associated with enhanced cell survival and inhibition of apoptosis. Knocking down the expression of TNFAIP8 in tumor cells can reduce their tumorigenicity. All these evidences support that TIPE is an oncogene and it may be linked with the cell survival and malignant growth-related signaling pathways. High level of TIPE1 mRNA is detected in most human carcinoma cell lines, which suggests that it may play a role in carcinogenesis. Unlike TNFAIP8 and TIPE1, TIPE2 was mainly found played a vital role in immunity. As reported, TIPE2 was a novel gene which maintains immune homeostasis and negatively regulates innate and adaptive immunity. However, information about TIPE2 in human cancer is limited. A few studies on the relationship of TIPE2 with cancer already verified TIPE2 had some function in cancer development. In recent research, TIPE2 was thought as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the relationship between TIPE2 and lung cancer is unknown so far. In our present study, we demonstrated the state of TIPE2 expression in lung cancer. We found that TIPE2 expression was down-regulated in lung squamous carcinoma and even almost lost in small cell lung cancer. However, in lung adenocarcinoma, TIPE2 strong expression was found, but no difference between non-tumor lung tissues and lung adenocarcinoma was analyzed. These results showed TIPE2 expression patterns might be different among different histologic subtypes of lung cancer, which suggested TIPE2 might play some different biological roles in different histologic types of lung cancer. To find out TIPE2 expression in all kinds of lung cancer, increaseing the numbers of lung cancer samples in the future study may be necessary. Furthermore, this study preliminarily interpreted the biological function of TIPE2 in lung cancer. Over-expressing TIPE2 promoted apoptosis of H446 cells in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. At the molecular level, TIPE2 regulated Bcl-2/Bax balance and activated caspase-3 and caspase-9. Interested in looking into the specific signal molecules possibly regulated by TIPE2, we then screened the expression of some common signaling molecules after TIPE2 over-expression. High level expression of phosphorylated P38 MAPK was detected after TIPE2 up-regulation. Recent studies have suggested a key role for P38 MAPK in mediating pathways leading to apoptosis and growth inhibitory signals. Additionally, P38 MAPK triggers the activation of caspase-3, 9 and is also necessary for the phosphorylation of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bax, Bim and Bcl-2 in OA-treated cancer cells. Combined with these results, we speculate that TIPE2 promotes lung cancer cell apoptosis through activation of P38 MAPK, which triggers the over-expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9. In addition, we also found that TIPE2 decreased the phosphorylated level of Akt. As reported, the Akt pathway is a central signal transduction pathway that regulates many critical aspects of cancer physiology, including cell proliferation, cell morphology, migration and apoptosis. Meanwhile, some apoptosis-related molecules such as Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 are affected distinctly by TIPE2. So, our results provide a lot of evidence that TIPE2 promotes lung cancer apoptosis. Interestingly, we found Ki-67 expression had no alteration after TIPE2 over-expression, which indicated that TIPE2 inhibited lung cancer growth attributing to promotion of cell apoptosis. Taken together, TIPE2 functions as a tumor suppressor to promote lung cancer cell apoptosis. Therefore, the forced expression of human TIPE2 may be a new strategy for treatment of lung cancer."}, "25874935": {"pmid": "25874935", "pmcid": "PMC4395230", "title": "Neuroprotective Effect of Neuroserpin in Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation- and Reoxygenation-Treated Rat Astrocytes In Vitro", "abstract": "\nNeuroserpin (NSP) reportedly exerts neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemic animal models and patients; however, the mechanism of protection is poorly understood. We thus attempted to confirm neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes in the ischemic state and then explored the relative mechanisms. Astrocytes from neonatal rats were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R). To confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP, we measured the cell survival rate, relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release; we also performed morphological methods, namely Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V assay. To explore the potential mechanisms of NSP, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-\u03b1 related to NSP administration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proteins related to the NF-\u03baB, ERK1/2, and PI3K/Akt pathways were investigated by Western blotting. To verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the NF-\u03baB pathway, a NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor sc3060 was employed to observe the effects of NSP-induced neuroprotection. We found that NSP significantly increased the cell survival rate and reduced LDH release in OGD/R-treated astrocytes. It also reduced NO/TNF-\u03b1 release. Western blotting showed that the protein levels of p-IKKB\u03b1/\u03b2 and P65 were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment and such effects were significantly inhibited by NSP administration. The NSP-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor sc3060, whereas, expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2, and p-AKT were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels were unchanged by NSP administration. Our results thus verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP in ischemic astrocytes. The potential mechanisms include inhibition of the release of NO/TNF-\u03b1 and repression of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Our data also indicated that NSP has little influence on the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.\n", "fulltext": "Thrombolysis induced by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an important strategy for treating cerebral ischemia (CI). Nevertheless, alongside playing a role as a thrombolytic agent, tPA triggers neurotoxic effects after stroke, including inflammatory damage, excitotoxicity, and basal lamina degradation by enhancing the activation of microglia and neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated signaling. Neuroserpin (NSP) is an axon-secreted serine protease inhibitor and belongs to the serpins superfamily. It plays a crucial role in cerebral development, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity as an inhibition of tPA. Although mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effects of NSP are poorly understood, it is believed that NSP exerts neuroprotective effects in CI animal models and patients. The neuroprotective role of NSP in cerebral ischemia is well documented. As early as 2000, Yepes et al. first reported that NSP reduces the volume of ischemic lesions and exhibits neuroprotective effects by protecting neurons from ischemic injury. Cinelli et al. later verified these neuroprotective effects in ischemic mice, showing that NSP reduces activation of microglia. Next, Zhang et al. found adjuvant administration of NSP prolonged the therapeutic window for thrombolysis with tPA. Our previous studies indicated that the reduction of fibrinolytic component and the neuroprotective role of NSP may cause the exacerbation of ischemic injury in diabetic rats. Lebeurrier et al. (2005) reported that NSP prevents NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. A later report from the same laboratory showed that NSP plays crucial roles in the CNS, including the adjustment of neuronal migration, plasticity, and cell death. Wu et al. (2010) found that NSP improved ischemic tolerance and decreased the volume of CI lesions in wild-type and tPA-deficient (tPA\u2212/\u2212) neurons and mice. Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al. (2011) demonstrated that NSP had neuroprotective effects in CI patients and OGD-treated mixtures of neurons and astrocytes in rats by attenuating tPA-mediated mechanisms of inflammation and disrupting the blood\u2013brain barrier in an ischemic model in vitro. They also found that a high serum NSP level indicates a better outcome in CI patients. Ma et al. (2012) confirmed a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of NSP in OGD/R rats by inhibiting tPA-mediated acute neuronal excitotoxicity. Moreover, Gelderblom et al. recently reported that an unbalanced expression of NSP and tPA caused a negative outcome in experimental CI, which is believed to be associated with increased microglial activation. These previous clinical and bench studies verified the neuroprotective properties of NSP from different angles, and are helpful in approaching the mechanisms of NSP; however, there have been no studies to date on the effects of NSP on astrocytes in vitro. Astrocytes are the most numerous cells in the central nervous system (CNS). They play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of CNS by the processing, transfer, and storage of information in the nerves. The role of astrocytes in the ischemic state is complex. Astrocytes interact with neurons by cross-talk, and are crucial in maintaining the survival of neurons in the ischemic brain. Abnormal astrocyte function, induced by ischemia, may have remarkable effects on the survival of neurons. Cerebral ischemia triggers astrocyte activation. It is reported that reactive astrocytes contribute to the protection of the ischemic penumbra, modulate the decrease of the infarct volume, and counteract the effects of edema. Another recent study emphasized the important role of astrocytes in maintaining the function and integrity of blood\u2013brain barrier. Because of the abundance of astrocytes, their wide distribution, and important role in ischemic stroke, we speculate that NSP is neuroprotective to astrocytes. A previous study verified the neuroprotective effect of NSP in ischemic cortical cells (mixture of neuron and astrocytes), the effects of NSP on astrocytes alone remain unverified. The present study had two aims. The first was to confirm whether NSP exerts neuroprotective effects on astrocytes in an in vitro ischemic model. The second was to explore the potential mechanisms of NSP in astrocytes. The influence of inflammatory cytokines along with measurement of proteins related to the NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were also investigated. On the basis of the results of a pre-experiment, we used a NF-\u03baB inhibitor, called sc3060, to verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the NF-\u03baB pathway. All the astrocytes were acquired from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats (age < 24 h, Shanghai Institute of the Chinese Academy of Science, China). All animals were treated as per the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Fudan University (authorization No: 072105387). Rats were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight); their cortical hemispheres were separated from the skull and meninges. Then, the tissues were dissociated by 0.125% trypsin digestion for 10 min at 37\u00b0C and gently triturated. The homogenate was placed in 100-mm dishes or 96-well plates at a density of 3\u20135 \u00d7 105 cell/mL and maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Astrocytes were cultured in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 5.5 mM glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), which was replaced every 3 d. At confluence (days 7\u20139), the astrocyte cultures formed a confluent layer of process-bearing glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells (at least 95%). OGD was performed following the processes described in a previous study. Briefly, the original glucose-containing media were removed from all treatment groups and kept aside for future use. Astrocytes were washed three times with deoxygenated glucose-free medium and then incubated in an anaerobic chamber (Model 1025, Forma Scientific, USA) in an atmosphere containing 85% N2, 10% H2, 5% CO2, and <0.1% O2 at 37\u00b0C. In this study, OGD was continued for 12 h. OGD was terminated by removing the cultures from the chamber and reoxygenation was performed by adding the original media and culturing in a normoxic incubator for 0\u201324 h at 37\u00b0C. The control astrocytes were washed and incubated in a normoxic incubator throughout the common normoxic astrocyte culturing medium (blank control). Recombinant human NSP (PeproTech, USA) was diluted with MEM containing 10% FBS 24h before the experiments. NSP was randomly added to the normal astrocyte culturing mediums (100 \u03bcL/well) in a 96-well filter plate (AcroPrep, USA). We adjusted NSP solutions to various concentrations (i.e., 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 ng/mL) and reacted for 1 h, and then subjected to the OGD treatment for 12 h followed by 24 h of reoxygenation (OGD12hR24h). We observed the cell survival rate and relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release of all the OGD12hR24h cells along with a blank control. The cell survival rate was calculated as follows: at the end of culture, 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma-Adrich, USA) was added to each well to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, the medium was removed and 100 \u03bcL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well and kept for 10 min. The plate was read at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Multiscan MK3; Thermo Labsystems USA). The cell survival rate was calculated as the ratio of the cells survived compared to the blank control. LDH release was measured following a classic method. Briefly, the medium (50 \u03bcL) of each group was transferred from the culture well to a 96-well plate and mixed with 50 \u03bcL of reaction using a commercial LDH detecting kit (Sigma, USA). The mixtures were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min, and then 50 \u03bcL of stop solution included in the kit was added to each well. After 30 min, the absorbance was read at 492 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo, USA). The maximum LDH release was measured in each well at the end of each experiment, following repeated freezing and thawing. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate, with each experiment containing eight readings. Results are expressed as a percentage of the maximum LDH release, after subtracting background levels determined from the medium alone. Finally, we selected 5 ng/mL as the appropriate NSP concentration for further experiments (Fig 1A and 1B). We then confirmed the efficacy of 5 ng/mL NSP by measuring the survival rates of cells undergoing 12 h of OGD followed by reoxygenation for various times (i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 h) A standard Hoechst 33342 staining was employed to observe changes in DNA in astrocytes, as described in a previous study. Briefly, the astrocytic monolayer solution (8 mL) was fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (1 h, room temperature). Cells were then stained with 5 \u03bcg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Beyotime, China) for 5 min at room temperature in the dark, and washed three times with PBS for 3 min. The morphological features of apoptosis were observed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX 51, Japan), and at least 500 cells from 10 randomly selected fields per dish were counted. The proportion of apoptotic cells was observed by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioVision, USA), according to a previously described method. Briefly, cells were harvested and resuspended in binding buffer at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL (8 mL). During reoxygenation, cells were simultaneously mixed with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI). After incubation at room temperature for 10 min in the dark, the cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACScan; BD Biosciences, USA) to determine the population positive for annexin V-FITC (FL-1 channel) and/or PI (FL-2 channel). Data were analyzed using the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, USA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to observe the influence of NSP on NO and TNF-\u03b1. We added the NSP into astrocyte solutions (100 \u03bcL) and adjusted the concentration of the NSP solution to 5 ng/mL, and after 1 h of reaction, the cells were treated with OGD12h followed by 12 or 24 h of reoxygenation. The blank control group was not subjected to the OGD/R treatment. Then, NO and TNF-\u03b1 were measured using the NO ELISA kit and TNF-\u03b1 ELISA kit (ADL, USA), respectively, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Nitric oxide was measured as described in a previous study. In brief, we made a standard curve to detect concentrations between 1 and 100 \u03bcM of nitrite per well. Next, 100 \u03bcL astrocyte solutions were centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 2 min, and the clarified supernatant recovered. Ice-cold (5%) metaphosphoric acid (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) was mixed with clarified samples in a ratio of 1:1 (v: v) (mixing and spinning at 10,000 g for 5 min). Supernatants along with standards were exposed to nitrate reductase for 1 h at room temperature (23\u00b0C) to transform nitrate to nitrite. By using the enhancer, Griess reaction reagents were applied to convert nitrite to a purple azo-cromophore compound. Optical density was measured using a microplate reader (Multiscan MK3; Thermo Labsystems, USA) at 450 nm with a wavelength correction at 570 nm. Classic Western blotting analysis was performed to clarify the potential effect of NSP on the NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways. We added the NSP into astrocyte solutions (100 \u03bcL) and adjusted the concentration of the NSP solution to 5 ng/mL, the cells for the NF-\u03baB pathway were divided into two group. One group was only treated with NSP, and the other group was treated with NSP and the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, sc3060 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) (75 ug/mL) and after 1 h of reaction, the cells were treated with OGD12 h followed by 24 h of reoxygenation. The blank control group was not subjected to the OGD/R treatment. After OGD/R, the cells were subjected to Western blotting analysis. Cells were scraped into lysis buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 10 mM KCl; 0.1 mM EDTA; 0.1 mM EGTA; 1 mM DTT; 1 mM PMSF; 1 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin; and 1 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin) and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and used as the cytosolic fractions, whereas pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 400 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 10% glycerol; 1 mM DTT; 1 mM PMSF; 1 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin; and 1 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin) on ice for 30 min. These lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 min, and supernatants were collected and used the nuclear fractions. Protein concentrations in the resultant supernatants were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Manufacturing, USA) and samples containing equal amounts of protein (30 \u03bcg) were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the membranes were incubated in 4% milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 12 h at 4\u00b0C with antibodies (diluted 1:500) against NF-\u03baB p65, phospho-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (p- IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, CST, USA), phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2, CST Co, USA), total-ERK1/2 (t-ERK1/2, Kangchen, China), phospho-AKT (p-AKT, CST Co., USA), total-AKT (t-AKT, Santa Cruz, USA), \u03b2-actin (Abcam, USA), and histone H3 (Santa Cruz, USA). The proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit or antimouse secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and after exposure to a film, they were visualized using chemiluminescence reagents provided with the ECL kit. Densitometry was performed as the index of quantitative analysis using the Quantity One software (BioRad Laboratories, USA). All experiments were repeated at least three times in separate cell preparations and the average data were calculated. Data were recorded as the mean \u00b1 standard error and were analyzed using the SPSS 13.0.0 software (SPSS, USA). Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc correction was used for multiple comparisons. The variables included the NSP dose (Fig 1A and 1B), time of reoxygenation (Fig 1C), reoxygenation time and NSP dose (Figs 2A2 and 3), NSP dose and OGD (Figs 4B and 4C and 5B and 5C). The type I error in ANOVA was accepted as P < 0.05. All the tests were two-sided. Fig 1 shows the protective effects of NSP on the astrocytes treated by OGD/R. The survival rate of the cells was significantly reduced after OGD12hR24h (NSP 0 ng/mL vs. blank control); however, the administration of NSP significantly increased the survival rate. The maximum effect was observed with 5 ng/mL of NSP, but no further improvements were observed at a dose over 5 ng/mL (Fig 1A). The relative LDH release of the cells significantly increased after OGD12hR24h (NSP 0 ng/mL vs. blank control); however, the administration of NSP significantly decreased the LDH release. The maximum effect was observed with 5 ng/mL of NSP, but no further improvements were observed at a dose over 5 ng/mL NSP (Fig 1B). Thus, we selected 5 ng/mL as the administration dose for further experiments. We also found that 5 ng/mL of NSP improved the cell survival rate in the cells treated by OGD12h followed by different times of reoxygenation (4\u201324 h, Fig 1C). Fig 2 shows the protective effects of NSP by morphological methods. Fig 2A shows the results of DNA staining (Hoechst 33342 staining). By comparing the number of pyknotic changes between the non-NSP group and NSP group, it is obvious that NSP administration inhibited the changes induced by OGD/R (Fig 2A1). The results of quantitative counting are shown in Fig 2A2. Fig 2B shows the results of the Annexin V assay. The apoptotic cells increased by OGD/R treatments (OGD12h24h vs. blank control, right lower quadrant), whereas NSP administration exerted an inhibitory effect against ischemia-induced apoptosis (OGD12h24h vs. OGD12h24h + NSP, Fig 2B1). Fig 2B2 shows the results of quantitative cell counting. The potential mechanisms of neuroprotection were investigated by measuring the release of NO and TNF-\u03b1 and the proteins related to the NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt pathways. Fig 3 shows that NSP inhibited the release of NO (Fig 3A) and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig 3B). Inhibition of NO and TNF-\u03b1 may play a role in the mechanism of NSP neuroprotection. Fig 4 shows the results of the morphological studies and Western blotting analysis used to assess the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, including expression of p-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and p65. We observed typical star-shaped astrocytes with synapses enwrapped in a slice of blank control, but the typical astrocytes disappeared after OGD 12 h and R24 h. Administration of NSP was neuroprotective, as we observed characteristic star-shaped astrocytes in the slice, but these neuroprotective effects could be reversed by administration of the NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor, sc3060. For the cytosolic fractions, the expression of p-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 was significantly enhanced by the OGD12hR24h treatment and was recovered after the administration of NSP. The recovery induced by NSP could be reversed by administration of the NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor, sc3060 (Fig 4B and 4C). For the nuclear fractions, the expression of nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 was upregulated by the OGD12hR24h treatment, whereas it reduced significantly after the administration of NSP. The reduction induced by NSP could be reversed by administration of sc3060 (Fig 4B and 4D). These results indicated that inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway may play a role in the mechanism of NSP neuroprotection. Fig 5 shows that, although the OGD12hR24h treatment upregulated the expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2 (Fig 5A and 5B), and p-Akt (Fig 5A and 5C), interestingly, the administration of NSP did not invert that trend, which indicated that NSP has little influence on the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Thrombolysis with tPA is the most common therapy for treating CI, despite tPA administration being a double-edged sword. In this regard, a deeper insight into the tPA inhibitor NSP, which plays a crucial role in tPA regulation, is particularly important. Although the neuroprotection of NSP on cerebral ischemia is well documented, the present study aimed to confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP on ischemic astrocytes in vitro and attempted to explore the related mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the mechanisms of the effects of NSP on astrocytes. Early in 1999, Docaqne et al. reported that NSP is expressed in both neurons and astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells in CNS). Our findings verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes i.e., NSP administration significantly reduced the release of LDH (Fig 1B) in OGD/R-treated astrocytes. In addition, the cell survival rate (Fig 1A) along with the morphological evidences (Figs 2 and 4A) confirmed the neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes. These findings are in agreement with the results of Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al.. In that study, they found that OGD treatment caused morphological alterations and increased cell death in these cells, whereas the administration of NSP could reverse these changes. The results of our present study are different on two accounts. First, their study, which involved a mixture of neurons and astrocytes, did not focus on the mechanisms underlying the effect of NSP on astrocytes. Second, they used the OGD process, whereas in this study, we used the OGD/R process in order to mimic the ischemic state of astrocytes. All of our evidence proved that NSP is neuroprotective to astrocytes under ischemic conditions. The mechanism of NSP neuroprotection is complicated. Previous studies concerning NSP focused on its effects in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease [25,30\u201332], and most of the mechanisms were discussed with regard to its neuroprotective effects in NMDA-induced cell death and microglia. Previous studies have suggested that NSP may regulate the growth and maturation of neurons via a noninhibitory mechanism. In the present study, once the protective efficacy was verified, we explored other potential neuroprotective mechanisms. The first finding was that NSP could inhibit the release of NO and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig 3). Oxidative and inflammatory pathways have been proven to play roles in the injuries induced by OGD/R exposure. The release of NO and TNF-\u03b1 can be used as a simple biomarker in the future. The second finding was that NSP administration considerably reduced the overactive expression of p-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and P65 in OGD/R astrocytes (Fig 4B and 4D). The protection induced by NSP could be significantly reversed by sc3060, a NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor. We first reported that blocking the NF-\u03baB pathway deteriorates the morphological appearance of astrocytes ameliorated by NSP (Fig 4A), and reverses the downregulation of p-IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and P65 expression induced by NSP (Fig 4B and 4D). These data suggest the critical role of the NF-\u03baB pathway in NSP-induced neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia. The NF-\u03baB pathway acts as an important transcription factor and regulator of genes that control cell proliferation and survival. It is regarded as the center of various cellular responses, including immune and inflammatory reactions, and is generally considered as a \u201cprototypical proinflammatory\u201d signaling pathway on the basis of the activation of NF-\u03baB by proinflammatory cytokines. The roles of the NF-\u03baB pathway under ischemic conditions are dual, and the interaction between the NF-\u03baB pathway and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 is complicated. Nijboer et al. reported that early NF-\u03baB activation is neurotoxic, whereas the late NF-\u03baB pathway is neuroprotective. Inhibition of the early NF-\u03baB pathway is neuroprotective only if the late NF-\u03baB pathway is maintained. It is believed that TNF-\u03b1 can directly activate the NF-\u03baB pathway, and such activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway may generate NO by stimulation of the expression of nitric oxide synthase. The interaction between NSP and the NF-\u03baB pathway is poorly understood. It is believed that NF-\u03baB may be activated by the accumulation of NSP polymers within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Chronic activation of NF-\u03baB may cause cell death, resulting in the accumulation of NSP and causing dementia. On the basis of the above evidence, we speculate that a potential explanation of our findings is that in the early stage of ischemic/hypoxic injury to astrocytes (OGD12h), administration of NSP inhibits the release of TNF-\u03b1, which causes less activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway and consequent reduction in the release of NO (Fig 6). This should be verified in our next experiments. One limitation of this study is that we did not measure the changes in NO after administrating sc3060. However, astrocyte morphology (Fig 4A) provides evidence that NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor can reverse the efficacy of NSP. Another limitation is that we did not have a control condition, i.e. only with OGD, in all our experiments. We aim to do this in future experiments. Moreover, we also found that the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were activated by the OGR/R treatment (Fig 5), which was in accordance with a previous study. However, our data showed that NSP has only little influence on these pathways. Additional studies are warranted to clarify the interactions between these complicated pathways and NSP. In conclusion, NSP exerts neuroprotective effects in OGD/R-treated astrocytes, and these potential neuroprotective mechanisms may lie in the inhibition of release of TNF-\u03b1 and NO, along with inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway. In addition, NSP has little influence on the MAPK and P13K/Akt pathways."}, "25054547": {"pmid": "25054547", "pmcid": "PMC4108472", "title": "Characterization of a Novel BCHE \u201cSilent\u201d Allele: Point Mutation (p.Val204Asp) Causes Loss of Activity and Prolonged Apnea with Suxamethonium", "abstract": "\nButyrylcholinesterase deficiency is characterized by prolonged apnea after the use of muscle relaxants (suxamethonium or mivacurium) in patients who have mutations in the BCHE gene. Here, we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant (c.695T>A, p.Val204Asp). Inhibition studies, kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation disrupts the catalytic triad and determines a \u201csilent\u201d phenotype. Low activity of patient plasma butyrylcholinesterase with butyrylthiocholine (BTC) and benzoylcholine, and values of dibucaine and fluoride numbers fit with heterozygous atypical silent genotype. Electrophoretic analysis of plasma BChE of the proband and his mother showed that patient has a reduced amount of tetrameric enzyme in plasma and that minor fast-moving BChE components: monomer, dimer, and monomer-albumin conjugate are missing. Kinetic analysis showed that the p.Val204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr BChE displays a pure Michaelian behavior with BTC as the substrate. Both catalytic parameters Km\u200a=\u200a265 \u00b5M for BTC, two times higher than that of the atypical enzyme, and a low Vmax are consistent with the absence of activity against suxamethonium. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations showed that the overall effect of the mutation p.Val204Asp is disruption of hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441, leading Ser198 and His438 to move away from each other with subsequent disruption of the catalytic triad functionality regardless of the type of substrate. MD also showed that the enzyme volume is increased, suggesting a pre-denaturation state. This fits with the reduced concentration of p.Ala204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr tetrameric enzyme in the plasma and non-detectable fast moving-bands on electrophoresis gels.\n", "fulltext": "Butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8; BChE) also known as pseudocholinesterase, is the sister enzyme of acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7; AChE). It is present in most tissues and in human plasma at a concentration about 50 nM. Though BChE lacks obvious physiological functions, it is of toxicological and pharmacological importance in detoxifying or catabolising ester-containing drugs. Furthermore, individuals deficient in BChE appear asymptomatic, apart from a heightened sensitivity to the muscle relaxants suxamethonium and mivacurium, two BChE substrates used as myorelaxant. In patients with usual BChE levels, these drugs are rapidly hydrolysed in plasma and their duration of action is short (<10 min). BChE deficiency results in slower hydrolysis of these drugs and, consequently, a prolonged neuromuscular block, leading to apnea. Prolonged neuromuscular block occurs with BChE deficiencies of marked severity (impairment >70%). Although many acquired conditions may affect BChE activity (liver or renal diseases, malnutrition, pregnancy, malignancy), BChE deficiency is mainly due to mutations in the BCHE gene (MIM 177400). Prolonged apnea following injection of succinylcholine was first described in 1953. The genetic variation of BChE deficiency was described by Kalow and Genest in 1957 and is said to be a cornerstone in pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics. The human BCHE gene is located on chromosome 3q26.1, contains 3 coding exons, and spans approximately 64 kb. Genetically inherited BChE deficiency shows autosomal recessive inheritance. It has been estimated that almost 24% of the human population carries at least one variant BCHE allele. Currently, close to 70 natural mutations have been documented in human BCHE. Most of them have an adverse effect on BChE activity. This may occur either by deleterious effects of point mutations on catalytic functioning, or by point mutations that affect protein expression, which may result in an absence of BChE altogether. Although the majority of these mutations are rare, two of them, the atypical variant (c.293A>G, p.Asp70Gly, rs1799807) and the K-variant (c.1699G>A, p.Ala539Tyr, rs1803274), are relatively common, homozygotes occurring at 1\u22363,000 and 1\u2236100 in the Caucasian population respectively. Here we report a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after administration of suxamethonium leading to the discovery of a novel BCHE variant. DNA sequencing showed that this variant results from a point mutation c.695T>A (p.Val204Asp). Inhibition studies, kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics were undertaken to understand how this mutation determines the \u201csilent\u201d phenotype. The patient is a one-month old infant boy (subject II-1), who presented a prolonged neuromuscular block (16 hours) after administration of a single dose of succinylcholine (2 mg/kg) for pyloric stenosis surgery. His parents have no medical or surgical history. Biological investigations mentioned below were performed on plasma from the patient and his parents. The parents signed an informed consent to participate in the genetic study, which was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the Begin Military Teaching Hospital. Three reference plasma samples of phenotype UU, UA and AS (DNA sequence for the silent BChE unknown) from O. Lockridge\u2019s plasma sample collection were used for control of catalytic and inhibition properties and electrophoresis of plasma BChE samples. Butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTC), Benzoylcholine chloride (BzCh) and dibucaine chloride were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, Missouri, United States of America). Succinyldithiocholine was custom synthesized by Molecular Probes Inc. Other chemicals were of biochemical grade. Total plasma BChE activity was measured with butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTC) as substrate on a Cobas\u00ae 6000 system (Roche Diagnostics) according to the method described by the manufacturer ([BTC]\u200a=\u200a7.56 mM at pH\u200a=\u200a7.7 and 37\u00b0C). Under these conditions the reference interval for BChE activity in healthy individuals was 5,320\u201312,920 IU/L for men, 4,260\u201311,250 IU/L for women under 39-years, and 2,260\u20136,460 IU/L for infants. Activity of BChE in plasma or serum was also measured in the laboratory using a single beam spectrophotometer. Two substrates were used: BTC and BzCh. Activity with BTC was determined using Ellman\u2019s method in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at 25\u00b0C. Plasma samples (10 \u00b5L) were preincubated for 5 min with the chromogenic reagent 20 mM DTNB (50 \u00b5L) in 1,275 \u00b5L of the buffer solution prior to assay to neutralize plasma-containing free thiol compounds (under these conditions, free-thiol-containing molecules present in plasma samples were neutralized in less that 3 min). After adding 1 mM BTC, assays were recorded at 412 nm taking \u03b5412\u200a=\u200a16,360 M\u22121 cm\u22121. Activity with BzCh was determined according to Kalow and Genest by recording decrease in absorbance at 240 nm (\u0394\u03b5\u200a=\u200a6,700 M\u22121.cm\u22121) of 50 \u00b5M BzCh in 67 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 25\u00b0C. For both assays, one unit (U) of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes one \u00b5mol of substrate per minute. Blood samples were collected from the patient and his parents. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes with use of the QIAamp Blood-DNA mini reagent set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA was eluted in 100 \u00b5L of water in the final step and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until required. Sequencing of the coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of the BCHE gene was performed after PCR amplification of genomic DNA, with specific primers (Table 1). All of the coding exons and the flanking introns of the BCHE gene were amplified by PCR using the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95\u00b0C for 10 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 56\u00b0C for 30 s, and an extension at 72\u00b0C for 40 s; 1 cycle of 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The reaction mixture of final volume 25 \u00b5L contained 100 ng DNA template, 1\u00d7PCR Buffer (Invitrogen), 2.0 mmol MgCl2, 0.2 mmol dNTP, 1 \u00b5mol of each primer, and 0,625 U Taq Gold DNA polymerase. PCR products were purified with use of the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Both strands were sequenced using amplification primers as sequencing primers and BigDyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Beckman Coulter). Purified sequencing fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis and detected by laser-induced fluorescence on a Beckman Ceq 8000 (Beckman Coulter). Polyphen and Mutation Taster were used to perform in silico prediction of the impact of nucleotide changes on the protein structure and function. Inhibition numbers (i.e. the dibucaine number and the fluoride number) for plasma BChE samples were determined according to classical procedures using BzCh as the substrate in 67 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 25\u00b0C. An inhibition number is defined as the percentage of inhibition of hydrolysis of 50 \u00b5M BzCh by a fixed concentration of inhibitor. The dibucaine number (DN) was determined using 10 \u00b5M dibucaine according to Kalow and Genest. The fluoride number (FN) was determined using 50 \u00b5M sodium fluoride according to Harris and Whittaker. Catalytic parameters for hydrolysis of BTC were determined in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at 25\u00b0C. Measurements were performed using Ellman\u2019s method. Hydrolysis rates were recorded for 2 min after preincubation of plasma samples in the presence of DTNB as mentioned above. Wide ranges of substrate concentrations were used: from 10 \u00b5M to 50 mM for BTC. Spontaneous hydrolysis of substrates was recorded and subtracted for each enzymatic measurement at corresponding substrate concentrations. BChE catalyzed-hydrolysis of substrates can be described by the model (Fig. 1) and by Eq 1:(1) At low substrate concentration, hydrolysis kinetics for all substrates follow the simple boxed reaction scheme that corresponds to the simple Michaelis-Menten mechanism in which the Michaelis constant, Km, is described by Eq 2:(2)with Ks\u200a=\u200ak-1/k1, the dissociation of the ES complex, k2 and k3 the rate constant for acylation (EA) and deacylation, respectively. The catalytic constant kcat is:(3)with Vmax, the maximum velocity, and [E], the enzyme active site concentration. At high concentration, for positively charged substrates like BTC a second substrate molecule binds to the peripheral anionic site (PAS, p) of wild-type enzyme (Usual): SpE, and the ternary complex SPES makes products. Kss is the dissociation constant of this ternary complex. As a consequence, the kinetics deviate from the Michaelian model; there is either activation by excess substrate, e.g. with BTC, or inhibition by excess substrate, e.g. with BzCh. In Eq 1, the b factor refers to the effect of the second substrate molecule on the kcat. If b>1, there is activation; if b<1, there is inhibition. If there is no binding on the PAS, b\u200a=\u200a1, and Eq 1 reduces to the simple Michaelis-Menten equation. Catalytic parameters were determined by non-linear fitting of substrate-dependent hydrolysis rate curves. Because BChE has a non-Michaelian behavior with BTC as substrate, Eq 1 was used to describe hydrolysis of BTC. On the other hand, owing to the structure of SCdTC which contains 2 thiocholine groups (one binds on the catalytic active center and the other binds to the PAS) the catalytic behavior is Michaelian, and Eq 1 reduces to Eq 3. Nondenaturing gradient gel (4\u201330%) electrophoresis of plasma samples (5 \u00b5L/lane) was carried out as described. BChE active bands were stained using the methods of Karnovsky and Roots with BTC as the substrate as described elsewhere. BChE was immunopurified from 0.5 ml plasma by binding to monoclonal mAb2 immobilized on Sepharose 4B. Activity assays showed that 97% of the BChE activity had disappeared from plasma following overnight incubation with mAb2-Sepharose. Beads (0.04 mL) were washed with phosphate buffered saline, and desalted by washing with water. Beads were transferred to 0.45 \u00b5m Durapore centrifugal filters. BChE protein was released from the beads with 80 \u00b5L of 0.4 M acetic acid pH 2.6. The filtered acid extract was dried in a vacuum centrifuge, dissolved in 35 \u00b5L of SDS/dithiothreitol loading buffer, heated in a boiling water bath for 3 min and loaded on an SDS gel. Denaturing gel electrophoresis in SDS in the presence of dithiothreitol was carried out according to Laemli on 4\u201330% gradient polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Model structures for wild type (usual BChE) and p.Val204Asp mutant were prepared from the X-ray coordinates of PDB ID 1P0I as described in our previous studies,. For p.Val204Asp mutant of BChE, the Val204 side chain was manually converted to aspartic acid and its side chain was minimized with other protein atoms fixed. Minimization and MD simulations were performed with the NAMD 2.9 program and the CHARMM36 force field on the Lomonosov Moscow State University supercomputer. After solvation and addition of ions, protein structures were saturated with water molecules and water box equilibrating runs were performed as described in. This was followed by a full dynamic simulation of each system performed for 100 ns under periodic boundary conditions at a constant temperature of 298 K and constant pressure 1 atm. Structural analysis of the obtained MD trajectories was performed with ProDy and VMD software packages. The crystal structure of human BChE was described in 2003. The active, or acylation site (Ser198\u2026His438\u2026Glu325 triad) lies near the base of a gorge, approximately 20 \u00c5 from the surface. An adjacent site, the choline-binding site, also called the anionic site (Trp82\u2026Tyr128\u2026Phe329), is responsible for binding the choline moiety of the substrate, and positioning the ester bond for nucleophilic attack by the serine of the active site. Two additional structures, also located near the base of the gorge, are the oxyanion hole (Gly116\u2026Gly117\u2026Ala199) and the acyl pocket (Trp231\u2026Leu286\u2026Val288), which stabilize the substrate during hydrolysis. A peripheral anionic site (Asp70\u2026Tyr332) is involved in the initial binding of the substrate and in activation control. Various mutations affect BChE activity. In some cases, residues involved in the catalytic process are mutated: e.g. Ser198 of the active site, Tyr128 of the choline binding site, or Asp70 of the peripheral site. The first two mutations result in a silent enzyme, while the last one causes a reduction in substrate affinity and an abolition of substrate activation. Other mutated residues fall within conserved sequences or motifs that are distant from the active site. Here we report a novel BCHE variant in a patient presenting a marked deficiency in BChE activity (|BChE|\u200a=\u200a1,270 IU/L) (Fig. 2). Sequencing of the whole coding region of BCHE revealed that this patient harbored three point mutations in a compound heterozygous state. One was the well-known atypical variant (c.293A>G, p.Asp70Gly). The second one was the Kalow-variant (c.1699G>A, p.Ala539Thr). The last one, which was not previously described nor was included in any mutation databases, introduced a mis-sense mutation at amino acid residue 204 (c.695T>A, p.Val204Asp, GenBank Accession #KJ513459) (Fig. 2). It involves a residue highly conserved across species (Table 2). In silico predictions identified this mutation as potentially deleterious: i.e. PolyPhen-2 score of 1.0 (sensitivity: 0.00, specificity: 1.00), and Mutation Taster score of 152. This mutation was observed in the patient\u2019s father (patient I-1) at heterozygous state, whereas the mother (patient I-2) was compound heterozygote for the atypical variant and the Kalow variant. Mutations near residue Val204 have previously been described: p.Ala199Val, p.Ala201Thr and p.Ser203Pro. These mutations result in a silent enzyme. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations determine the silent phenotype were not established. In the present work kinetic analysis, inhibition studies and molecular dynamics studies have led to an understanding of how mutation p.Val204Asp disrupts the catalytic triad and determines the \u201csilent\u201d phenotype. Results of phenotyping are in Table 3. Results are consistent with reported values of activity, DN and FN for heterozygous human BChE of genotype Silent (p.Val204Asp)/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr (Proband), Silent (p.Val204Asp)/Usual (father) and Usual/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr (mother). Hydrolysis kinetics of BTC were performed under steady-state conditions. The catalytic behavior of the patient\u2019s BChE (p.Val204Asp/p.Asp70Gly-p.Ala539Thr) follows the Michaelis-Menten model (boxed reactions in Scheme 1). Km was about 10 times higher than that of the Usual enzyme (18\u00b15 \u00b5M) and two times that of the atypical enzyme (150\u00b150 \u00b5M) (Control #2 in Table 4). The catalytic behavior of the parent\u2019s BChE fits with expected values for heterozygous enzyme tetramers containing half of usual (U) subunits. The low Kss of the patient\u2019s mother can be explained by the reduced affinity of BTC for the PAS in K-subunits (Kss value of K-BChE was reported to be two-fold lower than Kss of the usual enzyme). According to Eq 1, the two-fold reduced Kss did not significantly affect kinetic measurements at BTC concentrations lower than 10 mM, i.e. performed at 1mM and 7.56 mM. Kinetic analysis of the patient\u2019s BChE with BTC as the substrate showed that there was no substrate activation (b\u200a=\u200a1), see Individual II-1 in Table 4. This fact indicates that the PAS is not functional in p.Val204Asp subunits or that subunits carrying the p.Val204Asp mutation are totally inactive at all BTC concentrations. Because the tetrameric enzyme is a hybrid of silent subunits carrying the mutation p.Val204Asp and subunits carrying the two mutations p.Gly70Asp and p.Ala539Thr, Vmax was expected to be reduced compared to parent\u2019s BChE (I-1, I-2) and control BChEs (#1,2). However, Vmax in the patient\u2019s BChE was unexpectedly low (Tables 3 and 4). This result, was corroborated by electrophoresis data on both activity stained gels and Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels of highly purified BChE (Figs. 3 and 4), which indicated that the concentration of BChE in the patient\u2019s plasma is lower than the average BChE concentration of 50 nM. This suggests that mutation p.Val204Asp may either reduce the biosynthesis of enzyme or more likely destabilizes the enzyme and accelerates its clearance from the bloodstream. If the latter possibility is correct this would suggest that mutation p.Val204Asp alters the 3D structure of silent subunits. The MD study on p.Val204Asp mutant protein sheds light on this issue. An additional cause for the low enzyme concentration could be the p.Ala539Thr mutation. Residue Ala539 is involved in the tetramerization domain of BChE. Mutation p.Ala539Thr (K variant) was found to destabilize the enzyme structure. Therefore the presence of the K variant in subunits carrying the p.Asp70Gly mutation may have also contributed to the low enzyme concentration in the patient\u2019s plasma. Comparison of MD trajectories for usual BChE and p.Val204Asp mutant showed that in the mutant, shortly after the beginning of simulation, the catalytic triad is disrupted. The side chains of Ser198 and His438 move too far from each other to perform catalysis. By contrast, the catalytic triadstays operative during the whole MD trajectory for usual BChE. In usual BChE these catalytic residues are maintained in close proximity by a network of hydrogen bonds involving Gln223, Glu441 and Asn322, which bring the \u03b1/\u03b2-unit turn carrying the catalytic Ser198 close to the loop carrying the catalytic His438 (Fig. 5). Introduction of a charged amino acid instead of Val204 results in establishment of new hydrogen bonds and disruption of the initial bonds. Asp204 forms a hydrogen bond with Gly196. This causes Gly196 to turn about 90\u00b0 out of the \u03b2-sheet plane (Fig. 6). As a result the Gly196 oxygen backbone forms a hydrogen bond with the Gln223 side chain, instead of with backbone peptide bonds, as for \u03b2-sheet strands in usual BChE (Fig. 5). In addition to partial disruption of the \u03b2-sheet, this switches hydrogen bonding of the Gln223 side chain from Glu441 to Trp471. In the usual BChE the hydrogen bond between Gln223 and Glu441 links together the \u03b2-sheet and the loop carrying the catalytic His438. For Glu441 new hydrogen bonds are formed in the mutant: 3 hydrogen bonds with peptide bond groups of neighboring residues on the His438 loop (Fig. 6). However, Glu441 still interacts with the Asn322 side chain, as in usual BChE. This likely prevents the protein from unfolding. In other words, the overall effect of the mutation p.Val240Asp is disruption of hydrogen bonding between Gln223 and Glu441. This leads the catalytic Ser198 to move away from the loop carrying the catalytic His438 with subsequent disruption of the functional catalytic triad. Therefore, BChE subunits carrying this mutation have no activity regardless of the type of substrate. This mutation also has an impact on the overall protein structure and causes an increase in the radius of gyration along the MD trajectory of p.Val204Asp BChE compared to the usual BChE (Fig. 7). However it does not cause any significant secondary structure change except for that mentioned above (result not shown). The increased gyration radius suggests that the enzyme is in a pre-molten globule state, susceptible to unfolding. This statement would thus explain why the BChE concentration is reduced in plasma. In conclusion, this work explains how a point mutation (Val204Asp) far from the active site leads to a \u201csilent\u201d BChE phenotype where the BChE enzyme has no activity regardless of the type of substrate, and has a structure that is not recognized by a monoclonal to native BChE. MD simulations suggest that the enzyme is in a pre-denaturation state."}, "25006961": {"pmid": "25006961", "pmcid": "PMC4090211", "title": "Absence of PKC-Alpha Attenuates Lithium-Induced Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus", "abstract": "\nLithium, an effective antipsychotic, induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in \u223c40% of patients. The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter (UT-A1) and water channel (AQP2) expression in the inner medulla. Targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as PKC-mediated signaling, may be an effective method of treating lithium-induced polyuria. PKC-alpha null mice (PKC\u03b1 KO) and strain-matched wild type (WT) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3 or 5 days. WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKC\u03b1 KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration. Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice; however, AQP2 was unchanged in PKC\u03b1 KO. Similar results were observed with UT-A1 expression. Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks. Lithium-treated WT mice had 19-fold increased urine output whereas treated PKC\u03b1 KO animals had a 4-fold increase in output. AQP2 and UT-A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium-treated WT animals whereas in treated PKC\u03b1 KO mice, AQP2 was only reduced by 2-fold and UT-A1 expression was unaffected. Urinary sodium, potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium-fed WT but not in lithium-fed PKC\u03b1 KO mice. Our data show that ablation of PKC\u03b1 preserves AQP2 and UT-A1 protein expression and localization in lithium-induced NDI, and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy.\n", "fulltext": "Although lithium is an older antipsychotic, it still remains the most common treatment for bipolar disorder. Lithium also has beneficial effects in multiple other CNS disorders including stroke, multiple sclerosis, HIV-associated neurotoxicity and Huntington disease. Although lithium is effective at treating these and other CNS disorders, the drug is also known to be associated with renal, neurological and endocrine side effects. One of the renal side effects associated with lithium therapy is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) which presents in approximately 40% of patients,. Affected patients present with polyuria, polydipsia, reduced capacity to produce concentrated urine and an inability to respond to vasopressin,. The advancing polyuria associated with lithium-acquired NDI may appear early in the treatment regimen and can be considered a contraindication to continued use. In many cases with chronic use, lithium-induced NDI cannot be reversed thus discontinuing therapy after a certain point may not be advantageous in reducing this side effect. Ensuing NDI is particularly problematic as the risk for acute renal failure is significantly elevated due to increased circumstance for acute lithium toxicity and/or dehydration from severe polydipsia/polyuria. Although not all of the signaling mechanisms underlying lithium-induced NDI have been elucidated, acute administration of lithium inhibits the formation of cAMP\u2013. Cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of two critical transporters in the urine concentration mechanism, aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and the urea transporter, UT-A1, is required for translocation and insertion of these transporters into the apical plasma membrane of the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD),. This initial dysregulation of vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption contributes to the urine-concentrating defect; however, long-term lithium treatment decreases the protein abundance AQP2 and UT-A1 exacerbating the effect. Although lithium-dampened cAMP production is likely the primary cause of NDI, lithium dysregulation of renal prostaglandins, altered purinergic signaling and modifications of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway\u2013 have also been implicated. To prevent advancing renal side effects resulting from lithium therapy, physicians may have to remove the patient from treatment regardless of its effectiveness on psychotic episodes. With the increasing popularity of lithium for treatment of other CNS disorders, there is an increased need to alleviate potential renal side effects that may result in early termination of an otherwise effective treatment. Recent studies revealing cAMP-independent pathways that regulate urine concentration,, indicate that targeting regulatory proteins in these signaling cascades may provide novel pharmacological targets to treat vasopressin insensitive NDI. Recently, PKC\u03b1, a kinase involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling, has been shown to regulate AQP2 and UT-A1 function independently from cAMP\u2013. We explored the idea that in the absence of PKC\u03b1, the severity of lithium-mediated NDI would be affected using a PKC\u03b1 null mouse model with the ultimate goal of identifying a potential therapeutic site for prevention of this renal side effect of lithium therapy. The findings of our study show that ablation of PKC\u03b1 significantly offsets lithium-induced NDI in part by preserving the transporters involved in the urine concentration mechanism. All animal protocols were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. PKC\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were initially obtained from Dr. Jeffery Molkentin (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center). The mice were bred in parallel with wild-type mice from a mixed C57BL/6 x 129 genetic background (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Each three to four generations PKC\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 and PKC\u03b1+/+ were crossed to generate heterozygotes, which were then bred to produce wild-type (WT) and PKC\u03b1-null (PKC\u03b1 KO) litermates, which were then bred separately. All mice were male, ranged between 7\u20139 weeks of age and between 23-25 grams at the beginning of lithium treatment. For short-term lithium treatment, PKC\u03b1 KO and WT mice were injected intraperitoneally with 40 mmol/kg LiCl in saline every 24 hours for 3 or 5 days. For long-term treatment studies, PKC\u03b1 KO and WT mice were fed either standard diet (containing 23% protein) supplemented with LiCl (40 mmol/kg; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) or standard diet without supplementation for 6 weeks. In both treatment groups, mice were given free access to tap water and a salt block to maintain sodium balance and prevent lithium intoxication. Mice were individually housed in a Tecniplast Single Mouse Metabolic Cage, (Tecniplast USA Inc, Exton, PA) for a 24-hour acclimation period followed by an additional 24 hours to measure food and fluid intake and collect urine for analysis. Proteins (20 \u00b5g/lane) were size-separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and then electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA). After being blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 hour, blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. Specifically, either a 1\u22362000 dilution of an antibody generated against the C-terminal domain of AQP2 (purchased from StressMarq (Victoria, BC, Canada)), or a 1\u22361000 dilution of an antibody generated against the C-terminal domain of the UT-A1 transporter (fully characterized by our source of the antibody, Dr. Jeff M. Sands) was used for AQP2 and UT-A1 detection, respectively. Blots were next washed three times in tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 and then incubated for 2 hours with Alexa Fluor 680-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1\u22364000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Bound secondary antibody was visualized using infrared detection with the LI-COR Odyssey protein analysis system (Lincoln, NE) and densitometry of the desired band was collected. To insure equal loading and quantify our densitometric scanning, blots were also probed for \u03b2 tubulin (1\u2236500; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) as a loading control. Positive detection was observed following incubation with the corresponding secondary antibody, DyLight 800 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1\u22365000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The Odyssey system was used to collect densitometry of the \u03b2 tubulin band. Results are expressed as arbitrary units normalized to the densitometry of the loading control, \u03b2 tubulin. Urine osmolality was measured on a Wescor 5520 Vapor Pressure Osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT). Serum lithium levels and urinary sodium, chloride and potassium were measured by EasyLyte (Medica, Bedford, MA) instrument. Urine creatinine was determined by the Jaffe reaction and serum creatinine was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Urinary calcium was measured by atomic absorption and urinary protein by the Lowery method. Kidneys from all four experimental groups were perfusion fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Paraffin sections (5 \u00b5m thick) were cut on a Leica microtome and dried overnight at 37\u00b0C. Slides were then placed in xylene overnight and then rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (30 min in 99% ethanol and 10 min in 96% ethanol) and endogenous peroxidases were blocked with H2O2 (1% H2O2 solution in methanol) for 30 minutes. Target retrieval was accomplished by microwaving samples with 10 mmol/l Tris and 0.5 mmol/l EGTA (TEG) buffer. To prevent nonspecific antibody binding, sections were further blocked with 50 mmol/l NH4Cl in PBS (30 min). Tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber with primary antibody (1\u223650,000 C-terminal UT-A1; 1\u223610,000 C-terminal AQP2). The tissue sections were then incubated the following day with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1\u2236200, GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 2 hours at room temperature. Positive staining was visualized using a diaminobenzidine dye (brown; Amreso, Solon, OH). Cell nuclei were also counterstained with hematoxylin (blue; EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). Images were collected with an Olympus 1\u00d751 inverted microscope using a SIS-CC12 CLR camera. Quantitative data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Differences were determined by either t-test or the Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way analysis of variance where appropriate using GraphPad Instat Software (La Jolla, CA). We and others have demonstrated that rodents become polyuric within days of lithium treatment,,\u2013. Similarly, wild-type littermates (WT) generated 5.3\u00b10.3 ml/24 h urine in as little as 3 days following daily lithium injections (40 mmol/kg/d) (Table 1). This urine was 4-fold more dilute than that collected from untreated, WT mice (Figure 1). Following 5 days of lithium injections, WT mice produced 7.4\u00b10.5 ml/24 h urine that remained significantly dilute (Figure 1). Mice with a global deletion of PKC\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1 KO) did not generate more urine after 3 or 5 days of lithium-treatment and osmolality was not significantly altered (Figure 1); however, our data confirm previous reports of slight but significant concentrating defect in PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Table 1). Serum lithium remained below toxicity levels throughout the acute experiments and kidney function was preserved as evidenced by the stable creatinine clearance and urinary protein:urinary creatinine ratio values (Table 1). We conclude that although lithium can induce polyuria within 3 days of treatment, the absence of PKC\u03b1 protected mice from generating large amounts of dilute urine in the same time frame. Two transporters located in the apical membrane of the IMCD that are responsible for urine concentration are the water channel, AQP2, and the urea transporter, UT-A1,. Absence or dampened expression of one or both of these transporters frequently occurs with clinical maladies that present with polyuria including NDI. In WT mice, combined glycosylated and unglycosylated AQP2 expression in the inner medulla was decreased \u223c45% following 3 days of lithium injections and \u223c84% with continued treatment for 5 days (Figure 2B). PKC\u03b1 KO mice did not display a reduction of AQP2 abundance in the inner medulla after 3 or 5 days of lithium treatment (Figure 2A). We observed a similar pattern in lithium-induced reduction of AQP2 expression in outer medullary tissues from WT mice but not from PKC\u03b1 KO (Figure 2C). We also observed that total glycosylated UT-A1 expression was reduced \u223c43% in the inner medulla of WT mice after 5 days of lithium injections; however, UT-A1 abundance was unaffected by lithium treatment in the PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Figure 3). We did not investigate alterations of UT-A1 expression in the outer medulla because of the transporters exclusive location to the renal papilla. To determine if the absence of PKC\u03b1 prevents lithium-induced NDI for an extended time, WT and PKC\u03b1 KO mice were fed either standard chow or chow containing 40 mmol/kg lithium ad libitum for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, lithium-treated mice had elevated lithium serum levels (Table 2), comparable to therapeutic levels in humans. Mice from all four experimental groups were housed in metabolic cages during the final 72 hours of treatment. Following 24 hours of metabolic cage acclimation, we measured food and water intake and collected urine for 24 hours. There was no difference in food intake among the treated and untreated animals (data not shown); however, lithium treatment increased water intake in both WT and PKC\u03b1 KO mice albeit polydipsia was increased 10-fold in lithium-treated WT mice and only 3-fold in lithium-treated PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Table 2). Urine output was also significantly elevated in lithium-treated PKC\u03b1 KO mice but not to the extent as observed in lithium-treated WT mice (Table 2). Lithium decreased urine osmolality corroborating the developing polyuria with treatment. We found that lithium did not change the creatinine clearance rate in either the WT or PKC\u03b1 KO mice indicating that 6-week lithium treatment did not alter kidney function in these animals. Furthermore, the urinary protein-osmolality ratio was not significantly different among the four experimental groups confirming the absence of proteinuria (Table 2). Inner medullas collected from untreated WT and PKC\u03b1 KO mice had comparable expression levels of AQP2 when quantified by Western blot analysis as expected (Figure 4A). After 6 weeks of lithium treatment, AQP2 expression in the inner medulla was almost abolished in the WT mice whereas AQP2 levels were decreased 40% in treated PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Figure 4B). In outer medullary tissues, AQP2 abundance was decreased in response to lithium treatment in WT mice; however, lithium only reduced AQP2 expression by 30% in PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Figure 4D). Because PKC\u03b1 reportedly plays a role in vasopressin-induced AQP2 trafficking, we wanted to determine if the preservation of AQP2 expression in lithium-treated PKC\u03b1 KO was ineffective due to inability of the channel to reach the apical membrane. AQP2 was diffusely localized in the cytosol of inner medullary collecting duct cells in both untreated WT and PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Figure 5). We observed that AQP2 localization was primarily apical in lithium-treated PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Figure 5). UT-A1 expression in the inner medulla was decreased 52% in WT mice treated with lithium for 6 weeks compared to untreated WT mice (Figure 6A). Interestingly, UT-A1 expression did not decrease in PKC\u03b1 KO mice treated with lithium; rather, there was a trend toward an increase in urea transporter expression although this did not reach significance (Figure 6B). Despite a decreased abundance, UT-A1 was detected in the apical region of the IMCD in lithium-treated WT mice (Figure 7). Expression and cellular localization of UT-A1 is unchanged in the PKC\u03b1 KO mice treated with lithium (Figure 7). Urinary sodium, chloride, potassium and calcium levels were measured in mice from all four experimental groups and normalized to urinary creatinine to compensate for urine volume (Figure 8). Following 6 weeks of lithium treatment, natriuresis was observed in the WT mice whereas the PKC\u03b1 KO mice had no change in sodium excretion (Figure 8A). We observed a similar increase in potassium excretion in WT mice treated with lithium (Figure 8B). PKC\u03b1 KO mice displayed no significant changes in potassium excretion (Figure 8C). Next we measured urinary calcium and found that lithium-treatment significantly elevated calcium levels in WT mice; however, urinary calcium levels remain unchanged in treated PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Figure 8D). Although lithium is an older antipsychotic, it still remains a popular treatment for bipolar disorder and its therapeutic potential for other central nervous system (CNS) diseases is also gaining favor. The fraction of patients that develop lithium-induced NDI are more at risk to become dehydrated, increasing the risk of lithium toxicity,. Water balance is maintained in the collecting duct by vasopressin regulation of AQP2 and UT-A1 through a cAMP pathway,; however, recent studies suggest that other signaling pathways can also regulate the urine concentration mechanism,,,-. Lithium impairment of cAMP production\u2013 led to our exploration of a cAMP-independent pathway involving PKC\u03b1, which has been implicated in regulating urine concentration\u2013. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of PKC\u03b1, mice are protected from lithium-induced NDI from the onset of treatment and, as the regimen progresses; the polyuria is not as severe. This may seem counterintuitive given that other studies have shown that PKC\u03b1 KO mice have a higher flow rate and lower urine osmolality and we observed that at basal state, PKC\u03b1 KO mice are slightly polyuric (Table 1 and 2). In agreement with Yao et.al, we did not see a difference in medullary AQP2 expression between WT and PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Figure 4) and there are no apparent alterations in the morphology of the inner medulla in PKC\u03b1 KO mice (Figures 5 and 7). Despite the mild, basal polyuria in PKC\u03b1 KO mice, these animals are able to concentrate urine after water depravation demonstrating that the urine concentration mechanism is preserved. Although the mechanism of how PKC\u03b1 contributes to urine concentration in the basal state remains to be determined, our studies demonstrate that when the concentration mechanism is tested by lithium treatment, the mild polyuria in the PKC\u03b1 KO mice is overcome and the massive polyuria associated with NDI is attenuated in the absence of the kinase. The presence of AQP2 in the IMCD is critical for production of concentrated urine to maintain fluid homeostasis. Consequently, protein abundance of AQP2 is increased as a regulatory mechanism to long periods of water deprivation and/or high circulating levels of vasopressin. Several animal models of acquired NDI including hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, ureteral obstruction, chloroquine and lithium nephrotoxicity have decreased AQP2 expression in the inner medulla,\u2013; hence the need to understand the transcriptional regulation of the AQP2 gene. It is generally accepted that the cAMP-mediated regulation of AQP2 gene transcription is mediated by CREB binding to a documented functional CRE element. Although it has been speculated that lithium reduced AQP2 expression by dampening cAMP synthesis, studies by Li et al., showed that lithium reduction of AQP2 mRNA level was independent of cAMP and vasopressin-stimulated PKA phosphorylation of CREB still occurred. Our study found that ablation of PKC\u03b1 prevented the reduction of AQP2 abundance commonly observed in lithium-treated control animals. The mechanism behind PKC\u03b1 suppression of AQP2 is unknown. It is possible that in the absence of PKC\u03b1, Gi-mediated inhibition of cAMP generation does not occur thus allowing cAMP to remain in the IMCD cell to stimulate CREB-mediated transcription of the AQP2 gene. Using systems biology-based approaches, Yu et al., identified several putative transcriptional regulator families and binding elements other than CREB and CRE that may regulate AQP2 gene expression suggesting that PKC\u03b1 could decrease AQP2 expression by either directly phosphorylating one of these novel transcription factors or indirectly by phosphorylating one or more downstream modifying proteins. While detailed mechanisms of down regulation of AQP2 by lithium and other causes of acquired-NDI remain unexplained, our findings support a role for PKC\u03b1 in this process. Unlike AQP2, UT-A1 transcription is not mediated by cAMP but rather through the interaction between the tonicity-responsive enhancer (TonE) and the corresponding transcription factor, TonEBP. Our results demonstrate that UT-A1 expression is not altered by lithium in PKC\u03b1 KO mice. Preservation of the urea transporter in the absence of PKC\u03b1 likely occurs through the persevered tonicity of the medullary interstitium in lithium-treated PKC\u03b1 KO mice. For instance, in long-term cyclosporin A administration, another model of acquired-NDI, downregulation of TonEBP was secondary to the reduced tonicity of medullary interstitium. We also observed an ensuing kaliuresis in lithium-treated WT mice. Potassium depletion reduces the abundance of TonEBP, possibly explaining why abundance of UT-A1 is not altered in long-term lithium-treated PKC\u03b1 KO mice that are not potassium wasting. In addition to CRE, TonE is also present in the AQP2 gene which could contribute to the cAMP independent reduction of AQP2 mRNA by lithium. In addition to persevering AQP2 expression, we found that in the absence of PKC\u03b1, AQP2 expression was highly localized to the apical membrane of the IMCD following long-term lithium treatment. Studies indicate that the inhibitory action of PKC on vasopressin-stimulated water permeability is due to PKC-initiated endocytosis of AQP2. Although PKC does not directly interact with AQP2, activation of PKC leads to the short-chain ubiquitination of AQP2 resulting in lysosomal degradation of the channel. Reports show that the PKC\u03b1 isoform is involved in \u03b1-tubulin assembly in renal cells and microtubule-dependent trafficking of AQP2 regulates intracellular localization following internalization; however, microtubules are not involved in the exocytic transport of the channel. In fact, overexpression of a constitutively active PKC\u03b1 construct in IMCD cells prevented translocation of AQP2 to the plasma membrane and resulted in AQP2 distribution throughout the cytoplasm. Our data support these collective findings and indicate that in the absence of PKC\u03b1, AQP2 remains at the apical membrane despite a lithium-mediated reduction in cAMP concentration. Recently Zhang et al., discovered that lithium-induced natriuresis and kaliuresis is not as severe in mice lacking the P2Y2 receptor. We found that in the absence of PKC\u03b1, the onset of natriuresis and kaliuresis with lithium treatment was blocked. Given that the creatinine clearance and the osmolality:protein ratio was unchanged in either WT or PKC\u03b1 KO mice in response to lithium, it is unlikely that an alteration in glomerular filtration or kidney injury is contributing to the observed natriuretic responses. The determination of any altered response of sodium and potassium transporters along the nephron is beyond the scope of this manuscript but will be intriguing for future studies. Regardless, our current findings suggest that the downstream target of purinergic signaling, PKC\u03b1, is an important regulator in water and solute absorption. We also observed that lithium-treated PKC\u03b1 KO mice did not display the hypercalciuria observed in treated WT mice. Polyuria is often clinically correlated with hypercalcemia and resulting hypercalciuria in several fluid balance disorders including the chronic administration of lithium,. Increased urinary calcium is sensed by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), located in the apical membrane of the collecting duct. Studies suggest that activation of collecting duct CaSR by elevated urinary calcium reduces the expression of AQP2 resulting in decreased water reabsorption. Bustamante et al. demonstrated that cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells chronically exposed to extracellular calcium reduced both AQP2 mRNA and protein levels while CaSR gene silencing counteracted this effect. AQP2 was also reduced in the inner medulla of animal models of hypercalciuria including hypercalciuric rats, and TRPV5 null mice. Furthermore, hypercalciuria is associated with elevated levels of urinary AQP2 in enuretic children. PKC\u03b1, one of the conventional PKC isoforms that requires calcium for activation, is stimulated in response to extracellular calcium treatment in CCD cells. These reports combined with our findings suggest an interesting interaction between PKC\u03b1, and the known association of hypercalciuria with decreased AQP2 expression and CaSR activation. In conclusion, we discovered that the development of lithium-mediated NDI is not as severe in the absence of PKC\u03b1. Although lithium remains the drug of choice for treating psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder, many patients experience several side effects including acquired-NDI. Our findings indicate that adding a PKC inhibitor to a prescribed lithium regimen will prevent deleterious renal side effects. Treating patients simultaneously with the CNS-penetrant PKC inhibitor, tamoxifen, and lithium reduces the number of manic episodes compared to patients on lithium therapy alone, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of PKC to alleviate the renal side effects of lithium will not hamper the effectiveness of lithium as an anti-psychotic but is in fact beneficial."}, "24743235": {"pmid": "24743235", "pmcid": "PMC3990611", "title": "IL-3 and CSF-1 Interact to Promote Generation of CD11c+ IL-10-Producing Macrophages", "abstract": "\nUnraveling the mechanisms of hematopoiesis regulated by multiple cytokines remains a challenge in hematology. IL-3 is an allergic cytokine with the multilineage potential, while CSF-1 is produced in the steady state with restricted lineage coverage. Here, we uncovered an instructive role of CSF-1 in IL-3-mediated hematopoiesis. CSF-1 significantly promoted IL-3-driven CD11c+ cell expansion and dampened basophil and mast cell generation from C57BL/6 bone marrow. Further studies indicated that the CSF-1/CSF-1R axis contributed significantly to IL-3-induced CD11c+ cell generation through enhancing c-Fos-associated monopoiesis. CD11c+ cells induced by IL-3 or IL-3/CSF-1 were competent in cellular maturation and endocytosis. Both IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 cells lacked classical dendritic cell appearance and resembled macrophages in morphology. Both populations produced a high level of IL-10, in addition to IL-1, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, in response to LPS, and were relatively poor T cell stimulators. Collectively, these findings reveal a role for CSF-1 in mediating the IL-3 hematopoietic pathway through monopoiesis, which regulates expansion of CD11c+ macrophages.\n", "fulltext": "Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a hematopoietic cytokine that is secreted by activated T and mast cells (MCs),,. It is produced during allergic inflammations or in response to parasitic infections, and has been considered a Th2 response promoter,. IL-3 is necessary for optimal immunity against helminthes, reflecting its role in enhancing generation of systemic basophils and tissue MCs. The hallmark of IL-3 is its capacity to stimulate proliferation of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells, particularly those of the myeloid lineage, at various developmental stages,. As such, IL-3 has been recognized as a multi-potential colony-stimulating factor (multi-CSF),. IL-3 stimulates ex vivo generation of MCs, macrophages, basophils and CD11c+ cells in mouse bone marrow (BM),. The hematopoietic effect of IL-3 has been shown to be strain-specific. In contrast to IL-3, CSF-1 or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is produced in the steady state, with a much more restricted hematopoietic coverage, primarily regulating development of the monocyte lineage,,, and has been reported to have a role in developing dendritic cells (DCs). The capacity of IL-3 to promote multilineage development has been examined in conjunction with several cytokines. For instance, IL-3, IL-6 and stem cell factor mediate generation of granulocytes and monocytes, and this combination has been used to study myeloid lineage commitment of C57BL/6 mice,. Together with TNF\u03b1, IL-3 is a potent cytokine in generation of Langerhans cells from human cord blood CD34+ hematopoetic progenitor cells (HPCs). In humans, IFN\u03b3 cooperates with IL-3 to enhance expansion of HPCs, while IFN\u03b2 and IL-3 induce monocyte differentiation into DCs, which potently stimulate helper T cells. IL-4 and IL-3 initiate human monocyte differentiation into Th2-polarizing DCs. While IL-3 and CSF-1 were known to act synergistically in induction of BM colonies and CSF-1R+ hematopoietic cells,, their hematopoietic relationship has not been fully characterized. With advanced knowledge in leukocyte biology and cellular/molecular techniques, we revisited earlier studies on IL-3 hematopoiesis and its lineage relationship with CSF-1 and addressed issues pertinent to a) phenotypic identifications of leukocyte populations induced by IL-3 with and without CSF-1 in BM ex vivo, b) the effect of CSF-1 in IL-3 multilineage hematopoiesis and associated molecular pathways and c) clarification of macrophage or DC induction as previously reported and their immunological functions. We identified an instructive role of CSF-1 in IL-3-mediated hematopoiesis and demonstrated that the combination of the two cytokines stimulated expansion of CD11c+ macrophages that produced IL-10 with a minimal T cell stimulation capacity. C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice (aged 6\u201310 wk) used throughout this study were purchased from the Animal Resources Centre (Canning Vale, Western Australia). These mice, together with Csf1r-EGFP (MacGreen) derived from the University of Queensland, were maintained in the animal facilities of Griffith University (Gold Coast, Australia). All experimental procedures were conducted following the animal ethics guideline of Griffith University Animal Ethics Committee (GLY/06/12/AEC). BM cells from murine femurs and tibias were collected and treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for 5 min. Cells were washed and cultured with complete RPMI 1640 media at 5\u00d7105 cells/ml in 24-well plates. Recombinant mouse IL-3 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), GM-CSF and CSF-1 (eBioscience) were used at 10 ng/ml. At days 3, 6 and 9, one half of the culture media was aspirated and slowly replenished with media containing 20 ng/ml cytokines, without disturbing cells as described. In some experiments, cells were co-incubated with 5 \u00b5g/ml CSF-1R blocking antibody anti-CD115 (AFS98) (eBioscience) or isotype control antibody (Rat IgG2a \u03ba) (eBioscience). Cells (2\u00d7105) were pelleted and treated with Fc Block (2.4G2, BD Biosciences). They were then labeled with fluorescent antibodies including FITC-anti-CD11b (M1/70, BD), APC-eflour780-anti-CD11c, APC-anti-Fc\u03b5RI (MAR-1, eBiosceince) and Percp-anti-c-kit (2B8, Biolegend). The cell/antibody mix was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Cells were washed for flow cytometry analysis (CyAn ADP, Beckman Coulter). To examine cell morphology, cells were imaged by the 40X lens in bright field in a 24-well plate, using the ECLIPSE TS100 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). CD11c+ and T cells were purified by magnetic cell sorting. To purify CD11c+ cells, BM culture cells were incubated with anti-CD11c (N418) MAC beads (10 \u00b5l/107 cells) (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) in the presence of 2% FCS and 2 mM EDTA in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. Cells were positively selected with the MAC LS column and the magnetic separator (Miltenyi Biotech). CD11c+ cell purity was at least 93%. T cells were isolated from spleen. Briefly, splenocytes were incubated with a cocktail of biotin-conjugated antibodies and anti-biotin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech) to label non-T cells. Cells were negatively selected with the LS column as described. T cell purity was >90%. CD11c+ cells (106/ml) were seeded in triplicates in the 24-well plates and stimulated by LPS (1 \u00b5g/ml) for 24 h. Supernatants were collected for cytokine detection by ELISA. TNF\u03b1, INF\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were detected using BD Biosciences kits, while IL-10, R&D Systems kits. Briefly, antibody-coated microtiter plates (Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany) were washed with 0.05% tween in PBS, and samples were added after blocking with FCS for 2 h. Plates were washed and biotin coated detection antibody added for 2 h. Streptavidin-horseradish-peroxidase and the substrate (R&D) were added and the colorimetric reaction was stopped by 2N H2SO4. The optical density of each well was determined at 450 nm by Wallac Vitor3 1420 Multi-label Counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Cells were stimulated with LPS (1 \u00b5g/ml) derived from Escherichia coli (0111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Cells (5\u00d7105) were collected, washed and incubated with Fc Block at 4\u00b0C for 5 min. They were labeled with APC-conjugated anti-CD40 (HM40-3, eBioscience), FITC-anti-CD80 (16-10.A1, eBioscience), PE-Cy7-anti-CD86 (GL1, BD), APC-MHC-class I (H2Kb) (AF6-88.5.5.3, eBioscience) and PE-Cy7-MHC class II (IA, IE) (M5/114.15.2, Biolegend, San Diego, CA), together with APC-anti-eFlour780-anti-CD11c (N418, eBioscience) or PE-anti-CD11c (HL3, BD) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. In flow cytometry, live CD11c+ PI-negative cells were gated to evaluate maturation. To evaluate antigen uptake, cells were incubated with 10 \u00b5g/ml FITC-dextran (Sigma Aldrich) at 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 15 min. Cells were then labeled with APC-eFlour780-anti-CD11c. The capacity of CD11c+ cells in dextran uptake was evaluated. BM cell culture was harvested at day 3 and lineage-depleted. Briefly, cells were pelleted and incubated with biotin-lineage antibody cocktail (10 \u00b5l/107 cells) (Miltenyi Biotec), followed by anti-biotin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were negatively selected using LS column as described. Lineage-negative cells were collected and preserved in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Victoria, Australia) at -80\u00b0C. Total RNA was isolated. RNA (1 \u00b5g) was reverse transcribed using random primers (Promega, Madison, WI) and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega). cDNA (50 ng) was used as a template for SYBR Green real-time PCR (Roche, NSW, Australia) on a CFX96 Touch System (Biorad, Hercules, CA) using a standard three-step melt program (95\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s). Primers were designed for the quantification of C/EBPA (F 5 CGG TGC GCA AGA GCC GAG AT; R 5 CCC GCA GCG TGT CCA GTT CA) and c-fos (F 5 ACT AGA GAC GGA CAG ATC TG; R 5 ATA ACG GGA ACG CAG CAG TA). Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 (QuantiTec, Qiagen, Victoria, Australia) and presented as the relative level of expression. Purified C57BL/6 CD11c+ cells (2\u20138\u00d7103) derived from IL-3, IL-3/CSF-1 and GM-CSF culture were co-cultured in triplicates with purified 2\u00d7104 Balb/c T cells, which had been labeled with 5 \u00b5M CFSE, in a 96-well round bottom plate. At day 3, cells were collected and T cell proliferation was evaluated by CFSE fluorescence in flow cytometry. The percentages of cells proliferated were determined by gating on CD3+ cell populations with descended FITC fluorescence. All data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SEM, where statistical analysis is required. Significance between experimental groups was determined by the p value (<0.05), using student t test or one-way ANOVA. We have examined the effect of IL-3 on cell generation kinetics of BM ex vivo. IL-3 primarily induced three cell populations, CD11b+CD11c+ cells, Fc\u03b5RI+c-kit\u2013 basophils and Fc\u03b5RI+c-kit+ MCs (Fig. 1). The rapid increase in numbers of CD11c+ cells was followed by moderate expansion of basophils, whereas the development of MCs occurred later (Fig. 1). This sequential induction of three distinct IL-3 regulated populations may be linked to their specific roles at various stages of the allergic immune response. While CSF-1 alone had a minimal effect on DC generation, the addition of CSF-1 into IL-3 treated cultures significantly increased both the percentage and absolute number of CD11c+ cells, with the percentage peaking at day 12 and absolute number at day 9 (Fig. 1A and 1B). CSF-1/IL-3 induced more than a two-fold increase of the CD11c+ cell yield, compared with IL-3 treatment alone (Fig. 1A and 1B). In contrast to CD11c+ cells, IL-3-induced generation of basophils and MCs, both in percentages and numbers, was depressed by the addition of CSF-1 (Fig. 1C and 1D). Both IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 had a comparable potent effect in inducing overall cell expansion (Fig. S1). There was no effect of CSF-1 on expansion of CD11c+ cells with GM-CSF (Fig. S2A), a potent cytokine that is associated with the generation of inflammatory DCs, even though CSF-1 was able to enhance generation of total cells in cultures containing this cytokine (Fig. S2B). We further investigated the mechanism by which CSF-1 modulates the IL-3-mediated hematopoietic pathway. CD11c+ cell generation mediated by IL-3 was significantly inhibited when CSF-1R was blocked with AFS98 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the AFS98 antibody had no effect on the generation of CD11c+ cells induced by GM-CSF (Fig S3). In a positive control, AFS98 blocked the action of CSF-1, resulting in a similar level of CD11c+ cell generation to that seen in the AFS98 treated IL-3 culture (Fig. 2A). The dependence of IL-3 on CSF-1R in inducing CD11c+ generation was further validated by two findings. First, expression of the CSF-1R reporter c-fms/EGFP in MacGreen BM cells was rapidly induced by IL-3 with or without CSF-1 (Fig. 2B). Second, albeit at a low level, CSF-1 was produced and remained at a constant level at the early stage of IL-3 culture (Fig. 2C), while IL-34, another cytokine known to signal through CSF-1R, was not detected (data not shown). We next examined how CSF-1 transcriptionally regulates IL-3 induction of CD11c+ cells. Monopoiesis and granulopoiesis have been linked to transcriptional factors c-Fos and C/EBP\u03b1, respectively,,. Indeed, in early lineage-depleted progenitor cells, CSF-1 significantly enhanced expression of transcriptional factor c-Fos, whereas it reduced expression of C/EBP\u03b1 (Fig. 2D). IL-3 stimulates JAK/STAT, which activates and upregulates c-Fos and cell proliferation. CSF-1 preferentially activates ERK and induces expression of c-Fos that enhances monopoiesis,. Thus, CSF-1 skews IL-3-mediated hematopoiesis towards monopoiesis through reinforcing c-Fos, promoting differentiation of the CD11c+ monocytic pool,. We next compared the maturation phenotype and functions of IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 CD11c+ cells. Phenotypically, both populations expressed similar levels of costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-class I (H2Kb) and II (IA, IE) (Fig. 3A). After LPS stimulation, IL-3/CSF-1 CD11c+ cells exhibited a more mature phenotype, expressing higher levels of co-stimulatory markers, particularly CD86 (Fig. 3A). Both populations were comparable in their abilities to take up antigens based on FITC-dextran binding at 4\u00b0C and internalization at 37\u00b0C for 15 min (Fig. 3B). After 7 days of culture, both cell populations were adherent; however, IL-3/CSF-1 cells were more elongated/spreading in appearance resembling macrophages (Fig. 3C). Neither of the cell populations exhibited the conventional DC morphology. In response to LPS, both CD11c+ purified populations produced comparable levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and a relatively high level of IL-6, (Fig. 3D). Both produced IL-10, with IL-3/CSF-1 CD11c+ cell expression detected at a lower level, while IFN\u03b3 expression was not detected at all (data not shown). In the mixed lymphocyte reactions (Fig. 3E), both IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 CD11c+ cells failed to efficiently stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation, with much lower levels of percentages on proliferated T cells, in contrast to GM-CSF-derived DCs. These data support that IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1-derived CD11c+ cells are macrophages with a possible regulatory phenotype. Although both express CD11c, CD11b, costimulatory molecules and MHC-class II (Fig. 3A), in contrast with the data reported in a previous study, we did not find any evidence to suggest that they have conventional myeloid DC properties. Hence, expression of these cell surface markers under specific cytokine conditions or in response to certain inflammatory cues is insufficient to classify a monocytic cell population as DCs. The ability of CSF-1 to modulate the IL-3-driven hematopoietic pathway may have implications in allergic inflammations. IL-3 is the major inducer of blood basophils and tissue mast cells, which are Fc\u03b5RI+ effector cells that regulate immediate hypersensitivity. CSF-1 may on one hand mitigate overproduction of basophils and mast cells that can cause undesired tissue damage, while on the other hand mobilizing IL-10-producing monocytic cells that exert anti-inflammatory functions and/or facilitate the development of Th2 and humoral responses. An alternative perspective is that, because CSF-1 drives CD11c-MHC-class II- macrophage generation, IL-3 may function to divert from a wound healing (mediated by CSF-1 alone) to an immunomodulatory phenotype. Nevertheless, the ability of IL-3 together with CSF-1 to regulate CD11c+ macrophage expansion highlights the role of cytokine combination in plasticity of the BM progenitors that further contributes to the heterogeneity of the antigen-presenting cell system."}, "21042587": {"pmid": "21042587", "pmcid": "PMC2962642", "title": "Familial Glucocorticoid Receptor Haploinsufficiency by Non-Sense Mediated mRNA Decay, Adrenal Hyperplasia and Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess", "abstract": "\nPrimary glucocorticoid resistance (OMIM 138040) is a rare hereditary disease that causes a generalized partial insensitivity to glucocorticoid action, due to genetic alterations of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Investigation of adrenal incidentalomas led to the discovery of a family (eight affected individuals spanning three generations), prone to cortisol resistance, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, arterial hypertension and hypokalemia. This phenotype exacerbated over time, cosegregates with the first heterozygous nonsense mutation p.R469[R,X] reported to date for the GR, replacing an arginine (CGA) by a stop (TGA) at amino-acid 469 in the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor. In vitro, this mutation leads to a truncated 50-kDa GR lacking hormone and DNA binding capacity, devoid of hormone-dependent nuclear translocation and transactivation properties. In the proband's fibroblasts, we provided evidence for the lack of expression of the defective allele in vivo. The absence of detectable mutated GR mRNA was accompanied by a 50% reduction in wild type GR transcript and protein. This reduced GR expression leads to a significantly below-normal induction of glucocorticoid-induced target genes, FKBP5 in fibroblasts. We demonstrated that the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid signaling dysfunction involved GR haploinsufficiency due to the selective degradation of the mutated GR transcript through a nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay that was experimentally validated on emetine-treated propositus' fibroblasts. GR haploinsufficiency leads to hypertension due to illicit occupation of renal mineralocorticoid receptor by elevated cortisol rather than to increased mineralocorticoid production reported in primary glucocorticoid resistance. Indeed, apparent mineralocorticoid excess was demonstrated by a decrease in urinary tetrahydrocortisone-tetrahydrocortisol ratio in affected patients, revealing reduced glucocorticoid degradation by renal activity of the 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, a GR regulated gene. We propose thus that GR haploinsufficiency compromises glucocorticoid sensitivity and may represent a novel genetic cause of subclinical hypercortisolism, incidentally revealed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and mineralocorticoid-independent hypertension.\n", "fulltext": "Glucocorticoids are one of the most important class of steroid hormones that regulate essential biological processes including development, metabolism, growth, inflammatory processes, behavior and apoptosis. Glucocorticoid actions are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a nuclear receptor encoded by the NR3C1 gene. GR is ubiquitously expressed as two distinct isoforms GR\u03b1 and GR\u03b2. These isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of the last exon 9\u03b1 or exon 9\u03b2 of NR3C1 and differ by their last carboxy terminal amino acids and their transcriptional activities. GR regulates a large variety of gene expression in responses to glucocorticoid hormones,. A closely related nuclear receptor, the mineralocorticoid receptor also binds glucocorticoid hormones. However, in classical aldosterone target tissues, such as the distal nephron and the colon, the enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\u03b2HSD2) metabolizes cortisol into inactive derivative cortisone and prevents permanent MR activation leading to inappropriate sodium retention and subsequent arterial hypertension. To date, twelve germinal mutations of the human GR have been identified; most of them are heterozygous missense mutations causing partial loss of function of the GR,,. These NR3C1 mutations compromise various steps of the glucocorticoid signalling pathway and cause primary glucocorticoid resistance (OMIM 138040), a rare hereditary disease with generalized partial insensitivity to glucocorticoid action. However, the clinical presentation of primary glucocorticoid resistance is very diverse from severe signs of mineralocorticoid excess due to elevated aldosterone levels, and hyperandrogenia, to mild or asymptomatic forms. This variable phenotype is associated with a wide genetic heterogeneity due to various missense mutations affecting distinct functional domains of the nuclear receptor and responsible for impaired glucocorticoid signalling. Up to date, non-sense mutation of NR3C1 has never been described. We report herein, the discovery of the first heterozygous nonsense mutation in the human GR. We describe a clear-cut clinical, cellular and molecular characterization of a stop mutation and demonstrate that an impaired translation of mutant mRNA in vivo causes GR haploinsufficiency. This mutation NR3C1 p.R469[R,X] identified in a French family with eight affected siblings spanning three generations gives a unique opportunity to study the natural history of GR haploinsufficiency as previously reported in mouse models. We thus infer that GR haploinsufficiency in humans is responsible of a discrete phenotype of subclinical hypercortisolism, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and arterial hypertension. This unusual clinical presentation, most notably incidentally discovered adrenal hyperplasia, progresses gradually throughout the life cycle, and clearly differs from that previously described during primary glucocorticoid resistance associated with other NR3C1 missense mutations. We finally provide evidence that arterial hypertension in this family is related to an illicit MR activation in the kidney, due to altered renal 11\u03b2HSD2 activity and hypercortisolism rather than to elevated mineralocorticoids as previously proposed for primary glucocorticoid resistance. Thus, GR haploinsufficiency might be an underestimated cause of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and arterial hypertension. The 46-year-old French Caucasian male propositus (subject II.3, Fig. 1A) was referred for evaluation of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia discovered incidentally during computerized tomography (CT) performed for lumbago. His personal history was marked by recent onset of arterial hypertension (190 mm Hg systolic values). Physical examination showed no signs of Cushing's syndrome such as striae bruises, amyotrophy or faciotroncular obesity (Fig. 1B). Biochemical evaluation showed normal glycemia (4.1 mmol/L), moderate hypokalemia (3.5 mmol/L) with inappropriate kaliuresis (55 mmol/d) and normal renal function. Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) excretion, measured by mass spectrometry-HPLC, was 2- to 4-higher than normal while serum ACTH levels were inappropriate and increased after the CRH test (Table 1). Further endocrine evaluation showed a preserved circardian cortisol cycle but markedly elevated midnight cortisolemia (248 nmol/L). An overnight 1-mg dexamethasone (DEX) suppression test failed to completely suppress plasma cortisol (nadir 119 nmol/L, N <50). Supine aldosterone and active renin levels were undetectable (Table 1) and deoxycorticosterone values were low (40 pg/ml, N 40-200). In contrast, the urinary tetrahydrocortisone/tetrahydrocortisol ratio (THE/THF) was low (0.92, N>1.5), suggesting impaired renal 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\u03b2HSD2) activity. Abdominal CT revealed bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (Fig. 1C, middle panel). Normal bone density and osteocalcin levels ruled out detrimental consequences of the cortisol excess on bone structure and metabolism. Magnetic resonance imaging showed normal pituitary and no muscle atrophy and no abdominal or subcutaneous adipose depots. The two affected brothers of the propositus (subjects II.5 and II.7, Fig. 1A) had no clinical features of Cushing's syndrome despite hypercortisolism and insufficiently suppressed plasma or salivary cortisol with low or undetectable renin and aldosterone values (Table 1). The THE/THF ratio was abnormally low in both cases (Table 1). CT also revealed bilateral nodular adrenal hyperplasia in subject II.5 (not shown). The 72-year-old mother (I.2, Fig. 1A) had a history of severe uncontrolled arterial hypertension and hypokalemia (Table 1), with no clinical features of hypercortisolism or hyperandrogenism (testosterone 0.31 ng/mL, N 0.1-0.4, D4-androstenedione 1.3 ng/mL, N 0.6-1.6, DHEAS 400 ng/ml, N 200-2300). Her bone mineral density was at the upper limit of normal for her age despite probable longstanding glucocorticoid excess. UFC and midnight plasma cortisol levels were elevated and remained high after an overnight DEX suppression test (Table 1). Aldosterone was undetectable. Her THE/THF ratio was also abnormally low (Table 1). CT revealed bilateral nodular adrenal hyperplasia (Fig. 1C, upper panel). The proband's 9-year-old affected daughter (III.2, Fig. 1A) has normal height, growth and prepubertal development (S2, P1), without clinical hypercortisolism or hyperandrogenism. Her UFC was increased, with inappropriately high ACTH levels (Table 1). Androgen levels were very low. CT also revealed slightly enlarged adrenal glands for her age (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Subject III.5, a 14-year-old daughter of subject II.7, had normal development and regular menses that started at age 12 years. She shows no signs of hypercorticism despite a 4-fold increase in UFC and a negative suppression test (Table 1). All these clinical and endocrine abnormalities raised the diagnosis of familial generalized glucocorticoid resistance and prompted us to search for genetic defects. We also studied some unaffected family members, including three with normal hormone levels (Table 1) and one with a normal abdominal CT (not shown), in order to demonstrate phenotype and genotype co-segregation. After sequencing the ten exons and the exon-intron boundaries of the proband's hGR gene, a single heterozygous cytosine to thymidine substitution was identified in exon 4 at nucleotide position 1405 (Fig. 2A), replacing a CGA (arginine) by a TGA stop codon at amino acid 469 in the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of GR. This p.R469X mutation results, as expected, in a truncated GR molecule of 468 amino-acids (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, this nucleotide substitution abrogates the Bsp119I restriction site (TTCGAA), thus facilitating rapid identification of the mutation in the amplified exon 4 sequence (Fig. 2C). This heterozygous nonsense mutation was detected in eight heterozygous individuals (see Fig. 1A: I.2, II.3, II.5, II.7, III.2, III.3, III.4 and III.5), absent in unaffected family members and in 100 unrelated Caucasians. The functional properties of the hGR\u03b1-R469X mutant were assayed in human HEK 293 cells by transient transfection experiments. As expected from the DBD truncation, the hGR\u03b1-R469X mutant migrated as a \u223c50-kDa band as shown by Western blot with an antibody recognizing the N-terminal part of GR (Fig. 3A) and by autoradiography of the radiolabeled receptor obtained in a translation-coupled-to-transcription assay (Fig. 3B). The mutant receptor was unable to bind DNA as shown by gel retardation assay (Fig. 3C) neither to translocate to the nucleus after dexamethasone exposure (Fig. 3D). Finally, the mutant was unable to transactivate the GRE2-Luc reporter gene in the absence or presence of hormone (Fig. 3E). Fibroblasts cultured from a proband skin biopsy sample were used for molecular characterization of the endogenous GR mutation in vivo. The presence of the heterozygous GR mutation in genomic DNA from fibroblasts of individual II.3 was confirmed. However, direct sequencing of cDNA failed to detect any mutated transcripts (Fig. 4A, upper panel). This was consistent with selective degradation of the mutated GR mRNA through a nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay (NMD), a specific quality-control mechanism that eliminates aberrant mRNAs harboring a premature termination codon before the last exon. The involvement of this active process was unambiguously demonstrated as treatment of patient fibroblasts with either emetine or cycloheximide, two potent NMD inhibitors, stabilized the mutant mRNA expressed from the defective allele (Fig. 4A) and significantly increased the total amount of GR mRNA levels as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, GR mRNA levels expressed in patient fibroblasts were approximately half those measured in two controls (Fig. 4C). DEX binding assays accordingly demonstrated a 50% decrease in the number of fibroblast hormone-binding sites as compared to controls (Fig. 4D). Given the drastic reduction in GR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and the absence of defective allele expression, we suspected that the mutated GR protein was not expressed in vivo. Indeed, the 50-kDa mutated GR species was undetectable by western blot whereas a 50% reduction in the 90-kDa WT GR molecule was observed (Fig. 4E). Finally, owing to this decrease in the functional GR concentration in the proband's fibroblasts, significantly below-normal induction of FKBP5, a glucocorticoid-induced target gene, was observed after DEX exposure (Fig. 4F). Altogether, these findings unambiguously establish that the heterozygous nonsense mutation p.R469[R,X] results in GR haploinsufficiency that ultimately compromises glucocorticoid signaling in vivo. We describe a family carrying the first heterozygous nonsense mutation (R469X) in the GR gene. This germinal mutation results in partial glucocorticoid resistance associated with subclinical hypercortisolism, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and hypertension but yet low mineralocorticoid levels, aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone, defining an apparent mineralocorticoid excess. In vitro characterization revealed that the GR p.R469X mutant is unable to bind hormones and DNA. GR p.R469X mutant does not exhibit any ligand-dependant nuclear translocation nor display transcriptional activity. In vivo functional characterization of the endogenous heterozygous nonsense mutation demonstrated that the molecular mechanism underlying glucocorticoid insensitivity in this kindred involves GR haploinsufficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay (NMD). This mechanism of glucocorticoid signaling dysfunction differs from that induced by other heterozygous missense GR mutations that impair one or several steps of the GR activation cascade and/or exert dominant negative effect on wild-type GR. The rare familial or sporadic cases of primary glucocorticoid resistance are associated with mild to very severe clinical presentations. In this family, the clinical presentation was quite unusual. Indeed, adrenal incidentalomas are emerging as an increasingly important clinical entity owing to the routine use of efficient imaging techniques. Its prevalence increases with age, affecting as much as 10% of the elderly. Among clinically unapparent adrenal masses, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia often causes difficulties of diagnostic and management. Investigation of adrenal incidentalomas leads to the identification of this nonsense mutation in eight individuals spanning three generations allowing us to examine the natural history of the disease and to study the effects of human GR deficiency throughout the life cycle. Moderate hypercortisolism is associated with an almost normal phenotype with normal fertility and no virilization in affected women. A striking observation is the extent of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia which progresses gradually, probably owing to chronic exposure to inappropriate ACTH levels; this clinical presentation resembles that of heterozygous GR+/\u2212 mice. Alternatively, altered intraadrenal glucocorticoid-regulated adrenocortical cell signaling could play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Besides GR, glucocorticoids also bind the closely related mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Therefore, despite a drastic reduction in normal GR abundance, longstanding glucocorticoid excess may have deleterious effects through MR binding. In classical aldosterone target tissues such as the distal nephron, the enzyme 11\u03b2HSD2 metabolizes cortisol into inactive cortisone and prevents permanent MR activation with subsequent sodium retention and arterial hypertension. Indeed, the THE/THF ratio was low and fell gradually over the generations in this kindred, strongly suggesting impaired activity of renal 11\u03b2HSD2, a direct GR target gene. Owing to the absence of elevated aldosterone and DOC levels, increased cortisol levels induce illicit occupation and activation of the unprotected MR leading to an apparent mineralocorticoid excess with hypertension and hypokalemia. Glucocorticoid-activated MR could also trigger proadipogenic effects, or affect neuron function, although this needs to be investigated in patients with glucocorticoid receptor haploinsufficiency. On the other hand, the absence of hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia in the propositus despite chronically high glucocorticoid levels, suggests that the reduction in hepatic or adipose GR levels might somehow protect against glucose intolerance or metabolic alterations as observed in equivalent animal models,,. It remains to be established how and to which extent such an unbalanced GR dosage affects metabolic, central nervous system or cardiovascular functions in these affected individuals. In conclusion, our results provide first evidence for a new human genetic defect due to nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay responsible for GR hapoinsufficiency. Indeed, GR haploinsufficiency identified in this family compromises glucocorticoid sensitivity and may represent a novel genetic cause of subclinical hypercortisolism, incidentally revealed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and mineralocorticoid-independent hypertension. We propose that a GR genetic screening should be proposed and particularly relevant in such patients given the possible therapeutic potential of MR antagonists,. All the participants gave their written informed consent for genetic analyses which were approved by the local ethics committee (CHU Bic\u00eatre). Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells. The entire coding regions of the hGR\u03b1 and hGR\u03b2 genes were amplified and sequenced with primers described in Supplemental Table S1. Arginine to stop mutation (hGR\u03b1-R469X) was obtained with the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with pcDNA3-hGRa as a matrix. Fibroblasts (passages 5\u201315) were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in DMEM High Glucose (4.5 g/l), 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum, pH 7.4. Total RNA was extracted from cells with Trizol reagent (InVitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) and gene expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR, using an ABI 7300 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described. HEK 293 cells starved for 24 h in steroid-free medium were transfected using Lipofectamin 2000 (InVitrogen) with pcDNA3-hGR\u03b1 or pcDNA3 hGR\u03b1-R469X together with pSVbgal and pGRE2-TATA-luc plasmids and then exposed to 100 nM DEX. \u03b2-galactosidase and luciferase activities were assayed as described elsewhere. In vitro translated WT and mutated GR were prepared by using the TnT-T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation kit (Promega, Charbonni\u00e8res-les-Bains, France), and labeled with [35S]-methionine (Perkin Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France). Total protein extracts were prepared from cells lysed at 4\u00b0C, as previously described. Immunoblots were incubated overnight with anti-GR antibody (AbC10-G015, AbCys Paris, France) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Vector, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. Proteins were visualized with the ECL+ detection kit (GE Heathcare, Buckinghanshire, UK). Primary cultures of patient fibroblasts were grown for 24 h in minimal medium (DMEM High Glucose), then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with 50 nM [3H]-DEX (1517 GBq/mmol; Perkin Elmer) in the presence or absence of 25 mM unlabeled DEX. Specific [3H]-DEX binding was determined as the difference between total and nonspecific binding and was expressed as sites/cell. Electromobility shift assays were essentially performed as previously described. Purified complementary oligonucleotides (GRE-forward: 5\u2032-AGCTGCTCAGCTAGAACACTCTGTTCTCTACT-3\u2032 and GRE-reverse 5\u2032-AGCTAGTAGAGAACAGAGTGTTCTAGCTAGC-3\u2032) were annealed and radiolabeled with [32P]-dCTP (Perkin-Elmer) using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) to a specific activity of approximately 108 cpm/\u00b5g of DNA. In vitro translated wildtype and mutated GR were incubated with radiolabeled GRE probe for 15 min at 25\u00b0C in the absence or presence of 100-molar excess of labeled GRE and separated from free dsDNA by non-denaturing electrophoresis in a 4.5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (37\u22361) gel for 1 h at 200V (40 mA) in 0.25\u00d7 TBE (50 mM Tris, 50 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA). Gels were dried and exposed to X-ray film at \u221280\u00b0C. WT and mutated GR transfected cells were grown on acid-etched and poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips. After DXM treatment, cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS, fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution in PEM buffer (0.1 M PIPES, 2 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2), permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer for 30 min, and quenched in sodium borohydride (0.5 mg/ml in PEM buffer). Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h (RT) in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST before overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with anti-GR antibody (AbC10-G015) and subsequently with goat anti-mouse antibody-Alexa 555 (Molecular Probes). Cells were postfixed and counterstained with DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (0.5 mg/ml for 1 min), rinsed in water, and mounted onto slides (ProLong Gold; Molecular Probes). We used nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis multi-variance analysis followed by a post-test analysis of Dunn's comparison test (Prism 4, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA)."}, "23285048": {"pmid": "23285048", "pmcid": "PMC3527506", "title": "Context- and Cell-Dependent Effects of Delta-Like 4 Targeting in the Bone Marrow Microenvironment", "abstract": "\nDelta-like 4 (Dll4) is a ligand of the Notch pathway family which has been widely studied in the context of tumor angiogenesis, its blockade shown to result in non-productive angiogenesis and halted tumor growth. As Dll4 inhibitors enter the clinic, there is an emerging need to understand their side effects, namely the systemic consequences of Dll4:Notch blockade in tissues other than tumors. The present study focused on the effects of systemic anti-Dll4 targeting in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Here we show that Dll4 blockade with monoclonal antibodies perturbs the BM vascular niche of sub-lethally irradiated mice, resulting in increased CD31+, VE-Cadherin+ and c-kit+ vessel density, and also increased megakaryocytes, whereas CD105+, VEGFR3+, SMA+ and lectin+ vessel density remained unaltered. We investigated also the expression of angiocrine genes upon Dll4 treatment in vivo, and demonstrate that IGFbp2, IGFbp3, Angpt2, Dll4, DHH and VEGF-A are upregulated, while FGF1 and CSF2 are reduced. In vitro treatment of endothelial cells with anti-Dll4 reduced Akt phosphorylation while maintaining similar levels of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. Besides its effects in the BM vascular niche, anti-Dll4 treatment perturbed hematopoiesis, as evidenced by increased myeloid (CD11b+), decreased B (B220+) and T (CD3+) lymphoid BM content of treated mice, with a corresponding increase in myeloid circulating cells. Moreover, anti-Dll4 treatment also increased the number of CFU-M and -G colonies in methylcellulose assays, independently of Notch1. Finally, anti-Dll4 treatment of donor BM improved the hematopoietic recovery of lethally irradiated recipients in a transplant setting. Together, our data reveals the hematopoietic (BM) effects of systemic anti-Dll4 treatment result from qualitative vascular changes and also direct hematopoietic cell modulation, which may be favorable in a transplant setting.\n", "fulltext": "Hematopoiesis is the process by which new blood cells are generated and occurs mainly in the adult bone marrow (BM). The importance of the BM microenvironment in regulating hematopoiesis has been amply demonstrated by studying the so-called \u201cstem cell niches\u201d, in which the endosteal and vascular niches were shown to support hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation\u2013. However, recent findings have proven this interpretation of the BM stem cell niches may to be too simplistic,. Interestingly, the vascular niche is not only critical for HSC maintenance\u2013 and differentiation, but also for hematopoietic reconstitution and recovery\u2013. Mechanistically, the BM endothelial cells were shown to express different \u201cangiocrine genes\u201d, whose production is dependent on the activation of Akt or MAP kinase signaling pathways, and whose function is to restore hematopoiesis following insults such as irradiation. Therefore, targeting the BM vascular niche and angiocrine genes production to modulate hematopoietic recovery and function may be of clinical relevance. We found Delta-like 4 (Dll4, a ligand of the Notch signaling pathway expressed by BM endothelial cells) targeting to potentially fulfill this aim. Blockade of Dll4-mediated Notch signaling has been described as a modulator of tumor angiogenesis. Indeed, its inhibition, by promoting non-productive angiogenesis, was shown to be an effective treatment strategy in pre-clinical solid tumor models\u2013, and is already being tested in clinical trials,. We have explored the effects of Dll4 blockade in the BM vascular niche using two strategies, first by using different endothelial cell markers, to assess qualitative changes in BM vasculature, and secondly by exploring the modulation of \u201cangiocrine genes\u201d in vivo and EC-specific activation of signaling pathways in vitro. To characterize the phenotypic response of the BM vascular niche to anti-Dll4 antibody treatment, we used different EC markers (CD31, CD105, VE-Cadherin, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) and Lycopersicon esculentum lectin\u2013), SMA (smooth muscle actin, a pericyte marker), and by counting megakaryocyte numbers (which are part of the BM vascular niche, and are CD41+\u2013). Additionally, we assessed the effect of Dll4 blockade in modulating the expression of angiocrine genes and activation of signaling pathways on BM endothelial cells in vitro. We also determined how Dll4 systemic blockade interfered with hematopoiesis by directly affecting hematopoietic cells. Dll4 has been shown to be involved in HSCs self-renewal and proliferation\u2013, megakaryocytic differentiation, and lymphoid modulation,\u2013. However, the hematopoietic effects of Dll4 blockade, namely in the setting of perturbed BM function, had not been previously shown. We performed in vivo phenotypic characterization of the main BM hematopoietic lineages following anti-Dll4 treatment, in vitro functional assays to identify hematopoietic cell-specific modulation of anti-Dll4, and an in vivo BM transplant (BMT) following lethal irradiation. For the in vivo characterization of the main BM hematopoietic lineages we quantified myeloid (CD11b+) and lymphoid (B, B220+ and T, CD3+) BM content\u2013. Additionally, we measured hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs; stem cell antigen (Sca)-1+ and fetal liver kinase (Flk)-1\u2212), and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC; Sca1+Flk1+\u2013, in BM and peripheral blood (PB). The effects of anti-Dll4 treatment in HSPCs commitment and differentiation was assessed in vitro by performing colony-forming units (CFU) assays in methylcellulose,. We show that systemic Dll4 blockade affects the BM vascular niche and hematopoietic cell differentiation, while having limited effects on the expression of \u201cangiocrine genes\u201d or on EC activation. Interestingly, in a BMT setting, anti-Dll4 treatment of donor mice results in faster lymphoid and erythroid recovery of recipient mice. Together, we show that anti-Dll4 treatment perturbs BM recovery following irradiation, which can be clinically relevant in a BMT setting. The following animal experiments were performed following approval of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia Animal Care Committee and Review Board. Balb/c mice (6\u20138 weeks old) were sub-lethally irradiated (300rad), and subjected to treatment with neutralizing anti-mouse Dll4 antibody (HMD4-2),,, 12.5 g/kg, intraperitoneally (IP), every 2 days or every 3 days, for 15 days, starting 1 day after irradiation. In parallel, control mice were injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). All experiments refer to 15\u201320 days counting from the day of irradiation. Each irradiated group consisted of 3 control and 3 anti-Dll4 treated animals, and the experiments were performed 3 times. The Dll4 knockout mice experiments were performed with the approval of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Lisbon Ethics and Animal Welfare Committee. Dll4 conditional knockout mice (Dll4lox/lox) were generated as follows: conditional KO Dll4 vector with 2 loxP sequences flanking the 3 first gene exons was inserted in EE cells by electroporation. The neomycin resistant clones were selected, injected in blastocysts and transferred to pseudo-pregnant females. The offspring were crossed with h-ActB-flp mice to remove neoR, and the resulting littermates were crossed to obtain Flp\u2212/\u2212. These mice were then crossed with VECadCreERT2 mice, a gift from Dr. Ralph Adams, to produce a tamoxifen-inducible endothelial-specific Dll4 loss-of-function line (VECadCreERT2Dll4lox/lox). Tamoxifen induction was performed for 5 days, 50mg/kg/day. All experiments refer to 31\u201334 days counting from the first day of induction. Each group consisted of 12 Dll4lox/lox and 11 VECadCreERT2Dll4lox/lox animals. Peripheral blood was collected from the heart in EDTA-coated tubes (Multivette 600, Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany) and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes. BM was flushed from the long bones with PBS 0.5% BSA and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 15 minutes. PB and BM cells were collected for FACS analysis. Femur BM was flushed with PBS and immediately centrifuged at 800 rpm for 15 minutes. Plasma was then collected for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. Balb/c mice (6 weeks old) were lethally irradiated (800rad), and subjected to BMT 24 hours later. Cells for BMT were collected from the femur of previously treated or control animals (two recipients per donor animal), on day 15 of treatment. Viable nucleated cells were counted in a Countless Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 2.5\u00d7106 total BM cells were injected intravenously. BM for BMT was collected from 3 control and 3 anti-Dll4 treated animals. Recipient animals were treated with enrofloxacin 10 mg/kg every day for 7 days post-irradiation. Complete blood counts (CBC) of tail vein PB was performed at weeks 1 and 2 post-transplantation. Human umbilical cord vein ECs (HUVECs) (Clonetics, Lonza, Switzerland) were cultured in EBM-2 supplemented with EGM-2 SingleQuots, 2 mg/mL BBE (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Murine bone marrow-derived stromal cell line S17 was cultured in complete medium \u2013 Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium, 2 mM L-Glutamine, antibiotic-antimycotic (all from Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 50 \u00b5M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) \u2013 plus 10% FBS. BM mononuclear Lin\u2212Sca1+ cells (104), collected from anti-Dll4 treated and control animals and sorted in FacsAria (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), were plated onto cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium (MethoCult GF M3434, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Resulting colonies are single-cell derived and represent the original cell\u2019s identity,. Colonies were scored after 1 and 2 weeks of culture, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Human cord blood mononuclear cells were lineage depleted using lineage cell depletion kit, as shown in Table S1. 104 Lin\u2212 cells were plated onto cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium (MethoCult GF H4434, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). Treatment with neutralizing anti-human Dll4 antibody (MHD4-46),, 50 \u00b5g/mL, and/or anti-human Notch1 antibody (MHN1-128), 10 \u00b5g/mL, started the day after the establishment of the culture and was performed every 2 days. Colonies were scored after 1 week of culture, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. BM and PB mononuclear cells were stained for T, B, myeloid and progenitor cell markers, using the antibodies indicated on Table S1, 1 h at 4\u00b0C. BM cells were stained for megakaryocytes, following the same protocol. Flow cytometry was performed on FACSCalibur and analyzed with Cell Quest Software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Livers were formalin-fixed and processed for routine histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Bones were formalin-fixed, EDTA-decalcified and processed for routine histopathology. Immunohistochemistry for the antigens indicated on Table S1 was performed in the humerus, on 3 \u00b5m slices, at 3 distinct levels for each bone/mouse (40 \u00b5m distance). Sections were incubated with primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, immunostaining proceeded according to the visualization system manufacturer\u2019s instructions and counterstained with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin. Immunofluorescence for the antigens indicated on Table S1 was performed in the humerus, on 3 \u00b5m slices. Primary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (VectorLaboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (VectorLaboratories, Burlingame, CA) was injected in the tail vein (100 \u00b5g, from a 500 \u00b5g/mL solution). Mice were euthanized 5 minutes later, and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Femur BM was then flushed off and further fixed in 4% PFA overnight, dehydrated in a sucrose gradient for one day, and cryopreserved in Tissue-Tek Optimum Cutting Temperature (Sakura, Torrance, CA). Cryosections (15 \u00b5m) were stained with ToPro-3 (Table S1) plus 100 \u00b5g/mL ribonuclease A (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) at 4\u00b0C overnight, to visualize nuclei, and mounted in Mowiol 4\u201388 (pH 8.5 in Tris-HCl and glycerol; Calbiochem Merk Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Third passage HUVEC at 70% confluence were cultured in EBM-2 plus 1% FBS for 17 hours, left untreated or treated with neutralizing anti-human Dll4 antibody (MHD4-46),, 50 \u00b5g/mL, or PBS, for 2 hours. Cells were then lysed with RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate), and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 12% Mini-Protean TGX precast gel (BioRad, US). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Roosendaal, Netherlands) and subjected to standard immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated on Table S1. For in vivo assessments, total BM from control or anti-Dll4 treated mice was flushed off in PBS, centrifuged 1200 rpm 5 min, and collected to TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For in vitro assessments, third passage HUVEC at 70% confluence were starved with EBM-2 plus 1% FBS overnight, and treated with neutralizing anti-human Dll4 antibody (MHD4-46),, 50 \u00b5g/mL, or PBS, for 16 hours, then collected to TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was produced with SuperScript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by using random-sequence hexamer primers (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Real-time PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (both from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplification of 18S rRNA, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) and \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22MG) were used for sample normalization; data were analyzed using all these endogenous controls and plotted using HPRT only. Primer sequences are as described on Table S2. RT-PCR data were analyzed by DataAssist software (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA) using 18S, \u03b22MG and HPRT as endogenous controls, and plotted using HPRT as endogenous control. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Data were analyzed using unpaired two-tailed student's t test. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. We asked whether a therapeutic (systemic) approach of Dll4 blockade would affect the BM vascular niche. For that, we sub-lethally irradiated mice (300rad), therefore inducing myeloablation and BM turnover, and systemically treated them with a neutralizing anti-Dll4 antibody, HMD4-2 (Figure 1A). We used six different vascular markers to characterize the effects of anti-Dll4 in the BM vascular niche: CD31, CD105 and VE-Cadherin antibodies, widely used to identify BM endothelial cells,; VEGFR3 antibody, described as a specific marker of BM sinusoids; SMA antibody, which labels pericytes in arteries and capillaries-; and Lycopersicon esculentum lectin, used as a pan-endothelial marker that stains perfused vessels,. By day 15 post-irradiation, increased number of CD31+ and VE-Cadherin+ vessels were scored in the BM of anti-Dll4 treated mice, with no significant changes in CD105+, VEGFR3+, SMA+, and lectin+ vessels (Figure 1B, C, S1A). VE-Cadherin mRNA expression was also increased in vivo and in vitro following anti-Dll4 treatment (Figure S1B, C). Furthermore, anti-Dll4 treatment following myeloablation also increased BM megakaryocyte content (Figure 1D). BM VE-Cadherin (endothelial) expression had been previously associated with an increase in megakaryocyte numbers. Moreover, it has been reported that Dll4 impairs the final stages of megakaryocytic differentiation, without affecting its early stages, also concordant with our data. Therefore, the increase in megakaryocyte numbers herein described might be due to the increase in VE-Cadherin expression, to a direct effect of anti-Dll4 treatment on megakaryocytes, or both. These results were surprising, as previous work has shown quantitative vascular changes in tumors upon anti-Dll4 treatment,. However, in our study, we observed a qualitative modulation of the BM vascular niche (as suggested by the use of the different vascular markers). Therefore, we further characterized the type of blood vessels in the BM microenvironment, following anti-Dll4 treatment. As previously described, we found VEGFR3 to be a specific sinusoidal marker, lectin to stain all types of blood vessels in the BM (Figure S1A), and SMA to stain for pericyte-covered (stable) blood vessels, such as arteries and capillaries, (Figure S1A, S2a,c). CD31, CD105 and VE-Cadherin have been extensively used as BM endothelial cells markers,,,, but the CD31 and VE-Cadherin specific modulation led us to further characterize these vessels. As shown in Figure S2, BM stable vessels are CD105high/low, VE-Cadherinhigh and CD31+, whereas BM sinusoids are CD105+, VE-Cadherin+/\u2212, and CD31+/\u2212 in sub-lethally irradiated mice. Next, we asked whether these BM vascular niche-specific changes were a direct effect of Dll4 blockade on the endothelial cells. For that, we used inducible, conditional knockout (VECad-Cre-ERT2Dll4lox/lox) mice and assessed the number of CD31, CD105 and VE-Cadherin vessels, as well as the percentage of megakaryocytes in the BM. Consistent with the effects reported earlier (seen after systemic anti-Dll4 treatment), we observed a similar phenotype in this genetic targeting of Dll4, with an increase in CD31+ and VE-Cadherin+ vessels without modulation of CD105+ vessels, and an increase in the percentage of CD41+ megakaryocytes (Figure S3). These data suggest the effects of anti-Dll4 blockade in the BM vascular niche are exerted predominantly on VE-Cadherin-expressing BM endothelial cells. The BM vascular modifications herein described were accompanied by systemic defects in the vascular compartment of the liver (Figure S4), as previously reported by others. Together, these data suggest systemic Dll4 blockade perturbs the BM vascular niche, favoring CD31+ and VE-Cadherin+ endothelial cells expansion and increasing BM megakaryocyte content. Next, we investigated the mechanisms by which anti-Dll4 could affect endothelial cells function. First, we characterized the BM endothelial phenotype induced by systemic anti-Dll4 blockade in more detail. We used a stem cell marker, c-kit, and found some BM vessels to be c-kit+ (Figure 2A). C-kit is unappreciated as a BM vessel marker, despite in vitro reports of c-kit expression in primary BM endothelial cells. Some BM vessels were previously shown to express another stem cell marker, stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1), but its endothelial functions are still unknown. The overall percentage of c-kit+ vessels (assessed from double labeling with CD105) also increased in anti-Dll4 treated animals (Figure 2A, B). Next, we searched for modulation of \u201cangiocrine genes\u201d and of MAPK and Akt signaling pathways in our system, since these were considered crucial for the instructive role exerted by the BM vascular niche in promoting hematopoietic recovery. We performed qPCR analysis on a set of angiocrine genes, chosen because these are expressed depending on the activation state of BM endothelial cells and because of their involvement in hematopoietic recovery and vascular remodeling (Figure 2C, S5). Anti-Dll4 treated animals showed a significant decrease in BM expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and colony stimulating factor 2 (granulocyte-macrophage, CSF2) and an increase in insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFbp2), IGFbp3, angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2), Dll4, desert hedgehog (DHH) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) (Figure 2C, S5A). This increase in VEGF-A (but not SDF-1\u03b1 or stem cell factor, SCF) mRNA levels was accompanied by increased VEGF-A protein levels in BM plasma, assessed by ELISA (Figure S5B). In order to identify endothelial-specific angiocrine gene modulation, we treated HUVEC in vitro with anti-Dll4 antibody. Anti-Dll4 treatment resulted in a significant decrease in FGF1, CSF3, but not CSF2, and an increase in VEGF-A expression (Figure S5C). Genes whose expression was not changed in vivo were modulated in vitro, namely FGF2, CSF3, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and SCF (Figure S5C). Dll4 expression, however, was decreased in vitro, and increased in vivo (Figure S5C). The latter phenotypes can be interpreted as a non-endothelial cell-specific angiocrine gene modulation; another possibility is that the timing, activation state or endothelial cell identity of this in vitro assessment does not mimic BM endothelial cell characteristics. After characterizing angiocrine gene modulation, we searched for alterations of Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways induced by anti-Dll4 treatment. In light of the theory supported by Kobayashi et al., the fine-tuning between Akt and MAPK activation in BM endothelial cells balances self-renewal vs. differentiation of HSPCs. We found that treatment of HUVEC with anti-Dll4 decreased Akt phosphorylation, but did not induce significant changes in ERK1/2 activation (Figure 2D, E), which supports the notion that reduced Akt and equal MAPK promotes the maintenance of the HSPCs pool. These data suggest that modulating the BM vascular niche by anti-Dll4 treatment increases c-kit+ vessels and affects BM endothelial cells activation state and angiocrine factors production. Having shown systemic anti-Dll4 treatment affected BM endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro, including angiocrine gene modulation, next we explored the hematopoietic effects of anti-Dll4 treatment in BM hematopoietic recovery following myeloablation. Both BM and PB from anti-Dll4 treated mice showed increased myeloid cell content (CD11b+) (Figure 3A). The BM lymphocytic compartment was also affected by the anti-Dll4 treatment; there was a significant decrease in both CD3+ T and B220+ B lymphocytes, with no significant changes in the PB (Figure 3A). In contrast, anti-Dll4 treatment did not seem to affect BM progenitor cell populations. As shown in Figure 3B, there were no significant changes in the percentage of BM or PB EPCs (Sca1+Flk1+) or HSPCs (Sca1+Flk1\u2212), with a trend for increased BM HSPCs (p\u200a=\u200a0.07) in anti-Dll4 treated mice. After characterizing the global alterations in hematopoiesis upon anti-Dll4 treatment, we performed in vitro CFU assays, counting single-cell derived colonies, which represent either multipotent (CFU-granulocyte-erythrocyte-macrophage-megakaryocyte, CFU-GEMM), bipotent (CFU-granulocyte-macrophage) or unipotent (CFU-monocyte, CGU-M, CFU-granulocyte, CFU-G, or CFU-erythrocyte, CFU-E),. These assays allowed us to evaluate if the hematopoietic effects seen with anti-Dll4 treatment could also be due to direct effects on hematopoietic elements, namely in their differentiation capacity. For that, we sorted BM HSPCs (Lin-Sca1+) from anti-Dll4 treated and control mice and cultured these in methylcellulose in vitro,. In accordance with the lack of change in HSPCs frequency seen after anti-Dll4 treatment (Figure 3B), this did not affect HSPCs CFU potential, or colony number (Figure S6). Next, we also assessed the direct effects of anti-Dll4 treatment on HSPCs, by treating na\u00efve HSPCs with anti-Dll4 in vitro, in CFU assays. We further sought to determine whether Notch1 was the receptor involved, by blocking Notch1 using a monoclonal antibody either alone or in conjugation with anti-Dll4. We induced cord blood HSPCs\u2019 (Lin-) differentiation in methylcellulose in the presence of either PBS, anti-Dll4, anti-Notch1, or the 2 neutralizing antibodies together. As shown in Figure 3C, anti-Dll4 treatment shifted differentiation towards the myeloid lineage (increased CFU-M and CFU-G colonies), an effect independent of anti-Notch1 treatment, as anti-Notch1 did not affect CFU-M or CFU-G colony number. Anti-Dll4 treatment reduced multipotent HSPCs (CFU-GEMM colonies), as did anti-Notch1 and the conjugation of both antibodies, indicating that anti-Dll4 treatment reduced multipotent HSPCs by reducing Notch1-mediated Notch signalling. Anti-Notch1, alone or combined with anti-Dll4, decreased HSPCs potential to differentiate into the erythroid lineage (CFU-E), and decreased HSPCs differentiation potential (total colony number). Both treatments reduced multipotent HSPCs (CFU-GEMM) (Figure 3C). Taken together, these data suggest that besides affecting the BM vascular niche, anti-Dll4 treatment also perturbs hematopoietic cell differentiation and commitment. Next, we assessed whether the BM changes induced by anti-Dll4 treatment affected the efficiency of BM hematopoietic recovery in a transplant setting. For this purpose, we lethally irradiated recipient mice, which were subsequently transplanted with BM from untreated or anti-Dll4 treated mice (Figure 4A). Mice that received BM from anti-Dll4 treated mice showed evidence of improved hematopoietic recovery following lethal myeloablation (significantly faster recovery of leukocytes, hematocrit and lymphocytes), assessed by CBC (Figure 4B). These data suggest that treatment of BM donor mice with anti-Dll4 improves hematopoietic recovery following lethal myeloablation. The data presented in this paper show that systemic Dll4 blockade induces qualitative changes in the BM vasculature (which becomes more heterogeneous), which may be favorable in a BMT setting. A number of studies have proven the relevance of the BM vascular niche in hematopoiesis, but the heterogeneity of the BM vasculature has only been recently objectively assessed, clearly suggesting further detailed studies are needed to understand the importance of the different BM vessels for normal BM function\u2013,,,,\u2013. We describe that systemic targeting Dll4, which has previously been shown to confine to particular vascular ECs (called \u201ctip cells\u201d), changes the vascular identity in the BM. Following myeloablation, we applied an anti-Dll4 treatment, similar to what is currently being performed in phase I clinical trials to treat patients with solid malignancies. This treatment resulted in different vascular alterations in the BM, as shown by increased CD31, VE-Cadherin and c-kit+ cells, without quantitative changes in CD105+, VEGFR3+, SMA+ or lectin+ vessels. The global BM vessel identity is therefore altered upon anti-Dll4 treatment. Interestingly, CD31 is indispensable for several stages of hematopoiesis, endothelial cells survival and angiogenesis, which in turn are all crucial for hematopoietic recovery following myeloablation,,\u2013. VE-Cadherin is also required for hematopoiesis and angiogenesis,,. The role of c-kit, in ECs, however, is unknown; studies assessing its role in angiogenesis and, more specifically, in the BM microenvironment, will be required for proper interpretation of the data presented in this paper. Regarding the modulation of \u201cangiocrine genes\u201d, besides the increase in CD31+ BM vessels previously described, we detected a significant increase in IGFbp2, IGFbp3, Angpt2, DHH and VEGF-A and a decrease in FGF1 and CSF2 expression in whole BM extracts from anti-Dll4 treated animals (Figure 2C). Even though FGF1, which is decreased upon anti-Dll4 treatment, prevents vessel regression, IGFbp3, Angpt2 and VEGF-A, which are increased, are modulators of vascular survival and re-growth, which, as previously mentioned, is crucial for hematopoietic recovery following myeloablation\u2013. Despite the decrease of CSF2, which is associated with a decrease in the myeloid lineage, IGF1 induces proliferation and differentiation of myeloid lineage cells, and DHH is important for granulocyte differentiation/proliferation in the BM; moreover, the myeloid modulation we describe may be due to a direct effect of anti-Dll4 treatment on hematopoietic cells (Figure 3C). Both HSPCs and myeloid cells are reported to express Dll4. We show that anti-Dll4 treatment of HSPCs in vitro increases CFU-M and CFU-G number, independently of Notch1 modulation, but decreases multipotential progenitor cell-derived CFUs, similar to anti-Notch1 treatment (Figure 3C). VEGF-A blocks both B and T lymphopoiesis\u2013. The altered BM lymphocyte content observed might either be simply due to the increased myeloid content, to the VEGF-A increase in the BM, to the direct effect of anti-Dll4 in lymphoid cells, and/or to the effect of Dll4 inhibition in secondary hematopoietic organs, such as the thymus and spleen, which were previously shown to express Dll4,,,\u2013. Regarding the signaling pathways that are proposed to trigger the EC role in hematopoiesis, we observed a decrease of Akt activation, without significant changes in Erk1/2 (Figure 2D, E) after exposing EC to anti-Dll4. It should be noted that Dll4 has been shown to modulate the MAPK activation on a stimulus-depending manner; the technical constraints to study EC-specific signaling pathways activation in vivo led us to an in vitro study, which may not completely mirror the in vivo systemic effects of anti-Dll4, nor the proper stimulus acting in different BM microenvironments. In vivo assessments showed both HSPC phenotype and function (reconstitution potential) were not impaired by systemic anti-Dll4 treatment, and in vitro differentiation of HSPCs collected from the BM of anti-Dll4 treated mice was also not impaired, meaning HSPCs are unaffected by in vivo anti-Dll4 treatment (Figure 3B, 4B and S6). Systemic anti-Dll4 treatment of donor mice in a setting of BMT resulted in a mild, but significant, accelerated hematopoietic recovery of recipient mice (Figure 4),. For a successful BMT, HSPCs must home and engraft in the BM, a process for which BM ECs are essential\u2013. In this study, we transplanted whole BM mononuclear cells; this fraction includes BM ECs, which were previously shown to incorporate in the BM vasculature. Interestingly, vascular CD31 and VE-Cadherin regulate the transition of HSPCs between blood and BM,. The increased VE-Cadherin and CD31-positive BM vessels from anti-Dll4 treated donor mice may have enhanced the homing of HSPCs in recipient mice, thereby leading to an overall faster hematopoietic recovery. Interestingly, we have also observed an increase in Dll4 expression in the BM of anti-Dll4 treated donor mice (Figure 2C). Given that anti-Dll4 treatment was performed only in donor mice, and not in recipients, the transplanted cells may have increased Dll4 protein levels. Remarkably, in vitro data have shown that increasing Dll4 signaling in HSPCs increases erythroid commitment and HSPCs proliferation, induces commitment and complete maturation to the T cell lineage, and maintains HSPCs stemness,,,. In our BMT model, these effects were transient, because the treatment was not maintained thoughout the process of hematopoietic recovery; therefore, the lymphoproliferative disease that mice overexpressing Dll4 in the hematopoietic lineage are expected to develop was not observed (evidenced by the long term survival of recipient mice),. Alternatively, or in addition, IGFbp2 and IGFbp3 showed increased expression following anti-Dll4 treatment; these factors, by stabilizing IGF1, may contribute towards the effects of anti-Dll4 in promoting hematopoietic recovery following BMT. Together, our data shows that targeting Dll4 alters the vascular identity in the BM, mildly affects hematopoiesis, and promotes a faster hematopoietic recovery after BMT. We have characterized the BM vascular niche and provide evidence of its heterogeneity, which may create different microenvironments within the BM. This assessment may be particularly interesting to explore, as relevant information regarding the functional characterization of hematopoietic stem cell niches can be obtained. We further suggest anti-Dll4 blockade may be an interesting therapeutic approach in a BMT setting."}, "22808010": {"pmid": "22808010", "pmcid": "PMC3396641", "title": "Defining an EPOR- Regulated Transcriptome for Primary Progenitors, including Tnfr-sf13c as a Novel Mediator of EPO- Dependent Erythroblast Formation", "abstract": "\nCertain concepts concerning EPO/EPOR action modes have been challenged by in vivo studies: Bcl-x levels are elevated in maturing erythroblasts, but not in their progenitors; truncated EPOR alleles that lack a major p85/PI3K recruitment site nonetheless promote polycythemia; and Erk1 disruption unexpectedly bolsters erythropoiesis. To discover novel EPO/EPOR action routes, global transcriptome analyses presently are applied to interrogate EPO/EPOR effects on primary bone marrow-derived CFUe-like progenitors. Overall, 160 EPO/EPOR target transcripts were significantly modulated 2-to 21.8-fold. A unique set of EPO-regulated survival factors included Lyl1, Gas5, Pim3, Pim1, Bim, Trib3 and Serpina 3g. EPO/EPOR-modulated cell cycle mediators included Cdc25a, Btg3, Cyclin-d2, p27-kip1, Cyclin-g2 and CyclinB1-IP-1. EPO regulation of signal transduction factors was also interestingly complex. For example, not only Socs3 plus Socs2 but also Spred2, Spred1 and Eaf1 were EPO-induced as negative-feedback components. Socs2, plus five additional targets, further proved to comprise new EPOR/Jak2/Stat5 response genes (which are important for erythropoiesis during anemia). Among receptors, an atypical TNF-receptor Tnfr-sf13c was up-modulated >5-fold by EPO. Functionally, Tnfr-sf13c ligation proved to both promote proerythroblast survival, and substantially enhance erythroblast formation. The EPOR therefore engages a sophisticated set of transcriptome response circuits, with Tnfr-sf13c deployed as one novel positive regulator of proerythroblast formation.\n", "fulltext": "As committed erythroid progenitors transit through a CFU-e stage, proerythroblast formation becomes dependent upon key signals transduced by EPO's cell surface receptor (EPOR). Interest in better understanding EPO effects (and EPOR action mechanisms) recently has intensified. This is based, in part, on the clinical emergence of new EPO orthologues and mimetics, and on EPO's ability to cytoprotect select non-hematopoietic tissues from ischemic injury; to regulate select immune responses; and to modulate susceptibility to diabetes. Via poorly understood routes, EPO also may be associated with hypertensive and thrombolytic events, and as used to treat the anemia of chemotherapy may worsen the progression of certain cancers. With regards to action mechanisms, the EPOR occurs pre-assembled with Jak2 kinase (as apparently paired dimer sets),. EPO binding conformationally alters EPOR complexes. This leads to Jak2 activation, and the phosphorylation of up to eight cytoplasmic EPOR PY sites. One EPOR/Jak2 signaling axis involves EPOR PY479 recruitment of p85-alpha plus p110 PI3K. Disruption of p85-alpha is known to limit fetal erythropoiesis (and leads to the sustained expression of nucleated erythrocytes). Nonetheless, mutated EPOR forms that lack this PY479 PI3K docking site efficiently support erythropoiesis. Fully PY-deficient EPOR forms that retain only a box-1,2 Jak2 binding domain also can support erythropoiesis at steady-state, but are markedly defective during anemia,. A pathway that couples to EPOR PY- independent mechanisms involves a Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk axis. However, candidate necessary-and-sufficient roles for Erk's have been discounted by the recent observation that erythropoiesis can be bolstered when Erk1 is disrupted. A third central EPOR signaling route involves a Jak2-plus-Stat5 axis which has been shown to be important for EPO-dependent erythropoiesis during anemia. Original studies of Stat5 disruption per se yielded disparate results for erythropoietic roles,. Full deletion of Stat-5a and -5b loci, however, has since been shown to markedly compromise erythropoiesis. Among candidate Stat5 targets, Bcl-x previously was proposed to comprise one important EPO/EPOR- response factor whose anti-apoptotic actions might largely explain EPO's effects. Follow-up studies in primary bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells, however, have challenged this EPO/EPOR- Bclx connection, and instead point to roles for Bcl-xL within maturing late-stage erythroblasts,. Together, such considerations raise important questions concerning how much is well understood about key EPO/EPOR response circuits, and effects. Towards advancing insight into EPO/EPOR action, our laboratory recently has applied basic gene profiling approaches to initially identify select EPO-modulated targets, and for these few factors has generated basic evidence for functional significance. Examples include Podocalyxin as a proposed mediator of erythroblast adhesion/migration; Cyclin G2 as an EPO/EPOR- repressed cell cycle inhibitor; and Serpina-3g as an EPO- induced candidate erythropoietic factor. To broaden insight into EPO action mechanisms, we presently report on global transcript response events that EPO regulates within primary bone marrow CFUe- like progenitors. Attention is first given to candidate mediators of EPO's effects on response genes. Subsequent analyses address functional sets of EPO/EPOR targets which proved to include unique sets as regulators of proerythroblast survival, cell cycle progression, signal transduction, negative-feedback factors, and cytokines plus receptors. Within each functional sub-set (including delineated EPOR/JAK2/STAT5 targets), specific EPO/EPOR- modulated factors are described. Among cytokines-plus-receptors, one prime EPO-EPOR induced target proved to be a pro-survival TNF receptor, Tnfr-sf13c,. As engaged in lymphoid cells by its BAFF ligand (B-cell activating factor TNF family), Tnfr-sf13c is essential for lymphoid progenitor cell survival and B-cell formation. Within primary erythroid progenitors, Tnfr-sf13c (as induced by EPO) is now shown to enhance proerythroblast survival, and in addition, to promote the formation of late-stage Ter119pos erythroblasts. Overall findings are discussed in the contexts of unique response circuits that the EPOR regulates within primary bone marrow progenitors to sustain the balanced production of red blood cells at steady-state, and over a dynamic range of rates during anemia. Unless otherwise indicated, C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were used at age 8\u201314 weeks as a source of bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells (EPC's). Mice harboring the knocked-in minimal EPOR alleles EPOR-H, and EPOR-HM were as characterized by Menon et al. All protocols and procedures were approved by the IACUC of the Maine Medical Center Research Institute (Protocol number 0911). Bone marrow cells were prepared from femurs and tibiae as previously described,,,. EPC's were then expanded in SP34ex medium supplemented with 2.5 U/mL EPO, 100ng/mL mSCF, 1uM dexamethasone, 1 uM beta-estradiol, 75 ug/mL holo-transferrin, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mM glutamine, 0.5% BSA (Stem Cell Technologies). At day 3.5 of culture, CFUe-like stage E1 progenitors, stage E2 proerythroblasts, and stage E3 erythroblasts were isolated. Here, optimized multi-step MACS-based procedures were employed as recently detailed, and yielded purities of \u226599.9%. In analyses of stage E1, E2 and/or E3 cells (and per 200 uL assay), 106 cells were incubated (15 minutes, 4\u00b0C) with 5 ug of rat IgG in PBS, 0.5% BSA (0.2 mL assay volumes). PE-Ter119, FITC anti-CD71, and APC-anti-Kit antibodies (1 ug each, BD Biosciences) then were added (30 minutes, 4\u00b0C). Washed cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACScalibur, Cell Quest software). In assays of cell survival, Annexin-V or YoPro3 were used as recently detailed,. Viable cell numbers and frequencies were assayed by Vicell assays. In all experiments, equivalent numbers of gated events were analyzed. In analyses of EPO/EPOR response genes, purified stage E1 CFUe- like progenitors were cultured in the absence of EPO for 5.5 hours in HEPES buffered IMDM supplemented with 10 \u00b5g/mL transferrin, 15 ng/mL insulin, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% BSA, 1.5mM glutamine. Cells were then exposed to EPO (4 U/mL) or carrier (HSA, PBS). At 90 minutes of exposure, cells (from four independent replicates, each plus- and minus- EPO) were lysed directly in Trizol reagent. RNA was then isolated and used to prepare biotinylated probes for array hybridizations. Gene profiling utilized Affymetrix 430 2.0 arrays, GeneChip 3000 scanning and initial GCOS software (Affymetrix) analyses of hybridization signals. Subsequent bioinformatics analyses utilized GeneSpring GX 11.0. Microarray data were assessed for background signals, normalized, and probe-summarized using a GC-RMA algorithm. Significantly expressed genes were identified using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR filter. For EPO modulated genes, a p-value cut-off of 0.05 was used. K-means clustering utilized a Euclidean distance matrix. For significance testing between [\u2212] EPO vs [+] EPO samples, Student's T-testing was used (single tailed). Analyses of transcription factor binding sites represented within K-means clusters #1 \u2013 #4 of EPO- modulated genes was via DiRE,. To further estimate the significance of STAT elements as represented among Cluster #4 EPO-response genes, TransFac was applied (\u2212950 to +50 algorithm). Reverse transcription (standard 1 ug of RNA per reaction) was with Superscript III (and included pre-treatment with DNAse I) (Invitrogen). Quantiative PCR utilized Sybr-green reagents and MyIQ single color real-time PCR detection system (BioRAD). Primer pairs were from SuperArray, and are defined in supplemental materials (Table S1). During definitive erythropoiesis, development beyond the CFU-e stage fails due to disrupted expression of Epo, or the EpoR. Such CFUe- like cells, including those generated using an optimized serum-free ex vivo system for murine bone marrow erythroblast development,,,, exhibit sharp dependency on EPO for their growth and survival. Present global transcriptome analyses therefore focused on this developmental cohort of KitposCD71highTer119neg progenitors (termed \u201cstage E1\u201d). Figure 1A defines approaches employed for the short-term expansion, and isolation of these primary progenitors. For stage E1 cells, the high purity routinely obtained is illustrated via flow cytometric analyses of KitposCD71highTer119neg cells (Figure 1B). This was further confirmed through transcriptome-based analyses of erythroid and possibly contaminating B-cell, T-cell and myeloid cell markers. May-Grumwald cytospins of stage E1 cells also are shown (Figures 1C, 1D). Pilot experiments next served to assess time-courses for EPO-induction of four known response genes as Cis, Pim1, Socs3 and Podocalyxin. As analyzed at 10, 30, 90 and 270 minute intervals, near maximal induction of these target genes was achieved by 90 minutes (data not shown). With regards to ligand concentration, EPO levels during anemia can increase several hundred-fold (and EPO at 3U/mL is required to support stress BFU-e development, for example). An EPO challenge dose of 4U/mL therefore was used in profiling experiments. Using the above defined conditions, purified CFUe-like cells next were interrogated for EPO/EPOR modulated events using Affymetrix arrays. Specifically, quadruplicate independent samples were interrogated for EPO- challenged stage E1 cells versus unchallenged controls. In these (and all profiling experiments presented below), all samples readily passed all quality control parameters, and signal variance was distributed similarly among replicates (Figure 1E). Figures 1F and 1G illustrate heat-maps for each sample, together with a volcano plot of p-value distributions. When analyzed via GC-RMA algorithms (p\u22640.05) and unpaired Student's T-testing), 196 arrayed genes proved to be significantly EPO- modulated (Figure 1H). Among these target genes, 157 were up-modulated, and 39 were down-modulated (with mean fold- modulations of 3.6 fold, and 2.6 fold, respectively). A consideration of core structure-function features of the EPOR (Figure 2A) prompted an unsupervised clustering approach to sub-categorize EPO/EPOR- response genes. K-means clustering of modulated transcripts resolved four major patterned response sets: 1- induced, 2- moderately induced, 3- repressed, and 4- markedly induced (Figure 2B). This analysis suggested that possible groupings of transcription factor sets may differentially modulate select clusters of EPO/EPOR target genes. In this context, cluster-4 was considered in further detail. Notably, based initially on in silico analyses, essentially all EPO- modulated targets in this subset proved to comprise either known, or predicted Stat5 (or Stat X) targets (Figure 2C). This included six new candidate Stat5 target genes within CFUe- like progenitors as Matr3, Chac1, Ccrn4l, Socs2, Tnfr-sf13c and Rpl12. To critically assess the candidate nature of these targets as EPO/EPOR/Stat5 response genes, independent quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed using CFUe-like progenitors isolated from mice harboring knocked-in EPOR-HM and EPOR-H alleles. The minimal EPOR form EPOR-HM is coupled to JAK2 but lacks all cytoplasmic PY sites, while EPOR-H retains a single PY343 site for Stat5 recruitment. CFUe-like stage-E1 progenitors from bone marrow of EPOR-HM and EPOR-H mice were expanded, purified and cultured without EPO for 5.5 hours. Cells then were exposed to EPO (+/\u22124U/mL). At 90 minutes RNA was isolated, and reverse-transcribed. Quantitative PCR analyses provided independent evidence that each of the above novel cluster-4 EPO response factors represent an EPOR-PY343-Stat5 target (Figure 2D). DiRE analyses of cluster-4 also indicated \u223c33% representation of STAT sites among ten top- occurring transcription factor binding sites (and scored 2nd of 10 in indicated importance) (Figure S1). As points of comparison, DiRE was also applied to analyze predominant representations of transcription factor elements for EPO- response genes within clusters #1, #2 and #3. Within EPO- response gene clusters #1 and #2, STAT binding sites were not enriched (among top-20 enriched motifs). In addition, no known STAT5- induced genes occurred among cluster #1 EPO targets, and within cluster #2 only Cyclin-d2 was represented (and only for a single probe set signal). To inform further, all EPO- modulated genes within each cluster are listed in Table S2 (together with DiRE- predicted transcription factor binding sites). In contrast, within cluster #4 Cyclin-d2 was represented for five probe sets, and T-cell receptor-gamma for three probe sets (for example), data not shown. In addition, cluster #4 contained a number of EPO- modulated genes that previously have been implicated as STAT5 targets (e.g., Socs3, Cis, Pim1, Podocalyxin). STAT5a elements, however, were enriched in DiRE analyses of cluster #3 (although at a lower scoring) (note: DiRE searches and scores full gene loci for conserved, weighed transcription factor binding sites. Positive scores are reported based on numbers of sites with summation for non-coding region sites. DiRE also scores the association of individual transcription factors with the biological function shared by groups of input genes,). Cluster #3 includes transcripts that are down-modulated by EPO. In support of the apparent enrichment of STAT5a sites, inspection of the gene list for cluster #3 (see Table S2) revealed Cyclin G2, Trb2, and Klf3, each of which previously has been implicated to be subject to repression by STAT5,,. By speculation, STAT5a therefore might be more involved in repression within an EPO- response context as contrasted to STAT5b. In keeping with broadening concepts for EPO's effects,,,,,, functional sub-sets of EPO/EPOR- modulated targets included survival factors, cell cycle regulators, signal transduction factors, negative feedback factors and a select set of cytokines plus receptors (as defined in some detail below). In addition, a substantial number of EPO/EPOR response factors sorted to functional categories of transcriptional regulators, cancer biology- associated factors, ribosome biosynthesis regulators, RNA processing factors and metabolic factors. These overall functional sub-sets of EPO/EPOR- modulated factors are outlined in Figure 3A. The latter categories of EPO/EPOR targets are of significant interest, and therefore are further defined in Tables S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8. One prime role ascribed to EPO/EPOR signaling involves anti-apoptotic effects. In highly EPO-dependent CFUe-like stage E1 erythroid progenitors, seven cell survival factors proved to be clear EPO/EPOR target genes (Figure 3B). Pim1 S/T kinase has previously been described. Pim3 (like Pim1) acts via an mTOR-like pathway. In parallel, Gas5, a non-coding RNA that supports mTor expression also was induced (2.6-fold). Lyl1 also comprised a novel EPO/EPOR target, and recently has been shown to act (as a transcriptional regulator) to promote hematopoietic progenitor cell survival. Among Bcl2-related factors, only Bim was EPO/EPOR regulated (2.7-fold repression of this BH3-only, proapoptotic factor). Finally (and as reported recently) the intracellular serpin Serpina-3g and the pseudokinase Trb3 each were strongly EPO-induced. Each has potential anti-apoptotic activities, and each comprises a singular EPO-modulated orthologue within multi-member families (e.g., Tribs-1, -2 and -3) (data not shown). Notably, modulation of the above EPO/EPOR-response genes (Figure 3D) also was validated by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 3B, and Figure S2). Select cell cycle regulators recently have been indicated to also be subject to EPO- modulation. Specifically, the inhibitory cyclin, Cyclin-G2 has been described as a target for EPO repression, and Cyclin-D2 as a target for EPO-induction (each, in part, via an EPOR/Jak2/Stat5 axis),. Beyond Cyclins G2 and D2, global transcriptome analyses revealed four additional EPO-modulated cell cycle regulators (Figure 3C). These first included Btg3 as an E2F-1 regulator (and novel EPO/EPOR target). Also modulated were p27/Kip1 as a repressed target (and CDK2 inhibitor) together with two regulators of phase G2 progression as Cdc25a and a Cyclin B interacting protein, Cyclin B-IP1. EPO therefore appears to engage a select collection of cell cycle regulators which overall are proposed to promote G1 and G2 phase progression within rapidly dividing CFUe-like progenitors. For the above cell cycle regulators (Figures 3C, 3E) EPO/EPOR modulation also was confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 3C, and Figure S2). Next, with regards to an extended category of EPO/EPOR targets as additional signal transduction factors (STF's), global analyses revealed 22 such factors to be significantly modulated. Two STF sub-categories were cytokines plus receptors, and negative feedback factors (Figure 4) (guiding references also are cited in Figure 4 as PMIDs) (also see Figure S3). Among receptors, a TNF receptor, Tnfr-sc13c, proved to be most strongly induced (3.4 to 7.0 \u2013 fold up-modulated due to EPO). Tnfr-sc13c binds BAFF ligand, and as studied to date in B-cells, is an atypical TNF-R which exerts pro-survival effects (Figures 4A and 4C). This factor therefore is the subject of extended functional erythropoietic studies (see following Results sub-section). Lrp8, a receptor for apolipoprotein-E ligands also was induced 1.9 \u2013 to 2.9 \u2013 fold. Interestingly, roles for Lrp8 in platelet function and neural cell migration recenty have been described. In stage-E1 EPC's, EPO also induced the expression of three cytokines: Cmtm6, Gdf3 and Oncostatin-m. Cmtm6 is a chemokine-like factor superfamily member with presently unknown function, while Gdf3 can act as a TGF/BMP antagonist (and may therefore counter inhibitory effects of TGFbeta on erythropoiesis). Oncostatin-m is a known EPO response gene, but recently has been shown to induce hepatocyte hepcidin expression, and to consequently decrease serum iron levels. EPO/EPOR STFs also included five negative feedback factors (Figures 4B, 4D) (guiding references are included as PMIDs) (also see Figure S3). Two are suppressors of cytokine signaling, while three are novel EPO targets as Spred2, Spred1 and Eaf1. SOCS factors act as E3 ubiquitin ligases, and exert feedback effects on activated EPOR/Jak2 complexes. The present results specifically implicate not only Socs-3 but also Socs-2 in this feedback loop. Spreds are adaptor proteins that have been characterized as negative feedback factors in RTK systems, but not in the context of Janus kinase- coupled receptor modulation. Finally, Eaf1 can act as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling. For twelve additional EPO/EPOR modulated STF's, these are described in supplemental text associated with Table 1 (which includes references as PMID's). As defined in Table 1, these include. Pik-3cb, Mobkl1a, Prkcq, Gnb2l1, Gab2, Irs2, Erbb2ip, Tirap, Gnl3, Pnrc1, Nol8, Plek2. Specific roles for Tnfr-sf13c during erythropoiesis next were assessed. EPO- induction in stage E1, E2 and E3 cells first was investigated, and confirmed at each stage (Figure 5A). Steady-state expression also was assayed, and proved to peak in stage E2 proerythroblasts (Figure 5B). The dependency of EPO's induction of Tnfr-sf13c on Stat5 also was confirmed in independent analyses using stage E1 progenitors expressing wt-EPO, EPOR-H or EPOR-HM alleles (Figure 5C). In functional experiments, primary bone marrow (pro)erythroblasts first were prepared essentially as described above for EPO-challenge experiments (including a second depletion of residual Ter119pos cells). Tnfr-sf13c expression then was induced by exposure to EPO (2U/mL) for 4 hours. Cells were washed thrice, and replated in the presence or BAFF (as Tnfr-sf13c's ligand). In parallel, cells were exposed to EPO (also included were no-BAFF, and no-EPO controls). At a subsequent 15 hour time point, possible effects on survival and/or Ter119pos erythroblast formation were assessed (by flow cytometry). Notably, BAFF ligand proved first to cytoprotect erythroid progenitors with an efficiency approaching that of EPO (ie, 60% of survival effects exerted by EPO) (Figure 5D). (For example primary data, also see Figure S4). In addition, BAFF (in the absence of EPO) also proved to clearly support the formation of Ter119pos erythroblasts (again, with substantial efficiency) (Figure 5E). In colony-forming assays, BAFF also moderately enhanced CFUe formation (170.5+/\u221212.3 per 1\u00d7105 BM cells with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL BAFF vs. 143.3+/\u221213.9 with EPO alone, 1 U/mL) (p\u200a=\u200a0.03, Student's T-test for mean values). CFUe formation may be only modestly affected by BAFF-ligand based on apparent actions at a post-CFUe (pro)erythroblast stage. These experiments employing primary bone marrow erythroblasts provide direct evidence for BAFF-ligated Tnfr-sf13c in promoting erythroblast development, and therefore the actions of EPO. This especially applies to developing proerythroblasts with heightened Tnfr-sf13c levels (see schematic model, Figure 6). In related analyses, NCBI Geo databases were used to more broadly consider Tnfrsf13c expression profiles. General comparisons to receptors such as EGF-R and IFNa-R indicated relatively narrow expression distributions for Tnfrsf13c (121,615 and 45,101 positive profiles for EGF+R and FGFR vs 822 for Tnfrsf13c). Factors indicated to regulate Tnfrsf13c also were limited. Cytokines included SDF1, IL4 and IL2 while transcription factors included STAT5b, Zfp3L2 and Pu1 (see Table S9). For each of eight example studies, basic details on mean fold-modulation and experiment design also are provided. (For additional information, please consult the indexed NCBI Geo GDS data sets). Since the cloning of EPO and its receptor, the EPOR system has served well as a paradigm for HGF-R action. Much of our understanding of EPO/EPOR effects, however, depends upon ectopic over-expression in cell line models (which often have been non-erythroid, or non-hematopoietic). In addition, and based on available reagents, attention has been paid predominantly to canonical pathways and signal transduction factors. For the present studies, a prime goal was to employ a transcriptome profiling approach, together with a primary bone marrow CFUe- like target cell population, to better reveal events (initially at a transcript level) that EPO elicits in a bona fide target cell population. Further impetus was provided by unique advances in the short-term expansion and purification of uniform cohorts of bone marrow-derived EPC's. Also, pilot transcriptional analyses in various cell line models proved to yield partially overlapping but otherwise disparate profiles among EPO response genes (eg, differentially regulated orthologues of Pim, Socs, Spry, Spred and Bcl2 factors; no modulation of PodxL) (data not shown). Using a serum-free short-term ex vivo expansion system plus optimized rapid and efficient cell immunoadsorption procedures, sufficient primary stage-E1 bone marrow EPC's presently were prepared in sufficient numbers for robust quadruplicate profiling studies. One related basic point for consideration concerns the choice of stage-E1 CFUe-like cells as a target for EPO-action analyses. Previously, we have shown that with regards to survival effects, EPO can also cytoprotect stage E2 proerythroblasts and stage E3 erythroblasts, but less effectively than for highly-dependent E1 cells,. Stage E1 cells also are more stimulated in their proliferative responses by EPO,. With regards to profiling per se, several features underscore the likelihood that culled transcripts represent EPO/EPOR response genes. First, among 50 factors assayed by quantitative RT-PCR, all except one (Pias3) were confirmed. Second, for the >2-fold modulated set considered, PCA and clustering analyses did not reveal outlying factors. Third, when cluster-4 was independently analyzed, all EPOR targets tested were validated. In addition (through the employ of knocked-in EPOR-H and EPOR-HM alleles) six new EPOR-PY343/Stat5 response genes were independently confirmed including Tnfr-sf13c, Ccrn4l, Rpl12, Socs2, Chac1 and Matr3 as novel EPO-regulated factors. Confidence in our presently reported EPO/EPOR- regulated transcriptome is also reinforced via heat-map and p-value distribution analyses. EPO is best known to promote EPC survival, and expansion,, and EPO/EPOR-modulated survival therefore is next considered. Among seven such factors, two are novel as Gas5, and Lyl1. Gas5 is of interest in ways that relate to Pim-1 and -3. Specifically Gas5 can act as a non-coding RNA to regulate mTOR levels. Together, Pim and mTOR pathways reinforce cell survival via pro-metabolic effects. Lyl1, by comparison, is a bHLH transcriptional regulator which recently has been demonstrated to enforce hematopoietic progenitor cell survival. EPO down-modulation of Bim (a BH3-only factor) is in-keeping with Bim's role as a Bclx antagonist. Finally, Trib3 and Serpina3g are a pseudokinase, and candidate protease inhibitor each of which recently has been preliminarily demonstrated to affect erythroid progenitor cell survival. For these latter highly EPO-induced factors, LOF studies are in progress (and point to important non-redundant effects exerted in relatively late EPC's) (manuscripts in preparation and submitted). In maturing CFUe, cell cycle regulation is an atypical affair in that cell division rates accelerate markedly, become synchronous, and then sharply decrease as erythroblasts transition to reticulocytes. In part, this recently has been indicated to involve E2F factor effects. Presently, five EPO-modulated factors are predicted to promote cell cycle progression as Cyclin-D2, Cdc25a and Cyclin b1-interacting protein as induced factors, and Cyclin-G2 plus p27/Kip as repressed inhibitory factors. Btg3, in contrast is a novel EPO-induced factor that previously has been demonstrated to attenuate G2 to M phase transitions. Btg3 therefore may contribute to synchronizing aspects of proerythroblast cell divisions. In a broad category of additional signal transduction factors, one interesting subset of EPO/EPOR- regulated STF's is negative feedback factors. Among these, suppressors of cytokine signaling Socs-3 previously has been implicated as an EPOR/JAK2 complex inhibitor. In primary bone marrow stage-E1 EPC's, Socs-3 as well as Socs-2 are shown to be induced by EPO. Spreds-1 and -2, as also induced by EPO, may well affect not only EPOR complexes, but also RTK's such as Kit and/or EphB4, each of which play erythropoietic roles,. Biologically, such suppression might relate, for example, to stage-E1 to -E2 transitions. This brings questions of possible receptor cross-modulation to bear. Eaf1 further is known to suppress Wnt signaling (see Figure 4B). By extended considerations, select EPO-induced transcriptional events also may result in erythroid cell extrinsic EPC effects. Examples are given by EPO- induction of Cmtm6 as a CMTM cytokine; Gdf3 as a candidate inhibitor of TGFbeta and Oncostatin M as a newly discovered regulator of hepatic hepcidin and therefore of iron availability. Finally, Tnfr-sf13C proved to comprise a strong EPO/EPOR response factor in EPC's and (as discussed below) this has proven to be of clear functional significance. Tnfr-sf13c to date has been studied in B-cells and (together with its BAFF ligand) is essential for B-cell survival and development,. BAFF interestingly is expressed by bone marrow stromal cells, and has been implicated as an anchoring site within marrow for multiple myeloma cells. In an erythropoietic context, we now demonstrate that Tnfr-sf13c is a major EPO-response gene in primary bone marrow EPC's, and ligation of Tnfr-sf13c results in not only cytoprotective effects, but also appears to bolster the formation of stage-E3 erythroblasts from stage E1 and E2 progenitors. Our profiling analyses of E1, E2 and E3 EPC's further indicate that these cells are not a significant source of BAFF as compared directly to primary bone marrow stromal cells (data not shown). Therefore, a novel functional connection is implicated between EPC's (via Tnfr-sf13c) and bone marrow stromal cells. It is of potential clinical interest to suggest that BAFF may comprise a rationale anti-anemia agent for possible use in combination with EPO. Via MGI Gene Expression Atlas, twenty-four cited experiments which include Tnfrsf13c indicate skewed expression among nine non-hematopoietic tissues (with 7 of 24 studies in brain). A final set of observations that merit discussion involves additional functional subsets of targets presently discovered to be modulated by EPO. This includes up to 99 EPO modulated genes (see Tables S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8). Among these, space (and focus) dictate the brief discussion of only a few such factors. Among transcription factors (Table S3) Eklf3 can both antagonize or substitute for Eklf1, and Kruppel-like factors also can cross-regulate one another. EPO's down-regulation of Eklf3 therefore might contribute to late erythroid development (ie, by indirectly modulating Eklf1 activation of late erythroid genes, eg, beta- globins). Mllt3, a transcription factor recently shown in Mllt3-null and transgenic mice to regulate early stage erythro- and megakaryopoiesis, also was down modulated 3.3 fold by EPO (Table S3). This therefore may favor advancement to late-stage erythroid development. In a category of ubiquitinylation (Table S4), EPO induced the expression of Usp12 and Fbxw7. Usp12 is a deubiquitinating enzyme previously implicated in Fanconi anemia, while Fbxw7 (a substrate binding component of Ub ligase complexes) can act as a tumor suppressor in part by regulating Mcl1 levels. Other EPO- modulated metabolic factors of note (Table S4) include Tim-9 and Tim-10 which act coordinately to facilitate transport of hydrophobic proteins to inner mitochondrial membranes. Interestingly, EPO induced mitochondrial biogenesis also has recently been reported in myocardial tissue. In a related category of transporters (Table S4) EPO also regulated the expression of Slc40a1, an iron transporter that may correspond to erythroid ferroportin. Here, down- modulation of an iron exporter would result in increased iron accumulation prior to hemoglobinization. Finally, eleven factors involved in ribosome biogenesis were induced by EPO (see Table S6) (for references, also see Table S6). This was unexpected, but of significant interest based on association of mutations in several ribosomal factors with Diamond-Blackfan anemia and 5q-linked myelodysplastic syndrome,. In part, this appears to involve a heightened sensitivity of erythroid progenitors to dysregulated ribosome biogenesis (and a consequential activation of p53). Among EPO/EPOR response factors presently discovered in bone marrow derived CFUe-like progenitors, Rrs1, Rpl12, Urb2 and Bxlc2 are known ribosome biogenic factors; Tsr1, Bysl and Nmd3 are involved in 20S, 40S, and 60S rRNA/subunit formation (respectively); Mak16p and Rbp1B and rRNA stabilizers and/or processing components; Rps24 is a structural component; while Dimt1l is an 18S rRNA adenosine demethylase. To date, none of the above EPO/EPOR targets have been directly implicated in the anemia of MDS or Diamond Blackfan disease. It nonetheless is compelling to suggest that EPO/EPOR signals likely impact on ribosome formation within (pro)erythroblasts \u2013 And that this bolstering of ribosome biogenesis may be important to avoid anemia, and keep pace with high demands for the translation of globin transcripts plus erythrocyte membrane and cytoskeletal components."}, "21238926": {"pmid": "21238926", "pmcid": "PMC3178012", "title": "Brat Promotes Stem Cell Differentiation via Control of a Bistable Switch that Restricts BMP Signaling", "abstract": "\nSummary\nDrosophila ovarian germline stem cells (GSCs) are maintained by Dpp signaling and the Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos) translational repressors. Upon division, Dpp signaling is extinguished, and Nos is downregulated in one daughter cell, causing it to switch to a differentiating cystoblast (CB). However, downstream effectors of Pum-Nos remain unknown, and how CBs lose their responsiveness to Dpp is unclear. Here, we identify Brain Tumor (Brat) as a potent differentiation factor and target of Pum-Nos regulation. Brat is excluded from GSCs by Pum-Nos but functions with Pum in CBs to translationally repress distinct targets, including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs. Regulation of both targets simultaneously lowers cellular responsiveness to Dpp signaling, forcing the cell to become refractory to the self-renewal signal. Mathematical modeling elucidates bistability of cell fate in the Brat-mediated system, revealing how autoregulation of GSC number can arise from Brat coupling extracellular Dpp regulation to intracellular interpretation.\n", "fulltext": "Stem cells have the defining characteristic of being able to\u00a0divide asymmetrically, producing a differentiating daughter cell while simultaneously renewing their own identity. The Drosophila ovarian germline serves as a paradigm for stem cell research due to its structural simplicity and accessibility (Kirilly and Xie, 2007). The Drosophila ovary consists of around 15\u201320 ovarioles\u2014linear arrangements of developing eggs that originate from the anterior-most structure called the germarium. The germarium houses two to three germline stem cells (GSCs), from which the female germline derives. These GSCs are maintained by signals produced from various surrounding somatic cells, which together make up the ovarian stem cell niche (Figure\u00a01A). The niche cells provide the key self-renewal signal Decapentaplegic (Dpp), which functions as a short-range signal to maintain the adjacent GSCs (Xie and Spradling, 1998) by directly repressing transcription of the key differentiation factor Bag of marbles (Bam) (Chen and McKearin, 2003a; Pyrowolakis et\u00a0al., 2004; Song et\u00a0al., 2004). When the GSC divides, one daughter cell remains within the niche, continuing to receive the Dpp self-renewal signal, whereas the other, the cystoblast (CB), moves posteriorly away from the source of the signal, leading to the derepression of Bam expression, which is both\u00a0necessary and sufficient to cause germline differentiation (Ohlstein and McKearin, 1997). Loss of Dpp signaling allows cells to differentiate, whereas ectopic expression leads to tumorous expansion of GSCs (Chen and McKearin, 2003a; Xie and Spradling, 1998). A number of intracellular factors that contribute to stem cell identity have also been characterized, including components of the miRNA pathway (Jin and Xie, 2007; Yang et\u00a0al., 2007), as well as the translational repressors Pumilio (Pum) and Nanos (Nos) (Chen and McKearin, 2005; Forbes and Lehmann, 1998; Szakmary et\u00a0al., 2005; Wang and Lin, 2004). It has been hypothesized that Pum and Nos maintain GSCs by repressing the translation of mRNAs encoding differentiation factors (Forbes and Lehmann, 1998; Szakmary et\u00a0al., 2005; Wang and Lin, 2004), although the identity of these targets has yet to be elucidated. In CBs Nos is downregulated by Bam (Li et\u00a0al., 2009), potentially allowing expression of these differentiation factors, thus contributing to the change of cell fate. Cooperation of the Pum and Nos repressors has also been shown in different developmental contexts, including the embryonic germline where they regulate multiple aspects, such as pole cell migration and proliferation (Asaoka-Taguchi et\u00a0al., 1999), and the postembryonic nervous system where they control morphogenesis of neuronal dendrites (Ye et\u00a0al., 2004). Pum and Nos often function with an additional translational regulator Brain Tumor (Brat), as described for the repression of hunchback (hb) mRNA to pattern the early embryo (Sonoda and Wharton, 1999), and paralytic mRNA to control excitation of larval motoneurons (Muraro et\u00a0al., 2008). Therefore, we investigated whether Brat also has a functional role in the ovary. Here, we provide evidence that Brat acts as a powerful differentiation factor within the germline via its limiting effects on the Dpp self-renewal pathway, allowing cells to robustly adopt distinct fates. Furthermore, our data demonstrate how stem cell progeny can rapidly commit to a differentiated fate despite proximity to a niche, a concept relevant to multiple stem cell systems. We began by examining the expression of brat in the ovary. In situ hybridization using a brat anti-sense probe revealed that the brat transcript is expressed throughout the germline, including GSCs (Figure\u00a01B), whereas immunohistochemistry showed that Brat protein is excluded from GSCs (Figure\u00a01C). This is further confirmed by costaining with a Bam-GFP reporter that labels only differentiating cells (Chen and McKearin, 2003b) (Figure\u00a01D). In the bam mutant, Brat protein is not present, but transcripts are still detected (see Figure\u00a0S1 available online), suggesting that Brat may be expressed as part of, or in response to, a differentiation program, downstream of Bam. These observations also indicate that brat may be regulated in GSCs at the level\u00a0of RNA translation. Pum and Nos are translational repressors known to be required autonomously in GSCs (Forbes and Lehmann, 1998). To investigate whether brat is a target of Pum-Nos repression, epitope-tagged constructs of pum and nos were coexpressed with a GFP reporter bearing the brat 3\u2032UTR (GFP-brat3\u2032) in Drosophila S2 cells. Because Brat protein is known to function with Pum-Nos in other contexts, and all three repressors are endogenously expressed in S2 cells (data not shown), RNAi targeting the brat coding region was employed to ensure that any regulation of the reporter was independent of Brat. The loss of endogenous Brat protein following RNAi treatment was confirmed by western blot (Figure\u00a0S1). Analysis revealed that Pum-Nos cooperatively repress the GFP-brat3\u2032 reporter expression (Figures 1E and 1F), but not GFP alone (Figure\u00a0S1). Intermediate levels of repression by each regulator alone are attributed to the presence of endogenous Pum or Nos. To understand the relevance of this regulation in\u00a0vivo, we examined various allelic combinations of pum mutant GSCs, which were found to ectopically express Brat protein (Figures 1G and 1I), indicating that brat is normally repressed by Pum in GSCs. Similarly, nos mutant GSCs also ectopically express Brat (Figures 1H and 1I). Moreover, when nos is ectopically expressed in anterior germline cells, brat repression is maintained in these cells, and the differentiation program is suppressed, producing ectopic GSCs (Figure\u00a0S1). Taken together, these results indicate that the brat mRNA is regulated by Pum-Nos in the ovary, limiting its expression to CBs and developing cysts. To investigate the function of Brat in the ovary, we generated a fly line in which the germline was homozygous mutant for the strong brat11 allele, which truncates the protein and removes the vital NHL domain, shown to be necessary for protein-protein interaction (Arama et\u00a0al., 2000). The brat mutant germline displayed an increased growth phenotype, with larger cells than wild-type (Figure\u00a02A). The mutant germline also had more GSCs, as indicated by the presence of Bam-negative cells with round fusome organelles (Figures 2B and 2C). Analysis of two additional brat alleles reveals a similar expansion in GSC number (Figure\u00a0S2). Because an increase in GSCs is seen when Dpp signaling is augmented in the germarium (Xie and Spradling, 1998), we investigated Dpp signaling in the brat mutant by analyzing expression of the Dpp target gene Daughters against dpp (Dad). In wild-type germaria a Dad-lacZ reporter is expressed strongly in GSCs, and at a lower level in CBs, reflecting Dpp-signaling activity (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004) (Figure\u00a02D). By contrast the expression domain of Dad-LacZ in the brat mutant is increased, confirming that the Dpp-signaling range is expanded (Figures 2D and 2E). These data indicate that Brat potentially has multiple functions within the differentiating germline, including cellular growth control and negative regulation of Dpp signaling. To further clarify the function of Brat, we ectopically expressed it specifically in the germline using the GAL4-UAS system and staining for the germline marker Vasa (Figure\u00a03A). When Brat is ectopically expressed in this way, the number of germline cells present is severely diminished, whereas other defects such as missing egg chambers and mispackaged cysts are evident (Figures 3B and 3C; Figure\u00a0S3). When the activity of GAL4 is increased by raising the growth temperature, the phenotypes become increasingly severe, ultimately resulting in a complete loss of germline and female sterility (Figure\u00a03D; Figure\u00a0S3). A TUNEL assay reveals no increase in programmed cell death of germline cells over time (Figures 3E\u20133I), whereas viability staining confirmed an absence of cell death by other mechanisms, such as necrosis (Figures 3E\u2032\u20133I\u2032). Both assays detected some dying somatic cells at the anterior tip of empty germaria (Figures 3H\u20133I\u2032), suggesting that an intact germline may be required to maintain the germarium structure. Together, these results reveal Brat to be a powerful differentiation factor within the germline. Brat interacts with the d4EHP and Pum translational repressors to repress the hb mRNA in the embryo (Cho et\u00a0al., 2006; Sonoda and Wharton, 2001). To unravel the molecular mechanism of Brat-mediated differentiation in the germarium, we ectopically expressed mutant forms of the Brat protein that either cannot interact with d4EHP or Pum. These two brat mutant transgenes are expressed at approximately equivalent levels to the wild-type transgene (Figure\u00a0S3). Expression of BratR837D, which cannot interact with d4EHP (Cho et\u00a0al., 2006), resulted in the same loss of germline seen for ectopic expression of wild-type Brat (Figure\u00a04A), suggesting that d4EHP interaction is dispensable for Brat's function in the ovary. The ovaries of initially eclosed flies expressing wild-type Brat or BratR837D had few developing egg chambers and no mature embryos, whereas after a period of 21\u00a0days, only empty germaria remained (Figure\u00a0S3). Conversely, ovaries expressing the BratG774D mutant, which has a reduced ability to bind Pum (Sonoda and Wharton, 2001), have a less-severe phenotype (Figure\u00a04B), indicating that Brat requires an interaction with Pum in order to promote differentiation. These flies eclosed with ovaries bearing intact germlines, which persisted over 21\u00a0days and produced mature embryos, although these were rarely laid for unknown reasons (Figure\u00a0S3). Because Pum is expressed in GSCs and also coincides with Brat expression in CBs (Figure\u00a04C), this led us to consider the possibility that Brat is repressed by Pum-Nos in\u00a0GSCs but acts in conjunction with Pum in CBs. Evidence shows that Nos is downregulated in CBs by Bam (Li et\u00a0al., 2009), implying that Nos is not involved in this Pum-Brat interaction. When Brat and Nos are visualized simultaneously, they were found to be expressed in reciprocal patterns (Figure\u00a04D), supporting the idea that Brat interacts with Pum independently of Nos in CBs, thus establishing a distinct repression complex. Because Brat protein expression overlaps that of Bam (Figure\u00a01D), and is downstream of it (Figure\u00a0S1), it is possible that Bam downregulates Nos to allow Brat expression, which then forms a new complex with Pum that acts in favor of differentiation. Having shown that Brat acts to promote differentiation, we next examined the potential targets of Brat repression. Because loss of brat function leads to expansion of Dpp signaling (Figure\u00a02D), we investigated whether Dpp pathway members could be subject to repression by Pum-Brat. Epitope-tagged Pum and Brat constructs were transfected into Drosophila S2 cells, along with reporters or tagged ORFs of the Dpp-signaling transducer Mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad) and the Dpp receptor thickveins (tkv). Because S2 cells express pum, nos, and brat at detectable levels (data not shown), nos RNAi was used to ensure that the results reflect nos-independent regulation and, therefore, approximate the in\u00a0vivo situation. The RNAi effectively suppresses Nos expression (Figure\u00a0S4). Western blot analysis reveals that a GFP construct bearing the Mad 3\u2032UTR (GFP-Mad3\u2032) was significantly repressed when cotransfected together with both Pum and Brat (Figure\u00a05A), whereas GFP alone or the Mad coding sequence was not (Figure\u00a05B; Figure\u00a0S4). Removal of nos RNAi reveals the same pattern of repression (Figure\u00a0S4), although the weaker effect may indicate that Nos and Brat compete for Pum. A tagged tkv construct bearing both UTRs showed no repression (Figure\u00a05C), suggesting that the Dpp receptor is not a Pum-Brat target. Because mutation of brat also caused a significant growth phenotype, we tested the growth regulator dMyc, which has been implicated as a Brat target in neural cells (Betschinger et\u00a0al., 2006). A reporter bearing the dMyc 3\u2032UTR (GFP-dMyc3\u2032) showed significant repression (Figure\u00a05D), indicating that Pum-Brat can also regulate dMyc-mediated cellular growth. Because expression of all reporters is under the control of the actin promoter, it is unlikely that the repression is at the transcriptional level but, instead, points to posttranscriptional regulation, consistent with it being conferred by the presence of the UTRs. To confirm that these mRNAs are authentic targets of Brat repression in\u00a0vivo, Mad and dMyc proteins were visualized in the brat mutant germline. In the absence of a suitable Mad antibody, the expression of activated Mad (pMad) was examined. Wild-type pMad is limited to GSCs and CBs at lower levels, reflecting Dpp-signaling activity as described previously (Song et\u00a0al., 2004) (Figure\u00a05E). In brat mutant germaria, pMad protein distribution is expanded (Figure\u00a05E), consistent with Mad being a target of Brat repression. Examination of dMyc protein in wild-type germaria reveals moderate levels of nuclear expression beginning after 16-cell cyst encapsulation (Figure\u00a05F), and high levels in GSCs with reduced expression in CBs (Figure\u00a05G), as described previously (Rhiner et\u00a0al., 2009). In the brat mutant germline, expression of dMyc occurs earlier and is more evident in the nucleus, whereas at the anterior germarium, expression is present in additional cells (Figures 5F and 5G). Therefore, our data suggest that Brat repression limits interpretation of the Dpp signal, in addition to restricting dMyc-mediated cellular growth. To assess the potential of the Brat-mediated network to produce a necessary sharp transition between adjacent self-renewing and differentiating cells, we generated a local, single-cell mathematical model of the intracellular network based on our experimental data (Figure\u00a06A). This simplified, local model includes Brat-mediated translational repression of Mad and assumes sufficient levels of both intracellular Pum and Med. The model confirms that Brat-mediated repression of Mad can confer bistability to pMad and other components of the network (Figures 6B and 6C) and that this bistable behavior is largely insensitive to the precise parameter values (Figure\u00a0S5). Therefore, the intracellular network allows two adjacent cells such as the GSC and CB to have equivalent levels of bound and signaling Dpp ligand, yet distinct levels of pMad and other intracellular components. The GSC or CB fate adopted by each cell depends on the cellular machinery, the levels of Pum, Brat and Mad, as well as the history of active signaling in the cell. Loss or ectopic expression of Brat in the model abolishes this bistability, and cells become either ultrasensitive or refractory to extracellular Dpp (Figure\u00a06B), which is consistent with the observations in Figures 2 and 3. To investigate Brat-mediated differentiation in the niche space and cell-to-cell competition, we developed a 3D spatiotemporal model of an idealized germarium. The 3D model contains two volumetric compartments: extracellular and intracellular, and includes chemical reactions and exchange of molecules between each individual cell's surface and the intracellular compartment. This allows us to investigate cell responses to changing conditions in the germarium, as well as interactions between cells, such as competition for Dpp in the niche space. The 3D model also includes additional elements, such as RBP9, which regulates Bam in developing cysts (Kim-Ha et\u00a0al., 1999), and incorporates the repression of dMyc by Brat (Figures 5D and 5G; Figure\u00a0S5). Because the mechanism of dMyc action in the germarium is unknown, we used the model to investigate two putative functions for dMyc (Figure\u00a06D). The first \u201csynthesis\u201d model involves a network whereby dMyc upregulates the overall intracellular protein synthesis rate, consistent with the previously observed role of dMyc in cellular growth control (Grewal et\u00a0al., 2005). The second \u201cendocytosis\u201d model is based on data suggesting that cells with higher dMyc levels outcompete cells with less dMyc, potentially by increasing uptake of the Dpp ligand (Moreno and Basler, 2004; Rhiner et\u00a0al., 2009). In both models the networks lead to bistability and the capacity for sharp\u00a0delineation between adjacent cells. Each network was tested by modeling a situation in which one of the two GSCs expressed ectopic dMyc (4xdMyc), which has been shown to lead to GSC competition and niche takeover by the 4xdMyc cell in\u00a0vivo (Rhiner et\u00a0al., 2009). In the \u201csynthesis\u201d model the introduced 4xdMyc cell exhibits no significant change in pMad level, or only a small increase for some parameter sets, and no changes are evident in the adjacent cells (Figure\u00a06E, t1). When the Dpp level is transiently reduced, the 4xdMyc clone does differ from the adjacent GSC (Figure\u00a06E, t2). However, modification of the intracellular network alone cannot confer a competitive advantage to the cell, and on return to normal Dpp levels, both cells return to the previously observed steady state (Figure\u00a06E, t3). In this network the 4xdMyc clone cannot outcompete wild-type GSCs, inconsistent with the in\u00a0vivo observations (Rhiner et\u00a0al., 2009). In contrast the \u201cendocytosis\u201d model reveals that although pMad levels also do not substantially increase in the 4xdMyc cell, signaling in the adjacent GSC diminishes (Figure\u00a06F, t1). The low dMyc expressing GSC is susceptible to small perturbations in the level of Dpp such that it will differentiate following a transient loss of Dpp (Figure\u00a06F, t2), allowing the 4xdMyc clone to take over the niche and germarium via symmetric division (Figure\u00a06F, t3). Thus, this network exhibits effective competition and predicts that it may occur by limiting the amount of Dpp ligand available to the \u201closer\u201d cell, rather than through an increase of signaling in the \u201cwinner\u201d 4xdMyc cell. The comparison of the two networks demonstrates how simple upregulation of endocytosis can in principle lead to competition of GSCs for Dpp or other niche signals, although additional experiments aimed at measuring Dpp uptake in GSCs and CBs will be required to directly test this model. Because the \u201cendocytosis\u201d model more faithfully reflects GSC behavior in\u00a0vivo, its validity was further considered by examining the spatial expression of network components. The expression patterns generated are consistent with our experimental observations in both wild-type germaria (Figure\u00a06G) and under conditions of altered Brat levels (Figure\u00a06H). The model was then used to explore the signaling dynamics during division and differentiation of a GSC. Our analysis reveals that immediately following GSC division, the daughter cell, which we assume contains initially high pMad and low Brat levels inherited from the\u00a0mother cell, rapidly evolves to the low Dpp-signaling state (Figure\u00a06I, positions 1\u20132). The rapid evolution of pMad in the CB can be attributed to two dominant and directly related processes: lower Dpp levels at the distal position of the CB relative to the GSCs, and competition between the CB and GSCs for available Dpp. In general, we find that the cell in position 2 is sensitive to Dpp production rates and the effective diffusivity of Dpp, which may explain the experimental observation of two to three GSCs per niche in wild-type germaria. We also tested whether the model could recapitulate other behavior of the stem cell system seen in\u00a0vivo, including the reoccupation of an empty niche by the dedifferentiation of developing cysts. If no GSCs are present, resulting in an absence of competition, the increase in available Dpp is sufficient to reverse the differentiated fate of a CB (Figure\u00a06I, red line to position 1), restoring the GSC population. To test this phenomenon for cells far from the Dpp source, we developed a 2D cell array model and found that in a niche devoid of cells and a germarium with a cyst-fated cell in the posterior region, the distribution of Dpp automatically adjusts and switches the differentiating cell into a GSC-like cell (unpublished data). Overall, these data, together with the predicted function of dMyc in endocytosis, are consistent not only with the cell competition data obtained (Rhiner et\u00a0al., 2009) but also the suggested mechanism of GSC replacement through symmetric division of a single GSC (Xie and Spradling, 2000) and the repopulation of an empty niche (Kai and Spradling, 2004), providing insights and testable hypotheses for a better understanding of the underlying interactions responsible for these behaviors in\u00a0vivo. Finally, the case of a brat-null mutant was considered to observe signaling dynamics in a system that is sensitive to Dpp signaling but does not exhibit the bistability provided by\u00a0Brat (Figure\u00a06J). In the absence of Brat, sensitivity to Dpp\u00a0signaling is established throughout the system, consistent with an increase in GSC-like cells in the germarium, as seen in\u00a0vivo (Figure\u00a02B). Cells that are far from the Dpp source will eventually begin to differentiate but are much more susceptible to dedifferentiation (Figure\u00a06J). Thus, the Brat-mediated repression of Mad\u00a0and dMyc provides a robust autoregulatory module that is essential for maintaining stable and discrete cell fates during the transition from self-renewing to differentiated identity. Without Brat, this sharp delineation is lost, leaving the differentiation process vulnerable to perturbations in the Dpp signal. Overall, our data show that the decision of a stem cell to self-renew or differentiate depends on feedback generated by a network of translational repressors (Figure\u00a07). When anchored to the niche, the GSC receives high levels of Dpp signal due to its proximity to ligand-producing cells, in addition to the effects of a competitive mechanism, modeled here as increased Dpp-ligand uptake, resulting from high dMyc expression (Figure\u00a07, 1). These factors, in conjunction with other molecular players that augment Dpp signaling (see below), silence transcription of Bam (Figure\u00a07, 2), allowing Pum-Nos to repress mRNAs encoding differentiation factors, including the brat mRNA (Figure\u00a07, 3). Following GSC division, a transient loss of Dpp signaling is sufficient to initiate a chain of events that ultimately locks the CB into a differentiation fate. A reduction in Dpp signaling allows derepression of Bam expression in the CB (Figure\u00a07, 4). Bam then downregulates Nos (Figure\u00a07, 5) to subsequently allow the\u00a0translation of differentiation-promoting factors, including Brat (Figure\u00a07, 6). Brat interacts with Pum to form a distinct translational repression complex with altered specificity, which targets self-renewal mRNAs, including those of Mad and dMyc (Figure\u00a07,\u00a07). Downregulation of signal transduction by Brat's repression of Mad can explain at the molecular level the previously reported genetic evidence showing that Bam limits Dpp signaling downstream of its receptor in the ovary (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004) because Brat is expressed downstream of Bam. The loss of Mad in GSCs has been shown to cause their differentiation (Xie and Spradling, 1998), whereas the loss of just one copy of Mad can reverse the effect of Dpp ectopic expression (Xi et\u00a0al., 2005), illustrating the acute sensitivity of germline cells to changes in Dpp pathway components and, hence, Brat's impact on cellular fate. Brat repression of Mad and dMyc diminishes the CB's ability to respond to the Dpp signal, committing the cell to the differentiation program. The regulation of Dpp transduction is one level at which Dpp signaling is regulated within the ovarian stem cell system. The production and availability of the ligand depend upon transcriptional control in niche cells mediated by JAK-STAT signaling (Lopez-Onieva et\u00a0al., 2008; Wang et\u00a0al., 2008a), whereas spatial regulation is provided by extracellular elements such as type IV collagens that sequester Dpp ligand (Wang et\u00a0al., 2008b), and the glypican Dally that potentiates local Dpp signaling (Guo and Wang, 2009; Liu et\u00a0al., 2010), thus contributing to Dpp's limited availability. The action of Brat ensures that ligand present\u00a0in the vicinity of CBs is transduced at a limited rate. This is complemented by dSmurf-mediated degradation of Mad (Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004; Chen and McKearin, 2005), and the control of expression and localization of the Dpp receptor Saxophone by miR-184 in differentiating cells (Iovino et\u00a0al., 2009). Thus, multiple mechanisms are employed to restrict Dpp-signaling activity in the germarium, consistent with the essential requirement to downregulate Dpp signaling to ensure proper oogenesis. However, whereas the germarium contributes to the spatial control of Dpp, Brat-regulated mechanisms, including the repression of dMyc, provide a link between extracellular regulation and intracellular interpretation. The interactions we have identified and modeled form a bistable network, which demonstrates multiple behaviors that are observed in\u00a0vivo. The bistability generates a large difference between the minimum amount of Dpp required to maintain self-renewal and that needed to transition from differentiation to self-renewal. This effect affords a robust mechanism, in concert with cell competition, to ensure a constant population of GSCs because the balance between Dpp secretion and utilization is sufficient to support only two to three GSCs. Our modeling data suggest that dMyc-mediated competition can be explained by a role for dMyc in promoting endocytosis of Dpp. However, because the link between increased dMyc and elevated pMad levels is molecularly undefined, we cannot exclude other possibilities, such as influences of dMyc on pMad stability or maintenance of its phosphorylated state. In addition to the effect of dMyc, physical niche interactions, such as niche adherence and forces from crowding, have also been suggested as a competitive interaction downstream of Bam expression (Jin et\u00a0al., 2008). Interestingly, niche adherence in GSCs, mediated by E-cadherin, has been observed to be independent of dMyc (Jin et\u00a0al., 2008; Rhiner et\u00a0al., 2009), indicating that these two potential competition mechanisms are not coupled at the level of dMyc expression. It is likely that there\u00a0are multiple parallel competitive mechanisms downstream of Bam, which could potentially be mediated by Brat, and extension of the model will contribute to their delineation in the future. Our data are consistent with Pum being a member of distinct translation repression complexes that target different pools of mRNAs. Evidence suggests that the recruitment of Pum corepressors is both context and target dependent. The well-documented Pum-Nos-Brat complex that targets the hb mRNA in the embryo (Sonoda and Wharton, 2001) does not appear to play a role in the germarium because Nos and Brat have mutually exclusive expression patterns. Although there are precedents for a Pum-Nos complex functioning in the absence of Brat, e.g., in the repression of the cyclinB (cycB) mRNA in embryonic pole cells (Kadyrova et\u00a0al., 2007; Sonoda and Wharton, 2001), to our knowledge, a Pum-Brat complex has not been described previously. Because Nos functions with Pum to co-recruit Brat to the Pum-Nos-Brat complex, it is likely that in the absence of Nos, another factor takes on this role in CBs. One possibility is that Bam and its binding partner BGCN are responsible for this function because they have been implicated in translation repression in CBs (Li et\u00a0al., 2009) and can interact with Pum (Kim et\u00a0al., 2010). Dissection of elements within the mRNA 3\u2032UTRs conferring specificity of translation repression by either the Pum-Nos or Pum-Brat complexes will ultimately be informative in terms of understanding mRNA selection, although potentially challenging due, in part, to the loose binding consensus of Pum (Gerber et\u00a0al., 2006) and its binding promiscuity (Gupta et\u00a0al., 2008). Brat belongs to the NHL domain family that also includes the Drosophila protein Mei-P26, which, like Brat, acts to promote ovarian germline differentiation (Neumuller et\u00a0al., 2008). Both Brat and Mei-P26 have higher expression in CBs than GSCs, yet this is achieved by distinct mechanisms. For Brat, Pum-Nos repression of the mRNA ensures that its expression is limited to CBs and not GSCs, whereas the expression of Mei-P26 is stimulated in CBs by the binding of Vasa to a U-rich region of the mei-P26 mRNA, which then potentially recruits the essential translation activator eIF5B (Liu et\u00a0al., 2009). In addition the miRNA pathway has been implicated in repression of Mei-P26 in the Drosophila wing (Herranz et\u00a0al., 2010), and because the miRNA pathway is active in GSCs (Park et\u00a0al., 2007), it may serve to negatively regulate Mei-P26 levels in these cells. In addition to the distinct mechanisms used to actively limit Brat or Mei-P26 protein to the CB, it appears that each paralog also mediates differentiation through contrasting mechanisms. Although our work shows that Brat acts via direct repression of self-renewal promoting mRNAs, Mei-P26 is thought to function through inhibition of the miRNA pathway, affecting regulation of differentiating-promoting target mRNAs in CBs and differentiating cells\u00a0(Neumuller et\u00a0al., 2008). Mei-P26 interacts with the miRNA pathway effector Argonaute (Ago1), although how this interaction affects the miRNA pathway is currently unclear. Mei-P26 shares significant domain homology with the C. elegans protein Ncl-2 (Glasscock et\u00a0al., 2005), a putative E3-ubiquitin ligase, suggesting that Mei-P26 could act via ubiquitination to downregulate either Ago1 directly or another component of the miRNA pathway. Indeed, mammalian homologs similarly control cell fate through ubiquitination and miRNA regulation, such as the\u00a0mouse ortholog mLin41 that antagonizes Ago2 by ubiquitination (Rybak et\u00a0al., 2009), and TRIM32 that regulates miRNA level\u00a0in neuroblast progenitors and additionally ubiquitinates c-Myc (Schwamborn et\u00a0al., 2009). Although Brat can also bind\u00a0Ago (Neumuller et\u00a0al., 2008), it is not known whether Brat\u00a0functions through miRNA regulation in the germarium (Figure\u00a07). However, Brat lacks the RING finger domain known to provide ubiquitin-ligase activity (Glasscock et\u00a0al., 2005), potentially accounting for the contrasting mechanisms of regulation described for Brat and Mei-P26 in the control of germline differentiation. Brat has been previously identified in an additional stem cell system of Drosophila as a key regulator of neuroblast progeny differentiation during development of the larval brain (Bello et\u00a0al., 2006; Betschinger et\u00a0al., 2006). Together with our findings, these data could suggest a global function for Brat in promoting cell fate changes in stem cell systems. Brat orthologs have been identified in other species and have also been implicated in disease, including neurodegeneration in mice (Balastik et\u00a0al., 2008) and formation of brain tumors in humans (Boulay et\u00a0al., 2009). Thus, our study will serve as a platform for understanding differentiation in mammalian stem cell systems as well as related genetic diseases. Fly stocks used were: yw67c23 as the initial stock to generate transgenics; Dad-LacZ (Tsuneizumi et\u00a0al., 1997); GFP-Pum (Buszczak et\u00a0al., 2007); Nos-myc (Verrotti and Wharton, 2000); Gal4-Nos:VP16, pumMsc, pum01688, pumET1, UAS-Flp (Bloomington Stock Center); Bam-GFP (Chen and McKearin, 2003b); nosRC, nosRD (a gift from R. Baines); Df(3R)DlFX1 (Forbes and Lehmann, 1998); and brat11 (Frank et\u00a0al., 2002). Transgenic flies were generated by standard P element-mediated transformation using the pUASp vector. brat mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene). Clones were generated by FLP/FRT recombination. Flies of genotype Gal4-Nos:VP16/+ ; FRT-brat/FRT-GFP ; UAS-FLP/+ were dissected; clones were confirmed by loss of GFP. As a control UAS-FLP was omitted. For immunofluorescence, adults were dissected after maturing on yeast/apple juice agar plates, and ovaries were fixed and stained using standard techniques (detailed methods available on request). Antibodies used are detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's Modified Drosophila Media (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. DNA constructs were transfected using Effectene (QIAGEN) according to manufacturers' instructions, and cells harvested following 3\u00a0days expression. Western blot was performed using standard methods and detected using Li-Cor Infrared detection system. Primary antibodies were used at 1:2000 dilution: mouse anti-HA (Santa Cruz); mouse anti-Myc (Santa Cruz); rabbit anti-Flag (Roche); mouse anti-V5 (Abcam); rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam); rabbit anti-Brat (Sonoda and Wharton, 2001); and mouse anti-Tubulin (Roche). Secondary antibodies were used 1:10,000 dilution: IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse and IRDye 680LT goat anti-rabbit (Li-Cor). Western blot IR signals were quantified using Li-Cor Odyssey software. Error bars were generated from the SEM of at least three separate biological repeats with Student's t test used to evaluate significance. For the local cell model, we developed a set of coupled, nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which are given along with parameters in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. The core model is a simplified form of the known interaction network in BMP signaling. This model considers only BMP-bound receptors, Mad, Bam, Nos, and Brat, with a double-negative feedback loop, formed by Brat acting on Mad availability and Nos acting on Brat availability. dMyc is modeled here, but without feedback on other components. The complete system comprises six state variables and 22 parameters (kinetic rates, regulatory constants, and the bound receptor level). Equations were solved numerically using MATLAB\u00ae and the Matcont numerical bifurcation analysis software (Dhooge et\u00a0al., 2003). The local model equations were expanded further to develop a 3D spatiotemporal model of the germarium. The nondimensionalized equations, including boundary conditions, are given in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. This system considers BMP diffusing from a source boundary at the anterior end of the germarium and binding to receptors at the surface of cells, where signaling and receptor endocytosis occurs. In addition to expanding the previous model spatially, this system considers the spatial distribution of Pum and RBP9, an inhibitor of Bam (Kim-Ha et\u00a0al., 1999) . We developed partial differential equation balances on extracellular, membrane-bound, and intracellular components. All species are free to diffuse in each subdomain and on the cell membrane, and ligand uptake occurs by the binding of extracellular Dpp to transmembrane receptors, which are internalized as a Dpp-receptor complex. Effects of alternate mechanisms of dMyc activity are considered in the 3D model. In one model the effect of dMyc modulating the rate of BMP-bound receptor endocytosis is tested. For simplicity we assumed a linear relationship between scaled dMyc, added to a constant basal endocytosis rate. To describe the alternate dMyc model, wherein protein synthesis rates for many intracellular processes are upregulated by dMyc, production terms for Mad, Bam, Nos, and Brat linearly depend on the concentration of dMyc. Partial differential equations were solved using COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae. All parameter values were obtained in the literature where available or estimated from similar processes in other systems (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details)."}, "20801540": {"pmid": "20801540", "pmcid": "PMC2987498", "title": "Hepatic but not brain iron is rapidly chelated by deferasirox in aceruloplasminemia due to a novel gene mutation", "abstract": "\n\nBackground & Aims\nAceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease associated with brain and liver iron accumulation which typically presents with movement disorders, retinal degeneration, and diabetes mellitus. Ceruloplasmin is a multi-copper ferroxidase that is secreted into plasma and facilitates cellular iron export and iron binding to transferrin.\n\n\nResults\nA novel homozygous ceruloplasmin gene mutation, c.2554+1G>T, was identified as the cause of aceruloplasminemia in three affected siblings. Two siblings presented with movement disorders and diabetes. Complementary DNA sequencing showed that this mutation causes skipping of exon 14 and deletion of amino acids 809\u2013852 while preserving the open reading frame. Western blotting of liver extracts and sera of affected patients showed retention of the abnormal protein in the liver. Aceruloplasminemia was associated with severe brain and liver iron overload, where hepatic mRNA expression of the iron hormone hepcidin was increased, corresponding to the degree of iron overload. Hepatic iron concentration normalized after 3 and 5\u00a0months of iron chelation therapy with deferasirox, which was also associated with reduced insulin demands. During short term treatment there was no clinical or imaging evidence for significant effects on brain iron overload.\n\n\nConclusions\nAceruloplasminemia can show an incomplete clinical penetrance but is invariably associated with iron accumulation in the liver and in the brain. Iron accumulation in aceruloplasminemia is a result of defective cellular iron export, where hepcidin regulation is appropriate for the degree of iron overload. Iron chelation with deferasirox was effective in mobilizing hepatic iron but has no effect on brain iron.\n\n", "fulltext": "Aceruloplasminemia (ACP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism, where affected patients typically present with a triad of diabetes mellitus, retinal degeneration, and neurological symptoms. Absence of ceruloplasmin (CP) in plasma in combination with mild anemia, hypoferremia, and hyperferritinemia is a diagnostic finding. The prevalence of ACP is highest in Japan where it is estimated to be 1 in 2 million. ACP can be caused by nonsense, missense, splice-site or frame shift mutations in the CP gene, where a total of about 40 different mutations has been described. One ACP patient, heterozygous for only one missense CP mutation p.R701W, has been reported suggesting a dominant negative effect of this mutation. CP is mainly expressed in hepatocytes and glial cells, where the hepatic splicing variant includes exons 1\u201319 and encodes a soluble, 1040 amino acid protein. Astrocytes express a membrane-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored form of CP, resulting from alternative splicing, where a cryptic splice site within exon 18 is spliced to exon 20 and exon 19 is skipped. Hepatic CP is secreted into the plasma as a glycosylated metalloprotein that binds >90% of the copper in plasma. CP is a multi-copper ferroxidase which facilitates iron binding to transferrin and promotes iron export from hepatocytes, macrophages, and glial cells [7\u20139]. Iron export from macrophages is required for the recycling of heme\u2013iron from senescent red blood cells. In contrast, iron export from hepatocytes supplies iron from stores during iron deprivation or iron loss. The only known iron-exporter is ferroportin, which is stabilized by GPI-anchored CP in glial cells. How soluble CP in plasma promotes iron export from hepatocytes remains unknown. Ferroxidase activity and stabilization of ferroportin at the plasma-membrane require copper in the active site of CP. Supply of copper to the hepatocellular Golgi apparatus for correct CP assembly and folding requires the activities of ATP7A, which is implicated in intestinal copper uptake, as well as the activity of ATP7B, which is an intracellular copper transport protein. Menkes disease and Wilson\u2019s disease, which are associated with genetic defects in ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively, are characteristically associated with low serum CP concentrations resulting from reduced copper supply to the Golgi apparatus. Iron accumulation in ACP affects the liver, pancreas, and central nervous system, where the retina, striatum, thalamus, and dentate nucleus are primarily affected. Brain iron accumulation can be associated with retinal degeneration, extrapyramidal symptoms, cerebellar symptoms, and mental dysfunction which indicate neurodegeneration. In contrast, hepatic iron overload is not associated with liver disease in ACP but diabetes may be the result of iron-induced damage of pancreatic islet cells. Disease onset typically occurs in the 4th\u20135th decade of life and ACP has a slowly progressive course, with deterioration of neurological symptoms that can cause typical complications and death in most patients in the 6th decade of life. Iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine or deferiprone has been reported to reduce hepatic iron stores in ACP and transfusion of fresh plasma has been shown to partially reconstitute plasma ferroxidase activity [14\u201318]. Brain iron concentrations and neurological symptoms did not improve on iron chelators, which may be a result of the limited permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier for these drugs. Herein, we report the clinical presentation of ACP in three siblings and the biochemical consequences of a novel CP mutation in a canonical splice-site. Further, the clinical, biochemical, and radiological responses to iron chelation therapy with deferasirox are presented. This study was approved by our local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Serum iron parameters, serum copper concentration, serum CP concentrations, and hematological parameters were determined using routine clinical biochemical methods. Serum ferroxidase activity was determined using p-Phenylenediamine (Sigma Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) as artificial substrate according to a previously published method. For cDNA sequencing, total liver RNA extracted from a liver biopsy specimen of the index case was used as a PCR template after reverse transcription. PCR products were directly sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Kit v.3.2 (Applied Biosystems, Vienna, Austria) and an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Vienna, Austria). Primers and annealing temperatures for RT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Exons 11\u201317 and the exon\u2013intron boundaries of the CP gene were sequenced from genomic DNA. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Sequence analysis was carried out with the Sequencher v4.9 software (Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI) using the Ensemble entries for human CP as reference (ENSG00000047457, ENST00000264613). To screen 100 chromosomes from healthy controls for the presence of an eventually identified c.2554+1G>T mutation, a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was set up. The newly identified c.2554+1G>T mutation creates an additional RsaI cleavage cut site in the corresponding PCR product, which can be used for high throughput screening. PCR products were analyzed after RsaI digestion by HPLC using a WAVE DHPLC system (Transgenomic, Glasgow, UK). Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with Perls\u2019 reagents according to standard methods. Tissue iron and copper concentrations were determined in an unfixed and air-dried liver biopsy sample by atomic absorption spectroscopy. For the non-invasive quantification of liver iron, T2\u2217 relaxation times were calculated from a fat-saturated multi-echo gradient-echo MR sequence. For the quantification of liver T1-values a fast T1-mapping sequence based on an inversion recovery snapshot FLASH sequence was used which allowed the acquisition of a single T1 map during one breath hold. T1 and T2\u2217 acquisitions were obtained for identical slice positions and slice parameters. T2\u2217 and T1 maps were calculated off-line using ImageJ software (NIH, MD, USA). The parameter maps were analyzed by the placement of region of interests into different hepatic lobe segments, whereby identical regions of interests were used in T1 and T2\u2217 maps. Care was taken to avoid the inclusion of large vessels. Protein extracts from liver biopsies were made by the addition of radio-immuno precipitation buffer-containing protease inhibitors to a 1 mm3 snap-frozen piece of liver tissue. After reduction and heat denaturation, protein extracts were separated on an 8% discontinuous SDS gel. After blotting onto a PVDF membrane, CP immunoreactivity was detected by incubation of blocked (in 1% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween) membranes in goat anti human CP polyclonal antibody (C0911-Sigma Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. Immune complexes were visualized by ECL after incubation of washed membranes in a rabbit anti goat peroxidase conjugate at a 1:1000 dilution. A 3D homology model of truncated CP protein was made based on the PDB template 2J5WA using the Swiss-Model workspace. Models were analyzed and figures were prepared with Accelrys DS Visualizer v2.0. The index case (IV.2) was a 47\u00a0year old male who complained of a progressive gait disorder with falls which had deteriorated over the last 3\u20134\u00a0years. In the neurological examination the patient presented with a cerebellar syndrome with a slurred speech, hypometric saccades, and an intention tremor in the right hand. When standing he was unsteady with a reduced postural stability and a pronounced gait ataxia. The patient also had a left-sided spastic hemiparesis following a traumatic brain injury at the age of 23\u00a0years. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was diagnosed at the age of 26\u00a0years. Blood tests showed marked hyperferritinemia and hypoferremia with normal transferrin but decreased transferrin saturation (Table 1). Serum CP and ferroxidase activity were undetectable. Serum copper was 2.1\u00a0\u03bcM (reference range 11\u201322\u00a0\u03bcM). No hematological or other biochemical abnormalities were found. To assess tissue iron concentrations, MRI of the abdomen and the brain with T1 and T2\u2217 relaxation time-mapping was carried out. As shown in Fig. 2A, iron accumulation was found in the liver, the basal ganglia, and the dentate nuclei. Liver histology showed a normally structured liver with severe hepatocellular iron overload but no stainable iron in macrophages (Fig. 3). The results from hepatic iron quantification are shown in Table 1. Based on these findings the clinical diagnosis of ACP was made in the proband and family studies were initiated. Family studies showed a consanguineous loop and the family history revealed diabetes in a sister (IV.4) of the proband (Fig. 1). As shown in Table 1 hyperferritinemia, hypoferremia, and undetectable serum CP in two sisters indicated ACP. A movement disorder with a hypomimia and a postural tremor of both arms were present in the older sister (IV.4), whereas all other family members were clinically unaffected. Ophthalmological investigation in all individuals showed retinal pigment epithelium changes with a central depigmentation and a bulls-eye like macula but a normal vision and perimetry in patients IV.4 and IV.5. MR imaging and liver histology in the biochemically affected sisters showed iron accumulation in the basal ganglia, dentate nuclei, and the liver. The results from family studies further supported the diagnosis of autosomal recessive inheritance of ACP in this pedigree and molecular genetic testing was initiated. To identify the genetic cause of ACP, hepatic cDNA analysis was carried out and RT-PCR did not show the expected full length product but showed an aberrant fragment, 100\u00a0bp shorter than the expected for the PCR product spanning from exons 13 to 16 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Sequencing of the aberrant fragment showed absence of exon 14 in all biochemically affected family members. No other mutations were detected. Direct sequencing of genomic DNA revealed homozygosity for c.2554+1G>T in intron 14 of the CP gene in all biochemically affected family members. The mother (III.1) and one unaffected brother (IV.3) were heterozygous carriers, whereas the other brother had the wild-type sequence on both alleles. The c.2554+1G>T mutation of the CP gene was not found in 100 control chromosomes by PCR amplification, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and D-HPLC (Supplementary Fig. 2). Genetic and biochemical findings in this family show segregation of this novel mutation with ACP. The c.2554+1G>T mutation, which was shown to cause skipping of exon 14 is predicted to preserve the open reading frame and resulted in the loss of 43 amino acids spanning residues G809\u2013G852 with a molecular weight of 4.6\u00a0kDa. This was confirmed by SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blotting of proteins extracted from liver biopsies of genetically affected family members and a healthy control, which showed major immunoreactive bands at the expected molecular weights (Fig. 4A). A structural homology model of the mutant protein that appears to be expressed in the liver of genetically affected individuals was constructed (Supplementary Fig. 3). Our model suggests that the missing region from G809\u2013G852 is located within domain 5 (D724\u2013P903) of CP, which contains neither a copper-binding site nor the ferroxidase site. Analysis of the model suggests that rearrangement of the termini flanking the deleted residues would require a cumulative shift in their positions of approximately 20\u00a0\u00c5. The abnormal CP, where the open reading frame and all copper-binding sites are putatively preserved, is expressed in hepatocytes, but undetectable in plasma. To study the pathogenesis of iron overload in ACP, mRNA of the key regulator of iron metabolism hepcidin was quantified by real time PCR in liver biopsies. To determine if the observed increase in hepcidin expression was appropriate for the degree of iron overload, hepcidin/log\u00a0(ferritin) ratios were calculated. As shown in Fig. 4B mean hepcidin mRNA levels and hepcidin/log\u00a0(ferritin) ratios are higher in ACP, dysmetabolic siderosis, and patients with fatty liver disease as compared to patients with C282Y homozygous hemochromatosis or viral hepatitis. To treat iron overload associated with ACP, iron chelation therapy with deferasirox was started in all three homozygotes for the CP splice-site mutation with initial doses of 17\u201320\u00a0mg/kg bodyweight per day. Treatment duration ranged from 1\u00a0week to 5\u00a0months. In the index case deferasirox dose was reduced from 20 to 15\u00a0mg/kg/day after 4\u00a0weeks due to diarrhea and after 3\u00a0months treatment was stopped because of anemia (hemoglobin 9.9\u00a0g/dl). Patient IV.4 also developed anemia (hemoglobin 10\u00a0g/dl) and treatment was stopped after 5\u00a0months due to a gradual increase in creatinine up to 1.3\u00a0mg/dl. Treatment was discontinued after one week in patient IV.5 because of a skin rash. Serum ferritin concentrations decreased in all patients whereas serum iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation remained unchanged during deferasirox therapy (Fig. 2D). Non-invasive iron quantification by MRI showed a marked decrease in liver iron concentration after 3\u00a0months in the index case and in patient IV.4. After 5\u00a0months of treatment T1 and T2\u2217 relaxation times in patient IV.4 increased from 390 to 513\u00a0ms (normal 570\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040\u00a0ms) and from 1.8 to 10.9\u00a0ms (normal 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0ms), respectively. However, there was no imaging evidence for significant effects on brain iron overload during iron chelation therapy in both patients. Accordingly, neurological symptoms remained stable during the follow up. Both patients reported a transient reduction in their insulin demands on deferasirox. Iron chelation therapy with deferasirox is effective in reducing hepatic iron concentrations and improves endogenous insulin production, but has no short term effect on brain iron accumulation. CP is a multi-copper ferroxidase essential for iron homeostasis which facilitates cellular iron efflux. Lack of functional CP is typically associated with iron overload in the liver, pancreas, and the basal ganglia as illustrated in the reported cases. Retinal degeneration has a penetrance ranging from 75% to 93% in patients with ACP and retinal pigment epithelium changes were present in patients IV.4 and IV.5. It is unclear if the incomplete penetrance of neurological symptoms and diabetes in our patients is a result of disease modifiers or reflects the natural course of ACP. Both clinically affected siblings are diabetic since their twenties, whereas the youngest genetically affected sibling is asymptomatic and not diabetic at the age of 37, which suggests the presence of modifiers that affect disease expression. In agreement with previous reports of ACP, none of the genetically affected individuals had evidence of impaired biochemical liver function or advanced fibrosis despite the significant hepatocellular iron overload that exceeded the thresholds for hepatic fibrosis established in hemochromatosis cohorts. This observation suggests that iron is only a cofactor in hepatic fibrogenesis. Liver histology showed the presence of iron in hepatocytes, whereas no iron was found in macrophages. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging also showed the absence of iron overload in the spleen, suggesting that iron overload in Kupffer cell is a late event in ACP. This observation suggests that CP is important for hepatocellular iron efflux, whereas CP-independent mechanisms for iron export from macrophages exist. If CP was indispensable for iron export from recycling macrophages, one would expect more pronounced anemia and even higher sTfR concentrations. In our ACP patients, stainable iron was restricted to hepatocytes, in comparison to patients with advanced hemochromatosis or transfusional iron overload where the iron storage typically affects parenchymal cells and macrophages. The decline of serum ferritin on deferasirox treatment in ACP patients was faster than in patients with \u00df-thalassemia, which suggests that iron-loaded hepatocytes are the main source of serum ferritin and hepatocellular iron is more accessible to deferasirox than macrophageal iron. The prompt increase in serum ferritin after cessation of deferasirox treatment may indicate a redistribution of iron, since the re-accumulation of food iron in such a short time appears unlikely. Hepatocellular iron overload induces expression of the peptide hormone hepcidin in normal individuals, which causes ferroportin degradation. This results in cellular iron retention and reduced iron absorption. The observation that hepatic hepcidin mRNA expression in ACP patients and in dysmetabolic siderosis patients are comparable, but low in HFE hereditary hemochromatosis, suggests that CP but not HFE is dispensable for iron-mediated hepcidin regulation. We found higher hepcidin mRNA expression in ACP than in viral hepatitis patients where hepcidin expression is suppressed, which also suggests that hepcidin responds normally to iron in ACP. Normal hepcidin regulation in ACP supports the concept that regional iron accumulation in affected organs results from disturbed cellular iron metabolism rather than from alterations in total body iron homeostasis. The functional consequence of the splice-site mutation c.2554+1G>T is the skipping of exon 14, which preserves the open reading frame. The structural model suggests that the abnormal protein folds into a potentially functional protein, but such a significant structural change within domain 5 of CP is likely to affect the stability of the variant protein, resulting in intracellular retention. The phenotypic similarity with CP nonsense mutations further suggests that this variant is dysfunctional. Skipping of exon 14 is also predicted to affect the alternative transcript in the brain, where activation of a cryptic splice-site results in direct splicing of exons 18\u201320. Iron accumulation in the basal ganglia of c.2554+1G>T homozygotes suggests the absence of functional GPI-anchored CP and supports the importance of correct protein folding for the activity and stability of GPI-anchored CP. Ferroxidase activity is required to stabilize the iron export pump ferroportin in cells expressing GPI-anchored CP, which provides a molecular explanation for cellular iron retention in ACP. Iron-mediated lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are the main causes of neurodegeneration secondary to brain iron accumulation. To reduce iron toxicity chelation therapy was introduced in ACP. The iron chelator deferoxamine was effective in reducing hepatic iron overload and leading to a partial improvement of neurological symptoms and brain iron accumulation, as reported in a single case report. The positive effect of deferoxamine on central nervous symptoms and signs was not found in subsequent studies, which highlights the low permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier for deferoxamine. Despite the lower molecular weight and more lipophilic properties of deferiprone, this orally bioavailable iron chelator had no beneficial effect in ACP in a previous report. In agreement, we found no improvement of neurological symptoms or brain iron accumulation during deferasirox treatment over a period of several months. Deferasirox could still be an effective brain iron chelator, whose clinical benefit might be missed after a short term treatment. By comparison, the neurological improvement on zinc-sulphate was found after 15\u00a0months of treatment in a patient with ACP. In contrast, hepatic iron concentration and insulin requirements improved in both patients who were treated for 3 and 5\u00a0months, respectively. Taken together, short term deferasirox is effective in reducing hepatic iron overload, but ineffective for the treatment of brain iron accumulation. In all patients, side effects prohibited the long term therapy that may be required to mobilize iron from the brain. Given the high efficacy of a high dose of deferasirox, a low dose of the iron chelator may have a more favourable side effect profile, which in turn may allow for a long term and combination therapy. Recent studies in an animal model of Friedreich\u2019s ataxia suggest that the combined use of pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone and deferoxamine is an effective treatment of iron accumulation in glial cells. Further work is required to determine if similar strategies can be developed for patients with ACP and other neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with brain iron accumulation.

Isoforms of NADPH oxidase NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 are reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (ECs). Of these, NOX1 and NOX2 have been reported to contribute to intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) models. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the isoform NOX4 in ECs contributed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\u2013induced angiogenesis and IVNV.\n\n\nMethods\nIsoforms of NADPH oxidase mRNA were measured in several types of cultured vascular ECs: human retinal microvascular ECs (hRMVECs), choroidal ECs (CECs), and human umbilical vascular ECs (HUVECs) using real-time PCR. Newborn rat pups and dams were placed into an OIR model that cycled oxygen concentration between 50% and 10% every 24 h for 14 days, and then were placed in room air (RA) for an additional 4 days (rat OIR model). NOX4 expression in retinal lysates from the RA\u2013raised pups at postnatal day 0 (P0), P14, and P18 was determined with western blots. STAT3 activation was determined as the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 to total STAT3 with western blot analysis of retinal lysates from pups raised in RA or from the rat OIR model at P18. Semiquantitative assessment of the density of NOX4 colabeling with lectin-stained retinal ECs was determined by immunolabeling of retinal cryosections from P18 pups in OIR or in RA. In hRMVECs transfected with NOX4 siRNA and treated with VEGF or control, 1) ROS generation was measured using the 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester fluorescence assay and 2) phosphorylated VEGF receptor 2 and STAT3, and total VEGFR2 and STAT3 were measured in western blot analyses. VEGF-stimulated hRMVEC proliferation was measured following transfection with NOX4 siRNA or STAT3 siRNA, or respective controls.\n\n\nResults\nNOX4 was the most prevalent isoform of NADPH oxidase in vascular ECs. NOX4 expression in retinal lysates was significantly decreased during development in RA. Compared to RA, the expression of retinal NOX4 increased at P18. At p18 OIR, semiquantitative assessment of the density of lectin and NOX4 colabeling in retinal vascular ECs was greater in retinal cryosections and activated STAT3 was greater in retinal lysates when compared to the RA-raised pups. In cultured hRMVECs, knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection inhibited VEGF-induced ROS generation. VEGF induced a physical interaction of phosphorylated-VEGFR2 and NOX4. Knockdown of NOX4: 1) reduced VEGFR2 activation but did not abolish it and 2) abolished STAT3 activation in response to VEGF. Knockdown of either NOX4 or STAT3 inhibited VEGF-induced EC proliferation.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data suggest that in a model representative of human retinopathy of prematurity, NOX4 was increased at a time point when IVNV developed. VEGF-activated NOX4 led to an interaction between VEGF-activated VEGFR2 and NOX4 that mediated EC proliferation via activation of STAT3. Altogether, our results suggest that NOX4 may regulate VEGFR2-mediated IVNV through activated STAT3.\n\n", "fulltext": "Angiogenesis, a process of new blood vessel formation, plays important roles in development but also in pathologic conditions, including in cancer, diabetes mellitus, and ocular diseases. Endothelial cell (EC)\u2013generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) can function as signaling molecules to promote EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation in angiogenesis. NADPH oxidase, originally recognized for the superoxide burst generated by leukocytes to fight infection, is a source of ROS generation in ECs that can affect angiogenesis. Isoforms of NADPH oxidase, NOX 1\u20135 and Duox1 and -2, are differentially expressed in tissues and cells, and several papers support NADPH oxidase isoforms as having different roles in physiologic and pathological responses. NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 are expressed in ECs and have been associated with pathology in retinal diseases. Models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) are useful for studying mechanisms of developmental and pathologic angiogenesis caused by different oxygen stresses. In these models, newborn animals that normally vascularize their retinas postnatally are exposed to oxygen stresses that cause intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in which blood vessels grow outside the plane of the retina into the vitreous. Several pathways involved in angiogenesis have been identified, including those activated by hypoxia and stabilization of hypoxia inducible factors, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor signaling; and inflammatory pathways, such as cyclooxygenase signaling and angiotensin II type I receptor signaling. We and others found NADPH oxidase important in models of OIR. In rat and mouse OIR models, NOX2 colocalized with retinal ECs and macrophages and regulated IVNV partly through apoptotic and inflammatory mechanisms. Investigators also reported that activation of NOX1 in microglia or other cells contributed to ischemia-induced vascular pathologies and ganglion cell death. The effects of NOX4 in vascular diseases are conflicting as having either protective or pathologic effects in ischemic vascular diseases. In one study involving inducible Nox4\u2212/\u2212 mice, silencing of NOX4 led to aortic inflammation. However, in a diabetic mouse model, NOX4 activation upregulated VEGF and reduced the integrity of the endothelial blood\u2013retinal barrier. In this study, we sought to study the role of endothelial NOX4 in VEGF-induced IVNV. We used the rat 50/10 OIR model, which recreates many of the features of human retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). We addressed the hypothesis that VEGF-activated NOX4 in ECs contributes to pathologic angiogenesis through VEGF/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling. All animal studies were performed in compliance with the University of Utah (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. The rat 50/10 OIR model has been previously described. Entire litters of newborn Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) and dams were placed in an oxygen environment that cycled oxygen concentration between 50% and 10% every 24 h for 14 days and then placed in room air. Pup number was maintained at 12 to 14 pups/litter. Pups were euthanized with intraperitoneal injections (IP) of ketamine (60\u00a0mg/kg) and xylazine (18\u00a0mg/kg) followed by IP pentobarbital (80\u00a0mg/kg). Eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 10 mmol/l sodium orthovanadate for 10 min. Retinas were removed and placed into 4% PFA for 15 min followed by incubation in 30% sucrose/PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, Ph 7.4) overnight. Each retina was immersed in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Tissue-Tek; EMS, Hatfield, PA). Eyes were cut into 12\u00a0\u00b5m cryosections and were incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with primary antibody anti-NOX4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All sections were\u00a0washed and then incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of Alexa 594-conjugated antibody for isolectin B4 and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for NOX4. Sections stained with only secondary antibodies were controls. Sections were rinsed in PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Integrated density per image area of NOX4 fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ. Human primary retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMVECs; Cell Systems, Kirkland, WA) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; Lonza, Hopkinton, MA) were maintained in basal endothelial growth medium (EGM2-MV, Lonza), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human choroidal endothelial cells (CECs) were isolated from donor eyes (Utah Eye Bank, Salt Lake City, UT) as described previously. Briefly, the choroidal tissue was separated from the sclera, minced into small pieces. After three washes with cold Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 0.5 mg ml\u22121 penicillin\u2013streptomycin, the minced choroid was digested in a mixture containing 500 \u03bcg ml\u22121 collagenase 1A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 1.2 U ml\u22121 Dispase II (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C in a rotating shaker. The choroidal digests were double filtered through 70 and 44 \u03bcm meshes. Enzymes were neutralized by adding two times the volume of DMEM with 10% FBS. The cell suspension was incubated with CD31-coated DynaBeads (Dynal Biotech, Inc., NY) beads for 15\u201330 min at room temperature (RT) with gentle rotation to isolate human choroidal ECs and minimize RPE and fibroblast contamination. The bead\u2013EC complexes were then washed five times in HBSS with 5% FBS, mixed by gentle agitation for 1 min, and separated from the mixture with the Dynal Magnetic Particle Concentrator (MPC). The bead\u2013choroidal EC complexes were resuspended in 150 \u03bcl EGM-2 with 10% FBS and 0.5 mg ml l\u22121 penicillin\u2013streptomycin and plated onto a 1 cm2 area and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Choroidal ECs were confirmed as ECs and not fibroblasts by 100% immunostaining with von Willebrand Factor (Sigma), CD31 (Serotec, NC), and VE-cadherin (R&D Systems, MN). Choroidal ECs were maintained in basal endothelial growth medium (EGM-2, Lonza) with 5% FBS at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 and Passages 2\u20135 were used in the experiments. For treatment, cells were first starved in serum-free basal endothelial medium (EBM2; Lonza) overnight, pretreated with VEGFR2 tryosine-kinase inhibitor semaxanib (SU5416; 5\u00a0\u00b5M, Sigma-Aldrich) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 30 min, and then incubated with VEGF (20 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 1 h. Cells were harvested for western blots and immunoprecipitation. Total RNA was extracted with the Tri Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). cDNA was generated with the use of a High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative Real Time-PCR was performed on a Mastercycler ep Realplex (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) with SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Quantitative real-time PCR conditions were Step 1 (50 \u00b0C for 2 min), Step 2 (95 \u00b0C for 10 min) and Step 3 (40 cycles of [95 \u00b0C for 15 s to 60 \u00b0C for 1 min]). Expression levels for NOX isoforms were normalized to the mean value of internal control GAPDH. For siRNA transfection, hRMVECs at 70%\u201380% confluence in six-well plates were transfected with siRNAs targeting human NOX4 or STAT3 (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). A silencer selective negative control siRNA was used as control. Retina and hRMVECs were lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and orthovanadate (2 mmol/l; Sigma Aldrich), and then homogenized and centrifuged at 15,700\u00a0\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Protein concentration in the supernatant fluid was quantified with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL); 30\u00a0\u00b5g total protein for each sample was used for western blots. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: p-VEGFR2, total VEGFR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NOX4, p-STAT3 (Y705), and total STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). For the interaction of NOX4 and VEGFR2, coimmunoprecipitation was performed in 500\u00a0\u00b5l cell lysate containing 500\u00a0\u00b5g protein using anti-NOX4 antibody to pull down NOX4; the amount of VEGFR2 interacted with NOX4 was determined with western blots using anti-VEGFR2 antibody. Blots were visualized, and the relative densities of bands were calculated using UN-SCAN-IT Gel 6.1. hRMVECs were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected with siRNA. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were loaded with 5\u00a0\u00b5m 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CMDCF-DA; Invitrogen) in serum- and growth factor-free medium for 30 min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) or control PBS for 30 min. ROS generation was measured in a fluorescent plate reader (excitation-488 nm and emission-520 nm). Cells incubated with 10\u00a0\u00b5M H2O2 were used as a positive control. For the proliferation assay, 24 h post-transfection, cells were starved in serum- and growth factor-free medium for 24 h and then incubated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for another 24 h. Cell number was measured with Vybrant 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assay kit (Invitrogen). Significant differences between treatment groups were determined with ANOVA with the Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison post-hoc test. A minimum value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. For in vivo studies, three different litters were used for each experiment to account for potential effects within individual litters. Four to five retinas from different individual pups were analyzed for time points. For in vitro studies, at least three conditions were used in each experiment and experiments were repeated two additional times. For real-time PCR, six individual samples were used for NOX isoforms mRNA analysis. Results are means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). To determine the roles of endothelial NADPH oxidase isoforms in angiogenesis, we first detected expression profiles of NOX isoforms in several types of cultured vascular ECs (hRMVECs, CECs, HUVECs) using real-time PCR. In support of our hypothesis and the literature, NOX4 was the most prevalent isoform in all ECs tested, and NOX2 was also expressed in CECs (Figure 1). We then measured NOX4 expression in retinal lysates from pups raised in RA at postnatal day 0 (P0), P14, and P18 and found that NOX4 expression was reduced during development (Figure 2A). In comparison to RA-raised rat pups, NOX4 protein was significantly increased in the OIR model at P18 (Figure 2C), but not at P14 (Figure 2B). We then determined NOX4 localization in retinal cryosections from rat pups in OIR or RA at P18 (Figure 2D). Compared to the RA-raised rat pups, semiquantitative assessment of NOX4 density was greater in lectin-stained ECs in the P18 OIR model than the P18 RA (Figure 2E). Thus, NOX4 expression in retinal ECs was increased in the rat OIR model at the time point when IVNV occurred, whereas NOX4 was less prevalent during retinal vascular development. We previously found that VEGF-activated STAT3 caused retinal endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and that NADPH oxidase mediated IVNV through activated STAT3 in a rat OIR+supplemental oxygen model in which pups were placed in 28% supplemental oxygen from P14 to P18, rather than 21% oxygen as in the rat OIR model used in the study. We also previously reported that, compared to RA-raised pups, retinal VEGF expression increased at several time points including P18 in the rat OIR model. Therefore, to determine if increased EC NOX4 was associated with activation of retinal STAT3 at P18 when VEGF is also increased in the rat OIR model, we measured phosphorylated STAT3 and total STAT3 in retinal lysates from the P18 OIR model and RA pups (Figure 3A). STAT3 activation, determined as a ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 to total STAT3, was significantly increased at P18 in the OIR model compared to the RA pups (Figure 3B). This suggested that increased NOX4 was associated with activation of STAT3 and VEGF signaling at the time point when IVNV occurred. Increasing evidence indicates that NADPH oxidase participates in retinal angiogenesis through ROS generation. We previously reported that VEGF activated NADPH oxidase in CECs and contributed to choroidal neovascularization in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model. To understand the relationship between NOX4 and VEGF, we determined whether NOX4 was involved in VEGF-induced ROS generation in hRMVECs. In hRMVECs, knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection (Figure 4A) inhibited basal and VEGF-induced ROS generation (Figure 4B). This suggests that VEGF activates NOX4 and leads to ROS generation. Activated VEGF/ VEGFR2 signaling can cause IVNV in rat and mouse models of OIR. We determined if endothelial NOX4 was involved in VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling. We first measured VEGF-induced VEGFR2 and STAT3 phosphorylation in cultured hRMVECs that were transfected with NOX4 siRNA compared to control (Figure 5A). NOX4 silencing had no effect on basal levels of phosphorylated VEGFR2 (p-VEGFR2; Figure 5A) or STAT3 (p-STAT3; Figure 5B), but partly reduced p-VEGFR2 (Figure 5A) and completely inhibited VEGF-induced p-STAT3 (Figure 5B), providing support that STAT3 was a downstream effector of activated NOX4 and that NOX4 involved VEGFR2 signaling. To determine the mechanism in which VEGF/VEGFR2 and NOX4 were involved in downstream STAT3 activation, hRMVECs were pretreated with the VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, SU5416, or vehicle, and then stimulated with VEGF. In response to VEGF stimulation, coimmunoprecipitation of NOX4 with VEGFR2 was increased (Figure 5C). However, inhibition of VEGFR2 activation by SU5416 inhibited coimmunoprecipitation of NOX4 and VEGFR2 and SU5416 treatment effectively blocked VEGF-induced p-VEGFR2 in the same cell lysates (Figure 5C). Altogether, these results suggest that a structural relationship between NOX4 and p-VEGFR2 existed following VEGF-induced activation of VEGFR2 and that together the interaction over-activated STAT3. To assess the effect of NOX4 and STAT3 on EC proliferation, hRMVECs transfected with siRNAs to NOX4 or STAT3 or control siRNAs were treated with VEGF or PBS for 24 h. Compared to control, NOX4 siRNA (Figure 6A) and STAT3 siRNA (Figure 6B) significantly inhibited VEGF-induced hRMVEC proliferation. These and the previous data provide evidence that VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling mediated NOX4 enhanced EC proliferation through activation of STAT3. VEGF plays important roles in physiologic angiogenesis in development and in the adult as well as in pathologic angiogenesis in cancer and eye diseases. Inhibition of the bioactivity of VEGF has been used in several retinal and choroidal diseases to reduce pathologic angiogenesis, including several leading causes of blindness worldwide, neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity. However, in AMD, repeated anti-VEGF injections are usually required, and reports of retinal and choroidal atrophy raise concerns regarding long-term vision loss. In addition, a single dose of intravitreal anti-VEGF can reduce circulating VEGF levels, raising questions about reducing beneficial effects of VEGF as a neuroprotective agent in development or after brain ischemia or stroke. We previously found excessive signaling through VEGFR2-triggered signaling pathways that caused IVNV. To preserve beneficial aspects of VEGF signaling and inhibit IVNV, we sought to identify effectors that regulate VEGFR2 activation and downstream angiogenic signaling pathways as a means of supporting physiologic angiogenesis while inhibiting IVNV. NADPH oxidase isoforms NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 have been implicated in pathologic angiogenesis of the retina and choroid in different models. We previously found that activation of NADPH oxidase delayed physiologic retinal vascular development in the rat OIR model but caused IVNV mediated through STAT3 in the rat OIR model rescued in 28% supplemental oxygen. We and others also found that VEGF expression increased at several time points in the rat OIR model, including at P18 in association with IVNV. In this study, we focused on the potential role of NOX4 in retinal ECs in VEGF-induced IVNV. At P18 in the OIR model compared to RA pups, STAT3 activation was also increased in retinal lysates, in association with greater expression of retinal NOX4 and the development of IVNV. To study the role of NOX4 and VEGFR2 signaling in retinal ECs, a series of experiments were performed in cultured hRMVECs. Knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection inhibited basal and VEGF-induced ROS generation. In addition, knockdown of NOX4 partially reduced VEGF-induced VEGFR2 activation and abolished VEGF-induced STAT3 activation, suggesting the expression level of NOX4 and its activation to generate ROS were important for the interaction of NOX4/p-VEGFR2 and in maintaining activation of downstream signaling effectors of VEGFR2. The results from in vitro studies support a structural interaction between NOX4 and VEGFR2, perhaps through an adaptor protein, that relies on activation of VEGFR2, and that triggered STAT3 activation to cause hRMVEC proliferation. In summary, our study provides new evidence that VEGF-induced VEGFR2 can exacerbate downstream STAT3 activation through an interaction with NOX4 and may contribute to IVNV in the rat OIR model. Future studies to understand the interaction between NOX4 and p-VEGFR2 are important, because inhibiting NOX4 or its generated ROS may be a method to regulate VEGFR2 singaling and safely reduce VEGFR2-mediated IVNV."}, "21976953": {"pmid": "21976953", "pmcid": "PMC3185025", "title": "Identification of a novel FBN1 gene mutation in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome", "abstract": "\n\nPurpose\nTo identify the mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome (MFS).\n\n\nMethods\nPatients and family members were given complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of venous blood of six individuals in the family and 170 healthy Chinese individuals. All of the 65 coding exons and their flanking intronic boundaries of FBN1 were amplified in the proband by polymerase chain reaction and followed by direct sequencing. The mutation identified in the proband was screened in the other family members and the 170 healthy Chinese individuals by direct sequencing.

It is clinically diagnosed according to the Ghent criteria. MFS is mainly caused by mutations in the human fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. FBN1 contains 65 exons encoding a secreted 350\u00a0kDa glycoprotein, which is highly conserved among different species. Fibrillin-1 is characterized by a specific module organization in the extracellular matrix and is mainly composed of three types of repeated modules: 47 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like modules (43 calcium binding [or cb] EGF-like modules and 4 non-cb EGF-like modules), 7 transforming growth factor-binding (or TB) protein-like modules (8 Cys/TB), and 2 hybrid modules. To date, more than 60% of the reported mutations of FBN1 are missense mutations, and the majority of these are located in the cb EGF modules (in particular, cysteine residues, implicated in disulfide bond formation, or other residues implicated in calcium-binding and/or intra-/intermolecular interactions). There is limited evidence of genotype-phenotype correlations of this disorder, while mutations associated with neonatal MFS and other severe forms have been shown to cluster in exons 24\u201332. Molecular analysis of FBN1 is necessary because such analysis can detect at-risk individuals at an early stage and offer the possibility of prenatal diagnosis. We came across a four-generation family affected with MFS in Northeast China and detected a novel heterozygous mutation in FBN1. The mutation was found in the affected individuals but was not observed in any of the healthy family members. The proband, a 32-year-old female, was diagnosed with MFS according to the Ghent criteria. The family history revealed four affected members over four generations, two of whom were deceased. Available individuals II:2, II:6, II:7, III:4, III:12, and IV:4 were given complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations after obtaining informed consent (Figure 1). One hundred Chinese controls without diagnostic features of MFS were also recruited. The study was approved by the Harbin Medical University Ethics Committee (Harbin, China). Whole blood from six members of the family (II:2, II:6, II:7, III:4, III:12, and IV:4) and 170 unrelated Chinese controls were collected in tubes containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. Genomic DNA was extracted using a TIANamp Blood DNA Kit (Tiangen Biltech Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All 65 coding exons and flanking intronic regions, including splice sites of FBN1, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a set of primers listed in Appendix 1. PCR was performed for 35 cycles, with a denaturing phase of 30 s at 94\u00a0\u00b0C, annealing phase of 30 s at 58\u201362\u00a0\u00b0C, and an extension of 1 min at 72\u00a0\u00b0C. The PCR products were subsequently purified with a TIANgel Midi Purification Kit (Tiangen Biltech Co. Ltd) and sequenced with an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing results were assembled and analyzed using Chromas 2.22 software (Technelysium Pty. Ltd., QLD, Australia) with reference sequence in the Universal Mutation Database (UMD). A schematic of the cb EGF-like domain of human fibrillin-1 was used to assess the possible impact of the mutation at the secondary structure level. A homology 3D model of the cb EGF-like#15 domain was created based on the Protein data bank (PDB) template 1LMJ (45% sequence identity). DeepView v4.0.1 was used to display the structure file and to predict the potential consequence of the mutation. Two members (II:2 and III:12) of the family showed classic MFS (Appendix 2), and the unaffected family members, including a spouse (II:6), appeared normal. The daughter of the proband (IV:4), who was 2 years old, was too young for a clinical diagnosis to be made because several manifestations of MFS are age-dependent and may not yet be present in childhood. The proband had bilateral lens dislocation (Figure 2A,B), high myopia, and strabismus of both eyes. Echocardiography revealed cardiovascular manifestation of dilatation of the aortic root and mild mitral valve prolapse in the proband. Skeletal system abnormalities such as tall stature, long limbs, joint hypermobility, long narrow head, and arachnodactyly (Figure 2C), were also present in the proband. Individual II:2 showed similar clinical symptoms as the proband, with the exception of abnormalities of the cardiovascular system. Lentectomy and intraocular lens implantation were performed on individual II:2 in 2010. Family member II:5 had died of heart disease at the age of 53 and III:2 had died of hepatic cancer at the age of 39, and according to the proband\u2019s description, both of them appeared with tall stature, long limbs, and poor vision. Direct sequencing of FBN1 revealed a novel heterozygous mutation, c.3703T>C in exon 29, which resulted in the substitution of serine by proline (p.S1235P; Figure 3A). The mutation identified in the proband was also found in patient II:2 and the available affected member IV:4 (Figure 3B,C). No mutation was detected in the healthy family members (Figure 3D-F) or in any of the 170 unrelated control subjects (Figure 3G). The missense mutation c.3703T>C resulted in the substitution of serine at codon 1235, which is located in the neonatal region of fibrillin-1 (Figure 4A), and is highly conserved among mammalian species (Figure 3H). Secondary structure analysis of the cb EGF-like domain revealed that the mutant proline1235 could neither interfere with calcium binding in the NH2-terminal region of the domain nor influence disulfide bond formation (Figure 4B). Prediction by DeepView v4.0.1 suggested that the mutant residue could probably induce steric clash with its surroundings. Therefore, the conformation of the cb EGF-like domain was likely to be altered by the presence of this mutation (Figure 4C,D). In this study, we identified a novel heterozygous FBN1 mutation (p.S1235P) in a four-generation family affected with MFS. This missense mutation is located in the cb EGF-like#15 domain. It is clear that EGF-like domains play a major role in the pathogenesis of fibrillinopathies, as most of the mutations in these domains are associated with classic MFS. Each cb EGF-like domain of fibrillin-1 contains six highly conserved cysteine residues that form three intra-domain disulphide bonds (C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6) and a consensus sequence for calcium binding in the NH2-terminal region. The mutant residue found in our study, located at the 39th residue of the cb EGF-like#15 domain, did not affect disulphide bond formation or calcium binding of the domain at the secondary structure level. 3D structure analysis by DeepView v4.0.1 showed that the substitution of serine by proline could probably induce steric clash with its surroundings, which probably resulted in a conformation change and had a predictable detrimental effect on its function. It is evident that the structural effects of different FBN1 missense mutations are complex. Mutations in cb EGF motifs not affecting cysteines or residues of the calcium binding consensus sequence are extremely rare and have been postulated to affect intramolecular packing or intermolecular interactions, and subsequently affect microfiber assembly. Previously, only 6 mutations were published in the UMD website in the cb EGF-like#15 domain, and none of those mutations affected the residues between C-5 and C-6. The present study not only suggested that residues between C-5 and C-6 of cb EGF-like domains play an important role in maintaining the function of the FBN1 protein, but also added a new case to the notion that cb EGF-like#14\u201318 domains (in exons 28\u201332) are functionally more essential in fibrillin-1 of classic MFS than that of neonatal MFS. This rare mutation found in our study is located in the hot spot region for neonatal MFS and could also cause classic MFS. There is general consensus that neither the location of the affected module in the protein nor the position of the mutant residue is, by itself, sufficient to predict potential genotype-phenotype correlations. This missense mutation was also found in the proband\u2019s daughter, who was 2 years old and did not yet fulfill the diagnostic criteria. As such, in situations of clinical uncertainty, molecular analysis of FBN1 seems a logical aid in the clinical diagnosis of MFS. Moreover, the most important complication of MFS is a progressive dilatation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, leading to aortic valve incompetence and aortic dissection. As a result, early recognition of at-risk individuals not (yet) fulfilling the diagnostic criteria by molecular diagnosis is important in view of the available treatments that can significantly improve life expectancy and also offer the possibility of prenatal diagnosis. Although the four-generation MFS family we studied was large, the number of patients was relatively small. For genetic studies, it is better to examine pedigrees with more affected individuals, because (1) to find the mutant gene and exclude genetic heterogeneity, linkage analysis for candidate gene screening should be initially done, and in this condition, numbers of affected individuals should be large enough; and (2) more patients can help investigators to better interpret the rule of inheritance of the disease and display the genotype-phenotype correlations. Collectively, evidences from our study and published data supported that this novel p.S1235P mutation is the causative mutation for MFS in this four-generation family. Mutations in cb EGF-like domains of FBN1 play a critical role in the pathogenesis of classic MFS, and molecular diagnosis of MFS is becoming more and more important. Although more than 600 FBN1 mutations have been published in the UMD website for MFS, information on genotype\u2013phenotype correlations is still limited, especially in the Chinese population. Our data adds a novel mutation to the spectrum of FBN1 gene mutations, analyzes the potential functional consequence of the mutation, and enriches the existing knowledge of genotype\u2013phenotype correlations of Marfan syndrome."}, "19365571": {"pmid": "19365571", "pmcid": "PMC2666773", "title": "Macular corneal dystrophy in a Chinese family related with novel mutations of CHST6", "abstract": "\n\nPurpose\nTo identify mutations in the carbohydrate sulfotransferase gene (CHST6) for a Chinese family with macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) and to investigate the histopathological changes in the affected cornea.\n\n\nMethods\nA corneal button of the proband was obtained by penetrating keratoplasty.

The onset usually occurs in the first decade of life, starting with a fine superficial stromal haze in the central stroma. Gradually, the opacification extends to the periphery and usually involves the entire cornea, leading to visual impairment. At this time, penetrating keratoplasty is necessary. Although clinically indistinguishable, MCD has been subdivided into three immunophenotypes I, IA, and II, based on the serum level of sulfated keratan sulfate (KS) measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunohistochemical evaluation of the corneal tissue. The serum level of KS and the immunohistochemical reaction to the cornea is negative in the patients with MCD type I. The serum level of KS is negative, and the immunohistochemical reaction to the cornea is positive in the patients with type IA whereas both are positive in those patients with type II. MCD is histologically characterized by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the stromal lamellae, underneath the epithelium, and within the keratocytes and endothelial cells. An abnormality in the metabolism of KS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MCD. A gene responsible for MCD types I and II has been linked to chromosome 16q22. Recently, mutations in a new carbohydrate sulfotransferase gene (CHST6) encoding corneal glucosamine N-acety-6-sulfotransferase (C-GlcNac-6-ST) have been identified. Lack of activity of this enzyme is thought to result in the production of unsulfated KS and the loss of transparency in the corneas of affected patients. Akama and others have described missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and insertions within the coding region in CHST6 in patients with type I macular corneal dystrophy (differentiation between types I and IA was not performed) whereas MCD type II is associated with deletions and rearrangements in the upstream region of CHST6 as well as missense mutations. Despite the variety of mutations reported in both type I and type II patients, all of the identified sequence changes are associated with a similar clinical appearance. In this study, we identified novel compound heterozygous mutations within CHST6 in a Chinese family with MCD and investigated the histopathological changes of the opaque cornea. The family was ascertained by the Department of Ophthalmology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University (Harbin, China). Informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Heilongjiang Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from all participants. The pedigree was a four-generation family with three affected members, six unaffected family individuals, and two spouses (Figure 1). Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of their peripheral blood by standard procedures. Clinical diagnosis of MCD for these patients was based on pedigree structure and clinical features, which include bilateral symmetric stromal cloudiness studded by small, irregular, rounded, gray-white anterior stromal patches. One hundred normal Chinese samples were collected as the control. A half section of the corneal button obtained from the proband by penetrating keratoplasty was fixed in 4% formaldehyde then made into paraffin-embedded samples stained with Hale\u2019s Colloidal iron (Maxim IHC World, Fuzhou, China). After being fixed in 2.5% buffer glutaraldehyde, the other half section was washed with PBS, fixed in 4% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in the alcohol, and embedded by routine epoxy resin from which ultrathin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were examined with light microscope (LM) and electron microscope (EM). The unique exon involving the coding region, exon 3, was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers described previously. The cycling program started with an initial denaturing step of 5 min at 95\u00a0\u00b0C followed by 33 cycles of 94\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 s, 53\u201357\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 45 s with a final extension step at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 10 min. PCR products were purified and directly sequenced on both strands by using an automatic DNA sequencer (ABIPrism 377XL; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).The nucleotide sequences were compared with the published cDNA sequence of CHST6 (NM_021615). Two enzymes, PvuII with recognition site 5\u2032\u2026CAG\u02c7CTG\u20263\u2032 and PmacI with recognition site 5\u2032\u2026 CAC\u02c7GTG\u2026 3\u2032, were used for all family individuals to confirm the two heterozygous mutations identified by sequencing c. 892C>T and c.1072T>C, respectively. To exclude the possibility that the mutations were polymorphisms, the PCR products from 100 control subjects were also analyzed by those restriction enzymes. After digestion with PvuII and PmacI, the PCR products were electrophoresed by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by staining with 0.2% AgNO3. Slit lamp examination of the affected individuals showed that stromal cloudiness were studded by irregular rounded gray-white opacities in both the central and peripheral cornea (Figure 2). The corneal opacities were deep into corneal stroma anterior, the endothelial layer, and Descemet\u2019s membrane. From light microscopic study, plaque deposits were diffusely found in the corneal stroma and even near the endothelium. They presented significant positive reaction to Hale\u2019s colloidal iron stain, which was indicated by extracellular blue accumulations in the stroma. (Figure 3). Under transmission electron microscopy, it was displayed that the collagen fibers in the corneal stroma were irregular, enlarged, and intensive and the fibroblasts were active and hyperplastic. The enlargement of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and intracytoplasmic vacuoles appeared within those cells (Figure 4). CHST6 is 16.9 kb in length and consists of four exons of which only exon 3 contains the coding region. Two mutations, c. 892C>T and c. 1072T>C, were identified on each allele of exon 3. The first heterozygous change from the maternal allele, a c. 892C>T transition, occurred at the first nucleotide position of codon 298, predicting a change of amino acid glutamine to a stop codon (p.Q298X). The other change on the paternal allele, a c. 1072T>C transition, was identified at the second nucleotide position of codon 358, changing the amino acid from tyrosine to histidine (p.Y358H; Figure 5). Each patient (III:2, III:4, and III:6) in this family was found to have these two mutations within CHST6. The unaffected individuals II-2, III:1, and IV-1 were heterozygous with the nonsense change, c. 892C>T, while the other unaffected individuals II-3, III-5, and IV-2 were heterozygous with the missense change, c. 1072T>C. PCR products from individuals with c.892C>T transition were digested into 153 bp and 173 bp by restriction enzyme, PvuII, whereas ones without c.892C>T transition only had a 153 bp segment. Sequence with c.1072T>C transition could be divided into 337 bp and 357 bp by PmacI, but those without c.1072T>C transition only had a 357 bp segment. In addition, the results showed that the two heterozygous restriction enzyme segments segregated with all affected members. PCR products from 100 control subjects were analyzed by the same two restriction enzymes, but no mutation segments were found among them (Figure 6, Figure 7). Macular corneal dystrophy is the least common of the classic stromal dystrophies. This disorder is more common in Iceland, however, representing the most frequent indication for penetrating keratoplasty. In the present study, we collected one pedigree with three patients clinically diagnosed with MCD. Slit lamp examination of the affected individuals showed corneal opacities and stromal haze, which were common characteristic of MCD as described elsewhere. Sequence analysis of the CHST6 coding region revealed compound heterozygous mutations, c.892 C>T and c.1072T >C, co-segregated with the disease in the pedigree, which resulted in a missense mutation (p.Y358H) and an early stop codon (p.Q298X), respectively, and implied MCD as a recessive inherited disorder. Each patient (III:2, III:4, and III:6) diagnosed with MCD in this family were found to have both mutations. Six unaffected blood related members carried either one of the two mutations. None of these nucleotide alterations were detected in the 100 normal control subjects, indicating that these variations were not polymorphisms. The CHST6 protein is a sulfotransferase, a carbohydrate sulfotransferase of the semi-methyl-D/N-acetyl-galactose/N-acetyl glucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase family, which can catalyze the phosphorylation of 6-hydroxy-6-O of N-acetyl glucosamine, galactose, and N-acetyl galactosamine. In the normal corneal tissue, keratan sulfate (KS) is an important glycosaminoglycan, which exists as a highly sulfated form and plays a crucial role in the structure and transparency of the cornea. CHST6 can transfer the sulfuric acid group from the 3\u2032-adenosine 5\u2032-phosphate acid (PAPS) to the KS by competing with an endogenous or exogenous substrate. The variations in the coding region of CHST6 may decrease activity of the enzyme or even make it lost, leading to a low sulfated form or non-sulfated form of KS. Due to the loss of it's soluble property, non-sulfated KS is unable to be completely metabolized, inducing sediment to deposit in the corneal stroma. The nonsense change (p.Q298X) resulted in the premature termination of protein transcription and truncated, dysfunctional protein products. Sultana and Ha also found other nonsense mutations in the gene and thought that the truncated protein was instable and could be degraded rapidly, which was related to the MCD phenotype. The p.Y358H mutation is a new missense mutation that changes tyrosine to histidine, inducing the substitution between a neutral amino acid into a basic amino acid. In 2005, El-Ashry found the p.Y358D mutation (tyrosine to aspartate) in the patients with MCD type I, which changes from a neutral amino acid into an acidic amino acid. The tyrosine at codon 358 is highly conservative in many eukaryotic species such as human, canine, chimpanzee, rat, mouse, and drosophila, using bioinformatic analysis. So we speculated that the Y358H mutation could also affect the protein function. Thus, in our study, KS was observed to deposit in the cornea extensively and deeply, which should be associated with severe abnormalities of the sulfotransferase, leading to little activity and lack of function. As detected by microscopy, plaque accumulations (significant positive reaction to Hale\u2019s colloidal iron stain) diffusely appeared in the corneal stroma and even close to the endothelium. They were likely to be made up of the enlarged and intensive collagen fibers and active, hyperplastic fibroblasts that attempted to ingest the abnormal sediment, which caused the enlargement of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles in the cells. The mutations identified in this Chinese family are completely different from those reported previously in other Asians (Japanese) or whites (British and Icelandic). Together with previous reports, our data indicate significant allelic heterogeneity exists in MCD and the essential role of CHST6 in the transparency of the cornea. The immunophenotype of MCD has not been performed in our study since we could not test the serum level of KS. Yet no matter the type of MCD, all have indistinguishable clinical characteristic and the same responsible gene. Further studies on these mutations would be helpful to achieve a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MCD."}, "24914936": {"pmid": "24914936", "pmcid": "PMC4138578", "title": "Thyroid Hormone Receptor \u03b1 Mutation Causes a Severe and Thyroxine-Resistant Skeletal Dysplasia in Female Mice", "abstract": "\nA new genetic disorder has been identified that results from mutation of THRA, encoding thyroid hormone receptor \u03b11 (TR\u03b11). Affected children have a high serum T3:T4 ratio and variable degrees of intellectual deficit and constipation but exhibit a consistently severe skeletal dysplasia. In an attempt to improve developmental delay and alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism, patients are receiving varying doses and durations of T4 treatment, but responses have been inconsistent so far. Thra1PV/+ mice express a similar potent dominant-negative mutant TR\u03b11 to affected individuals, and thus represent an excellent disease model. We hypothesized that Thra1PV/+ mice could be used to predict the skeletal outcome of human THRA mutations and determine whether prolonged treatment with a supraphysiological dose of T4 ameliorates the skeletal abnormalities. Adult female Thra1PV/+ mice had short stature, grossly abnormal bone morphology but normal bone strength despite high bone mass. Although T4 treatment suppressed TSH secretion, it had no effect on skeletal maturation, linear growth, or bone mineralization, thus demonstrating profound tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. Despite this, prolonged T4 treatment abnormally increased bone stiffness and strength, suggesting the potential for detrimental consequences in the long term. Our studies establish that TR\u03b11 has an essential role in the developing and adult skeleton and predict that patients with different THRA mutations will display variable responses to T4 treatment, which depend on the severity of the causative mutation.\n", "fulltext": "The THRA and THRB genes encode the nuclear receptors (thyroid hormone receptor [TR\u03b1] and TR\u03b2), which mediate thyroid hormone action in target tissues (1). Autosomal-dominant resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) was recognized in 1967 (2), and the first causative mutations affecting THRB were identified 22 years later (3). More thanr 1000 RTH families have since been described, and affected individuals have increased thyroid hormone levels with an inappropriately normal or elevated TSH concentration due to disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis (4). After the identification of THRB mutations in individuals with RTH it was a further 23 years before the first THRA mutations were reported in 2012 and 2013 (5\u20137). A six year-old girl with skeletal dysplasia and growth retardation was found to have a heterozygous THRA nonsense mutation resulting in expression of a truncated TR\u03b11E403X protein. She had normal serum TSH with low/normal T4 and high/normal T3 concentrations. Further investigations revealed macrocephaly with patent and abnormal skull sutures, delayed tooth eruption and bone age, disproportionate short stature, and epiphyseal dysgenesis with delayed mineralization of secondary ossification centers. Treatment with T4 for 9 months resulted in suppression of TSH and an increased basal metabolic rate but did not improve linear growth or skeletal development (5). A second girl with similar thyroid function and skeletal dysplasia was found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in THRA resulting in expression of a truncated TR\u03b11F397fs406X protein (6). She presented at the age of 3 years with macrocephaly, delayed tooth eruption, absent secondary ossification centers, and congenital hip dislocation. Reducing growth velocity became evident between 3 and 6 years of age. T4 treatment between 6 and 11 years of age only resulted in a small increase in growth velocity for a 2-month period but ultimately had no effect on her height, which continued along the 20th centile and was accompanied by persistently delayed bone age. The girl's 47-year-old father had the same THRA mutation and displayed short stature with a height 3.77 SDs below normal and acquired hearing loss due to otosclerosis (6, 8). Recently, a 45-year-old female with similar thyroid function, macrocephaly, and disproportionate short stature was identified and found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in THRA, resulting in expression of a truncated TR\u03b11P382fs388X protein. She presented in infancy with developmental delay and was treated intermittently with T4, which resulted in some improvement in growth velocity although her final adult height remained 2.34 SDs below normal (7). These recent reports define a new genetic disorder characterized by a severe developmental phenotype with profound skeletal abnormalities that are thought to result from impaired T3 action in bone and cartilage (5\u20138). In an attempt to ameliorate the phenotype, three children have already received intermittent T4 at different doses and for varying durations. However, responses to date have been limited, and it is unknown whether long-term T4 treatment will be beneficial or detrimental. Thus, it is now essential to define the adult skeletal consequences of THRA mutations and determine the long-term effects of T4 supplementation, because life-long therapy is likely to be required. Importantly, Van Mullem et al (8) showed that dominant-negative inhibition of TR\u03b2 by TR\u03b11F397fs406X in vitro could be overcome partially by a high concentration of thyroid hormone. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that TR\u03b2 may mediate T3 actions in bone and cartilage (9\u201312), even though the principal physiological effects are mediated by TR\u03b11. These observations suggest, therefore, that treatment of patients with supraphysiological doses of T4 may improve their skeletal abnormalities via TR\u03b2-mediated actions. To address this timely question we investigated the effects of prolonged T4 treatment in a mouse model of this novel disease. Mice with dominant-negative mutations affecting Thra (Thra1PV) and Thrb (ThrbPV) were generated to investigate the tissue-specific roles of TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2 and aid the identification of patients with THRA mutations (13, 14). The PV mutation, first recognized in a patient with RTH, is a C-insertion in exon 10 of THRB that results in a frameshift affecting the C-terminal 16 amino acids (15). The equivalent Thra1PV mutation comprises a homologous C-insertion followed by the PV sequence described in THRBPV (14, 16). The Thra1PV mutation disrupts helix 12 of TR\u03b11, which is essential for T3 binding and coactivator recruitment (17) and lies within a 21-amino acid region containing the described human THRA mutations (5\u20137). Accordingly, TR\u03b11PV cannot bind T3 or activate target gene transcription but acts as a potent dominant-negative inhibitor of wild-type (WT) TR\u03b11 or TR\u03b2 (14, 18, 19). Thus, the functional characteristics of TR\u03b11PV closely resemble those reported for TR\u03b11E403X, TR\u03b11F397fs406X, and TR\u03b11P382fs388X (5\u20137). Importantly, PV and none of the described human mutations affect the sequence of the TR\u03b12 isoform that is also expressed from the THRA locus but which cannot bind T3 and has no known physiological function. Consistent with this, juvenile Thra1PV/+ mice display the same characteristics as children with heterozygous THRA mutations. They have a reduced T4:T3 ratio (14), delayed closure of the skull sutures with enlarged fontanelles, and severe postnatal growth retardation with delayed bone age. These abnormalities result from impaired TR\u03b11-mediated T3 action in bone and cartilage (20\u201322), indicating that Thra1PV mice represent an excellent disease model in which to investigate the consequences of prolonged T4 treatment. We hypothesized that the adult phenotype of Thra1PV/+ mice would predict the skeletal outcome of human THRA mutations and determine whether affected individuals may be susceptible to fracture or osteoarthritis, both of which are associated with altered thyroid hormone action in bone (23\u201326). We also hypothesized that prolonged treatment of Thra1PV/+ mice with a supraphysiological dose of T4 would ameliorate the developmental skeletal phenotype and improve bone structure and strength in adulthood. The current studies demonstrate that adult Thra1PV/+ mice have short stature but normal bone strength despite high bone mass, suggesting that patients with THRA mutations are unlikely to have an increased risk of fracture. By contrast, gross morphologic abnormalities of the bones and joints predict that individuals with THRA mutations may be predisposed to osteoarthritis (27, 28). Although treatment with a supraphysiological dose of T4 completely suppressed TSH secretion, it had no effect on skeletal maturation, linear growth, or bone mineralization, thus demonstrating profound tissue resistance to thyroid hormone in Thra1PV/+ mice. However, prolonged T4 treatment increased bone stiffness and strength abnormally due to progressive enlargement of cortical bone diameter and thickness. Overall, the findings suggest that T4 treatment of individuals with dominant-negative THRA mutations is unlikely to improve their skeletal abnormalities substantially and may even be detrimental in the long term. Nevertheless, Thra1PV/+ mice represent an important disease model in which to identify and evaluate new therapeutic approaches. WT and heterozygous Thra1PV/+ mice have a mixed C57BL/6J and NIH Black Swiss genetic background and were bred and genotyped as described elsewhere (14, 21). Detailed characterization of the adult skeleton in Thra1PV/+ mice was performed in 14-week-old female mice after cessation of growth, and in fully mature 20-week-old female mice that had been treated with vehicle or T4 from weaning at 4 weeks of age until death. All mice were given ip injections of calcein (10 mg/kg in 100 \u03bcL PBS) 14 and 7 days before tissue collection (29). Animal studies were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee granted ethical approval for all experiments. TSH, T4, and T3 levels were determined in serum from mice (n = 5\u201313 per group) treated with vehicle or T4 (1.2 \u03bcg/mL in the drinking water) between 4\u201320 weeks of age. T4-supplemented water was changed every 3 days, with the T4 concentration adjusted to intake in 2-week cycles to ensure all animals received the same amount of T4 and did not become markedly thyrotoxic (14, 30\u201332). Tibias were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and decalcified in 10% EDTA, embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (5 \u03bcm) were stained with alcian blue and van Gieson (29, 33). Measurements from at least 4 separate positions across the growth plate were obtained to calculate the mean height using a Leica DM LB2 microscope and DFC320 digital camera (Leica Microsystems). Results from 2 levels of sectioning were compared. Femurs were imaged at 10 \u03bcm resolution using a Faxitron MX20 (Qados). Bone mineral content was determined relative to steel, aluminum, and polyester standards. Images were calibrated with a digital micrometer, and bone length, cortical bone diameter, and thickness were determined (33, 34). Femurs were analyzed by micro-CT (Skyscan 1172a) at 50 kV and 200 \u03bcA with a detection pixel size of 4.3 \u03bcm2, and images were reconstructed using Skyscan NRecon software. A 1-mm3 region of interest was selected 0.2 mm from the growth plate, and trabecular bone volume as proportion of tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular number, and trabecular thickness were determined (29, 33). Representative femurs from each treatment group were rescanned using a SCANCO \u03bcCT 40 (SCANCO Medical AG) operating at 55 kVp peak energy detection, 6 \u03bcm resolution to obtain approximately 2500 cross-sections per specimen in 766 \u00d7 763 pixel 16 bit DICOM files. Raw data were imported using 32-bit Drishti v2.0.221 (Australian National University Supercomputer Facility, http://anusf.anu.edu.au/Vizlab/drishti/) and rendered using 64-bit Drishti v2.0.000 to generate high-resolution images. Femurs were fixed in 70% ethanol and opened longitudinally (33). Carbon-coated samples were imaged using backscattered electrons with a Zeiss DSM962 digital scanning electron microscope (EM) at 20-kV beam potential (KE Electronics). High-resolution images were quantified using ImageJ to determine the fraction of trabecular and endosteal bone surfaces displaying osteoclastic resorption (33). Bone mineralization was determined by quantitative BSE-SEM at 1-\u03bcm3 resolution. Specimens were embedded in methacrylate and block faces polished to an optical finish for scanning electron microscopy (EM) analysis at 20 kV, 0.5nA with a working distance of 11 mm (33). Gradations of micromineralization density were represented in 8 equal intervals by a pseudocolor scheme (33, 35). Sections from decalcified tibias were stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, counterstained with aniline blue, and imaged using a Leica DM LB2 microscope and DFC320 digital camera (29, 33). A montage of 9 overlapping fields covering an area of 1 mm2 located 0.2 mm below the growth plate was constructed for each bone. BV/TV was measured, and osteoclast numbers and surface were determined in trabecular bone normalized to total bone surface (BS) (29, 33). Methacrylate-embedded specimens were imaged with a Leica SP2 reflection confocal microscope at 488-nm excitation to determine the fraction of BS undergoing active bone formation (33, 36). Mineral apposition rate was calculated by determining the separation between calcein labels at 20 locations per specimen beginning 0.2 mm below the growth plate. BS and mineralizing surface were measured using ImageJ, and the bone formation rate was calculated by multiplying mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate. Three-point bend tests were performed on tibias, with a constant rate of displacement of 0.03 mm/s until fracture, using an Instron 5543 load frame and 100N load cell (Instron Limited). Biomechanical variables reflecting cortical bone strength were derived from load displacement curves (33, 37). Data were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test; P < .05 was considered significant. Frequency distributions of mineralization densities obtained by Faxitron and quantitative BSE were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (29, 33, 34). The thyroid status of adult WT and Thra1PV/+ mice was determined following treatment with vehicle or a supraphysiological dose of T4 from weaning until 14 weeks of age (Figure 1). The basal T4 concentration did not differ between WT and Thra1PV/+ mice, whereas T3 and TSH levels were increased in Thra1PV/+ mice by 1.5-fold (P < .01) and 6-fold (P < .001), respectively. Thus, the characteristically reduced T4:T3 ratio identified in individuals with THRA mutations (5\u20137) was also present in Thra1PV/+ mice (T4:T3 ratio: Thra1PV/+ 23 vs WT 39). Supraphysiological T4 treatment completely suppressed TSH in both WT and Thra1PV/+ mice. Despite profound and similar suppression of TSH, the increases in circulating T4 and T3 concentrations were attenuated in Thra1PV/+ mice (T4, 3.5-fold increase; T3, 1.5-fold) compared with WT (T4, 6-fold increase, P < .001; T3, 4-fold, P < .01) indicating that they are resistant to T4 administration. Delayed bone development in juvenile Thra1PV/+ mice (21) led to severe skeletal abnormalities in adults. Growth plates in 14- and 20-week-old Thra1PV/+ mice were 39% and 70% wider than in WT mice (Figure 2, A and B), demonstrating persistent delay of endochondral ossification. An increased degree of retention of mineralized cartilage within trabeculae revealed that bone modeling was also impaired (Figure 2C). T4 administration did not affect either of these abnormalities in mutant mice (Figure 2 and data not shown). Bones from 14- and 20-week-old Thra1PV/+ mice were grossly dysmorphic. They were 17% and 15% shorter than WT and had splayed metaphyses, an abnormal cross-section throughout the diaphysis, and misshapen joint surfaces (Figure 3A). Micro-CT analysis indicated that trabecular bone volume, number, and thickness were increased in 20-week-old Thra1PV/+ mice (BV/TV, 2.1-fold; trabecular number, 1.9-fold; trabecular thickness, 1.1-fold greater) (Supplemental Figure 1), and these findings were confirmed by back-scattered electron-scanning EM (BSE-SEM) (Figure 3B). Similarly, cortical bone thickness (48% wider at 14 weeks, 43% at 20 weeks) and periosteal diameter (13% larger at 14 weeks, 20% at 20 weeks) were markedly increased in Thra1PV/+ mice (Supplemental Figure 1). T4 administration had no effect on these morphologic abnormalities (Figure 3A) but resulted in a gradual increase in cortical bone thickness and diameter in Thra1PV/+ mice (Supplemental Figure 1). Importantly, the endosteal diameter did not change in Thra1PV/+ mice following T4 treatment, whereas in WT mice it increased by 16% (P < .01). Thus, the increase in cortical bone thickness in Thra1PV/+ mice resulted from a failure of endosteal bone resorption combined with a likely increase in periosteal bone deposition. X-ray microradiography revealed that 14-week-old Thra1PV/+ mice had lower bone mineral content than WT mice, consistent with reduced mineral accrual during postnatal growth (21). Thus, in Figure 4A, the pseudocolored images in 14-week-old mice show more yellow and fewer red pixels in Thra1PV/+ mice compared with WT, indicating reduced bone mineral content. These differences are shown graphically in Figure 4B, in which the frequency distribution for Thra1PV/+ mice is shifted to the left. By contrast, in 20-week-old mice there was a small shift to the right in the pixel frequency distribution for Thra1PV/+, mice indicating higher, rather than lower, bone mineral content in older animals (Figure 4, A and B). Remarkably, supraphysiological T4 treatment further increased bone mineral content in Thra1PV/+ mice even though, as expected, it was reduced in WT mice following treatment (Figure 4, A and B). Thus, Thra1PV/+ mice were resistant to T4-induced bone loss and had a paradoxical increase in bone mineral content following treatment. Despite this, BSE-SEM revealed that cortical and trabecular bone mineralization density was reduced in 20 week-old Thra1PV/+ mice, the difference being greater in cortical bone, and that T4 treatment did not affect mineralization (Figure 5, A\u2013D). Thus, Thra1PV/+ mice have an increase in bone mineral content (Figure 4) despite the reduction in tissue mineralization density (Figure 5) because their trabecular and cortical bone volume is substantially increased (Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 1). Overall, therefore, Thra1PV/+ mice have increased cortical and trabecular bone volume compared with WT, but their bone is less mineralized. Consistent with micro-CT and BSE-SEM analysis, histomorphometry studies demonstrated increased bone volume and surface in Thra1PV/+ mice. Furthermore, osteoclast surfaces were reduced and fewer osteoclasts were present in Thra1PV/+ mice compared with WT (Figure 6, A\u2013C). Thus, Thra1PV/+ mice had a smaller proportion of their increased BS covered by osteoclasts (see also Supplemental Figure 2). The differences in BS, BV/TV, osteoclast surface/BS, and osteoclast number/BS between WT and Thra1PV/+ mice were accentuated following T4 treatment (Figure 6, A\u2013C). Consistent with these findings, bone resorption was generally lower in Thra1PV/+ mice (Supplemental Figure 2) but bone formation parameters were similar (Supplemental Figure 3). However, it is important to note that small differences in dynamic bone formation may not have been detected in these studies because only 3 mice were analyzed per group. Biomechanical testing revealed no difference in bone strength between untreated WT and Thra1PV/+ mice (Figure 7, A and B). Nevertheless, T4 treatment resulted in gradual increases in yield load, maximum load, fracture load, and stiffness of bones from Thra1PV/+ mice (Figure 7, A and B). Thus, prolonged T4 administration abnormally and progressively increased bone stiffness and strength in Thra1PV/+ mice. During development Thra1PV/+ mice have delayed closure of the skull sutures, severe growth retardation, delayed bone age, and impaired bone mineral accrual (22). The delayed ossification persists into adulthood and is accompanied by impaired bone modeling and remodeling, resulting in short stature, increased bone mass, and gross morphologic abnormalities of the bones and joints, but normal bone strength. These findings suggest that, despite severe skeletal abnormalities, adults with THRA mutations are unlikely to have an increased risk of fracture. However morphologic abnormalities affecting the bones and joints predict that they may be at increased risk of osteoarthritis (27, 28). The abnormalities in Thra1PV/+ mice are consistent with effects of prolonged hypothyroidism on the growing and adult skeleton (38\u201342). Hypothyroidism disrupts growth plate chondrocyte differentiation leading to delayed endochondral ossification and linear growth, impairs bone modeling, and uncouples the processes of osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation (43). In adults, even though it is well established that thyroid hormones increase bone resorption and promote bone loss, it is not known whether T3 acts directly in osteoclasts or whether effects on osteoclasts are secondary to the direct actions of T3 in osteoblasts (43). In Thra1PV/+ mice, prolonged impairment of chondrocyte differentiation is manifest by growth retardation and short stature in adulthood. Similarly, defective osteoclastic bone resorption is evidenced by reduced metaphyseal in-wasting, abnormal diaphyseal cross-section, and increased trabecular bone volume with retention of mineralized cartilage. Moreover, the grossly delayed formation of secondary ossification centers and reduced bone mineral accrual in Thra1PV/+ mice persisted throughout growth when mice were active and gaining weight. Thus, unmineralized epiphyses were exposed to abnormal and greater mechanical loads, resulting in compensatory enlargement of the epiphyses and metaphyses and culminating in adult joint deformity. Surprisingly, the strength of adult Thra1PV/+ bones was normal despite these structural abnormalities and is accounted for by the increased cortical bone thickness and diameter (33, 44). A series of studies in genetically modified mice have shown that TR\u03b11 is the principal mediator of T3 action in bone and cartilage (12, 21, 45\u201348). The finding of an identical skeletal phenotype in patients with THRA mutations (5\u20137) now demonstrates that TR\u03b11 has a similar essential role in human bone development. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the skeletal phenotypes in Thra mutant mice revealed decreased expression of T3 target genes including GH receptor (Ghr), insulin like growth factor-1 (Igf1), Igf1 receptor (Igf1r), fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (Fgfr1) and Fgfr3, and reduced downstream signaling responses mediated by the MAPK, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, and AKT signaling pathways in chondrocytes and osteoblasts (12, 20, 21, 45, 49, 50). These data demonstrate impaired T3 action in cartilage and bone in Thra mutant mice despite a normal systemic T3 concentration and thus indicate the skeletal phenotype in individuals with THRA mutations is a consequence of local resistance to thyroid hormone. The phenotypes in Thra1PV/+ mice and patients with THRA mutations result from the actions of potent dominant-negative mutant receptors. However, we have previously reported that mice harboring a less severe Thra1R384C mutation have a milder phenotype with only transiently delayed ossification and growth retardation, although modeling and remodeling defects resulting in increased bone mass, cortical thickness, and diameter were present in adults (45, 47). Importantly, and in contrast to Thra1PV/+ mice, treatment of Thra1R384C mice with a dose of T3 that overcomes the reduced ligand binding affinity and dominant-negative activity of the mutant receptor did ameliorate their skeletal abnormalities (45). The response to thyroid hormone treatment in Thra1R384C mice suggests that individuals with THRA mutations may benefit from similar treatment. Unfortunately, however, doses of T4 sufficient to normalize circulating hormone concentrations have been largely ineffective in the patients treated so far (5\u20138), presumably because the currently identified individuals have mutations that result in expression of mutant receptors with little or no T3 binding affinity. Despite this, Van Mullem et al (8) showed that dominant-negative inhibition of TR\u03b2 by TR\u03b11F397fs406X in vitro could be overcome partially by increasing concentrations of thyroid hormones. In this context, several studies have suggested that TR\u03b2 can mediate T3 action in bone and cartilage (9\u201312), even though the principal physiological effects are mediated via TR\u03b11. Thus, we hypothesized that treatment of Thra1PV/+ mice with a supraphysiological dose of T4 might improve bone structure and strength. However, such treatment of Thra1PV/+ mice had no beneficial effect on growth or skeletal deformity but did, nevertheless, increase cortical bone thickness and diameter. These responses were likely mediated by TR\u03b2 and resulted in abnormal increases in bone stiffness and strength that may adversely affect the optimal compromise between strength and flexibility that is essential to minimize fracture risk (51). Thus, prolonged treatment of individuals harboring THRA mutations with high doses of T4 may also have adverse consequences in other tissues where T3 action is predominantly mediated via TR\u03b2. GH therapy represents an alternative approach to improve linear growth and skeletal maturation in children with THRA mutations, but treatment in one individual so far was ineffective (6). The reduced expression of Ghr, Igf1, and Igf1r, together with impaired signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and AKT signaling in growth plate chondrocytes in Thra mutant mice (12, 21, 50), suggests a mechanism to account for this lack of clinical response to GH. Thyroid hormone metabolism is mediated by 3 iodothyronine deiodinases. The type 1 enzyme (D1) catalyzes removal of an inner or outer ring iodine from T4 to generate T3 or rT3, or an outer ring iodine from rT3 to generate 3,3\u2032-diiodothyronine. D1 is expressed in liver, kidney, and thyroid and contributes to the circulating concentration of T3 (52). The type 2 enzyme (D2) converts the prohormone T4 to the active hormone T3: it is expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary and peripheral target tissues, where it generates a local supply of T3 and is subject to substrate-mediated inactivation (53). By contrast, the type 3 enzyme (D3) catalyzes removal of an inner ring iodine from T4 or T3 to generate the inactive metabolites rT3 or 3,3\u2032-diiodothyronine. D3 expression is induced by thyroid hormone, thus limiting the supply of T3 in conditions of thyroid hormone excess (52). Remarkably, and despite complete suppression of TSH, Thra1PV/+ mice had a blunted increase in circulating thyroid hormones following a supraphysiological dose of T4. This discrepancy indicates that the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis is intact in Thra1PV/+ mice, but metabolism of thyroid hormones must be increased. Indeed, we previously showed that untreated Thra1PV/+ mice have a 9-fold increase in hepatic D1 mRNA expression (14) resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in enzyme activity (54). It is well established that T3 acts via TR\u03b21 to stimulate D1 expression in the liver (55, 56) and, accordingly, hepatic D1 activity is increased further in Thra1PV/+ mice following treatment with T3 (54, 57). By contrast, T3 acts via TR\u03b11 to stimulate expression of D3 (58) and we previously demonstrated that T3 treatment of Thra1PV/+ mice fails to induce the normal increase in D3 activity observed in WT animals (54, 57). We propose, therefore, that the resistance to T4 administration observed in Thra1PV/+ mice results from the markedly increased D1 activity combined with this absent D3 response (Figure 8). Consistent with this model, TSH in individuals with THRA mutations was suppressed readily following T4 treatment despite only small increases in T4 and T3 concentrations (7, 8). Detailed future metabolic studies will be required to confirm the precise underlying mechanisms responsible for these findings. For example, because defects in TR\u03b11 action may result in intestinal problems, it is possible that absorption of orally administered T4 could be impaired in Thra1PV/+ mice. However, it should also be noted that, following oral treatment with T4, the TSH concentration was suppressed completely in both WT and Thra1PV/+ mice, indicating that intestinal absorption of T4 was unlikely to be markedly impaired in Thra1PV/+ mice. Nevertheless, it would be instructive to investigate whether differences in serum T4 and T3 levels persist between WT and Thra1PV/+ mice following parenteral administration of T4. The overall resistance of the skeleton to T4 treatment in Thra1PV/+ mice and the patients studied so far is likely to be a consequence of the potent dominant-negative activities of their mutant TR\u03b11 proteins (5\u20137, 14, 18). It is inevitable, however, that individuals with less severe THRA mutations will be identified in the future and, in such cases, T4 treatment is likely to be beneficial. Thus, treatment of Thra1R384C mice with doses of T4 that overcome the reduced binding affinity of TR\u03b11R384C rescued their skeletal phenotype by preventing delayed ossification and growth retardation, ultimately ameliorating adult bone structure and mineralization (45). Taken together, these studies predict that individuals with THRA mutations will display variable degrees of skeletal deformity and different responses to T4 treatment that correlate with the functional consequences of the particular disease-causative mutation. Therefore, in patients with THRA mutations, it will be important to characterize the functional properties of their mutant TR\u03b11 because this may predict their response to T4 treatment and the optimal systemic T4 concentration required."}, "27729412": {"pmid": "27729412", "pmcid": "PMC5161515", "title": "Reduced adiponectin expression after high-fat diet is associated with selective up-regulation of ALDH1A1 and further retinoic acid receptor signaling in adipose tissue", "abstract": "\nAdiponectin is an adipocyte-derived adipokine with potent antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic activity. Long-term, high-fat diet results in gain of body weight, adiposity, further inflammatory-based cardiovascular diseases, and reduced adiponectin secretion. Vitamin A derivatives/retinoids are involved in several of these processes, which mainly take place in white adipose tissue (WAT). In this study, we examined adiponectin expression as a function of dietary high-fat and high\u2013vitamin A conditions in mice. A decrease of adiponectin expression in addition to an up-regulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase A1 (ALDH1A1), retinoid signaling, and retinoic acid response element signaling was selectively observed in WAT of mice fed a normal\u2013vitamin A, high-fat diet. Reduced adiponectin expression in WAT was also observed in mice fed a high\u2013vitamin A diet. Adipocyte cell culture revealed that endogenous and synthetic retinoic acid receptor (RAR)\u03b1- and RAR\u03b3-selective agonists, as well as a synthetic retinoid X receptor agonist, efficiently reduced adiponectin expression, whereas ALDH1A1 expression only increased with RAR agonists. We conclude that reduced adiponectin expression under high-fat dietary conditions is dependent on 1) increased ALDH1A1 expression in adipocytes, which does not increase all-trans-retinoic acid levels; 2) further RAR ligand\u2013induced, WAT-selective, increased retinoic acid response element\u2013mediated signaling; and 3) RAR ligand\u2013dependent reduction of adiponectin expression.\u2014Landrier, J.-F., Kasiri, E., Karkeni, E., Mih\u00e1ly, J., B\u00e9ke, G., Weiss, K., Lucas, R., Aydemir, G., Salles, J., Walrand, S., de Lera, A. R., R\u00fchl, R. Reduced adiponectin expression after high-fat diet is associated with selective up-regulation of ALDH1A1 and further retinoic acid receptor signaling in adipose tissue.\n", "fulltext": "Obesity is considered to be one of the most common nutritional disorders of Western society and is characterized by a disproportionate expansion of body fat mass [reviewed in Gasbarrini and Piscaglia (1)]. In addition to being an energy storage site, white adipose tissue (WAT) also functions as a highly active metabolic regulator and major endocrine organ that secretes various adipokines (2\u20134). Adiponectin is a major adipokine with strong antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic activity, and its expression is decreased in WAT under high dietary fat conditions [reviewed in Ouchi et al. (5)]. With the exception of the putative role of inflammation (6\u20138), the precise mechanisms that mediate this down-regulation remain to be elucidated. Retinoids are important regulators of adipogenesis. Diets high in vitamin A (9), dietary excess of retinoic acid (10, 11), and diets high in \u03b2-carotene (12\u201314) result in increased adipocyte apoptosis and inhibition of adipogenesis, while low concentrations of retinoic acid were described to be proadipogenic (reviewed in refs. 9, 11, 15, 16). Retinoids, that is, naturally occurring and synthetic retinol analogues (reviewed in refs. 17, 18), are responsible for activation of specific nuclear receptors: the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Bioactive retinoic acids are formed from precursor retinaldehydes by the action of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes (RALDHs/ALDH1A) (19). RALDH1/ALDH1A1\u2013null adult mice have been shown to be resistant to high-fat (HF) diet\u2013induced weight gain (20, 21), which suggested that ALDH1A1 and its metabolic products are necessary for HF diet\u2013induced obesity (22\u201324). ALDH1A1 can synthesize retinoic acids (25), such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), 9-cis-retinoic acid, and, presumably, the newly found endogenous RXR ligand, 9-cis-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid (26). The last two are ligands for both RXRs and RARs, whereas ATRA only binds RAR. Unfortunately, only a few studies have detected retinoic acids in low concentrations in adipose tissue (27, 28), but no study has addressed the presence of retinoic acids in WAT when comparing ALDH1A1+/+ or ALDH1A1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Whether retinoic acids, and which retinoic acids, are the major metabolites of ALDH1A1 in WAT is yet unknown. Moreover, ALDH1A1 expression has been shown to be regulated by liver X receptor (LXR) (29) as well as estrogen receptor\u2013mediated pathways (30, 31). Various nuclear hormone receptor pathways are involved in adipokine secretion and adipocyte differentiation, proliferation, and lipid accumulation (reviewed in refs. 7, 32). In particular, RXRs, the central heterodimer-forming partners, play important roles during obesity (33\u201335). RXR\u03b1 as well as RXR\u03b3 KO and RXR-antagonist treatment induce resistance to weight gain after HF diet and also promote a higher metabolic rate (36\u201338). RXRs can also interact with several nuclear receptors, such as RAR, LXR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), or NR4A-orphan nuclear receptors (39, 40), and the activation of various so-called permissive heterodimers (RXR-PPAR, -LXR, -VDR, and -NR4A1/2) by an RXR ligand can initiate heterodimer-mediated signaling (39\u201341). The aim of our study was to find out how HF diet reduces adiponectin expression in WAT, focusing primarily on vitamin A\u2013mediated RAR- and RXR-dependent pathways. Manually prepared diets were made with wheat starch (Weizenst\u00e4rke, Foodstar, Germany; provided by Kr\u00f6ner-St\u00e4rke, Ibbenb\u00fcren, Germany), saccharose (purchased from a local supermarket in Hungary), casein (Sigma-Aldrich, Budapest, Hungary), cellulose (Vivapur; JRS Pharma GmbH; Rosenberg, Germany), vitamin mix (Vitamin-Vormischung C1000; Altromin GmbH, Lage, Germany), mineral mixture (Mineral-Spurenelemente-Vormischung C100; Altromin GmbH), and sunflower oil (Henry Lamotte, Bremen, Germany). Animal experiments were performed in the Laboratory Animal Core Facility of the University of Debrecen. Experiments were performed according to Hungarian ethical guidelines. After the acclimatization period, animals received a vitamin A\u2013deficient [0 retinol equivalent (RE)/kg diet] diet for 10 wk that contained 5% sunflower oil as a dietary lipid, which represented a diet with normal fat (NF) content (42). Animals were divided into different feeding groups (n = 6 per group) and were fed for 4 wk with specific diets that contained different amounts of dietary fat and equal amounts of vitamin A (2500 RE/kg diet, normal vitamin A). Sunflower oil was added as dietary fat, which contained either 2% [as weight %; low-fat (LF) diet], 5% (NF diet), or 25% (HF diet). The source of the fat was always sunflower oil in different proportions added to feed. On the basis of the analyzed feed of the NF diet, it contained 11.6% saturated fats, 20% monounsaturated fatty acids, and 68.4% polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, dietary composition was 180 g/kg casein, 10 g/kg vitamin mix, 45 g/kg mineral mix, and 20 g/kg cellulose for all applied diets (42). As a result of the increased amount of fat in the diet, the carbohydrate proportion was lower; the LF diet contained 29.5% sucrose and 43% starch, the NF diet 28% sucrose and 41.5% starch, and the HF diet 17% sucrose and 32.5% starch (42). For vitamin content, diets were supplemented with vitamin mix (Vitamin-Vormischung C1000) that contained either 2500 RE/kg as normal\u2013vitamin A diet, or for high\u2013vitamin A diet, an additional retinyl-palmitate (RetPal) supplement (final 326,500 RE/kg; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the normal\u2013vitamin A diet (42, 43). After euthanizing mice, blood collection was carried out by cardiac puncture. Blood was centrifuged for 20 min and plasma was stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Mice were anatomized, and WAT samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after dissection and later stored at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA extraction. Retinoic acid response element (RARE)-Luc female mice (n = 6) were obtained from Cgene (Oslo, Norway) and received LF, NF, or HF diets for 4 wk or the oral retinoid treatments as described before (43, 44). We conducted ex vivo organ analysis by bioluminescence imaging. All animals were treated with 120 mg/kg d-luciferin (Bioscience, Budapest, Hungary) via intraperitoneal injections 15 min before euthanasia and further organ screening. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. After euthanasia, mouse liver, WAT, intestine, and brain were collected for bioluminescence imaging. Organs were analyzed for bioluminescence signal by using an Andor-Ixon CCD camera (Belfast, United Kingdom), and analysis was performed by Andor-IQ software. After imaging, integrated intensity/area was calculated for liver, WAT, intestine, and brain of each treated animal. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were seeded in 3.5-cm-diameter dishes at a density of 15 \u00d7 104 cells/well. Cells were grown in DMEM that was supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, as previously reported (45, 46). To induce differentiation, 2-d postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (day 0) were stimulated for 48 h with 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.25 \u00b5M dexamethasone, and 1 \u00b5g/ml insulin in DMEM that was supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were then maintained in DMEM that was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 \u00b5g/ml insulin (47). To examine the effects on gene expression of ATRA (a gift from BASF AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany), an RAR\u03b1 agonist (BMS753), an RAR\u03b3 agonist (BMS189961; both were prepared in our laboratories as described in the original patents (48, 49)], and an RXR agonist (LG268; gift from Ligand Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, USA), 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 1 \u00b5M of these molecules for 24 h, as previously reported (47). Data presented are the mean of 3 independent experiments each performed in triplicate. Eleven lean (body mass index: 22.5 \u00b1 0.5 kg/m2) and 14 obese (body mass index: 31.7 \u00b1 0.9 kg/m2) male participants were recruited, as previously reported (50). Lean and obese volunteers were age 44 \u00b1 7 and 44 \u00b1 5 yr, respectively. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were performed between 6:30 and 7:30 am after an overnight fast. Biopsies were obtained by needle aspiration in the periumbilical area under local anesthesia. Adipose tissue samples were rinsed in physiologic serum, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA extraction. The experimental protocol was performed in accordance with the guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Auvergne Region (agreement No. AU 800, March 2010). Participants gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. Analysis of total cellular RNA extracted from 3T3-L1 cells was performed in France by using Trizol reagent according to manufacturer instructions. Human adipose tissue sample extraction was also performed in France, whereas WAT and liver sample analysis from mice was done in Hungary. For the cell culture material in the French laboratory, cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u00b5g of total RNA in 20 \u00b5l by using random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses for genes were performed by using the Mx3005P Real-Time PCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) as previously described (51). For each sample, expression was quantified in duplicate and 18S rRNA was used as the endogenous control in the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method. For WAT and liver tissue analysis of human and murine origin, tissues were homogenized in Tri reagent solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and total RNA was isolated from tissue according to manufacturer guidelines and as previously described (52). Concentration and purity of RNA was measured by using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For real-time quantitative PCR, total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by using the Super Script II First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out in triplicate using predesigned MGB assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on an ABI Prism 7900 (Applied Biosystems, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France). Relative mRNA levels were calculated by using the Ct method and were normalized to cyclophilin A mRNA. Sequence Detector Software (v. 2.1; Applied Biosystems) was used for data analysis. WAT samples were collected and stored in dark vials at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Sample preparation was performed as previously described for retinoid (53) and eicosanoid/docosanoid (54) analysis. HPLC\u2013tandem mass spectrometry analyses for retinoids as well as eicosanoids and docosanoids, which focused on eicosanoids with known PPAR activation potential, were also performed as previously explained (53, 54). To examine the effect of retinoids on adiponectin secretion, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 1 \u00b5M of the retinoids (ATRA, RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b3, or RXR ligand) for 48 h. Adiponectin quantification was realized on the culture supernatant by using adiponectin ELISA assay according to manufacturer protocol (Quantikine ELISA; R&D Systems, Lille, France). Data are expressed as means \u00b1 sem. Significant differences between control and treated cells/groups were determined by Student\u2019s t test using Statview software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant. Body weight gain was observed in animals after 4 wk of HF diet compared with LF or NF dietary supplementation (LF: 1.07 \u00b1 0.08 g; NF: 0.92 \u00b1 0.11 g; HF: 3.24 \u00b1 0.37 g; LF-HF P = 0.03 and NF-HF P = 0.04). Food intake slightly decreased in the HF diet group (LF: 2.93 g/d/animal; NF: 2.70 g/d/animal; HF: 2.25 g/d/animal). ALDH1A1 was significantly increased only in WAT (LF: 1 \u00b1 0.80; NF: 1.83 \u00b1 0.36; HF: 5.26 \u00b1 0.23) of HF diet\u2013fed mice compared with LF and NF diet\u2013fed mice, and was tissue selective for WAT (Table 1, WAT), compared with unchanged expression in the liver (Table 1, liver). ALDH1A2 expression remained unchanged in liver and WAT (Table 1). ALDH1A3 was also significantly increased in adipose tissue of animals fed HF and NF diets compared with LF diet (Table 1, WAT). In addition, expression of RAR pathway target genes, such as CYP26A1 and CYP26B1, remained unchanged (Table 2), whereas expression of the highly sensitive common RAR/RXR pathway target gene transglutaminase 2 (TG2) was strongly increased (Table 1; LF: 1 \u00b1 0.36; NF: 9.56 \u00b1 0.13; HF: 15.36 \u00b1 0.17) in HF diet\u2013fed mice. In addition to increased retinoid signaling, expression of adiponectin was reduced in HF diet\u2013fed mice (LF: 1 \u00b1 0.31; NF: 0.86 \u00b1 0.12; HF: 0.15 \u00b1 0.37). Experiments using adipose tissue biopsies from normal-weight and obese human volunteers confirmed increased ALDH1A1 (healthy volunteers were set as 1; 1.20 \u00b1 0.07) and reduced adiponectin (0.85 \u00b1 0.04) expression in the obese volunteers (Table 3). Expression of ALDH1A1 increased (NF, normal vitamin A was set as 1: 1 \u00b1 0.19; NF, high vitamin A: 2.32 \u00b1 0.47) in the WAT of mice fed an NF diet with high vitamin A supplementation, whereas adiponectin expression (NF, normal vitamin A was set as 1: 1 \u00b1 0.47; NF, high vitamin A: 0.37 \u00b1 0.21) was decreased in WAT (Table 4). Retinol levels remained stable in the WAT of LF, NF, and HF diet\u2013fed animals, whereas ATRA (LF: 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 ng/g; NF: 1.7 \u00b1 0.2 ng/g; HF: 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 ng/g) levels were lower in the WAT of HF diet\u2013fed animals (Table 5). Increased retinoid signaling was confirmed in RARE-Luc mice, with increased RARE-mediated signaling detected specifically in adipose tissue of HF compared with LF and NF diet\u2013fed animals, whereas in liver, intestine, and brain, no increased RARE-mediated signaling was observed (Fig. 1). Endogenous PPAR ligands [9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), 13-HODE, 13-ketooctadecadienoic acid, 12-ketoeicosatetraenoic acid, PgJ2, and d15d12PgJ2] were mainly unchanged, except the adipose tissue\u2013specific PPAR\u03b3 ligand, hepoxilin B3, which is increased in adipose tissue of HF diet\u2013fed animals (Table 5). Expression of PPAR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b3 target genes retinol saturase (RETSAT)/fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4)/FADS2 in mouse WAT remained unaffected by NF and HF dietary supplementation compared with LF diet (Table 2). Treatment of cultured adipocytes with synthetic RAR\u03b1-selective ligands [control (CTRL) set as 1; adiponectin: 0.22 \u00b1 0.01 and ALDH1A1 2.37 \u00b1 0.04], RAR\u03b3-selective ligands (CTRL set as 1; adiponectin: 0.22 \u00b1 0.01 and ALDH1A1 2.64 \u00b1 0.01), and the natural RAR ligand ATRA (CTRL set as 1; adiponectin: 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 and ALDH1A1 3.19 \u00b1 0.07), in addition to a synthetic RXR agonist (LG268; CTRL set as 1; adiponectin: 0.51 \u00b1 0.04 and ALDH1A1 1.04 \u00b1 0.04), resulted in increased ALDH1A1 expression for RAR agonists, whereas adiponectin expression was reduced for all RAR and RXR ligands. In addition, these results were confirmed at the protein level in cell culture supernatants where adiponectin secretion was reduced for all administered RAR and RXR ligands, except for the RAR\u03b3-selective ligand, which displayed a nonsignificant decrease (Table 6). Obesity is classically associated with a decrease of adiponectin plasma level in humans and rodents, as well as a decreased expression in adipose tissue (5). This relationship between obesity and decreased adiponectin expression is suspected to be linked to the increased inflammatory status of adipose tissue, as TNF-\u03b1, one of the main inflammatory markers produced by adipose tissue (55), is known to reduce adiponectin expression (56). However, this mechanism is probably not exclusive, and other pathways\u2014RAR signaling among them\u2014could be involved in this regulation. In this study, we reported that, in mice, reduced adiponectin expression in WAT after HF dietary supplementation was associated with an increase of ALDH1A1 expression. Similar results were also obtained by comparing lean vs. obese WAT biopsies. Surprisingly, increased ALDH1A1 expression in mice does not result in increased ATRA levels in WAT. ALDH1A1, the major enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis using retinaldehyde as a substrate, is highly likely to play an important role in the relationship between retinoid signaling and obesity (20, 21, 57). Indeed, its expression is increased in WAT during HF-induced obesity (58). In ALDH1A1\u2212/\u2212-deficient adipocytes as well as in ALDH1A1\u2212/\u2212 mice, adipogenesis is impaired and mice are resistant to HF diet\u2013induced obesity (20), which is suggested to be related to altered retinoid signaling [(25) and reviewed in refs. 9, 11, 15]. Retinoic acids, the products from ALDH1A1 metabolism, are the endogenous activators of RARs and RXRs. Reduced retinaldehyde and retinol levels were measured in adipose tissue of animals fed an HF diet, and ATRA levels were speculated to be increased upon ALDH1A1 activity (20). However, the detection and quantification of retinoic acid levels in adipose tissue have been scarcely examined (27, 28) and, unfortunately, the connection of retinoic acids in response to ALDH1A1 expression in adipose tissue has not been studied before. In the present study, we report that increased ALDH1A1 expression in mice does not result in increased ATRA levels in WAT. On the contrary, ATRA levels were even lower in WAT of HF vs. LF or NF diet\u2013fed animals. Similar reduced levels of ATRA were confirmed in serum and adipose tissue of obese volunteers compared with obese volunteers after a weight-loss diet (unpublished data), which indicates that obesity is related to reduced local and systemic retinoid levels in humans. These findings of reduced local retinoid levels in adipose tissue of obese animals fit well with previous studies on animals fed a vitamin A\u2013deficient diet, which were found to become obese upon reduced ATRA synthesis, levels, and ATRA-mediated signaling [reviewed in Bonet et al. (11)]. In addition, it is well established that retinoids, and especially ATRA, as signaling ligands, have the ability to inhibit proliferation of adipocytes; enhance up-regulation of genes involved in lipid oxidation, energy dissipation, and insulin response; and thereby prevent obesity and insulin resistance [reviewed in Bonet et al. (11)], probably by targeting adipocyte oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondriobiogenesis (59). As a result of this unclear evidence and inconclusive determination of retinoic acids levels in WAT, we opted, like others [(21, 57) plus follow-up reviews in refs. 15, 22], for an indirect method of detection of retinoid signaling by using a RARE-reporter mouse model (44) and we confirmed increased WAT-selective, RARE-mediated signaling in the WAT of HF vs. LF diet\u2013fed mice (57). Previous experimental studies claimed, without any analytical proof, the involvement of ALDH1A1-synthesized ATRA in adipose tissue and, only on the basis of increased RARE signaling (21, 57), that ATRA is the metabolite of ALDH1A1 in adipose tissue and that the described effects of ALDH1A1, by consequence, are mediated by ATRA-RAR signaling. Furthermore, they claimed that the ALDH1A1 product ATRA must be involved in the ALDH1A1-mediated increase of adipose tissue expansion and diet-induced obesity. Our solid data, generated by using HPLC\u2013tandem mass spectrometry quantification of ATRA in adipose tissue, contradicts these claims and warns about the common obtainment of false-positive data from RARE-Luc activation models (60). We concluded that either a still-uncharacterized endogenous RAR ligand must be synthesized in the WAT of HF diet\u2013fed mice to induce WAT-selective, RARE-mediated signaling or alternative mechanisms that possibly involve transporter protein\u2013mediated signaling (reviewed in ref. 61 and speculated upon in ref. 62) or post-translational modifications in adipocytes [(21) and reviewed in ref. 63] must be taken into consideration. With regard to ligands other than ATRA, it is still unknown which RAR- and/or RXR-activating ligands could be synthesized upon ALDH1A1 expression in WAT, and we could not conclusively suggest a possible structure using our current analytical expertise (26, 53). However, several known and unknown candidates, including 9-cis- and all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid, retinal, apo-lycopenoic acids, apo-13\u2032-carotenone, apo-10\u2032-carotenoic acid, and apo-14\u2032-carotenoic acid (20, 26, 44, 47, 64\u201372), were recently identified and could constitute potential endogenous retinoids. To further exclude the involvement of PPAR\u03b3, the key regulator of adipogenesis (7, 73), as a major nuclear receptor responsible for adiponectin reduction after an HF-supplemented diet, endogenous PPAR ligands were determined. Levels in adipose tissue were mainly unaltered after LF, NF, or HF dietary supplementation (74\u201377). Only the levels of the endogenous and adipose tissue\u2013specific PPAR\u03b3 ligand, hepoxilin B3, (78, 79) were significantly increased in HF vs. LF diet\u2013fed animals. In addition, our data show no increased expression of PPAR\u03b3 and known PPAR\u03b3 target genes, RETSAT, FABP4, and FADS2, in the WAT of HF diet\u2013fed mice, which, in part, contrasts with previous studies. In general, increased PPAR\u03b3 expression in adipose tissue after HF diet is mainly related to omental and not subcutaneous fat in humans, as reviewed in (80). In mice, increased PPAR\u03b3 expression is observable just after diets with extreme HF conditions, after strong weight gain, and after a long time of HF dietary supplementation (<8 wk) (81\u201384). Finally, it is well established that PPAR\u03b3 signaling activation increases secretion of adiponectin rather than decreases it (85). In summary, all these data strongly imply that PPAR\u03b3-mediated signaling in adipose tissue of animals fed an HF-supplemented diet is unlikely to be of major importance for further reduced adiponectin expression. To evaluate RAR- and RXR-mediated signaling pathways in adipocytes directly, 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell culture models were used, and we determined that ALDH1A1 was increased after administration of ATRA and synthetic RAR\u03b1- and RAR\u03b3-selective RAR ligands, and not by a synthetic RXR ligand, whereas adiponectin expression and secretion in the cell supernatant were decreased after administration of RAR or RXR agonists. We conclude, therefore, that this direct down-regulation of adiponectin is an RAR- or RXR-mediated pathway and that ALDH1A1 expression is just regulated by an RAR ligand. In summary (Fig. 2), we found that reduced adiponectin expression in the WAT of mice is under the control of retinoid-mediated signaling, mainly via RAR-mediated signaling pathways. We suggest that altered retinoid signaling in adipose tissue is an important mechanism of HF diet\u2013induced obesity. In particular, ALDH1A1 seems to be the key enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of alternative endogenous RAR ligands selectively in WAT. This increased ALDH1A1 and reduced adiponectin expression was also confirmed to occur in adipose tissue from obese human volunteers. Endogenous as well as synthetic RAR ligands were shown to further directly inhibit adiponectin expression in cultured adipocytes. The nature of the endogenous RAR/RXR agonists or antagonists synthesized by ALDH1A1 in WAT remains elusive and is the topic of future studies. Characterization of these novel endogenous retinoids with mainly RAR, as well as potential RXR, ligand activation potential and their metabolic pathways can help clarify the controversy of the altered retinoid signaling in adipose tissue. On the basis of these data, novel strategies can be developed to selectively inhibit distinct retinoid signaling, especially that which involves ALDH1A1 products under HF diet, focused on adipose tissue to enable sufficient beneficial adiponectin expression."}, "27103577": {"pmid": "27103577", "pmcid": "PMC5072355", "title": "On the pivotal role of PPAR\u03b1 in adaptation of the heart to hypoxia and why fat in the diet increases hypoxic injury", "abstract": "\nThe role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1)-mediated metabolic remodeling in cardiac adaptation to hypoxia has yet to be defined. Here, mice were housed in hypoxia for 3 wk before in vivo contractile function was measured using cine MRI. In isolated, perfused hearts, energetics were measured using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation were measured using [3H] labeling. Compared with a normoxic, chow-fed control mouse heart, hypoxia decreased PPAR\u03b1 expression, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) levels, while increasing glycolysis, all of which served to maintain normal ATP concentrations ([ATP]) and thereby, ejection fractions. A high-fat diet increased cardiac PPAR\u03b1 expression, fatty acid oxidation, and UCP3 levels with decreased glycolysis. Hypoxia was unable to alter the high PPAR\u03b1 expression or reverse the metabolic changes caused by the high-fat diet, with the result that [ATP] and contractile function decreased significantly. The adaptive metabolic changes caused by hypoxia in control mouse hearts were found to have occurred already in PPAR\u03b1-deficient (PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212) mouse hearts and sustained function in hypoxia despite an inability for further metabolic remodeling. We conclude that decreased cardiac PPAR\u03b1 expression is essential for adaptive metabolic remodeling in hypoxia, but is prevented by dietary fat.\u2014Cole, M. A., Abd Jamil, A. H., Heather, L.

J., Ratcliffe, P. J., Neubauer, S., Robbins, P. A., Clarke, K. On the pivotal role of PPAR\u03b1 in adaptation of the heart to hypoxia and why fat in the diet increases hypoxic injury.\n", "fulltext": "Each day, the human heart beats \u223c100,000 times and pumps \u223c10 tons of blood through the body, therefore requiring \u223c6 kg of ATP (1). To produce such a large quantity of ATP, the heart relies on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of a variety of metabolic fuels, including free fatty acids (FFAs) and glucose. In theory, FFAs require \u223c13% more oxygen than glucose to generate the same amount of ATP, although hearts metabolizing FFAs may require far more oxygen, owing to increased mitochondrial uncoupling (2, 3). ATP is transported from the mitochondria to be used for contractile function via the creatine (Cr) kinase energy shuttle, in which phosphate is transferred from ATP to Cr with the formation of phosphocreatine (PCr) and ADP in a reaction catalyzed by mitochondrial Cr kinase (1):  The Cr kinase system acts to keep ATP levels constant via a fall in PCr and a rise in cytosolic free ADP concentrations ([ADP]free), which controls mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation when oxygen is not limiting (4). In hypoxia, when oxygen availability limits oxidative phosphorylation, the heart moves toward more oxygen-efficient carbohydrate, away from fatty acid, metabolism (5). Thus, cardiac glucose uptake was increased in hypoxic rats (6) and in high-altitude-adapted humans (7), and fatty acid metabolizing enzyme [carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD)] expression was decreased by hypoxia (8\u201310). Magnetic resonance (MR) studies have shown that cardiac PCr/ATP ratios are lower in high-altitude-adapted humans (11) and in lowlanders returning to sea level following a trek to Mount Everest Base Camp (12). However, the links among limited oxygen availability, changes in substrate metabolism, ATP generation, and cardiac function have not been well defined. The balance between fatty acid and glucose metabolism may be regulated, at least in part, by the nuclear PPARs. Of the 3 receptor isoforms, \u03b1, \u03b4, and \u03b3, PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b4 are highly expressed in the heart (13). PPAR\u03b1 regulates several genes encoding for proteins that control fatty acid metabolism, including MCAD (14), and glucose metabolism, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) (15). Hypoxia is a potential driver of metabolic reprogramming, with the oxygen-sensitive transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) elevated in ischemic cardiac myocytes (16) and in infarcted hearts (17). In normoxia, HIF-\u03b1 subunits are polyubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation, the constant degradation of HIF-\u03b1 subunits mediated by hydroxylation via the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) or egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor (EGLN) oxygenase family. In hypoxia, PHD activity is reduced, stabilizing HIF-\u03b1, which translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with HIF-1\u03b2. The dimer transcriptionally activates \u223c200 genes, including those involved in erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and energy metabolism (18). In hypoxia-adapted Tibetans, variants of the genes EGLN1 and endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1, encoding for PHD2 (the most important of the 3 human PHDs) and the HIF-2\u03b1 subunit, respectively, associated with the PPARA gene in genome-wide scans (19), and serum fatty acid concentrations in this group correlated with the PPARA haplotype (20). These findings suggest that PPAR\u03b1 may control cardiac substrate metabolism, ATP generation, and thereby, cardiac function in hypoxia (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Putative mechanism for the control of cardiac substrate metabolism and function in hypoxia. Decreased oxygen tension in the blood inhibits PHD activity, stabilizing HIF-\u03b1 subunits and down-regulating the nuclear hormone receptor, PPAR\u03b1. In turn, PPAR\u03b1 regulates fatty acid and glucose metabolism via changes in several proteins, including MCAD and PDK4, and the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, via UCP3 and mitochondrial thioesterase 1 (MTE-1) proteins. Increased glycolytic flux and decreased mitochondrial uncoupling increase the efficiency of ATP production, the ATP being consumed primarily by myocardial contraction. ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase; CoA, coenzyme A; ETC, electron transport chain; FA, fatty acid; FADH2, flavin adenine dinucleotide; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NEFA, nonesterified fatty acid; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PGC-1\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3 coactivator \u03b1; Pi, inorganic phosphate; RXR, retinoid X receptor; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. Recent studies using cultured cells, knockout, or transgenic mice seemingly demonstrate that alterations in the HIF system, whether decreases or increases in aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT; HIF-1\u03b2) (21), HIF-1\u03b1 (22\u201324), HIF-2\u03b1 (21, 25), PHD1 (25), or von Hippel-Lindau (26) levels, increase PPAR\u03b1 or PPAR\u03b3 (22) in heart or skeletal muscle. Such apparently contradictory studies necessitate a deeper understanding of the cellular mechanisms whereby a decrease in PPAR\u03b1 is absolutely required to maintain ATP levels for the contractile function of the hypoxic heart. Here, we show that hypoxia causes the heart to undergo a series of metabolic changes, coordinated by PPAR\u03b1 and designed to use the limited available oxygen as efficiently as possible. We demonstrate in normal mice how a high-fat diet increases PPAR\u03b1 expression, which prevents the metabolic changes required for acclimation to hypoxia, thereby significantly decreasing [ATP] and myocardial contractile function. We also demonstrate that the lack of myocardial PPAR\u03b1 prevents any metabolic response to hypoxia and that chemical induction of HIF, by inhibition of HIF hydroxylases in mechanically active cardiomyocytes, has the same effect on PPAR\u03b1 as hypoxia. In short, for adaptation to hypoxia, it is essential that PPAR\u03b1 expression decreases to increase the efficiency of oxygen use, via orchestrated changes in substrate metabolism and mitochondrial respiration, so that normoxic [ATP] and cardiac function can be maintained. Male wild-type 129Ev/Sv (n = 106; 14 mo) and littermate PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 (n = 72) mice were housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum. The mice, a kind gift from Dr. Frank J. Gonzalez (National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA), were bred in-house on a pure 129Ev/Sv background with 10 backcrosses. All procedures conformed to ethical regulations of the United Kingdom Home Office. Mice were housed in a glass-fronted hypoxia chamber (BioSpherix, Parish, NY, USA), in which N2 replaced O2. Chamber O2, monitored continuously, was used to regulate chamber N2 levels via a feedback system. Mice were fed laboratory chow (7.5% fat) or a high-fat (55% fat) diet. To acclimatize mice to hypoxia, chamber O2 was reduced in daily steps over a 7 d period to be maintained at 11% (v:v) for a further 12 d. Following hypoxia, animals were reoxygenated for 1 h to ameliorate any short-term effects of reoxygenation on cardiac function. MRI was carried out on an 11.7 T (500 MHz) vertical bore (123-mm diameter) magnet (Magnex Scientific, Oxon, United Kingdom), as previously described (27). Mice were anesthetized using 60 mg \u22c5 kg body weight\u22121 sodium pentobarbitone intraperitoneally and hearts were excised and arrested in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Hearts were perfused in Langendorff mode at 80 mmHg perfusion pressure and at 37\u00b0C with modified Krebs-Henseleit recirculating buffer gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2 containing 11 mM glucose and 0.4 mM palmitate prebound to 1.5% (w/v) albumin. A polyethylene balloon connected to a pressure transducer was inserted in the left ventricle (LV) and inflated to an end-diastolic pressure of 4\u20138 mmHg to measure pressures and heart rates. Glycolytic flux and palmitate oxidation were measured in perfused hearts using 25 \u00b5Ci [5-3H]-glucose or [9,10-3H]-palmitate, respectively, in recirculating perfusion buffer, as previously described (3, 28). Buffer samples were taken every 5 min for the measurement of [3H] label conversion to 3H2O using Dowex anion separation or Folch extraction. In a subset of experiments, insulin (500 \u03bcU) was added to the buffer to measure the maximal insulin-stimulated response. Hearts were snap frozen in liquid N2. Cardiac lactate efflux was determined by measuring lactate concentrations, using lactate dehydrogenase, in timed buffer collections. Perfused hearts were inserted into the same NMR system as used for imaging (see Cardiac MRI section), but using a 10 mm diameter probe (Rapid Biomedical, Wuerzburg, Germany). Fully relaxed spectra were acquired by averaging 60 scans using a 90\u00b0 pulse (60 \u03bcs) and a 10-s delay to give an acquisition time of 10 min. Data were analyzed using jMRUI software and 4 spectra were summed to determine ATP, PCr, and Pi peak areas. Intracellular pH, the cytosolic-free ADP ([ADP]free), and the free energy of ATP hydrolysis (\u0394GATP) were calculated as previously described (4). HL-1 murine cardiomyocytes, a kind gift from Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA), were maintained in Claycomb Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, United Kingdom). Cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, ascorbic acid (0.3 mM), norepinephrine (0.1 mM), and l-glutamine (4 mM). Cells were cultured on plates precoated with 5 \u03bcg/ml fibronectin and 0.02% gelatin and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C and 95% humidity. All experiments were performed on confluent, beating cells. Cells were exposed to 2% hypoxia or normoxia for 24 h. In separate experiments, normoxic HL-1 cells were incubated for 24 h with a specific PHD inhibitor, 50 \u00b5M 2-(1-chloro-4-hydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxamido) acetic acid (IOX3) (29, 30), which was synthesized specifically for the experiment (31). Cells were aspirated with PBS and harvested for protein analysis or quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Primers were designed using Primer3 software based on GenBank or EnsemblGenomes browser searches and obtained from Eurofins MWG Operon (Wolverhampton, United Kingdom). References to primer sequences included the following: PPAR\u03b1, NM_011144.6; PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, NM_011145.3; PPAR\u03b3, NM_011146.3; MCAD, NM_007382.4; UCP3, NM_009464.3; PDK4, NM_013743.2; VEGF, NM_009505.4; \u03b2-actin, NM_007393.3. Total RNA was extracted and purified from frozen heart and skeletal muscle tissues using a QiaAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, United Kingdom). For cells, total RNA was extracted and purified from \u22645 \u00d7 106 confluent HL-1 cells using a QiaAmp kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from the RNA template using a high-capacity transcriptase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA). Quantitative PCR amplification was performed using the Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences). The PCR program had an initial heat-activation step of 95\u00b0C for 10 min. Forty cycles of thermocycling were performed with a denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and an annealing and extension step at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Fluorescence was measured following each extension step. After amplification, a melting curve was acquired and used to determine the PCR product specificity. Relative quantification of target gene expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene, \u03b2-actin, and performed using a 2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct method. Powdered frozen cardiac or skeletal muscle was added to 300 \u00b5l lysis buffer and homogenized for 30 s, as previously described (3, 28). Confluent HL-1 cardiomyocytes in 6-well plates were washed with PBS and added to 150 \u00b5l lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor. Lysates were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, supernatant was saved, and protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, United Kingdom). Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C following addition of 5% 2-ME (v/v) and boiling for 5 min. Equal concentrations of protein from cardiac and skeletal muscle samples were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels, separated using electrophoresis, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Watford, United Kingdom). Cardiac and skeletal muscle proteins were detected using the following polyclonal antibodies and dilutions in 5% milk: PGC-1\u03b1 and MCAD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), 1:500; GLUT1 (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), 1:1000; GLUT4 (kind gift of Geoffrey Holman, University of Bath, United Kingdom), 1:4000; PDK4 and UCP3 (Abgent, Maidenhead, United Kingdom), 1:500 and 1:2500; MTE-1 (kind gift of Dr. Stefan Alexson, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden), 1:2000; RXR\u03b1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, London, United Kingdom), 1:1000; HIF-1 and -2\u03b1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), 1:2000 and 1:500. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase conjugate polyclonal with goat anti-rabbit specificity (Autogen-Bioclear, Wiltshire, United Kingdom), all diluted to 1:3500, with the exception of GLUT1 and -4, HIF-1\u03b1 (1:2000) and -2\u03b1 (1:1000), and MCAD (donkey anti-goat). Consistent protein loading and transfer were confirmed by Ponceau staining and protein levels related to internal standards to ensure homogeneity between samples and gels. Bands were quantified using UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT, USA), and all samples were run in duplicate on separate gels to confirm results. The myocardial enzymatic activities of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) were measured using coupled enzyme assays (32). Frozen, ground heart tissue (1 mg/ml) was extracted with the buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 60 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton-X 100, 1 mM PMSF, 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 1 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.5. The PK activity was assayed at 30\u00b0C, 340 nm in medium containing 50 mM imidazole (pH 7.6), 20 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM NADH, 1 mM ADP, 4.5 U/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate. The PGK activity was recorded at 25\u00b0C, 340 nm, in an assay medium containing 50 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.6), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM 3-phosphoglycerate, and 0.2 mM NADH. Cardiac lipids were extracted from freeze-clamped tissue (25\u201350 mg) using 10 ml 2:1 chloroform:methanol solution as previously described (3, 28). After mixing and phase separation, the lower phase was air dried at 50\u00b0C and resuspended in ethanol. With the use of a kit (Randox Laboratories, London, United Kingdom), cardiac triacylglycerol (TAG) content was measured spectrophotometrically at 500 nm. Grouped data (means \u00b1 sem) were analyzed using 3-factor ANOVAs, with individual comparisons subsequently performed using Student's t tests. Results were considered significantly different at P < 0.05. To investigate functional and metabolic responses of the in vivo mouse heart to hypoxia, we used a 3-wk protocol that began with 7 d of lowering ambient oxygen concentration from 21 to 11% in daily increments to produce a graded, physiologic hypoxia (Fig. 2). Hypoxia in wild-type, chow-fed mice increased whole-blood hemoglobin by 51% (P < 0.001) and hematocrit by 33% (P < 0.001) but did not alter body weight. Established HIF-1\u03b1 downstream targets, cardiac VEGF and PDK1 protein, increased 3.6-fold (P < 0.001) and 1.8-fold (P < 0.01), respectively. LV mass decreased by 19% (P < 0.001) following hypoxia, whereas right-ventricular (RV) mass was unaltered. Plasma metabolites in wild-type mice were unchanged by hypoxia (Supplemental Fig. 1). Hypoxia in chow-fed, wild-type mice decreased cardiac PPAR\u03b1 mRNA levels by 36% (P < 0.05), with PPAR\u03b4 mRNA and PPAR\u03b3, RXR, and PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels remaining unchanged (Fig. 3A and Supplemental Fig. 2). In parallel with lower PPAR\u03b1 mRNA levels, hypoxia decreased protein levels of downstream targets of PPAR\u03b1: UCP3, MTE-1, and PDK4 (Fig. 3B). MCAD protein levels were 24% (P < 0.05) lower, but proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration were unchanged following hypoxia (Supplemental Fig. 2). Hypoxia increased cardiac glycolysis 2.3-fold (P < 0.01) and lactate efflux 2.4-fold (P < 0.01), measured in isolated, beating, perfused hearts using [3H] substrate labeling (Fig. 3C). Hypoxia did not alter total cardiac GLUT4 protein or activities of glycolytic intermediates (Supplemental Fig. 3). Fatty acid oxidation was 26% (P < 0.02) lower in hearts from hypoxic mice compared with normoxic controls (Fig. 3D), whereas myocardial TAG levels were 28% (P < 0.05) higher in hypoxic mice. In isolated, perfused hearts, [PCr] was 31% (P < 0.001) lower, but [ATP] was unaltered by hypoxia, measured using [31P] NMR spectroscopy and HPLC (Fig. 3E); total Cr was 28% (P < 0.05) lower following hypoxia. Although [ADP]free increased 2-fold (P < 0.02), the calculated \u0394GATP was preserved. In vivo cine MRI showed that 3 wk of hypoxia did not alter cardiac output, cardiac index, or ejection fraction, despite an 18% (P < 0.02) lower stroke volume (SV), resulting from a 17% (P < 0.05) lower end-diastolic volume (EDV) in hypoxic mice (Fig. 3F). The cardiac metabolic and energetic changes observed in hypoxic mice may have been caused by decreased PPAR\u03b1 expression. To investigate whether PPAR\u03b1 expression is central to hypoxic adaptation, we prevented PPAR\u03b1 down-regulation by increasing PPAR\u03b1 expression using high-fat (55% fat) feeding. The feeding of mice a high-fat diet for 3 wk in normoxia did not alter body weight, but with hypoxia, caused a 10% (P < 0.01) loss of body weight and a 19% (P < 0.01) decrease in LV mass (Supplemental Table 1). High-fat feeding increased PPAR\u03b1 mRNA expression in both normoxia and hypoxia (P < 0.05), preventing any hypoxia-induced decrease (Fig. 4A). PPAR\u03b4 mRNA and PPAR\u03b3, RXR, and PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels were unchanged by high-fat feeding. Downstream targets of PPAR\u03b1, UCP3, and MTE-1 proteins, increased 2-fold (P < 0.001), and MCAD protein increased by 39% (P < 0.01) with high-fat feeding under both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 4B and Supplemental Fig. 2). High-fat feeding did not significantly increase cardiac PDK4 protein, although it prevented the decrease caused by hypoxia in chow-fed mice. High-fat feeding prevented the increase in cardiac glycolysis and lactate efflux that occurred in chow-fed mice in hypoxia, and decreased GLUT4 protein by 59% (P < 0.05), which remained unaltered by hypoxia (Fig. 4C). High-fat feeding increased cardiac fatty acid oxidation by 22% (P < 0.05; Fig. 4D) and myocardial TAG content by 82% (P < 0.01), both unaffected by hypoxia. High-fat feeding decreased cardiac [PCr] by 25% (P < 0.05) in normoxic mice, but [PCr] did not decrease further with hypoxia (Fig. 4E). [ATP] was normal in normoxic high-fat\u2013fed mouse hearts but was 31% (P < 0.05) lower in hearts from hypoxic high-fat\u2013fed mice compared with chow-fed normoxic mice. Total Cr was unaltered in normoxic high-fat\u2013fed hearts but was 37% (P < 0.05) lower in hearts from high-fat\u2013fed mice exposed to hypoxia. [ADP]free was 55% (P < 0.05) higher in hearts from normoxic high-fat\u2013fed mice compared with normoxic chow-fed mice and increased by a further 38% with hypoxia (P < 0.05). High-fat feeding significantly lowered cardiac \u0394GATP in all mouse hearts. High-fat feeding under normoxia had no effect on cardiac function (Fig. 4F), whereas feeding a high-fat diet under hypoxia decreased in vivo cardiac output by 24% compared with normoxic chow (P < 0.01) or high-fat-fed (P < 0.05) mice. This was a result of a 35% (P < 0.001) lower SV, accounted for by a 28% (P < 0.01) lower EDV and despite a significantly higher heart rate. The cardiac index was decreased by 15% (P < 0.05), and ejection fractions were 12% (P < 0.02) lower than in normoxic chow-fed mice. Hence, high-fat feeding prevented the adaptive molecular and metabolic responses to hypoxia that were observed in chow-fed mouse hearts, thereby causing cardiac dysfunction. Having demonstrated that increased PPAR\u03b1 was associated with impaired function of the hypoxic heart, we next determined whether loss of PPAR\u03b1 altered cardiac metabolic and functional responses to hypoxia. PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were fed a chow diet and housed under hypoxia for 3 wk. PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice had 13% (P < 0.05) lower body weight and 18% (P < 0.05) lower LV mass than wild-type mice, with neither altered by hypoxia (Supplemental Table 1). Cardiac PPAR\u03b1 mRNA levels in PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were negligible, although PPAR\u03b4 mRNA and PPAR\u03b3, RXR, and PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels were normal and unchanged by hypoxia (Fig. 5A and Supplemental Fig. 2). Cardiac UCP3 protein (Fig. 5B) was 71% (P < 0.001) lower, and MTE-1 was 49% (P < 0.02) lower in PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts compared with wild-type mice, and both were unchanged by hypoxia. Other key mitochondrial proteins were unaltered relative to wild-type mice (Supplemental Fig. 2). PDK4 was 45% lower (P < 0.01), and MCAD protein was 43% (P < 0.001) lower in normoxic and hypoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts. PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts had 3-fold (P < 0.01) higher glycolytic rates than normoxic wild-type mouse hearts and were unaffected by hypoxia (Fig. 5C). Glycolysis was not maximal following hypoxia, as stimulation with insulin doubled glycolytic rates in both normoxic and hypoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts (Supplemental Fig. 4). Lactate efflux from hypoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts was 2-fold (P < 0.01) higher than from normoxic wild-type hearts and not different from normoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 hearts. Cardiac GLUT4 protein was similar in normoxic and hypoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Consistent with PPAR\u03b1 being a regulator of fatty acid metabolism, PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice had 24% lower (P < 0.05) cardiac fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 5D) than wild-type mice, which was unaltered by hypoxia. Cardiac TAG content was increased by 45% (P < 0.05) in normoxic and hypoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts. Thus, the lack of PPAR\u03b1 prevented the metabolic changes that were observed in hypoxic wild-type mouse hearts. In PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, [PCr] was decreased by 43% (P < 0.001), although [ATP] was unaltered compared with normoxic wild-type mouse hearts (Fig. 5E). Hypoxic cardiac [PCr] and [ATP] were decreased by 51% (P < 0.001) and 34% (P < 0.05), respectively, in PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Total Cr was decreased by 20% (P < 0.001) in PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts with no effect of hypoxia. As a consequence, [ADP]free was 2.7-fold (P < 0.05) higher and \u0394GATP significantly lower in all PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts, and unaltered by hypoxia. Normoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice had normal cardiac function, but hypoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice had 23% lower EDV (P < 0.01), 19% lower ESV (P < 0.05), 29% (P < 0.01) lower SV, and therefore, 20% lower cardiac output than normoxic wild-type mice (Fig. 5F). Therefore, deletion of PPAR\u03b1 significantly altered myocardial substrate and energy metabolism and prevented any metabolic response to hypoxia, thereby impairing cardiac function. To test whether high-fat feeding was operating via an alternative mechanism to PPAR\u03b1 regulation, PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were fed a high-fat diet and housed in normoxia or hypoxia. High-fat feeding had no effect on body weight or LV mass compared with chow-fed PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplemental Table 1). Cardiac PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b4 mRNA levels and PPAR\u03b3 and RXR protein concentrations were unaltered by high fat feeding, being the same as in the chow-fed PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, with no effect of hypoxia (Fig. 6A). Cardiac UCP3, MTE-1, PDK4, and MCAD proteins were unaltered in PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a high-fat diet compared with a chow diet, again unaffected by chronic hypoxia (Fig. 6B). Cardiac metabolism in PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice was also unaltered by either high-fat feeding with or without (Fig. 6C, D). Cardiac output in PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a high-fat diet was 29% lower than chow-fed PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice (P < 0.01) and 18% lower with hypoxia (P < 0.01), similar to chow-fed PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice exposed to chronic hypoxia (Fig. 6E). Cardiac index was 29% lower in PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a high-fat diet vs. chow, with no effect of hypoxia (P < 0.01). Ejection fraction was 6% lower in high-fat\u2013fed PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice and unaltered by hypoxia (P < 0.05). Therefore, PPAR\u03b1 ablation nullified the metabolic flexibility seen in healthy mice fed a high-fat diet, resulting in impaired cardiac function and unaffected by hypoxia. To investigate the weight loss observed in wild-type hypoxic mice fed a high-fat diet (Supplemental Table 1), energy intake was measured during the 3-wk protocol. Food consumption was not affected by hypoxia or by the high-fat diet (Fig. 7A). However, as a result of higher calorific value, there was a 28% (P < 0.05) higher energy intake on the high-fat diet, which again was unaffected by hypoxia. Cardiac levels of UCP3 and MTE-1 were elevated by high-fat feeding (Fig. 4B), suggesting that skeletal muscle UCPs responded to the high-fat diet in a similar manner, thereby contributing to body-weight loss in hypoxia. UCP3 protein levels in skeletal (gastrocnemius) muscle were 26% (P < 0.05) lower after 3 wk of hypoxia (Fig. 7B and Supplemental Fig. 5), a similar response to that in cardiac muscle (Fig. 3B). As found in cardiac muscle, UCP3 levels in skeletal muscle increased with high-fat feeding compared with chow-fed controls (P < 0.001) and were not altered by hypoxia. Skeletal muscle MTE-1 protein levels showed identical responses to those of UCP3, being 34% (P < 0.05) lower in hypoxic, chow-fed mice and 71% (P < 0.001) higher after high-fat feeding with/without hypoxia. PDK4 protein levels increased by 55% (P < 0.01) during high-fat feeding, which again prevented the adaptive responses to hypoxia. Having established that adaptation to cardiac hypoxia was regulated by PPAR\u03b1, we used confluent, beating HL-1 cardiac cells to investigate whether such adaptations were directly linked to the HIF system. Cells were exposed to hypoxia (2% O2) for 24 h, or the HIF system was chemically induced using 24 h incubation with the selective prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, IOX3 (33). Hypoxia caused a 5-fold increase in HIF-1\u03b1 (P < 0.001) and a 72% increase in HIF-2\u03b1 (P < 0.05) protein levels (Fig. 8A and Supplemental Fig. 5). IOX3 was a more potent activator of the HIF system than hypoxia, with a 9-fold increase in HIF-1\u03b1 (P < 0.001) and doubling of HIF-2\u03b1 (P < 0.01) protein levels after 24 h incubation. Under HIF-1\u03b1 control, VEGF mRNA increased by 37% (P < 0.05) in hypoxia and 59% (P < 0.001) with IOX3. PDK1 protein levels increased 34% in hypoxia (P < 0.05) and 86% with IOX3 treatment (P < 0.01). GLUT1 protein levels increased by 48% (P < 0.02) with hypoxia and 3-fold (P < 0.01) with IOX3. Hypoxia decreased PPAR\u03b1 mRNA by 23% (P < 0.01) in HL-1 cells (Fig. 8B), similar to that caused by in vivo hypoxia in the intact heart. IOX3 produced a similar, 25% decrease in PPAR\u03b1 mRNA (P < 0.001). PPAR\u03b4 mRNA levels were unaffected by hypoxia or IOX3. PPAR\u03b3 mRNA levels were not altered by hypoxia but were doubled (P < 0.001) after IOX3 incubation. In cultured cardiac cells, PPAR\u03b1-controlled mRNA expression was altered by hypoxia in a similar manner as the respective protein in the in vivo hypoxic heart (Fig. 8C). UCP3 levels were lowered by 27% (P < 0.01) by hypoxia but were not altered by IOX3. MCAD levels were 31% (P < 0.001) lower after hypoxia and 17% (P < 0.01) lower after IOX3. PDK4 levels were unaffected by hypoxia or IOX3. In this study, we have demonstrated that normobaric hypoxia in mice decreased myocardial PPAR\u03b1 expression, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial UCP3 and increased carbohydrate metabolism; such changes allowed normoxic [ATP] and contractile function to be maintained. Genetic ablation of PPAR\u03b1 in mice caused metabolic changes in the normoxic mouse heart that were already at the extreme of hypoxic adaptation and therefore, could not be altered by hypoxia. A high-fat diet increased mouse heart PPAR\u03b1 expression and prevented PPAR\u03b1 down-regulation by hypoxia. Thus, with high-fat feeding, the cardiac proteins under PPAR\u03b1 control (UCP3, MTE-1, PDK4, and MCAD) and fatty acid oxidation increased, whereas GLUT4 levels and glycolysis decreased; metabolic changes that remained in hypoxia. Consequently, the high-fat diet plus 3 wk exposure to hypoxia significantly decreased myocardial [ATP], cardiac index, and ejection fraction. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an increase in a dietary constituent, fat, has been shown to cause myocardial dysfunction in hypoxia, a finding that may have implications for altitude exposure (34) or heart failure (in which similar metabolic changes, the \u201cfetal gene program,\u201d occur) (1, 28, 35, 36). However, the human diet typically contains \u223c30% fat and probably seldom the 7.5 or 55% fat used in the mouse diets. PPAR\u03b1 down-regulation and substrate switching are essential for the maintenance of contractile function of the hypertrophied heart (37), and there have been reports of decreased PPAR\u03b1 expression in the heart following in vivo hypoxia (24, 26\u201328). In our mice, PPAR\u03b1 appeared to be the sole PPAR isoform involved in the myocardial metabolic changes, as neither PPAR\u03b4 nor PPAR\u03b3 levels changed. In agreement with findings in human skeletal muscle at altitude (38), there were no changes in PGC-1\u03b1 nor were cardiac RXR protein levels decreased significantly by hypoxia. In cultured cardiomyocytes, however, others have demonstrated decreased hypoxia-induced PPAR\u03b1/RXR DNA binding as a result of decreased RXR (39) or increased HIF-1\u03b1 (24) levels. PPAR\u03b1 has been linked to hypoxic adaptation in high-altitude tolerant humans (19), and simulated hypoxia, using cobalt chloride to inhibit prolyl hydroxylases (40), decreased PPAR\u03b1 mRNA (9), suggesting regulation of PPAR\u03b1 via the HIF system. Certainly, in beating cardiomyocytes, we found that hypoxia or prolyl hydroxylase inhibition increased HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1, and decreased PPAR\u03b1, MCAD, and UCP3 expression; beneficial adaptations to hypoxia (41). Yet, studies of the HIF complex in transgenic (23) or knockout mouse hearts (21, 22, 26) or skeletal muscle (25) have yielded apparently conflicting (and confusing) results, in that decreased HIF-1\u03b2 (21), HIF-1\u03b1 (22, 23), or HIF-2\u03b1 (21) or increased HIF-1\u03b1 (26) or HIF-2\u03b1 (25) are reported to increase (21, 23, 25) or not alter (22) PPAR\u03b1 or decrease PPAR\u03b3 (22) expression with increased (21), or no change in (25), fatty acid oxidation. Of course, these are not studies on the metabolic effects of hypoxia, but on the contribution of individual constituents of the HIF pathway to changes in metabolism via the PPAR transcription factors. So, both increased (25) and decreased (21) HIF-2\u03b1 increased PPAR\u03b1 expression, whereas decreased HIF-1\u03b1 increased either PPAR\u03b1 (23) or PPAR\u03b3 (22) expression. It is difficult to compare such studies, as few and rarely the same measures of myocardial metabolism or function have been made, and seldom using the same techniques. However, most studies reported the deposition of lipids in the heart (21\u201323, 26) or cardiomyocytes (24), whether HIF-1\u03b1 was increased (24, 26) or decreased (22, 23). We also found increased TAG in all hypoxic mouse hearts, whether PPAR\u03b1 levels and fatty acid oxidation were increased or decreased and unrelated to the effects of hypoxia on contractile function. Indeed, both the high-fat\u2013fed and the PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts had high TAG levels in normoxia that were unaltered by hypoxia, suggesting that more fatty acids were taken up than could be oxidized and that lipid deposits per se do not cause cardiac injury. Carbohydrate metabolism was increased with hypoxia, but high-fat feeding prevented this potentially adaptive mechanism. GLUT4 was down-regulated with activation of PPAR\u03b1 via high-fat feeding and was unaltered by chronic hypoxia. Consistent with this finding, PPAR\u03b1 overexpression is known to repress GLUT4 mRNA (15), and we have shown that cardiac GLUT4 content is reduced in obesity (42). Lower GLUT4 levels may have contributed to cardiac dysfunction when hypoxia was combined with a high-fat diet, preventing increased carbohydrate metabolism and resulting in lower cardiac [ATP] in hypoxic mice. Ventricular mass was lower in chronically hypoxic mice, resulting in cardiac hypotrophy. This reflects human studies of altitude exposure in sea-level natives (12). The stimulus for such reduction in LV mass, in the absence of loss of body weight, may be a requirement to improve oxygen diffusion distances in tissue with a sustained, high-oxygen demand (43). The molecular mechanisms associated with such loss of cardiac muscle are incompletely understood but may involve a reversal of the hypertrophic mechanisms associated with physiologic hypertrophy (44). In hypoxic mice fed a high-fat diet, whereas absolute LV mass fell in hypoxia, cardiac hypotrophy was not evident, as hypoxic high-fat\u2013fed animals also lost body weight. The molecular mechanisms for this weight loss are unclear; however, all groups of PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice in this study were smaller than wild-type littermates, which potentially implicates PPAR\u03b1 in the regulation of body weight. Not only did hypoxia decrease PPAR\u03b1 mRNA levels and PPAR\u03b1 downstream targets\u2014UCP3, MTE-1, and MCAD protein levels\u2014in the heart, but also in skeletal muscle. In contrast to the increased PPAR\u03b1 observed in skeletal muscle in the PHD1\u2212/\u2212 mouse (25), the decrease in PPAR\u03b1 expression is in agreement with findings in human skeletal muscle at an altitude in which UCP3 levels and \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, a \u03b2-oxidation enzyme and PPAR\u03b1 target, were down-regulated (38). The adaptation to hypoxia via changes in PPAR\u03b1 expression, observed here in heart and skeletal muscle, may be relevant to other organs that have high PPAR\u03b1 expression, such as liver, kidney, and intestine (45). As in the heart, we found that the high-fat diet increased (and prevented any hypoxia-induced decrease in) UCP3, MTE-1, and PDK4 in mouse skeletal muscle. Although the high-fat\u2013fed mice consumed 28% more calories than those on the chow diet, they did not gain weight, possibly owing to energy wastage via increased mitochondrial uncoupling (3). The normobaric, hypoxia-induced decrease in cardiac PCr in our mice has been shown in the human heart as a decrease in PCr/ATP, measured using in vivo MRS: in lowlanders following a trek to Mount Everest Base Camp (12) and in Sherpa volunteers, even after 4 wk of de-acclimation at low altitudes (11). The decreased cardiac PCr/ATP in the Sherpa hearts was attributed to the requirement for a higher [ADP]free, to be closer to the Km of 110 \u03bcM (46) for ADP-requiring PK activity in glycolysis, reflecting the elevated contribution of carbohydrate-to-myocardial energy needs (7, 11). Such a mechanism may be related to a decrease in PPAR\u03b1 levels via high-altitude adaptation of the PPARA gene in Tibetans (19) and could explain why the highest [ADP]free occurred in the highly glycolytic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts in normoxia and hypoxia. However, a genetic adaptation cannot explain the 18% decrease in myocardial PCr/ATP and diastolic dysfunction in human lowlanders after a trek to Mount Everest (12), which may have been exacerbated by the hypobaria and a result of the requirement for increased [ADP]free, plus the insulin resistance and elevated epinephrine observed in the same cohort (47). [ADP]free is a key metabolite controlling oxidative phosphorylation (4), so it is possible that the decrease in PCr in the hypoxic mouse hearts was a result of the need for higher [ADP]free to stimulate mitochondrial respiration and to increase glycolytic flux. The requirement for oxygen would have been decreased in the hypoxic hearts by the decrease in both fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial uncoupling, with increased flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase and increased glucose oxidation, all of which allowed [ATP] and contractile function to remain at normoxic levels. In the mice fed a high-fat diet in normoxia, myocardial PCr decreased with no loss of total Cr to maintain normal ATP levels and cardiac function despite the increased oxygen required for fatty acid oxidation and increased oxygen wastage via mitochondrial uncoupling. Such changes with high-fat diets have been observed in human (48) and rat hearts associated with decreased efficiency (3). However, when the oxygen supply was restricted, the combination of greater oxygen requirement for fatty acid oxidation, plus oxygen wastage via increased mitochondrial UCP3 proteins, significantly decreased ATP, cardiac index, and ejection fraction. Likewise, mice with a cardiac-specific ARNT ablation had increased PPAR\u03b1 expression and fatty acid oxidation with decreased ejection fraction (21). The metabolic changes caused by hypoxia in wild-type mouse hearts were found to have occurred already in normoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts and did not change further with hypoxia. PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts maintained normal cardiac index and ejection fractions in hypoxia, owing to high [ADP]free, high glycolytic flux, low PDK4 (suggesting increased pyruvate dehydrogenase flux and glucose oxidation), low fatty acid oxidation, and low mitochondrial UCP3 and MTE-1 levels, all of which would have resulted in the most efficient use of any available oxygen. Thus, metabolism in the normoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse heart may be viewed as at the extreme of hypoxic adaptation, which increases resistance to ischemia (49, 50), but may not support a high workload (51) with greater hypertrophy and functional impairment following aortic constriction (52). It is possible that the PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts may have had decreased ejection fractions, in addition to the lower cardiac output and higher heart rates, with a longer duration of hypoxia. As metabolism in PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse hearts was at the limit of hypoxic adaptation during normoxia, with no response to hypoxia, the use of PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice to validate PPAR\u03b1 as a HIF target is questionable. For example, knockout mice with decreased HIF-2\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212) (21), increased HIF-2\u03b1 (Phd1\u2212/\u2212) (25), and decreased HIF-1\u03b1 [NADPH oxidase deficient (Tg Nox\u2212/\u2212) transgenic mice] (22) had their metabolic phenotypes reversed in a double knockout made by crossing with PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In summary, we propose that decreased myocardial PPAR\u03b1 expression is central to the metabolic changes required to maintain contractile function in hypoxia. A high-fat diet increased PPAR\u03b1 expression, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial UCP levels\u2014changes that were tolerated in normoxia, but decreased ATP and impaired cardiac function in hypoxia. Finally, the metabolic changes in normoxic PPAR\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse heart can be viewed as at the extreme of hypoxic metabolic adaptation, in that they have no metabolic response to hypoxia."}, "25550469": {"pmid": "25550469", "pmcid": "PMC4470404", "title": "The androgen receptor confers protection against diet-induced atherosclerosis, obesity, and dyslipidemia in female mice", "abstract": "\nAndrogens have important cardiometabolic actions in males, but their metabolic role in females is unclear. To determine the physiologic androgen receptor (AR)\u2013dependent actions of androgens on atherogenesis in female mice, we generated female AR-knockout (ARKO) mice on an atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (apoE)\u2013deficient background. After 8 weeks on a high-fat diet, but not on a normal chow diet, atherosclerosis in aorta was increased in ARKO females (+59% vs. control apoE-deficient mice with intact AR gene). They also displayed increased body weight (+18%), body fat percentage (+62%), and hepatic triglyceride levels, reduced insulin sensitivity, and a marked atherogenic dyslipidemia (serum cholesterol, +52%). Differences in atherosclerosis, body weight, and lipid levels between ARKO and control mice were abolished in mice that were ovariectomized before puberty, consistent with a protective action of ovarian androgens mediated via the AR. Furthermore, the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone reduced atherosclerosis (\u221241%; thoracic aorta), subcutaneous fat mass (\u221244%), and cholesterol levels (\u221235%) in ovariectomized mice, reduced hepatocyte lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells in vitro, and regulated mRNA expression of hepatic genes pivotal for lipid homeostasis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the AR protects against diet-induced atherosclerosis in female mice and propose that this is mediated by modulation of body composition and lipid metabolism.\u2014Fagman, J.

The androgen receptor confers protection against diet-induced atherosclerosis, obesity, and dyslipidemia in female mice.\n", "fulltext": "Circulating levels of testosterone, the main androgen, in females are approximately 1/10th of the levels in males. In women, androgens are secreted by both ovaries and adrenals, but in female mice, the ovaries are the dominant producers of androgens. In women, as in men, testosterone levels slowly decline with increasing age. Low androgen levels may also be caused, for example, by bilateral ovariectomy, hypopituitarism, and glucocorticosteroid use, whereas androgen levels are not significantly altered across menopause (1).Substantial evidence from both human and rodent studies indicates that androgens exert important effects on atherosclerosis, body composition, and metabolism in males (2\u20135). By contrast, the physiologic metabolic actions of androgens in females are poorly understood (1), and the ongoing debate concerning the possible existence of an androgen deficiency syndrome in women has mainly focused on well-being and sexual function (6, 7). The coexistence of excess androgen production and a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia), as well as increased atherosclerosis (8), in polycystic ovary syndrome has favored the idea that androgens exert adverse metabolic effects in women (9, 10).Studies on the role of androgens in females are hampered by, for example, the concomitant loss of androgens and estrogens following ovariectomy and difficulties in assessing low serum levels of androgens in females, as well as determining appropriate doses for androgen replacement (1, 11). The physiologic effects of androgens are mostly mediated by activation of the ubiquitously expressed androgen receptor (AR) (12), and the development of female AR knockout (ARKO) mice has provided a valuable tool for studying the role of androgens in females (13).To determine the physiologic AR-dependent actions of androgens on the development of atherosclerosis in females, we generated female ARKO and control mice on an atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (apoE)\u2013deficient background.Because of the vital importance of the AR in male fertility, Cre/loxP technology (14) was used to obtain female ARKO and control mice on an atherosclerosis-prone apoE-deficient background (AR\u2212/\u2212apoE\u2212/\u2212 and AR+/+apoE\u2212/\u2212, respectively). Mice expressing Cre recombinase ubiquitously and from an early embryonic stage under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase-1 promoter (PGK-Cre) (15) and mice with floxed AR exon 2 (floxAR) (14) were backcrossed to a C57BL/6 background (Charles River Laboratories) for \u22656 generations and then crossed with apoE\u2212/\u2212 (C57BL/6 background, model APOE-M; Taconic Europe A/S, Lille Skensved, Denmark) to obtain a homozygous apoE\u2212/\u2212 background. Because of the location of the AR on the X chromosome, the infertility of AR\u2212/Y males (14), and the fact that Cre activity starts in the diploid phase of oogenesis in PGK-Cre-expressing females and thereby causes complete recombination in Cre- offspring (15), the breeding was performed as follows: AR+/floxapoE\u2212/\u2212 female mice and Cre+/+apoE\u2212/\u2212 male mice were crossed to obtain heterozygous AR+/\u2212Cre+/\u2212apoE\u2212/\u2212 female offspring. These AR+/\u2212Cre+/\u2212apoE\u2212/\u2212 females were mated with ARflox/YapoE\u2212/\u2212 males to generate AR\u2212/\u2212apoE\u2212/\u2212 (ARKO) females. Female AR+/+apoE\u2212/\u2212 (control) mice were generated by mating AR+/\u2212Cre+/\u2212apoE\u2212/\u2212 females with AR+/YapoE\u2212/\u2212 males. Because Cre expression itself did not affect the metabolic phenotype and there were similar effects on atherosclerosis by ARKO in Cre+ and Cre\u2212 mice, Cre+ and Cre\u2212 animals were pooled in both the ARKO and control groups. We assessed AR (14), Cre (14), and apoE (protocol from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) genotypes using PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the tail.The mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a 6:00 am to 6:00 pm light cycle and fed diet and tap water ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Care and Use in Gothenburg and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.Female ARKO and control mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) after weaning and, in separate experiments, an NCD or a high-fat diet (HFD; #821424, 21% fat from lard, 0.15% cholesterol; Special Diets Services, Essex, United Kingdom) from 8 to 16 weeks of age. Some mice were kept on an NCD until 34 weeks of age.Prepubertal female ARKO and control mice (23\u201325 days old) were anesthetized with isoflurane (Baxter Medical AB, Kista, Sweden) and bilaterally ovariectomized. From 8 to 16 weeks of age, the mice were fed an HFD as described in Protocol 1.Eight-week-old female apoE-deficient mice (Taconic Europe A/S) were bilaterally ovariectomized and implanted subcutaneously with a small slow-release pellet containing placebo or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) releasing 2.5 mg/90 days (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA). From 8 to 16 weeks of age, the mice were fed an HFD as described in Protocol 1.Prepubertal male apoE-deficient mice (23\u201325 days old) were anesthetized with isoflurane and sham-operated or bilaterally orchiectomized. From 8 to 16 weeks of age, the mice were fed an HFD as described in Protocol 1. Total RNA was extracted from the liver as described below.At the study end, the circulatory system was perfused with 0.9% saline (pH 7.4) under physiologic pressure. The entire aorta was dissected out from the heart to the iliac bifurcation and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. For en face analysis, the aortas were dissected free from connective and adipose tissue, cut open longitudinally, and pinned flat on silicone-coated dishes. The aortas were stained for lipids using Sudan IV, and images were captured. The outline of the aortic surface and lesions were defined manually by a blinded observer, and lesion areas were computed by an image analysis program (BioPix Software, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden). The extent of atherosclerosis was expressed as the percentage of the aortic surface covered by lesions. Results were calculated for the aortic arch (from the brachiocephalic trunk to the first intercostal arteries), the thoracic aorta (from the first to the last intercostal arteries), the abdominal aorta (from the last intercostal arteries to the aortic bifurcation), and the whole aorta, respectively.Serial 10 \u03bcm cryosections were cut distally from the aortic root. Sections were stained (200, 400, and 600 \u00b5m after the appearance of the aortic cusps) with Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Masson\u00b4s trichrome (Accustain Trichrome Stains\u2013Masson; from Sigma-Aldrich). For immunohistochemical staining of macrophages, aortic root cryosections (160 \u03bcm from the aortic cusps) were incubated with rat anti-mouse Mac-2 antibody (1:1000; Cedarlane, Hornby, BC, Canada) or isotype control antibody (1:1000; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), followed by horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated goat anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (1:1000; GE Healthcare, London, United Kingdom) and visualized with the DAB substrate kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The areas of Oil red O staining, Mac-2 staining, and collagen staining (blue color in Masson\u2019s trichrome) were determined using morphometric analysis (BioPix Software) and normalized to the size of the atherosclerotic lesion. Lesion complexity (presence/absence of necrotic core) was evaluated in sections stained with Masson\u00b4s trichrome (200 \u03bcm from the aortic cusps).Body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar PIXImus 2 mouse densitometer; GE Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The head region was excluded from analysis following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Lean, bone, and fat mass, as well as body fat percentage, were calculated by the Lunar PIXImus 2 2.10 software (GE Lunar Corporation).All blood samples were collected from random-cycling mice after 3\u20134 hours of fasting. Blood was collected in serum gel tubes (Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany), and serum was obtained and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Serum levels of estradiol were analyzed using a radioimmunoassay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Serum testosterone levels were measured by a radioimmunoassay after diethylether extraction (16). Levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and serum glucose were analyzed by colorimetric assays using Infinity reagents (TR13421, TR22421, and TR15421; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The distribution of lipids within the plasma lipoprotein fractions was assessed in pooled serum (6 mice per pool) by fast-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration using a Superose 6HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) (17). Insulin levels were measured using a mouse insulin ELISA (Ultra Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA; Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL, USA).Liver samples were homogenized with isopropanol using stainless steel beads (5 mm; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a TissueLyser II (Qiagen), kept for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C, and centrifuged for 5 minutes (2500 rpm, 4\u00b0C), and the supernatants were collected. The triglyceride levels in the supernatants were analyzed using an Infinity reagent (Triglycerides #TR22421; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the amount of triglycerides was normalized to liver sample weights.The mice were given an intraperitoneal injection (0.25 U/kg in mice fed a normal chow diet; 0.5 U/kg body weight in HFD-fed mice) of insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark), and blood glucose was determined in serial blood samples from the tail vein using the HemoCue Glucose system (HemoCue, \u00c4ngelholm, Sweden). The mice were fasted prior to the insulin injection and during the measurements until the 120-minute time point.The mice were given an intraperitoneal injection (2 mg/kg body weight in 0.9% saline) of d-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), and blood glucose was determined in serial blood samples from the tail as described above. The mice were fasted prior to the injection of glucose and during the test.The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (Baxter Medical AB), and a Samba transducer catheter (Samba Sensors, Gothenburg, Sweden) was placed into the left carotid artery for measurements of diastolic, systolic, and mean arterial pressure, as well as heart rate. We collected data using a PowerLab data acquisition unit together with LabChart software (ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia), averaged over a period of 2 minutes, following stabilization of the arterial pressure trace.The spontaneous locomotor activity was measured for 4 hours using open-field 50 \u00d7 50 cm plexiglas cages fitted with infrared beams (Kungsbacka M\u00e4t och Reglerteknik AB, Fj\u00e4r\u00e5s, Sweden). Activity counts were recorded each time a mouse broke an infrared beam. Rectal body temperatures were recorded in anesthetized mice (isoflurane; Baxter Medical AB). Food intake was measured individually over 24 hours. Indirect calorimetry was analyzed at room temperature (21\u00b0C) using an indirect open circuit calorimeter (Somedic INCA; Somedic sales AB, H\u00f6rby, Sweden). Briefly, the mice were placed in the individual cages in the specifically designed calorimeter chambers with a 6:00 am to 6:00 pm light cycle and ad libitum access to food and water for 24 hours.Cryosections of mesenteric adipose tissue were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and images were captured. The plasma membranes of individual adipocytes were defined manually by a blinded observer, and adipocyte surface areas were computed by an image analysis program (BioPix Software). An average of 300 adipocytes per mouse was analyzed.McArdle rat hepatoma cells (McA-RH 7777; LGC Standards AB, Bor\u00e5s, Sweden) were cultured in MEM (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Linz, Austria) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, South Logan, UT, USA). For assessment of intracellular lipids, the cells were plated in 24-well plates containing glass coverslips and grown in MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum. After 24 hours, the medium was changed to MEM without fetal bovine serum plus 0, 20, or 60 \u00b5M oleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and after 48 hours, the cells were treated with 1 nM DHT (dissolved in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle for 24 hours. In separate experiments, the medium was changed to MEM without fetal bovine serum plus 60 \u00b5M oleic acid 24 hours after plating, and after 48 hours, the cells were treated with 1 nM DHT, 10 \u03bcM enzalutamide (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA), or vehicle for 24 hours. Cells were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 5 minutes, treated with 20% isopropanol for 0.5 minutes, and stained with Oil Red O for 20 minutes. Next, cells were treated with 20% isopropanol for 0.5 minutes, stained with hematoxylin for 2 minutes, and finally rinsed in tap and distilled water. Cells were photographed with a Zeiss microscope and Oil Red O\u2013stained area per cell was quantified by BioPix iQ 2.1.8 software (BioPix Software).Analysis of hepatic triglyceride secretion was performed as previously described (18). Briefly, McA-RH 7777 cells were grown in MEM with 2% fetal bovine serum. After 24 hours, the medium was changed to MEM without fetal bovine serum plus 20 \u00b5M oleic acid, and after 48 h, DHT (10 nM) or vehicle was added for 24 hours. Cells were then incubated for 10 hours with [3H]glycerol (0.6 \u03bcCi/ml of culture medium; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) to trace triglycerides. Release of [3H]glycerol was chased in cold medium, and lipids were extracted in Folch solution (chloroform/methanol 2:1). Triglycerides were separated by thin layer chromatography on silica plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using a 2-phase system [first phase, chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4 v/v); second phase, petroleumether:diethylether:acetic acid (80:20:1 v/v)], and [3H]glycerol was measured by scintillation counting (BeckMan Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).Apolipoprotein B secretion was analyzed as previously described (19). Briefly, McA-RH 7777 cells were incubated with MEM containing 2% fetal calf serum and 20 \u03bcM oleic acid. After 24 hours, 10 nM DHT or vehicle was added for 24 hours. Next, cells were incubated for 2 h with methionine-free medium (Sigma-Aldrich), pulse-labeled for 20 min with [35S] methionine (Perkin Elmer), and chased with cold medium for 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Apolipoprotein B-100 and apolipoprotein B-48 were immunoprecipitated from the medium at each time point using a polyclonal anti-APOB apolipoprotein B antibody (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and Pansorbin cells (Merck). SDS-PAGE was carried out overnight at +4\u00b0C, 24 mA, on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was exposed to a phosphor-screen, and bands were observed using Fuji FLA-3000 PhosphorImager and quantified using MultiGauge 2.0.Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen liver using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using the high capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with random primers. mRNA expression of genes of interest was analyzed with TaqMan real-time PCR in an ABI Prism 7900 HT Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan Gene Expression assays were used: Ldlr mm00440169_m1; Vldlr mm00443281_m1; Pcsk9 mm00463738_m1; Scarb1 mm00450236_m1; Cpt1a mm00550438_m1; Mttp mm00435015_m1; Sort1 mm00490905_m1; ApoC3 mm00445670_m1; Nr1h3 (LXR\u03b1) mm00443451_m1; Srebf1 mm00550338_m1; and Srebf2 mm01306262_m1. 18S (Applied Biosystems) was used as an internal control.Statistical evaluations were performed with SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). All variables were tested for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk normality test). For variables that were normally distributed with or without log transformation, 2 group comparisons were performed by Student\u2019s t test and 4 group comparisons by 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. Other (nonparametric) data were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test (2 groups). Frequencies were compared by \u03c72 test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.We evaluated atherosclerotic lesion formation in en face-mounted aortas of 16-week-old female control and ARKO mice on an apoE-deficient background fed either an NCD or an HFD from 8 weeks of age. Lesion area in the whole aorta, aortic arch, thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta did not differ between ARKO and control females fed an NCD (Fig. 1). By contrast, after 8 weeks on HFD, the lesion area in the whole aorta was increased by 59% in ARKO compared with control mice (Fig. 1A, B). The lesion area was significantly increased in the aortic arch (+67%) and the abdominal aorta (+70%), but not in the thoracic aorta (Fig. 1C). There were no differences in plaque complexity (the presence/absence of a necrotic core) or composition (area of collagen and macrophage staining) in the aortic root between the genotypes in mice fed HFD (Supplemental Table S1).Because endogenous androgens are derived solely from the ovaries in female mice (20), we postulated that the observed difference in atherosclerosis between ARKO and control mice fed an HFD would be abolished in ovariectomized mice. Indeed, we observed similar levels of atherosclerosis in HFD-fed ARKO and control mice that were ovariectomized before puberty (Fig. 1D).We also evaluated endogenous hormone production in 16-week-old ovarian-intact mice fed an HFD. Serum estradiol levels were similar in ARKO and control mice, whereas serum testosterone levels were higher in female ARKO mice (Supplemental Table S2). The weights of uterus and ovaries did not differ between ARKO and controls (Supplemental Table S2).Between 4 and 16 weeks of age, body weight did not differ between ARKO and control females fed an NCD (Fig. 2A). However, body weight was significantly higher in ARKO mice after 4 (+11%), 6, and 8 (+18%) weeks on an HFD (age 12, 14, and 16 weeks; Fig. 2A). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry confirmed an increase in fat mass (+101%; Fig. 2C) and body fat percentage (+62%; Fig. 2D) without any changes in absolute bone mass (data not shown) or lean body mass (Fig. 2B) in HFD-fed ARKO mice. Further, the relative weights of dissected visceral and subcutaneous fat were increased in ARKO compared with control mice on an HFD (Fig. 2E, F). There were no differences in fat mass, body fat percentage, visceral fat, or subcutaneous fat between ARKO and control mice fed an NCD (Fig. 2C\u2013F). Further, body weight (Fig. 2G) and visceral fat mass (25.1 \u00b1 1.8 vs. 24.8 \u00b1 0.7 mg/g body weight; P = not significant) were similar in HFD-fed ARKO and control mice that were ovariectomized before puberty. We also monitored body weight of ARKO and control females fed an NCD until 34 weeks of age and found no difference in body weight during this time (body weight at 34 weeks: ARKO 31.4 \u00b1 1.6 vs. control 31.8 \u00b1 2.1 g, n = 7/group; P = not significant). Despite the diet-induced obesity in female ARKO mice, we found no significant differences in locomotor activity, food intake, body temperature, oxygen consumption, or carbon dioxide production between ARKO and control females fed an HFD (Supplemental Fig. S1A\u2013E).We next investigated whether there were differences in serum lipid levels between female ARKO and control mice fed an HFD. Indeed, serum total cholesterol levels were elevated by 52% and triglyceride levels by 44% in ARKO versus control mice after 8 weeks on an HFD (Fig. 3A), with a similar lipid distribution in lipoprotein fractions in the groups (Fig. 3B). Further, hepatic triglyceride levels were increased in ARKO mice (Fig. 3C). Both insulin and glucose tolerance were significantly impaired in ARKO compared with control females fed an HFD (Fig. 3D, E). In line with an insulin-resistant phenotype, ARKO mice displayed enlarged mesenteric adipocytes after 8 weeks of an HFD (Fig. 3F). In mice fed an NCD, there were no differences in either serum cholesterol and triglycerides (Fig. 3A) or insulin and glucose tolerance (Supplemental Fig. S2A, B). Further, HFD-fed ARKO and control mice that were ovariectomized before puberty displayed no differences in serum cholesterol or triglycerides (Supplemental Fig. S2C). Blood pressure did not differ between ARKO and control mice fed HFD (Supplemental Table S3).To confirm an atheroprotective action that is mediated via the AR in females, ovariectomized apoE-deficient mice were treated with the nonaromatizable AR agonist DHT or placebo for 8 weeks while simultaneously receiving an HFD. DHT treatment reduced en face atherosclerotic lesion area in the thoracic aorta by 41% compared with placebo, whereas there was no significant effect in the aortic arch or the abdominal aorta (Fig. 4A).DHT also reduced the relative weight of subcutaneous (\u221244%) but not visceral fat (Fig. 4B). Further, DHT increased skeletal muscle mass (Fig. 4C), and final body weight was not significantly different in DHT- versus placebo-treated mice (31.8 \u00b1 0.9 vs. 29.7 \u00b1 0.8 g, P = not significant).After both 2 and 8 weeks of an HFD, DHT decreased serum total cholesterol levels (by 35% and 26%, respectively; Fig. 4D). By contrast, DHT did not affect serum triglyceride levels during the study (Fig. 4E). Moreover, DHT treatment reduced fasting serum insulin levels after 8 weeks but not 2 weeks (Fig. 4F). Blood glucose levels were unchanged at both time points (data not shown).Dyslipidemia is the most important risk factor leading to the development of atherosclerosis (21, 22) and is tightly coupled to alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism. To study potential direct effects of androgens on hepatic lipid accumulation, we incubated McA RH-7777 hepatoma cells with DHT. We found that DHT significantly reduced neutral lipid storage in hepatocytes (Fig. 5A). This effect was blocked by concomitant treatment with the AR blocker enzalutamide (Fig 5B).As a major pathway for removal of hepatic lipids is the incorporation of triglycerides into very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and subsequent secretion, we hypothesized that DHT may affect this pathway. We found an increase in the amount of secreted triglycerides (Fig. 5C) with no difference in the amount of apoB secreted from the cells (Supplemental Fig. S3).We also measured levels of selected mRNAs that encode proteins involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in the livers of ovariectomized apoE-deficient female mice fed an HFD and treated with DHT or placebo. Of 11 studied mRNAs, 3 were regulated by DHT: mRNA levels of ApoC3 (\u221225%) and Vldlr (\u221253%) were decreased and mRNA levels of Sort1 were increased (46%; Fig. 5D). To study whether these genes are androgen regulated in males as in females, we analyzed mRNAs in the livers of intact and orchiectomized apoE-deficient male mice fed an HFD. Although ApoC3 mRNA (+11%, P = not significant) was not regulated by castration in males, the castrated males showed a decrease in Sort1 mRNA (\u221226%, P < 0.001 by t test) and a strong increase in Vldlr mRNA (+784%, P < 0.001 by t test), in accordance with the results from DHT treatment in females.The physiologic metabolic actions of androgens in females are poorly understood. The current study provides clear evidence that deletion of the AR in atherosclerosis-prone apoE-deficient female mice promotes the development of atherosclerosis, as well as obesity and dyslipidemia.This is the first study to investigate atherogenesis in an animal model of female AR deficiency. Earlier studies to elucidate the effect of exogenous androgens on atherosclerosis in females report conflicting results (23\u201328). An often-cited study reported that testosterone treatment of ovarian-intact female monkeys caused increased atherosclerosis (25); however, the treatment completely suppressed ovarian cyclicity, suggesting that a disturbed estrogen production may contribute to these results. By contrast, a number of studies in ovariectomized female mice showed atheroprotection by testosterone (27, 28), and similar to our findings, 1 study showed that the nonaromatizable AR agonist DHT protected against atherosclerosis in female apoE-deficient mice (26), supporting the importance of the AR. However, in all these earlier studies, pharmacologic doses of androgens were administered exogenously, and thus these studies do not provide information on the physiologic effects of endogenous androgens.In the present study, female AR deficiency resulted in increased atherosclerosis in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta with no significant difference in the thoracic aorta, whereas DHT treatment reduced atherosclerosis in the thoracic aorta only. We speculate that this may be explained by regional differences in the kinetics of lesion development. It is well known that lesions appear first in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta in the apoE-deficient mouse model (29). Therefore, these areas may be more susceptible to factors operating early during atherogenesis (e.g., AR deficiency from embryonic stage) but less susceptible to atheroprotective factors operating in adult age (such as DHT treatment in this study) when complex atherosclerotic lesions have already developed in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta.Hypercholesterolemia is the most important risk factor for atherosclerosis and associated complications (21, 22). In the present study, we found that AR deficiency increased serum lipid levels and atherosclerosis in female mice, whereas AR stimulation exerted the opposite actions. Dyslipidemia in female mice with general AR deficiency has not been addressed previously. In accordance with our data, previous studies report a reduction of serum lipid levels by exogenous androgens to both ovariectomized female mice (28, 30) and women (31). Limited available data do not support beneficial effects of testosterone treatment on lipid profiles in postmenopausal women (32); however, dose and mode of administration, as well as background endogenous hormone production, may determine treatment effects (1, 32).It seems likely that the diet-induced obesity and associated metabolic complications, such as hepatic fat accumulation, contribute to an atherogenic dyslipidemia in female ARKO mice (22). Using an in vitro model, we also show direct hepatic actions of a nonaromatizable AR agonist protecting hepatoma cells from lipid accumulation, in line with previous reports (33). Interestingly, serum cholesterol levels were reduced shortly after the initiation of AR agonist treatment to female mice in vivo, and we observed hepatic regulation of genes pivotal for lipid homeostasis, encoding sortilin, VLDL receptor (VLDLr), and apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3), in these mice. In accordance, we found that Sort1 and Vldlr, but not ApoC3 mRNAs were regulated by endogenous androgens (castration) in male mice. Liver-specific sortilin overexpression may dramatically reduce cholesterol levels in mice, but basic studies report conflicting results on sortilin action (34). The VLDLr mediates reuptake of VLDL into the liver, and downregulation of Vldlr may therefore contribute to protection from hepatic steatosis by androgens in vivo (35), although this mechanism may be less relevant in our apoE-deficient model. Notably, DHT treatment to females in vivo downregulated ApoC3, a major component of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that reduces clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and is causally associated with atherogenesis (36, 37). Although the regulation of ApoC3 mRNA was relatively modest (\u221225%) in our study, reduction of ApoC3 mRNA in this range was recently shown to effectively reduce lipid levels in mice (37). Taken together, we propose that androgens reduce hepatic lipid accumulation by favoring a higher lipidation of VLDL with no changes in the total amount of secreted VLDL particles, as shown here in vitro. These particles are in turn more effectively cleared from the circulation due to a relative decrease in apoC3. In accordance with this notion, testosterone supplementation increased VLDL clearance in female apoE3-Leiden mice (30). The clinical relevance of these data is supported by a study suggesting that testosterone supplementation may improve lipid profiles in ovariectomized women by decreasing the apoC3 concentration in lipoproteins (31).Our present results demonstrate that ARKO female mice display obesity when fed an HFD, but not an NCD. This finding is in line with earlier studies that reported late-onset obesity and metabolic dysfunction in male (38, 39) but not female (38, 40\u201342) ARKO mice fed an NCD. It is therefore clear that an HFD is required for the obese and metabolic phenotype in female ARKO mice, and possibly the apoE-deficient background of our mice and/or the lard content of the HFD further contributes to unmasking of the phenotype. In comparison, we previously found increased atherosclerosis but less pronounced alterations in serum lipid levels and lower body weight in male apoE-deficient ARKO mice fed an HFD (5); these discrepancies may be partly explained by developmental defects in male ARKO mice (43).It remains a topic for future studies to determine the target organs for the metabolic effects of androgens in females. Supporting the notion of the liver as a major target organ, male mice with liver-specific inactivation of the AR [hepatic androgen receptor knockout (H-ARKO)] develop diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and dyslipidemia (44). Although the latter study reported no similar phenotype in female H-ARKO, it is conceivable that adjustment of experimental conditions (diet, mouse background) may reveal metabolic disturbances also in female H-ARKO. Androgens may also exert direct AR-dependent effects on adipocyte differentiation and function (45), and hyperinsulinemia and visceral obesity are reported in male mice lacking the AR in adipose tissue (46), although others found no similar phenotypes (47). In the present study, the weights of both visceral and subcutaneous fat depots were increased in ARKO females, whereas the AR agonist reduced the weight of subcutaneous, but not visceral, fat. Androgens may affect adipocyte biology in a depot-specific manner (45), and several factors that differ between the two models (endogenous AR deficiency from embryonic stage vs. exogenous AR stimulation in adulthood, respectively) could potentially explain fat depot specificity. Irrespective of mechanism, this discrepancy may indirectly support a role of AR actions at the adipose tissue level.In agreement with previous results (13), we found unchanged serum estradiol levels in female ARKO mice. Further, uterus weight was unchanged, indicating that peripheral estrogen action is not disturbed in ARKO females. Our finding of increased testosterone levels may suggest involvement of the AR in the feedback regulation of androgen production in females, as shown previously in males (48). The increased testosterone levels are unlikely to contribute to the increased atherosclerosis in the ARKO females; testosterone should have mainly estrogenic effects in the absence of the AR (12), and exogenous testosterone reduces atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient females (28). We also found that the observed difference in atherosclerosis between ARKO and control mice was abolished in ovariectomized mice. This result is consistent with a protective action of endogenous androgens that is mediated via the AR, given that ovariectomy results in complete loss of endogenous androgens in female mice and that estrogen levels were unchanged in ARKO females.The main evidence in support of androgens exerting adverse metabolic effects in women is the fact that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (affecting 6\u201310% of all women) display both hyperandrogenism and an adverse metabolic risk profile with insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and increased atherosclerosis (8\u201310). However, most evidence suggests that insulin resistance is central to the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome and that the androgen excess is secondary to compensatory hyperinsulinemia (49). In line with our present results, several studies also report an association between low androgen levels and atherosclerosis in women (50\u201353). Further, recent clinical studies have reported a U-shaped (54, 55) or an inverse (56, 57) association between androgen levels and cardiometabolic risk, consistent with a protective action by endogenous androgens in women. In comparison, low androgen levels have been associated with both increased atherosclerosis and cardiometabolic risk in men (3, 4).To date, a definition of androgen deficiency in women is lacking (1, 6). Consequently, the symptoms, signs, and clinical outcomes associated with androgen deficiency are not well characterized (1, 6), and the clinical recommendation regarding testosterone supplementation to women is an area of disagreement (7). The results of the present study highlight the need for further studies on the cardiometabolic consequences of androgen deficiency and supplementation in women.In conclusion, we demonstrate that the AR confers protection against diet-induced atherosclerosis in female mice and propose that this is mediated by modulation of body composition and lipid metabolism. Our results provide evidence that physiologic AR-dependent actions of androgens play a central metabolic role in females."}, "28411266": {"pmid": "28411266", "pmcid": "PMC5521864", "title": "Genetic Variation at the Sulfonylurea Receptor, Type 2 Diabetes, and Coronary Heart Disease", "abstract": "\nDespite widespread clinical use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the impact of sulfonylurea therapy on cardiovascular outcomes remains uncertain. Studies of naturally occurring genetic variation can be used to anticipate the expected clinical consequences of a pharmacological therapy. A common missense variant in the gene encoding a component of the sulfonylurea receptor (ABCC8 p.A1369S) promotes closure of the target channel of sulfonylurea therapy and is associated with increased insulin secretion, thus mimicking the effects of sulfonylurea therapy. Using individual-level data from 120,286 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from four large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the impact of this variant on cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. The p.A1369S variant was associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% CI 0.91, 0.95; P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211). The variant was associated with increased BMI (+0.062 kg/m2; 95% CI 0.037, 0.086; P = 8.1 \u00d7 10\u22127) but lower waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, a marker of abdominal fat distribution. Furthermore, p.A1369S was associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 0.99; P = 5.9 \u00d7 10\u22124). These results suggest that, despite a known association with increased weight, long-term sulfonylurea therapy may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.\n", "fulltext": "Sulfonylurea therapy remains a recommended adjunctive therapy to lifestyle modifications and metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes on the basis of low cost and efficacy in improving glycemic control (1,2). However, the impact of sulfonylurea therapy on the risk of coronary heart disease or other cardiovascular outcomes remains uncertain. Sulfonylurea initiation has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events in observational studies, an effect some have attributed to weight gain (3,4). Importantly, owing to approval and marketing many years before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s call in 2008 for rigorous cardiovascular risk assessment of new antidiabetes therapies (5), an adequately powered cardiovascular outcomes trial was never performed.In the absence of gold-standard randomized clinical trial data, studies of naturally occurring genetic variation have emerged as a tool to anticipate clinical consequences of a therapy. For example, a common variant near the HMGCR gene, the target of statins, was associated with decreased LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular event risk but an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (6,7). This finding was borne out in large clinical trials in which statin therapy led to reduced LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular events but an increase in incident type 2 diabetes (8).Sulfonylureas promote insulin release from pancreatic \u03b2-cells via binding to a hetero-octameric complex, with four subunits encoded by the ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 8 gene (ABCC8) and four by the Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily J Member 11 (KCNJ11). The A amino acid allele at p.A1369S in ABCC8 has been associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes (9,10); the reciprocal S amino acid allele consequently lowers risk of type 2 diabetes, promotes closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in vitro (11), and is associated with higher insulin secretion after a glucose load (10), thus mimicking the effects of pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy. Here, we aimed to determine the impact of such genetic variation on cardiometabolic traits and risk of coronary heart disease.We used individual-level data from 120,286 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort (12). We supplemented this individual-level data with summary-level statistics from four genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia examining anthropometric traits, glycemic traits, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease, all predominantly containing individuals of European descent.The ABCC8 p.A1369S variant (rs757110) is inherited as a haplotype with a p.E23K variant (rs5219) in KCNJ11 (the additional subunit composing the ATP-sensitive potassium channel) with individuals inhering the S allele in ABCC8 almost always inheriting the E allele in KCNJ11 (r2 = 0.98 between the two variants in Europeans, and r2 = 1.0 in Africans and East Asians). Because of this coinheritance, genetics studies were unable to determine which of the two variants was causally linked to channel activity (10). However, subsequent in vitro analyses demonstrated the S allele of ABCC8 p.A1369S to be the causal variant in sensitivity to gliclazide and promoting closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (not p.E23K in KCNJ11) (13). Therefore, in our primary analysis, we examined the effect of ABCC8 p.A1369S, a mutation that mimics sulfonylurea therapy, on type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cardiometabolic traits. All traits were plotted in units of standard deviations to facilitate comparisons among traits but were displayed in clinical units for interpretation.Using the UK Biobank cohort, we also examined whether ABCC8 p.A1369S is associated with other cardiovascular disease, including stroke, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease, as well as a composite of these outcomes and coronary heart disease. Last, we conducted a phenome-wide association study for 32 additional diseases in UK Biobank, including endocrine, renal, urological, gastrointestinal, neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and neoplastic disorders.Genotyping and imputation was performed in UK Biobank as previously described (14). Individual-level genetic data were available from 120,286 individuals in UK Biobank, after excluding one related individual of each related pair of individuals, individuals whose genetic sex did not match self-reported sex, and 480 samples with an excess of missing genotype calls or more heterozygosity than expected.Of these individuals, 41,397 were genotyped using the Affymetrix UK Biobank Lung Exome Variant Evaluation (UK BiLEVE) array, and 78,889 were genotyped using the Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom Array. Phasing and imputation were performed centrally, by UK Biobank, using a reference panel combining UK10K and 1000 Genomes samples.The S amino acid of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant (corresponding to the \u201cA\u201d DNA sequence allele of rs757110) has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (9,10). We first sought to independently replicate the association of this variant with type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank. After replication, we used this variant as an instrument to estimate the effect of genetic inhibition of the sulfonylurea receptor on cardiometabolic traits and coronary heart disease.In the UK Biobank, we estimated the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S with each outcome using logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, 10 principal components of ancestry, and a dummy variable for genotyping array. For the summary-level data, this approach is equivalent to the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant with the trait or outcome of interest.For our primary outcome, coronary heart disease, a P value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. For our secondary analysis of cardiometabolic traits, which included eight traits, we set a Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance of P = 0.05/8 = 0.00625 (though this may be conservative for some traits, given the higher prior probability of association in an expected direction). For our phenome-wide association study of 32 phenotypes, we set a level of significance of P = 0.05/32 = 0.0016.Recent evidence suggests that excess abdominal fat increases the risk of coronary heart disease, even after adjustment for BMI (15). As pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy induces weight gain, we sought to examine whether ABCC8 p.A1369S was associated with abdominal fat, which may mediate the weight gain associated with pharmacological therapy. Of 120,286 participants with genotype data available in UK Biobank, 1,296 participants underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Total fat mass and the ratio of abdominal (android) fat mass to peripheral (arm and leg) fat mass were estimated using full-body DEXA. We examined the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant with these three measurements in this subset of 1,296 UK Biobank participants, after adjustment for age, sex, 10 principal components of ancestry, and a dummy variable for array type.Analyses were conducted using R version 3.2. All results are reported relative to the S amino acid allele of ABCC8 p.A1369S (the \u201cA\u201d DNA sequence allele), which promotes closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (13).ABCC8 p.A1369S genotype was available in 120,286 participants of UK Biobank, including 15,593 (13%) homozygous for the allele encoding A/A, 55,612 (46%) with A/S, and 49,081 (41%) with S/S. The mean age was 57 years and 56,936 (47%) participants were men (Supplementary Table 1).As in prior published results (9,10), the S allele at ABCC8 p.A1369S was associated with a lower risk of diabetes in UK Biobank participants (odds ratio [OR] 0.94; 95% CI 0.90, 0.97; P = 0.0015). A meta-analysis of the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) and UK Biobank results showed ABCC8 p.A1369S to be associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes at a genome-wide level of significance (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.91, 0.95; P = 3.0 \u00d7 10\u221211) (Fig. 1).As predicted for a variant that mimics the pharmacological impact of a sulfonylurea, p.A1369S was associated with increased fasting insulin and a decrease in 2-h glucose as assessed via an oral glucose tolerance test (Supplementary Table 2 and Fig. 2). Although each of these associations was nominally significant, neither reached the prespecified Bonferroni-adjusted P value. Beyond glycemic traits, p.A1369S was associated with increased BMI (+0.062 kg/m2; 95% CI 0.037, 0.086; P = 8.1 \u00d7 10\u22127) and hip circumference (+0.095 cm; 95% CI 0.045, 0.15; P = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124) but lower waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI, a marker of abdominal fat distribution (\u22120.00093; 95% CI \u22120.0014, \u22120.00045; P = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124) (Fig. 2). p.A1369S was not associated with unadjusted waist-to-hip ratio (\u22120.00012; 95% CI \u22120.00058, 0.00036; P = 0.64).Individual-level data in the UK Biobank, restricted to 119,913 participants in whom anthropometric data were available, confirmed an increased BMI among those with genotypes encoding the A/S or S/S genotypes (P for trend = 0.0075). Despite this increased overall BMI, these genotypes were associated with decreased central adiposity as assessed by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (P for trend = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22124) (Table 1). Direct imaging assessment of body fat mass using DEXA scanning was available in a subset of 1,296 participants. The S allele p.A1369S did not relate to total fat mass but was nominally associated with a reduced ratio of android (abdominal) to peripheral fat mass, a direct measurement of abdominal fat distribution (P = 0.039) (Table 1).Overall, the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant was associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96, 0.99; P = 5.9 \u00d7 10\u22124) (Fig. 1) and a reduced risk of a composite cardiovascular disease phenotype (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96, 0.99; P = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124) (Fig. 3). Although the associations of p.A1369S with stroke, heart failure, or peripheral vascular disease did not reach statistical significance, effects were directionally consistent with protection without evidence for significant heterogeneity across phenotypes (P heterogeneity = 0.74) (Fig. 3). In a phenome-wide association study in UK Biobank, ABCC8 p.A1369S was not associated with 32 other diseases, including other endocrine disorders and cancer (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3).The ABCC8 p.A1369S missense variant is common in the population and is known to mimic the pharmacological impact of sulfonylurea therapy. We confirm and extend previous observations of a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and elevated BMI among individual carriers of the S allele, consistent with the effects of pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy (16). Furthermore, we demonstrate that, despite an increased BMI, carriers of the S amino acid have a more favorable body fat distribution and are protected from coronary heart disease.These results permit several conclusions. First, these results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of the sulfonylurea receptor may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease more broadly over the long term. Each copy of the S allele at ABCC8 p.A1369S was associated with a 6.9% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a 2.4% lower risk of coronary heart disease, and a 2.5% lower risk of cardiovascular disease. This cardioprotective effect was noted despite an association with increased BMI and may relate to improved glycemic profile, a more favorable body fat distribution (15), or other pathways that could not be characterized in this study. The magnitude of association of the p.A1369S variant in ABCC8 with coronary heart disease (OR 0.96 per 10% reduction in risk of diabetes) is similar to a similar recent report involving a missense variant in the gene encoding GLP1R (OR 0.95 per 10% reduction in risk of diabetes) (17). This suggestion of cardioprotection derived from a genetic study was confirmed in subsequently completed cardiovascular outcome trials involving the GLP-1 analogs liraglutide and semaglutide (18,19). Although currently available clinical trial data for sulfonylurea therapy are underpowered to determine impact on cardiovascular outcomes (20), we provide evidence that pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy may similarly lead to cardiovascular benefit.The expected magnitude of cardioprotection afforded by sulfonylurea therapy can be modeled based on previous clinical trial data. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) trial, pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy reduced the risk of an HbA1c >7% at 3 years by 33% (16). Standardizing the genetic estimates observed in this study to a 33% reduction in risk of diabetes, these results would suggest that pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy would increase BMI by 0.34 kg/m2 but reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 13%. The 13% predicted reduction in risk of coronary heart disease with sulfonylurea therapy is identical to the 13% reduction in risk of coronary heart disease observed in a recent trial of liraglutide (18).A genetic predisposition to decreased risk of type 2 diabetes is known to associate with protection from coronary heart disease as well (21). In order to determine whether the magnitude of impact of p.A1369S in ABCC8 with coronary heart disease could be fully explained by its effect of type 2 diabetes, we compared the observed effect to that previously noted in a study of 26 type 2 diabetes genetic variants free of pleiotropy (21). In this study, a 33% lower risk of diabetes is associated with a 4% lower risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.98, 0.94). By contrast, for the p.A1369S variant, a 33% lower risk of diabetes is associated with a 13% lower risk of coronary heart disease (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.81, 0.94; P interaction = 0.03). This indicates that degree of risk reduction for the p.A1369S variant on coronary heart disease exceeds that which would be predicted based on the average impact of type 2 diabetes associated variant at other genetic loci.Second, these results highlight the potential importance of examining body fat distribution in addition to BMI as measurements of adiposity. As expected based on clinical experience with pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy (4), the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant was associated with increased BMI. However, estimates based both on anthropometric assessment and direct quantification using DEXA imaging suggest that the variant is associated with reduced abdominal adiposity. Although the impact on improved body fat distribution was modest, it may account for a portion of the reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, these genetic results suggest that therapies that increase BMI may not increase coronary heart disease risk if weight gain is mediated by fat accumulation in peripheral tissues (22).This study has several limitations. First, these results are based on the lifelong impact of a constitutive genetic variant within the sulfonylurea receptor. However, pharmacological therapy with sulfonylurea is initiated later in life and leads to more dramatic inhibition of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and upregulation of insulin secretion. As such, our genetic modeling approach may not have fully captured adverse on-target effects of sulfonylurea therapy, such as hypoglycemia, or other off-target effects. Second, our estimates of the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant with cardiometabolic traits and coronary heart disease were derived in the general population; the association of the ABCC8 p.A1369S variant with traits and coronary heart disease among individuals with type 2 diabetes (in whom pharmacological sulfonylurea therapy is currently implemented) may differ. Third, the associations of ABCC8 p.A1369S with stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure remained underpowered to detect statistically significant associations. Finally, the majority of participants in the UK Biobank and included GWAS consortia were of European ancestry; future analyses will seek to validate these observations in other ethnicities as genetic data becomes available.In conclusion, genetic variation mimicking the impact of sulfonylurea therapy is associated with reduced risk of both type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease."}, "27999109": {"pmid": "27999109", "pmcid": "PMC5204313", "title": "A Critical Role for the Type I Interferon Receptor in Virus-Induced Autoimmune Diabetes in Rats", "abstract": "\nThe pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes, characterized by immune-mediated damage of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells of pancreatic islets, may involve viral infection. Essential components of the innate immune antiviral response, including type I interferon (IFN) and IFN receptor\u2013mediated signaling pathways, are candidates for determining susceptibility to human type 1 diabetes. Numerous aspects of human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis are recapitulated in the LEW.1WR1 rat model. Diabetes can be induced in LEW.1WR1 weanling rats challenged with virus or with the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). We hypothesized that disrupting the cognate type I IFN receptor (type I IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor [IFNAR]) to interrupt IFN signaling would prevent or delay the development of virus-induced diabetes. We generated IFNAR1 subunit\u2013deficient LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u2013associated protein 9) genome editing and confirmed functional disruption of the Ifnar1 gene. IFNAR1 deficiency significantly delayed the onset and frequency of diabetes and greatly reduced the intensity of insulitis after poly I:C treatment. The occurrence of Kilham rat virus\u2013induced diabetes was also diminished in IFNAR1-deficient animals. These findings firmly establish that alterations in innate immunity influence the course of autoimmune diabetes and support the use of targeted strategies to limit or prevent the development of type 1 diabetes.\n", "fulltext": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T-cell\u2013mediated autoimmune disease that destroys insulin-producing pancreatic \u03b2-cells (1). It is heritable but non-Mendelian, and genetic susceptibility loci are insufficient for predicting diabetes onset; most people with risk alleles never become diabetic (2). Interaction of genes with environmental factors has been invoked as a determinant of disease (3,4). Viral infection, particularly with enterovirus, is believed to be a key environmental modulator of T1D, and its possible role in pathogenesis has been reviewed in detail (5,6). The mechanisms that underlie viral triggering of T1D remain unclear; \u03b2-cell infection, bystander activation, antigenic spreading, and molecular mimicry have been proposed. Alternatively, viruses could prevent T1D through immunoregulation or induction of protective immunity (7).To gain better insight into the mechanism of virus-induced diabetes, we used a rat model of the disease. Rats are the only naturally occurring virus-induced T1D model that closely resembles that of human T1D in terms of histopathology, pathogenesis, lack of sex bias, and MHC class II association (8). Type 1\u2013like autoimmune diabetes, both spontaneous and inducible, is relatively common among inbred rat strains, which, like humans, express a high-risk class II MHC haplotype; in rats, this is designated RT1B/Du. Among susceptible rat strains, the LEW.1WR1 strain has been particularly useful. About 2.5% of LEW.1WR1 rats develop T1D spontaneously, typically during their early reproductive years; both sexes are affected, and islets show insulitis (9). Various perturbations of the immune system, however, can efficiently trigger autoimmune diabetes in up to 100% of animals. Perturbants include regulatory T-cell (Treg) depletion, innate immune activation with thrice-weekly doses of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), and infection with Kilham rat virus (KRV) or rat cytomegalovirus. LEW.1WR1 rats also develop diabetes at an increased rate (18%) after Coxsackie B serotype 4 (CVB4) infection, but only if pretreated with a low dose of poly I:C daily for 3 days before viral challenge (10). Of note, weanling but not adult LEW.1WR1 rats are prone to diabetes after any viral challenge, making these animals a faithful model of the generally juvenile aspect of T1D.After poly I:C challenge or during viral infection, a cascade of cytokines, including type I interferon (IFN) (i.e., IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 [Supplementary Fig. 1]), could contribute to the induction of diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have established associations between the risk for human T1D and polymorphisms in genes that mediate type I IFN responses, including IFIH1 (11,12), Ebi2 (13), and Tyk2 (14\u201316). Thus, we aimed to define the role of type I IFN on the development of autoimmune diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats by disrupting the IFNAR1 subunit of the type I IFN receptor complex, a key component of IFN signaling. The generation of knockout rats has previously been challenging, but advances in zinc finger nuclease gene targeting (17) and, more recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\u2013associated protein 9 (Cas9) technology (18) have made this feasible. We generated Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and challenged weanling wild type (WT) and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats with either poly I:C or KRV and assessed for the development of diabetes. We found that IFNAR1 deficiency protects against diabetes.LEW.1WR1 rats (RT1B/Du) were from Biomere (Worcester, MA). They develop spontaneous diabetes at a rate of \u223c2.5% (9), but treatment with poly I:C (9) or infection with viruses from several families (10) increases the frequency of diabetes to 30\u2013100%. Animals were housed in viral antibody\u2013free conditions, confirmed monthly to be serologically free of rat pathogens (19), and maintained in accordance with institutional and national guidelines (20).An Ifnar1 target region in exon 4, encoding the IFN-binding domain, was disrupted in the genome of the LEW.1WR1 rat using the CRISPR-Cas9 method. The IFNAR1ex4_guide RNA (gRNA) 2 target site (AGGAGAGATGTAGACTA|GTATGG) includes an overlapping SpeI restriction site. The IFNAR1ex4_gRNA3 target site (TCAATTACACGATACGG|ATCTGG) includes an overlapping XhoII restriction site. Note that for both target sites, the cleavage site is indicated with a vertical line and the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence is underlined. To confirm high activity of the single guide RNA (sgRNA)/Cas9 nucleases before embryo injection, the guide sequences were cloned into plasmid pX330 (Plasmid #42230; Addgene, Cambridge, MA) (21), using the following primers:IFNAR1ex4_gRNA2_F 5\u2032-gtggaaaggacgaaacaccgAGGAGAGATGTAGACTAGTA-3\u2032IFNAR1ex4_gRNA3_F 5\u2032-gtggaaaggacgaaacaccgTCAATTACACGATACGGATC-3\u2032IFNAR1ex4_gRNA2_R 5\u2032-ctatttctagctctaaaacTACTAGTCTACATCTCTCCT-3\u2032IFNAR1ex4_gRNA3_R 5\u2032-ctatttctagctctaaaacGATCCGTATCGTGTAATTGA-3\u2032The full target sites, including PAM sequence, were cloned into the nuclease reporter plasmid M427 (provided by M.

Nuclease activity was confirmed by examining green fluorescent protein\u2013positive cells after cotransfection into 293T cells with the corresponding nuclease plasmid or with a negative control.Capped and tailed Cas9 mRNA was prepared using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and gRNA was prepared using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) as previously described (23). Linear DNA templates for Cas9 mRNA synthesis and sgRNA synthesis through T7 RNA polymerase were prepared by PCR using the pX330 sgRNA plasmids and the following oligonucleotides:Cas9T7_F 5\u2032-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGGACTATAAGGACCACGAC-3\u2032Cas9T7_R 5\u2032-GCGAGCTCTAGGAATTCTTAC-3\u2032IFNAR1ex4_gRNA2_vT7F 5\u2032-ttaatacgactcactataggAGGAGAGATGTAGACTAGTA-3\u2032IFNAR1ex4_gRNA3_vT7F 5\u2032-ttaatacgactcactataggTCAATTACACGATACGGATC-3\u2032gRNA_RsEq 5\u2032-AAAAAAgcaccgactcggtgccac-3\u2032Two independent in vitro\u2013transcribed sgRNAs (50 ng) were coinjected with Cas9 mRNA (50 ng) in 0.5-day-old LEW.1WR1 single-cell embryos by intracytoplasmic microinjection to create site-specific DNA double-strand breaks, thereby stimulating targeted gene disruptions. After injection, LEW.1WR1 embryos were transferred into pseudopregnant Sprague Dawley female rats. Embryonic injections and transfers were performed at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Medical School Transgenic Animal Modeling Core facility. Genomic DNA was isolated from tail samples. The genotypes of individual pups (i.e., presence of insertions/deletions [indels]) were determined by PCR, restriction enzyme digests, and sequencing (Macrogen, Rockville, MD).Of nine rats born, five founder animals that contained monoallelic or biallelic mutations in Ifnar1 were identified by nuclease screening and used for further breeding (Fig. 1B) to establish two distinct homozygous lines, designated IFNAR1\u039481 and IFNAR1\u039481+4, that were based on the indels present. Total RNA was extracted from heart and brain samples of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)\u2013infected rats 2 days postinfection using TRIzol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For RT-PCR analysis, primers targeting a 574-base pair (bp) region between exons 2 and 5 of the Ifnar1 gene (IFNAR1-F [5\u2032-CCGTAGCCTCAGGTGAAGAC-3\u2032] and IFNAR1-R [5\u2032-GCTGTGTCTCTGAAGCGATG-3\u2032]) were designed using Primer-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast). As a control, primers targeting a 543-bp region between exons 1 and 5 were designed for the Ifnar2 gene (IFNAR2-F [5\u2032-AAGCCCAGAACAGGGGAAAC-3\u2032] and IFNAR2-R [5\u2032-CCAACCACTCGTCAGTCACA-3\u2032]). The reference cDNA sequences used for rat Ifnar1 and Ifnar2 are NM_001105893.1 and XM_006248107.2, respectively. A 50-\u03bcL PCR master mix comprising HotStartTaq Master Mix (QIAGEN), nuclease-free water, forward and reverse primers (0.2 \u03bcmol/L each), and cDNA (2 \u03bcL per reaction) was prepared. For PCR cycling conditions, initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min was followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 40 s, 59\u00b0C for 45 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Amplified products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide under ultraviolet illumination after electrophoresis.Spleens were isolated from rats of either sex and immediately washed with PBS (Corning, Manassas, VA) and then minced and passed through a 40-\u03bcm sterile nylon mesh with a 3-mL rubber syringe plunger. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 7 min at room temperature. After removal of erythrocytes, the splenocytes were washed once with PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in appropriate volumes of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, counted, and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/well. Cultured splenocytes were stimulated with 1,000 units/mL of recombinant rat IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b1 (PBL Assay Science, Piscataway, NJ) for 18 h, then cell lysates were harvested for total RNA preparation using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN).cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Gene expression was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) with the QuantiTect Primer Assay (Rn_Isg15_1_SG, Rn_Oas1a_1_SG) for interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 and OAS1a. Expression levels were normalized to GusB (Rn_GusB_1_SG QuantiTect Primer Assay). The QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN) was used for real-time PCR amplification according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol on a Mastercycler ep realplex (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY).To determine splenic KRV transcript levels, total RNA was extracted from spleens of KRV-infected WT and IFNAR1\u039481 rats. cDNA was synthesized by using 1 \u03bcg of total RNA followed by RT-qPCR as described above. We used previously published primers (24) with the following sequences: forward primer 5\u2032-GGAAACGCTTACTCCGATGA-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-AACCGATGTCCTTCCCATTT-3\u2032. The expression levels of viral transcripts were normalized to GusB.All real-time PCR reactions were run in duplicate, including a no-template control reaction. Fold changes in gene expression of test and control samples were determined by using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.Studies of induced diabetes were performed in WT LEW.1WR1 and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 LEW.1WR1 rats (backcrossed \u2265 F5) using two different perturbants known to trigger autoimmunity in WT animals and one not previously tested. High-molecular-weight poly I:C (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) was administered to rats of either sex at 21\u201325 days of age by using a dose of 1 \u03bcg/g body weight by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection three times weekly for 3 weeks as previously described (9). Rats were monitored for a total of 39 days after the first injection with poly I:C, defined as day 0. Spleens, pancreata, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs), and sera were collected at day 4 from age-matched animals injected on days 0 and 2 with either saline or poly I:C in one experiment.In a second set of experiments, weanling WT and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats 21\u201325 days of age were infected with a single i.p. dose of KRV-UMass strain (1 \u00d7 107 plaque-forming units [PFU]) on day 0 and monitored for a total of 39 days for diabetes. KRV was prepared as previously described (25). Spleens, pancreata, PLNs, and sera were collected from age-matched uninfected (i.e., injected with culture media) or KRV-infected animals at day 5 postinoculation in one experiment.In a third set of experiments, weanling WT LEW.1WR1 rats were infected with a single dose of 1 \u00d7 107 PFU of EMCV (ATCC strain VR-129 propagated in BHK-21 cells) by i.p. injection on day 0 and monitored for diabetes for a total of 40 days. EMCV has not been previously tested in the LEW.1WR1 rat model. In one experiment, adult WT and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 LEW.1WR1 rats were infected with 1 \u00d7 107 PFU of EMCV i.p. and monitored for 14 days. Rats were euthanized if they exhibited gross signs of illness (e.g., ruffling, hunching). Some adult WT and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats were euthanized 48 h after infection with 1 \u00d7 107 PFUs of EMCV, and serum and select organs were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until used for quantifying viral titers.Blood glucose concentrations were measured at least three times weekly with a glucometer (Breeze2; Bayer, Carlsbad, CA). Rats were diagnosed as diabetic when the blood glucose concentration exceeded 250 mg/dL on 2 consecutive days.EMCV was measured in rat serum and organs based on previously published methods (26).A ProcartaPlex kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to measure cytokines and chemokines (CCL2, interleukin 1\u03b2 [IL-1\u03b2], CCL5, CXCL10) in rat samples. Insulin was measured in serum samples by using an ultrasensitive insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO, Salem, NH).After the diagnosis of diabetes or at the conclusion of an experiment, rats were euthanized, and pancreata were removed and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Paraffin-embedded sections of pancreas were sectioned and prepared for light microscopy in the UMass Medical School Morphology Core laboratory (www.umassmed.edu/morphology/protocols). Sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) were scored for insulitis as previously described (9) by an experienced reader (J.P.M.) who was not aware of the animal\u2019s glycemic status. Intensity of insulitis was scored as follows: 0, no inflammatory mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration; 1+, small numbers of infiltrating MNCs with preservation of islet architecture; 2+, moderate infiltrating MNCs with preservation of architecture; 3+, many MNCs, with most islets affected and distortion of islet architecture; 4+, florid infiltration and distorted islet architecture or end-stage islets with or without residual inflammation. Histology images in Fig. 3 were adjusted for clarity by setting the white point for each image using Adobe Photoshop CS6.Statistical procedures were carried out with either GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) or SPSS version 19 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) software. Survival and disease-free survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methodology; equality of survival distributions was tested by the log-rank statistic (27). Parametric data are given as arithmetic means \u00b1 1 SD or \u00b1 SE as indicated in the figure legends and Table 1. Fisher exact test was used to analyze 2 \u00d7 2 tables, and the \u03c72 test was used for larger tables. For comparisons of three or more means, we used one-way and two-way ANOVAs and either Bonferroni correction or the least significant differences procedure for posteriori contrasts (27). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.We induced mutations in rat Ifnar1 using a CRISPR-Cas9 strategy. Two sgRNAs were designed to target exon 4 of rat Ifnar1, which, together with exon 5, encodes an IFN-binding domain (Fig. 1A). The sgRNAs were coinjected with Cas9 mRNA into single-cell LEW.1WR1 rat embryos. We assayed Ifnar1 somatic mutations in F0 pups and identified either deletions spanning the region between the two sgRNA/Cas9 target sites (Fig. 1B, lower bands) or small indels at the individual target sites (data not shown). Two lines with germline mutations due to error-prone nonhomologous end joining repair were established and designated IFNAR1\u039481 and IFNAR1\u039481+4, and confirmed by sequencing rat genomic DNA from F0 founder, F1 heterozygous, and F2 homozygous animals. Sequences of IFNAR1\u039481 and IFNAR1\u039481+4 F2 homozygous animals are shown in Fig. 1C. PCR on cDNA using primers spanning exons 2\u20135 of Ifnar1 yielded the appropriate-sized product in WT rats but truncated products in IFNAR1\u039481 and IFNAR1\u039481+4 rats (Fig. 1D, left panel). Sequence analysis of Ifnar1 PCR products confirmed that the amplicons contained the predicted mutations (data not shown). In contrast, PCR analysis of Ifnar2 cDNA, which was not targeted, revealed the expected products for WT and both IFNAR1 rat lines for a region spanning exons 1\u20135 (Fig. 1D, right panel).We tested several commercially available antibodies against rat IFNAR1 but were unable to validate their target specificity. Therefore, we confirmed the IFNAR1 deficiency phenotype of our mutant rats using two approaches. First, we isolated splenocytes from WT IFNAR1\u039481+4 rats and IFNAR1\u039481 rats and challenged them in vitro with either recombinant rat IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b1. At 18 h postchallenge with IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b1, robust induction of Isg15 was present with WT but not with IFNAR1\u039481+4 and IFNAR1\u039481 splenocytes (Fig. 2A). A second ISG, Oas1a, was similarly induced by IFN-\u03b2 in WT but not IFNAR1-deficient rat splenocytes. The inability to respond to recombinant type I IFNs indicates that the cognate type I IFN receptor was lacking in the Ifnar1-targeted rats.Second, we examined rat survival after challenge with EMCV, which has been shown to induce type I IFN by engaging the IFIH1-encoded melanoma differentiation\u2013associated protein 5 (MDA5) (28,29). Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 mice are highly susceptible to EMCV infection compared with control mice (28,30). In addition, viral titers in Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 mice are much higher than in controls after challenge with viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and Semliki Forest virus (30,31). Thus, we expected that rats lacking IFNAR1 would have a heightened susceptibility to EMCV. After EMCV challenge, all WT adult rats survived >14 days postinfection without exhibiting signs of disease. In contrast, 100% of IFNAR1\u039481+4 rats and 80% of IFNAR1\u039481 rats died by 4\u20135 days postinfection (P = 0.0013 and 0.0070, respectively) (Fig. 2B). Serum and heart from IFNAR1-targeted rats also showed high viral titers compared with WT rats 48 h after inoculation with EMCV (Fig. 2C and D), indicating that the type I IFN response is impaired in these rats. The consistent findings between the two IFNAR1-targeted lines suggest that off-target effects from the CRISPR-Cas9 editing are unlikely. From this point on, we considered the two lines equivalent and henceforth term these Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats.In mice, only certain strains of EMCV are diabetogenic (32), whereas EMCV pathogenesis in rats has been only partly characterized (33). Therefore, we challenged weanling WT LEW.1WR1 rats (n = 7) with 1 \u00d7 107 PFU EMCV and monitored for diabetes for 40 days. None of the rats became diabetic over the course of the experiment (data not shown).Previous studies established that spontaneous diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats occurs with a cumulative frequency of \u223c2.5%, but administration of poly I:C to weanling rats leads to diabetes in 100% of rats (9). We challenged WT and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats with poly I:C and monitored them for diabetes. Poly I:C administration resulted in diabetes in 13 of 15 (87%) WT rats by 23 days after the first dose (Fig. 3A). In contrast, only 2 of 11 (18%) Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats became diabetic and not until day 28 at the earliest. This difference was highly significant (P < 0.0001). Of note, the difference between WT and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats was statistically significant regardless of whether the rats were of IFNAR1\u039481+4 or IFNAR1\u039481 lineage (Supplementary Fig. 2), again indicating that protection from diabetes is not simply because of an off-target effect.For poly I:C experiments, animals were euthanized at the time of diabetes or at the end of the study, and serial sections of pancreas were stained for H-E, insulin, and glucagon. Histopathological analysis revealed that insulitis was more severe in diabetic WT animals after poly I:C treatment compared with nondiabetic animals. Islet pathology for all WT animals was associated with a mean insulitis score of 3.11 \u00b1 0.45 (Table 1). End-stage insulitis was present in diabetic WT animals, which was associated with distorted islet architecture, shrunken size, and presence of few residual infiltrating lymphocytes (Fig. 3B). Moderate insulitis was present (2+) in one WT animal that was normoglycemic at the end of the study (Fig. 3B); other WT normoglycemic animals had no evidence of insulitis. In contrast, all normoglycemic Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats were completely free of insulitis, with normal islet size and structure (Fig. 3B). However, insulitis was observed in the two Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats that were diabetic. The mean insulitis score was 0.64 \u00b1 0.43 among all poly I:C\u2013treated Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 animals (Table 1). The overall concordance between the diabetes phenotype and insulitis scores agrees with our previous findings (34).Immunohistochemical staining on samples from all WT animals revealed abundant glucagon-positive cells, with a marked decrease in insulin-positive cells in diabetic WT rats and moderate loss of insulin-positive cells in normoglycemic poly I:C\u2013treated WT animals (Fig. 3B). Both insulin and glucagon were abundant in islets of all normoglycemic poly l:C\u2013treated Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 animals, with some loss of insulin-positive cells only in the small number of Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 diabetic animals (Fig. 3B). Insulin was measured in all available terminal serum samples; Table 1 shows the mean serum insulin values for WT versus Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats regardless of diabetes status. Overall, WT rats had significantly lower levels of terminal serum insulin compared with Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats, as anticipated.We assessed cytokines and chemokines in organs harvested from WT and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 animals 4 days after the administration of poly I:C (or saline control). CXCL10 and CCL5, whose expression is mediated by IFN, were significantly decreased in spleens from poly I:C\u2013challenged Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats compared with poly I:C\u2013challenged WT rats (Fig. 3C). In contrast, differences were not observed in IL-1\u03b2 or CCL2 in spleens of WT versus Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats after poly I:C challenge (Fig. 3C). Cytokines and chemokines were also measured in total pancreata, PLNs, and sera. Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats challenged with poly I:C had decreased levels of CXCL10, CCL5, and CCL2 in pancreata as well as decreased CXCL10 in sera compared with poly I:C\u2013challenged WT rats (Supplementary Fig. 3A).KRV infection induces autoimmune diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats (10). We conducted KRV infection studies with weanling Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats with two goals: 1) to establish whether rats deficient in IFNAR1 could survive infection with this parvovirus and 2) to see whether the frequency of diabetes would be reduced compared with WT rats. Diabetes was observed in 3 of 16 (19%) Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats infected with KRV and monitored over a 40-day period (Fig. 4A). No other morbidities occurred in these animals over the course of the study. Thus, although Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats succumbed to EMCV infection, they tolerated and survived KRV infection. Nine of 17 (53%) WT rats became diabetic after infection with KRV (Fig. 4A), a rate consistent with that previously reported in KRV-infected LEW.1WR1 rats (10). The difference in the frequency of diabetes in WT versus Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats was statistically significant (P = 0.0461), indicating that the absence of IFNAR1 is partially protective against KRV-induced diabetes. Pancreatic sections from all the normoglycemic KRV-infected Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats at the end of the study showed the complete absence of insulitis, whereas all diabetic rats, whether WT or IFNAR1 deficient, had classical end-stage insulitis (data not shown).KRV has been reported to be present in spleens of LEW.1WR1 rats after infection by the i.p. route (35). To establish whether IFNAR1 deficiency results in altered cytokine responses after KRV challenge, we measured select cytokines and chemokines in spleens collected from weanling rats that were uninfected or 5 days after KRV infection. CXCL10 and CCL5 were each significantly decreased in spleens from KRV-infected Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats compared with KRV-infected WT rats (Fig. 4B), illustrating an overall diminished type I IFN\u2013driven response in splenic cells after KRV infection in Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats. Of note, levels of IL-1\u03b2 and CCL2 were significantly higher in KRV-infected Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rat spleens compared with KRV-infected WT rat spleens (Fig. 4B). We measured KRV transcript levels in these WT and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rat spleens to determine whether viral replication was altered in the absence of functional IFNAR. Although viral transcript levels were slightly (approximately twofold) higher in Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rat spleens compared with WT, the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 4C). Total pancreatic, PLN, and serum cytokines and chemokines were also measured from these animals, but only limited differences were observed between KRV-infected WT and Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats (Supplementary Fig. 3B).Collectively, these data underscore the importance of type I IFN-mediated signaling for the development of autoimmune diabetes. The role of IFN signaling has been implicated in the initiation of islet autoimmunity and development of T1D (36). A strong IFN gene signature was identified in the peripheral blood of at-risk children before initiation of islet autoimmunity (37,38). The current findings in Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 LEW.1WR1 rats firmly define a role for type I IFN and downstream signaling pathways in poly I:C\u2013 and KRV-induced diabetes in the rat model and agree with a previous study in which anti-IFN-\u03b1 antibody administration to T1D-prone BB rats resulted in a trend toward a later onset of poly I:C\u2013induced diabetes (39). They also support human GWAS findings for human T1D risk associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes such as IFIH1 that participate in IFN-regulated pathways. Specifically, a nonsynonymous SNP in IFIH1 resulting in an amino acid change of alanine to threonine at 946 (A946T) of MDA5 is associated with an increased risk of diabetes (11). MDA5 recognizes cytoplasmic long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates generated during the replication cycle of CVB or intracellularly delivered synthetic dsRNA analog poly I:C, leading to potent IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction (40). Funabiki et al. (41) characterized a constitutively active form of MDA5 caused by the amino acid mutation G821S that results in type I IFN hyperexpression and causes lupus-like nephritis; they also similarly associated hyperexpression of type I IFN with A946T . The resulting increase in IFN is associated with severe autoimmune disease.In contrast, four rare-variant nonsynonymous SNPs in IFIH1 were found to be protective against T1D in GWAS (12); at least two of these variants, E627X and I923V, are predicted to decrease MDA5 function with loss of type I IFN responses after viral challenge (42). Recent data have also shown that NOD mice heterozygous for MDA5 were protected from T1D when infected with CVB4; this protective effect was attributed to a unique type I IFN signature that led to expansion of Tregs at the site of autoimmunity (43). Similarly, Ebi2, a regulator of the interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)\u2013driven inflammatory network (IDIN), including human IFIH1 (13), was associated with an increased risk of T1D; the specific Ebi2 polymorphism is associated with increased expression of IDIN genes (13). Finally, the human Tyk2 gene, which was mapped to the possible T1D susceptibility locus (15), encodes the IFNAR1-associated molecule tyrosine kinase 2, and its deficiency results in a reduced antiviral response (14). These data support the critical contribution of IFN-regulated pathways in the development of T1D following environmental insult.Rat models are particularly useful for understanding the pathogenesis of T1D, specifically in defining the roles of genetic and environmental factors, including viral infection. The mechanism by which KRV induces diabetes in rats has been partially dissected and involves both innate and adaptive immune responses (8). KRV infection of LEW.1WR1 rat primary islets and splenic cells reportedly activates the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 signaling pathway, leading to the activation of two major transcription factors, IRF7 and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) through the adaptor protein MyD88 (35,44). Treg depletion synergizes with KRV to induce diabetes (45). In our studies, the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)\u2013regulated chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10 are decreased in spleens of KRV-infected Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 rats, whereas NF-\u03baB\u2013driven IL-1\u03b2 and CCL2 are significantly increased (Fig. 4B), confirming roles for both IRF7 and NF-\u03baB in KRV infection. Of importance, IL-1\u03b2 is an inflammatory cytokine that has long been implicated in the development of T1D (46,47). The robust IL-1\u03b2 induction suggests that IL-1\u03b2 may not be a major contributor in the early stages of diabetes in this model. Of note, loss of IFNAR1 does not affect the overall survival of KRV-infected rats in the manner that it affects survival of EMCV-infected rats. Type I IFN production is elicited by several pathways in the infected host, depending on the specific virus, and each virus may have a unique means of antagonizing or evading the IFN response. For example, a murine parvovirus has been shown to efficiently evade host type I IFN (48), so rodent parvoviruses may possess unique mechanisms to counteract IFN-induced antiviral effectors. Although the impact of type I IFN on KRV replication is not completely defined, ISGs are induced during KRV infection and could contribute to autoimmunity.Figure 5 provides an overview of IFN signaling pathways in virus-induced diabetes in the context of this study as well as others (49,50). Viral nucleic acid structures are recognized by pattern recognition receptors, including MDA5 and TLR3, after viral infection of \u03b2-cells, leading to the activation of the key transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB (51), which is followed by induction of the transcription and synthesis of IFN-\u03b2, a subset of ISGs (40), and inflammatory cytokines; the magnitude of these responses may depend on the genetic susceptibility of the host. IFN-\u03b2 binds to the type I IFN receptor and exerts its antiviral effects through the trimolecular ISGF3 (IFN-stimulated gene factor 3) complex STAT1-STAT2-IRF9, which binds to the ISRE and induces the expression of ISGs for the recruitment of immune cells (e.g., lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells), leading to insulitis and diabetes. Type I IFNs also affect \u03b2-cell survival during infections with viruses linked to human T1D (49). We show that the absence of functional IFNAR tempers the onset of diabetes.We found the incidence of diabetes in our WT LEW.1WR1 rats to be comparable to previously published reports: 38% for KRV (10) and close to 100% for poly I:C (9). Of note, IFNAR1 deficiency results in an incidence of diabetes of \u223c18%, regardless of whether the trigger is poly I:C or KRV. This suggests a common mechanism of diabetes and insulitis in IFNAR1 deficiency. The mechanism behind diabetes during IFNAR1 deficiency remains undefined but may relate to IFN production that precedes IFNAR1 signaling events or that may depend on TLR-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB [TLR9 for KRV (44); TLR3 for poly I:C (52)] with subsequent T-cell recruitment. Virus-induced diabetes that occurs independently of the IFNAR1 pathway can be further explored in the rat model and, perhaps, eventually defined through generation of double-knockout rat lines. We have already dissected important genetic factors in virus-induced diabetes in rats. The genome-encoded T-cell receptor element V\u03b213 controls genetic susceptibility to diabetes (53); depletion of V\u03b213+ T cells prevents poly I:C\u2013induced diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats (54). Additional genetic studies define diubiquitin as a susceptibility gene for virus-induced diabetes in rats (55). With continued advancements in genomics and in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we anticipate exciting developments in autoimmune diabetes in the near future through rat models of diabetes.In summary, these data advance our understanding of how innate immunity influences the development of T1D. These studies help us to better understand why certain individuals with specific polymorphisms in IFIH1 are either predisposed to or protected from T1D. Viral infection and innate immune activation may initiate early events in \u03b2-cells and/or immune cells that ultimately lead to autoimmune attack and T1D in genetically susceptible individuals. In the long term, findings from these studies could be transitioned to diabetes models involving human islets and human immune cells (56) in which type I IFN pathways are disrupted. The current data reinforce the need for novel approaches to diabetes prevention and treatment, such as viral vaccine development (57,58) or even cytokine-modulating therapies."}, "28151486": {"pmid": "28151486", "pmcid": "PMC5386448", "title": "Star-PAP, a poly(A) polymerase, functions as a tumor suppressor in an orthotopic human breast cancer model", "abstract": "\nStar-PAP is a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase and required for the expression of a select set of mRNAs.

Ectopic Star-PAP expression inhibited proliferation as well as colony-forming ability of breast cancer cells. In breast cancer patients, high levels of Star-PAP correlated with an improved prognosis. Moreover, by regulating the expression of BIK (BCL2-interacting killer), Star-PAP induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway.

Furthermore, Star-PAP sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs both in vitro and in vivo.

These findings suggested that Star-PAP possesses tumor-suppressing activity and can be a valuable target for developing new cancer therapeutic strategies.\n", "fulltext": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with an estimated 1\u2009676\u2009600 new cases and 521\u2009900 deaths according to GLOBOCAN 2012.1 Cancer cells, including breast cancer cells, usually manifest aberrant gene expression that leads to malignancy, such as sustaining proliferation, metastasis and evasion of apoptosis.2 Identification of the deregulated gene expression may advance the understanding of cancer pathogenesis and provide insights into potential new therapeutic strategies. Recent advances reveal mRNA 3\u2032end processing as a highly regulated process and an important mechanism for posttranscriptional gene expression.3 This process controls stability, translocation and translation of mRNAs and plays a critical role in human physiology and pathology, including cancer.4 Star-PAP, a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase encoding by gene TUT1, is a component of the 3\u2032end processing complex required for a subset of pre-mRNAs.5, 6, 7 Star-PAP regulates the expression of target genes involved in various cellular processes, such as oxidative response and apoptosis, through processing their mRNAs.8, 9, 10 However, the physiological and pathological roles of Star-PAP largely remain unknown. Recently, it was reported that Star-PAP inhibits the lipogenesis and thus the cell proliferation in osteosarcoma cells in vitro.11 However, the functional role of Star-PAP in cancer development and treatment is unclear. Given the clues above, the function of Star-PAP in human breast cancer was investigated in this study. We observed that breast cancer manifests a downregulated expression of Star-PAP. Ectopic expression of Star-PAP inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells, and Star-PAP induced the mitochondrial apoptosis through regulating the expression of BIK (BCL2-interacting killer). Moreover, Star-PAP relieved breast cancer progression in vivo and sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. This study indicated that Star-PAP has a potential tumor-suppressing function in breast cancer and can be a valuable molecular target for breast cancer therapy and prevention. To investigate whether Star-PAP involves in human breast cancer pathogenesis, we first examined the expression of Star-PAP in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. When compared with the untransformed mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A and MCF12A), breast cancer cells showed downregulated protein levels of Star-PAP, determined by western blot (Figure 1a). Breast cancer cells also had reduced mRNA levels of Star-PAP as shown by qPCR (Figure 1b) and further confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 1c). We further analyzed the expression pattern of Star-PAP in Oncomine, a publicly accessible cancer informatics database, with the Neve cell line data set that includes the transcriptional profiles of 51 breast cell lines.12, 13 Among this collection of cell lines (n=51), the breast cancer cell lines (n=48) also exhibited lower Star-PAP expression levels than the immortalized breast epithelial cell lines (n=3; HBL-100, MCF10A, MCF12A) (Figure 1d). Collectively, the above results indicated that the downregulation of Star-PAP is a manifestation of breast cancer cells. Next, the expression of Star-PAP in human breast cancer tissues was examined by analyzing the public data sets.14, 15, 16 Although highly expressed in normal mammary tissues, Star-PAP was downregulated in ductal carcinoma in situ (Figure 1e), invasive ductal carcinoma (Figure 1f) and even the stroma of invasive ductal carcinoma (Figure 1g). These data proved that the expression of Star-PAP is also downregulated in clinical breast cancer progression, thus suggesting that Star-PAP may play a potential tumor-suppressing role in breast cancer. To elucidate the functional role of Star-PAP in breast cancer progression, we first overexpressed Star-PAP in MCF7 and SUM-159PT cells. In both breast cancer cell lines, the cell proliferation (Figure 2b and Supplementary Figure S1c) as well as the colony-forming ability (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure S1b) was inhibited by the increased expression levels of Star-PAP (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure S1a). Moreover, ectopic expression of Star-PAP also induced apoptosis of cancer cells (Figure 2d). Together, these findings indicated that Star-PAP functions as a possible suppressor for breast cancer cells. We then exploited KM-plotter, an online cancer survival analysis database,17 to investigate the correlation between Star-PAP levels and clinical prognosis. When evaluated across the entire spectrum of breast cancer patients, high levels of Star-PAP were associated with relatively increased overall survival and relapse-free survival (Figure 2e). When looking into each of the four major breast cancer subtypes (basal-like, her2-enriched, luminal A and luminal B), elevated levels of Star-PAP also indicated an improved relapse-free survival, especially in basal-like and her2-enriched subtype (Supplementary Figures S2a\u2013d). Thus, in breast cancer patients, high levels of Star-PAP correlated with an improved prognosis. Considering that Star-PAP induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Figure 2d), we then investigated the mechanism underlying the apoptosis-inducing activity of Star-PAP. We observed that Star-PAP overexpression caused approximately fivefold loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) than control (Figure 3a). Moreover, ectopic Star-PAP expression triggered the release of cytochrome c, a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, and increased the activation of downstream Caspase 9 and Caspase 3 (Figure 3b). As the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis manifests the loss of \u0394\u03a8m and the release of cytochrome c,18 the above results suggested that Star-PAP induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is tightly regulated by the BCL-2 protein family through the interaction between its subgroup members. BIK is an inducer of mitochondrial apoptosis by activating BAX.19, 20, 21, 22, 23 It has been reported that Star-PAP associates with BIK mRNA and thus facilitates BIK expression by processing its mRNA 3\u2032end in HEK293 cells.9 For this reason, we speculated that the Star-PAP-induced mitochondrial apoptosis of breast cancer cells is mediated by BIK. In human breast cancer cells, the association between Star-PAP and BIK mRNA was firstly verified by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by RT-PCR (Figure 3c). Moreover, Star-PAP increased both mRNA (Figures 3d and e) and protein levels (Figure 3b) of BIK. Therefore, these results indicated that Star-PAP regulates the expression of BIK in the context of breast cancer cells. Targeting BIK with two distinct shRNAs (shBIK#1, shBIK#2) effectively relieved the loss of \u0394\u03a8m triggered by Star-PAP overexpression (Figure 3a). The release of cytochrome c and the activation of Caspase 9 and Caspase 3 were also effectively inhibited by BIK knockdown (Figure 3b). As a consequence of the increased BIK level after Star-PAP overexpression, the activation of BAX was also elevated (Figure 3f), whereas BIK knockdown mostly counteracted this alteration (Figure 3f). It is reported that Star-PAPD218A, a polymerase-dead mutant of Star-PAP, loses the poly(A) polymerase activity as well as the ability to control the expression of BIK.9 We found that Star-PAPD218A failed to induce the loss of \u0394\u03a8m (Figure 3a) and the activation of BAX (Figure 3f), thus suggesting that the polymerase activity of Star-PAP is necessary for its apoptosis-inducing ability that is mediated by BIK. Collectively, these results suggested that Star-PAP, by regulating the expression of BIK, induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. To clarify the influence of Star-PAP on breast cancer in vivo, by stably transfecting MDA-MB-468 cells with a Tet-On plasmid encoding Star-PAP, we established a cell line with doxycycline-inducible Star-PAP expression. In the presence of doxycycline, highly expressed Star-PAP was induced and, consequently, the elevated expression of BIK was also detected (Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure S3a). As observed above, in MDA-MB-468 cells, the doxycycline-induced Star-PAP overexpression also inhibited cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure S3b) and provoked cell apoptosis (Supplementary Figures S3c and d). Moreover, the apoptosis of cells induced by the doxycycline-controlled Star-PAP overexpression also depended on BIK (Figure 4b). We then incubated the Tet-On Star-PAP cells into the fourth inguinal mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice and the same amount of Tet-On control cells into the contralateral mammary fat pad. The mice were immediately supplied with the diet containing doxycycline. Tumor volume was measured weekly, and mice were killed for necropsy at the end of experiment. As revealed by tumor volume and necropsy, the growth of breast cancer xenografts was significantly inhibited by the induced overexpression of Star-PAP (Figures 4c and d). As shown by western blot using the lysates from tumor xenografts, the observed inhibition of tumor was probably caused by the BIK-mediated cell apoptosis (Figure 4e). In conclusion, Star-PAP inhibited the progression of breast cancer in vivo. The initiation of mitochondrial apoptosis is a key step that determines the effect of various chemotherapeutic agents and the drug sensitivity of cancer cells.24, 25 As shown above, Star-PAP induces apoptosis in the mitochondrial pathway, and therefore we investigated whether Star-PAP overexpression affects the drug sensitivity of breast cancer cells. In MDA-MB-468 cells, doxycycline-induced upregulation of Star-PAP conferred drug sensitivity to cisplatin (~3-fold decrease in IC50) as well as doxorubicin (~4-fold decrease in IC50) (Figure 5a) and consequently increased the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (~35% increase) (Figure 5b). Similarly, ectopic expression of Star-PAP sensitized SUM-159PT cells to cisplatin (~2.5-fold decrease in IC50) and doxorubicin (~2-fold decrease in IC50) (Supplementary Figures S4a and b) and thus augmented the apoptosis caused by doxorubicin (~30% increase) (Supplementary Figures S4c and d). These results implied that increased Star-PAP levels may improve the effect of chemotherapeutics on tumor in vivo. This notion was then verified by using Tet-On Star-PAP tumor xenografts in NOD/SCID mice. When the tumors were palpable, doxorubicin was administered, and diet containing doxycycline was supplied at the beginning of treatment. As evaluated by the tumor volume (Figure 5c) and weight (Figures 5d and e), the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin was markedly improved by overexpression of Star-PAP. Taken together, these findings indicated that Star-PAP sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Inactivation or loss of tumor suppressor predisposes normal cells to the acquisition of oncogenic transformation. We had shown that Star-PAP has potential tumor-suppressing activity in breast cancer, and then we wondered whether Star-PAP knockdown transforms normal breast cells. To determine the role of Star-PAP in mammary epithelial cells, we first knocked down Star-PAP in untransformed breast cell MCF10A using two independent siRNAs (siStar-PAP#1, siStar-PAP#2). When introduced separately into MCF10A cells, both of these siRNAs evidently decreased the levels of Star-PAP (Supplementary Figures S5a and b) and significantly promoted proliferation of cells (Supplementary Figure S5c). We generated the stable Star-PAP knockdown cells by lentivirus-mediated transfection of shRNA. As determined by soft agar colony-formation assay (Figure 6c) using two different clones (shStar-PAP#1, shStar-PAP#2; Figures 6a and b), these cells acquired the ability of anchorage-independent growth after Star-PAP knockdown. However, when incubated in the mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice, Star-PAP knockdown MCF10A cells failed to form tumors (Figure 6d). In addition, as shown by the change of cell morphology (Figure 6e) and the upregulation of mesenchymal markers (Figure 6f), Star-PAP knockdown induced MCF10A cells to undergo the process of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT). Collectively, these data suggested that Star-PAP knockdown partially transforms the mammary epithelial cells. Star-PAP is a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase that controls the expression of a subset of genes involved in various cellular processes.6 However, the physiological and pathological roles of Star-PAP largely remain unknown. Here, we have shown that breast cancer manifests reduced Star-PAP expression and high Star-PAP level implies a better prognosis for breast cancer patients. By regulating BIK expression, Star-PAP induced apoptosis of cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway, inhibited progression of breast cancer and sensitized breast tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs. This study proved that Star-PAP has a potential tumor-suppressing role in breast cancer pathogenesis. Star-PAP is encoded by gene TUT1 that is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues and has putative family members from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to homo sapiens.6, 8 In this study, we examined the expression of Star-PAP, both mRNA and protein levels, in breast cancer cells as well as clinical breast tumors, and we observed a consistent differential Star-PAP expression existing between the normal and cancerous breast condition (Figure 1). Recently, the downregulation of Star-PAP has also been observed in osteosarcoma, the most common type of bone cancer, by PCR microarray using cDNA from clinical cancer tissues.11 These evidences suggest that a consistent dysregulation of Star-PAP may exist in various cancer types. However, in order to comprehensively define the functional role of Star-PAP in human cancer, more investigations should be conducted in other tumor types. In breast cancer cells, Star-PAP induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway that is tightly regulated by the BCL-2 protein family. It has been established that Star-PAP controls the expression of BIK, a member of the BCL-2 family proapoptotic proteins,18, 26 through regulating 3\u2032end processing of its mRNA in HEK293 cells.9 Therefore, we inspected the relation between Star-PAP and BIK in breast cancer cells (Figure 3c). We revealed that by regulating the expression of BIK, Star-PAP acquires the ability to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (Figures 3a\u2013e). We also observed that the apoptosis-inducing ability of Star-PAP is abolished by BIK knockdown (Figures 3a, b and f). Therefore, in breast cancer cells, the apoptosis induced by Star-PAP overexpression is dependent on BIK. Given the fact that BIK is just one of the many target genes of Star-PAP, this finding gives a hint that Star-PAP may fulfill various physiological and pathological roles through its different target genes. In this study, we proved that Star-PAP, by regulating expression of BIK, induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. Recently, several reports have suggested that the function of BIK goes beyond the regulation of apoptosis. Through changing its subcellular localization, BIK is involved in response to oxidative stress caused by chemotherapy in several breast cancer cell lines.27 Moreover, BIK controls the expression of miRNAs as well as the autophagic flux in MDA-MB-231 cells.28 Thus, it would be interesting to investigate whether Star-PAP is involved in these new functions of BIK. The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is commonly deregulated in cancer cells and plays a key role in cancer development.29, 30 Mitochondrial apoptosis is also a key factor that determines the effect of various chemotherapeutic agents and the drug sensitivity of cancer cells.24, 31 Because of the fact that BIK is an inducer of mitochondrial apoptosis, activating BIK has been used as an anticancer strategy. However, it is a challenge to drug BIK by chemical compounds at the present time. Several alternative ways to increase BIK expression have been established, such as vector-mediated BIK expression,32 adenovirus-mediated BIK expression and BIK-based gene therapy.33, 34, 35, 36 By promoting the polyadenylation of BIK mRNA, Star-PAP increases BIK expression and induces mitochondrial apoptosis of cancer cells (Figure 3b), indicating that Star-PAP overexpression may sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs. In this study, utilizing breast cancer xenografts in NOD/SCID mice, we showed that ectopic overexpression of Star-PAP significantly inhibits cancer progression and sensitizes tumor to doxorubicin in vivo (Figures 4 and 5). Although Star-PAP indicated an improved prognosis in breast cancer patients (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S2), it is not as good as in the xenografts. We noticed that when Star-PAP was ectopically overexpressed, the levels of Star-PAP increased ~20-fold in xenografts (Figure 4e). However, breast cancer patients have a low expression level of Star-PAP, and even the patients defined as Star-PAP-high group just have a slightly higher Star-PAP level than the Star-PAP-low group. This may be the reason for the difference mentioned above. Moreover, Star-PAPD218A, a mutant without poly(A) polymerase activity, lost the capacity of increasing BIK expression and failed to induce cell apoptosis, demonstrating that the polymerase activity of Star-PAP is necessary for the expression of BIK and the apoptosis-inducing role of Star-PAP (Figures 3a and d\u2013f). Considering that the polymerase activity of Star-PAP can be activated by chemical compounds, the enzyme activators of Star-PAP may indirectly augment BIK expression and thus facilitate BIK-based anticancer strategy for clinical treatments. Therefore, Star-PAP is a valuable target for drug discovery. Although both in vitro and in vivo evidences indicated that Star-PAP serves as a potential tumor-suppressing protein, knock down of Star-PAP only partially transformed mammary epithelial cells (Figure 6). The Star-PAP knockdown MCF10A cells acquired the anchorage-independent growth ability, a crucial step in the acquisition of malignancy,37 but failed to produce tumors in NOD/SCID mice (Figures 6c and d). These data suggested that partial loss of Star-PAP is not enough for the initiation of breast cancer, and also indicated that some other genetic alteration may be required to collectively complete the process of oncogenesis. Moreover, Star-PAP knockdown induced EMT, a central driver of tumor malignancy,38, 39, 40 in mammary epithelial cells (Figures 6e and f). It will be interesting to investigate how the lack of Star-PAP expression influences EMT and tumorigenesis. In conclusion, we discovered the tumor-suppressing activity of Star-PAP in human breast cancer. Star-PAP is downregulated in breast cancer and correlated with prognosis of breast cancer patients. Star-PAP induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway, inhibits breast cancer progression and sensitizes breast cancer to chemotherapy drugs. These findings advanced the understanding of breast cancer pathogenesis and suggested an alternative way to augment BIK expression for improving the clinical outcome of cancer chemotherapy treatments.

Here, we performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study for pazopanib, and integrated our results with previously published results on pancreas (n = 12) and small intestine NETs (n = 50). The mean numbers of somatic mutations in each case varied widely from 20 to 4682. Among 12 GEP-NETs, eight showed mutations of more than one cancer-related gene, including TP53, CNBD1, RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL. TP53 was recurrently mutated in three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were identified in two cases. Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated a durable response and one small intestinal grade (G) 1 NET patient with BRAF V600E mutation showed progression after pazopanib treatment.

Their incidence is significantly increasing based on data from recent population-based studies, and this phenomenon is explained by increased awareness of the disease entity and increased detection by advanced diagnostic modalities [1\u20136]. However, there has been no significant improvement in clinical outcome over the same period based on UK and US databases. Recently, the FDA approved a few targeted agents for pancreatic NETs including sunitinib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and everolimus, an inhibitor of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signal pathway. In pancreatic NET, sunitinib was compared to a placebo in a phase III trial of 171 pancreatic NET patients, and the median progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in the sunitinib arm (11.4 versus 5.5 months). Based on these data, sunitinib was approved in the US for the treatment of progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic NET. In randomized controlled trials, everolimus demonstrated a 65% decrease in the risk for tumor progression in pancreatic NETs and a 23% decrease in patients with non-pancreatic NETs. In an analysis of 159 patients with NETs, everolimus showed a response rate of 7.7% with a progression-free survival of 12 months. We recently conducted a phase II trial for pazopanib in metastatic GEP-NET patients. Our phase II study demonstrated an objective response rate of 18.9% (7 of 37, 95% CI 8.0 \u2013 35.2) and a disease control rate (CR + confirmed PR + stable disease) of 75.7% (28 of 37, 95% CI, 58.8 \u2013 88.2) in metastatic GEP-NETs. Through this trial, we observed that a small subset of NET patients responded to pazopanib for > 6 months. Recently, pancreatic NETs were characterized as having recurrent somatic mutations in MEN1, DAXX, ATRX, TSC, and PTEN on the basis of exome sequencing of 10 pancreatic NETs. Small intestinal NETs showed recurrent somatic mutations and deletions in CDKN1B by whole exome and whole genome sequencing of 50 small intestinal NETs. However, in another study of 48 small intestinal NETs by exome sequencing, recurrent mutations were not identified. Rather, 197 single nucleotide variations in a preponderance of cancer-related genes were identified; 33% of small intestinal NET patients showed PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alteration, and 72% had therapeutically actionable genomic alterations. The understanding of genomic profiles in GEP-NETs is still incomplete and the genetic alterations associated with drug responses have not been extensively studied. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study of pazopanib. The mean number of somatic mutations varied widely from 20 to 4682, and the mutation counts for each case are shown in Figure 1. One case with 4682 somatic mutations showed a mutation in MLH1 and additional missense mutations (ATR, PARP2, RBBP8, and RIF1) and splice site (XPC) mutations in DNA repair-related genes, and was thus classified as having a \u201chypermutated\u201d phenotype. Among 12 samples, eight showed mutations of more than one of the cancer-related genes (TP53, CNBD1, RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ERBB3, KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL) described by Lawrence et al. (Figure 2). TP53 was recurrently mutated in three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were identified in two cases. In our data set, we found the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in one primary NET from the small intestine, which was further confirmed by Sanger direct sequencing. To exclude the possibility of the occurrence of mixed adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine features, or both, we performed an independent pathology review in terms of architecture, tumor grade, and chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 immunoreactivity by IHC (Supplementary Table 1). All of the pathological features corresponded to GEP-NET, rather than mixed adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features. The patient with BRAF V600E mutation was 52 years old and had a metastatic grade 1 neuroendocrine tumor. The primary mass originated from the duodenum and had metastasized to multiple and distant lymph nodes at diagnosis. The patient received capecitabine and oxaliplatin as a palliative first-line treatment. After disease progression following the first-line therapy, the patient was enrolled in the pazopanib clinical trial. Before starting pazopanib, mutational profiles of the primary tumor tissue were evaluated. After two cycles of pazopanib therapy, the follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan revealed tumor growth corresponding to disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria (Figure 3A). Hence, this small intestinal NET patient with BRAF V600E mutation showed tumor progression after pazopanib treatment, although at the time of clinical trial enrollment, the genomic information was not available to the clinician because this trial was not a genome-selected trial. We also identified the TP53 mutation in a patient with a dramatic response to pazopanib. The patient had a grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinoma with gastric primary tumor location and extensive abdominal lymph node and peritoneal seeding nodule involvement. After failing to respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy, the patient was treated with pazopanib. After 2 cycles of pazopanib, the patient presented stable disease per the RECIST 1.1 criteria (Figure 3B). At 4 months, CT evaluation (after 4 cycles) revealed definite radiologic tumor shrinkage corresponding to a partial response based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria (Figure 3B), which lasted for > 6 months. Next, we surveyed the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NET patients. We included GEP-NETs from the rectum (n = 26 consisting 19 G1, 4 G2 and 3 G3), colon (n = 7 consisting 6 G3 and one G1), pancreas (n = 4, G2), small intestine (n = 3 consisting one G3 and 2 G2), stomach (n = 3 consisting 2 G3 and one G1) and appendix (n = 1, adenocarcinoid). We found BRAF V600E (G1 NET from rectum and two G3 NETs from colon) and BRAF G593S (G2 NET from pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%) in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs by Sanger sequencing. The cohort consisted of GEP-NET from rectum (n = 27), colon (n = 6), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1). All G1 and G2 NETs were positive for synaptophysin while rectal NETs and G3 NETs were negative for chromogranin (Figure 4). The pathology and immunohistochemical staining of the four NETs with BRAF V600E or G593S mutation are shown in Figure 4 (G1, 1-cm rectal NET; G2, 8.5 cm pancreatic NET; G3, 6.5 cm colon NET; and G3, 3.2 cm colon NET). The copy number profile of Korean GEP-NETs clearly demonstrates a difference in CNV pattern for each primary organ (Supplementary Figure 1). The copy number of pancreatic NET relatively fluctuated interchromosomally. In contrast, there was no concordance of arm-level copy number in small intestinal NET (Supplementary Table 2). Our copy number results are similar to those of a previous small intestinal NET study. Moreover, arm-level amplification of 19q13.31 (q value, 0.49) frequently occurred in the pancreas, i.e., in three of four amplification samples (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Fourteen CNV genes (MCL1, DNMT3A, MLJ1, MYD88, NOTCH1, HRAS, AKT1, TSC2, CREBBP, MARK3, CDH1, TP53, RARA, and BCL2) that may potentially be actionable are illustrated in Figure 2. Whole exome sequencing results in two cases showed an exceptional response to pazopanib. In these two cases, we could not find mutations in any of the 272 recurrently mutated genes. Furthermore, we investigated the mutation status of genes in four pathways (hsa04010, MAPK signaling pathway; hsa04020, calcium signaling pathway; hsa04060, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction; hsa05200, pathways in cancer) involved in the primary mechanism of action of pazopanib. We found a novel p.I16fs MAPKAPK5 mutation involved in the MAPK signaling pathway in a patient with pancreatic NET (Supplementary Figure 2). As our GEP-NETs included various primary organs, we integrated our results with previously published results for pancreatic and small intestinal NETs [12, 13]. Most of the mutated genes did not overlap among the three datasets, suggesting different genomic alterations according to the primary location of the tumor (Supplementary Figure 3). In this analysis, we found 272 recurrently mutated genes irrespective of the organ, and we used those recurrently mutated genes to construct a gene interaction network. Finally, a network of 65 genes and 89 interactions was generated after genes that did not pass the GSEA test were trimmed (Supplementary Figure 4 and Table 2). Genes related to cell cycle, Wnt signaling, E2F transcription factor network, DNA damage, p53 pathway, EGFR signaling, FGFR signaling, ERBB2 signaling, PDGFR signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were mostly associated with these genes (Table 2). TP53 was the gene with the most recurrent mutations, as mutations were observed in 6 cases in various organs (Figure 5). CDKN1B mutation was found in five cases of small intestinal NET, whereas MEN1 mutation was found in five cases of pancreatic NET. Mutations of RB1, ATM, and TP53BP1 were each identified in four cases. Overall, 46 of 72 samples (64%) had at least one mutation in at least one cancer-related gene. The overall mutational profile of all GEP-NETs, including ours, is presented in Figure 5. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, phase II study of pazopanib and constructed a gene interaction network based on recurrently mutated genes with sequencing data from 72 GEP-NETs from three datasets [12, 13]. TP53 (n = 6), CDKN1B (n = 5), MEN1 (n = 5), RB1 (n = 4), ATM (n = 4), and TP53BP1 (n = 4) were frequently mutated genes. CDK1B mutation was identified only in small intestinal NET, whereas MEN1 mutation was identified in pancreatic NET. These genes are related to the cell cycle, Wnt, E2F transcription factor, and DNA damage pathways. Overall, 46 of 72 samples (64%) had at least one mutation in cancer-related genes. Importantly, we found one BRAF V600E mutation in small intestinal NET that did not respond to pazopanib and further confirmed that 3 (6.8%) of 44 GEP-NET patients harbored the BRAF V600E mutation. BRAF V600E is an actionable mutation in melanoma with significantly prolonged survival when a BRAF inhibitor is administered in patients with this mutation, but it is not actionable in colorectal adenocarcinoma. To exclude the possibility of mixed histology of adenocarcinoma and NET, we performed an independent pathology review and confirmed that all of the NET cases were not adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Hence, BRAF V600E is a novel mutation found in NET that could potentially confer clinical benefit in this subset of patients. BRAF V600E mutations have been reported as oncogenic mutation or resistant mutation to drugs in melanoma [26, 27] and thyroid cancer, GIST, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, and pediatric metanephric tumors. The clinical implications of the BRAF V600E mutation in metastatic GEP-NET should thus be evaluated in clinical trials. Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated a durable response to pazopanib, either as PR or achievement of stable disease (Figure 2). The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is mutated in many cancer types, and various TP53 mutations (missense, frameshift [fs], or nonsense [*], leading to gain or loss of function) have been identified during tumorigenesis and metastasis. Cancer cells with mutated TP53 have accelerated tumor growth associated with increased VEGF expression and neovascularization, which represents an important survival pathway [7, 8], resulting in a therapeutic advantage of anti-angiogenesis inhibitors in TP53 mutant cancer patients. Although our findings should be confirmed in larger patient cohort, we postulate that GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutation may have enhanced angiogenesis that may be treated using an anti-angiogenesis inhibitor, such as pazopanib. Only a few reports have described the sequencing data of GEP-NETs, and most of them were performed for NETs from a specific organ. Jiao et al. performed exome sequencing in 10 pancreatic NETs and found recurrently mutated genes as follows: MEN1 (n = 5), DAXX (n = 3), PTEN (n = 2), and TSC2 (n = 2). In a validation set of 68 cases, MEN1 was mutated in 44% cases, and DAXX and ATRX, which interacts with DAXX to form a chromatin remodeling complex, were mutated in 25% and 18% cases, respectively, with a mutually exclusive pattern. Another important finding was that at least one gene involved in the mTOR pathway, such as TSC2 or PTEN, was mutated in 14% of cases. This finding is consistent with observed clinical responses in pancreatic NET patients with the recently approved mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Banck et al. performed exome sequencing of 48 small intestinal NETs and identified 197 protein-altering somatic single nucleotide variations with a preponderance of cancer-related genes such as FGFR2, MEN1, HOOK3, EZH2, MLF1, CARD11, VHL, NONO, and SMAD1. However, most of these mutations were not recurrently identified. Using an integrated approach combining mutational and copy number data, Banck et al. found that 33% of small intestinal NET patients showed PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alteration and 72% had therapeutically actionable genomic alterations. Francis et al. identified mutations of 1,230 genes by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing of 50 small intestinal NETs. Approximately 90% of mutations were not recurrently mutated, and only CDKN1B was recurrently mutated in 10% of patients. Moreover, only a small number of mutated genes overlapped with previously reported small intestinal NETs or pancreatic NETs, suggesting different genomic alterations according to the primary location of the tumor or that many of the observed mutations were passenger and not driver mutations. In our data sets where our results were combined with previously published results [12, 13], we confirmed that most of the mutated genes did not overlap among the three datasets, including ours. Therefore, we constructed a gene interaction network of 65 genes and 89 interactions using 272 recurrently mutated genes. As a result, traditional cancer-associated pathways, such as cell cycle, Wnt signaling pathway, E2F transcription factor network, DNA damage, p53 pathway, EGFR signaling, FGFR signaling, ERBB2 signaling, PDGFR signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway were mostly associated with the 65 genes. Notably, 46 of 72 samples (64%) showed at least one mutation of these 65 genes, suggesting that about two-thirds of GEP-NET patients may have a benefit from a drug targeting these pathways. In this study, we found that a novel MAPKAPK5 mutation involved in the MAPK signaling pathway affected the mechanism of action of pazopanib in a pazopanib responder. MAPKAPK5 is known to be involved in tumor suppression, angiogenesis, and cytoskeletal remodeling through interaction with a variety of substrates and is associated with neurological processes, including neurosecretion. However, MAPKAPK5 mutations have not been documented in GEP-NET. Our results will facilitate the identification of biomarkers for the pazopanib response and will form the basis for a further large-scale genomic study. The limitation of this study is that it was performed in a relatively small number of samples from various primary organs. To overcome this limitation, we tried to integrate our results with previously published data of pancreatic and small intestinal NETs. To our knowledge, the current study is the first using NET samples from patients enrolled in a clinical trial to identify genetic alterations associated with drug responses. We performed whole exome sequencing of 12 GEP-NET tumor specimens from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, single-center phase II study after obtaining written informed consent, and the samples were processed using protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards. We extracted DNA from fresh tumor tissue (n = 2) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (n = 10) as previously described. The primary sites of GEP-NETs included rectum (n = 3), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 2), stomach (n = 1), and unknown primary sites (n = 2), and all the cases had hepatic metastasis at presentation. An independent pathologic review by an expert gastrointestinal pathologist (G.L.) is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The histological grade was categorized as follows: carcinoid tumors and well differentiated NETs were classified as Grade 1 tumors, atypical carcinoid and well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas were classified as Grade 2 tumors, and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas were classified as Grade 3 tumors. For validation of the BRAF mutation in an independent cohort, we extracted DNA from 44 primary GEP-NETs (> 1cm in size or > Grade 2) and Sanger-sequenced them as previously described. All research involving human participants have been approved by SMC Institutional Review Board (IRB), and all clinical investigation has been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Sequencing data were generated using a protocol that has been detailed previously [13, 17]. Briefly, exonic regions were captured using the Agilent V2 capture probe set and sequenced by 76-bp paired-end reads using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument. A median of 129,621,217 total reads was generated for each sample, 97.72\u201399.28% reads of which were aligned to the target exome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA), resulting in a median coverage of each base of 100X. Downstream sequencing analysis was performed as previously described [13, 17]. Before mutation and indel calling, sequencing reads were locally realigned to improve the detection of indels and decrease the number of false-positive SNVs caused by misaligned reads, particularly at the 3\u2032 end as previously described [13, 17]. For mutation detection, > 14 reads in the tumors and > 8 reads in the normal samples were necessary to call candidate somatic base substitutions, and indels were detected using MuTect. Germline mutations were detected using the UnifiedGenotyper. All somatic mutations were manually reviewed and visually confirmed using the Integrated Genomics Viewer (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/). Copy number variation (CNV) was analyzed by GISTIC 2.0, and we investigated GEP-NET CNV genes from drug targets defined in a previous study. To investigate the genetic characteristics of GEP-NET, we integrated our mutation profiles with previously published data for pancreatic NETs (n = 10) and small intestinal NETs (n = 50). To compose the gene set, silent mutations were eliminated and then recurrently mutated genes (mutations in greater than or equal to 2) were selected. As a result, 136 genes were entered as a gene set. The interaction network was constructed from the input gene set by ReactomeFI of Cytoscape [22, 23] [PMID: 20482850, PMID: 14597658]. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the reactome pathway was performed within a cutoff FDR of \u2264 0.01. Finally, the interaction network was trimmed to only include genes that passed the GSEA and first neighbors of GSEA genes."}, "27090298": {"pmid": "27090298", "pmcid": "PMC4835700", "title": "Circulating Fatty Acid Synthase in pregnant women: Relationship to blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters", "abstract": "\nThe enzyme FASN (fatty acid synthase) is potentially related with hypertension and metabolic dysfunction. FASN is highly expressed in the human placenta. We aimed to investigate the relationship circulating FASN has with blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters in healthy pregnant women. Circulating FASN was assessed in 115 asymptomatic pregnant women in the second trimester of gestation along with C-peptide, fasting glucose and insulin, post-load glucose lipids, HMW-adiponectin and blood pressure (the latter was assessed in each trimester of gestation). At birth, newborns and placentas were weighed. FASN expression was also able to be assessed in 80 placentas. Higher circulating FASN was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), with a more favourable metabolic phenotype (lower fasting glucose and insulin, post load glucose, HbAc1, HOMA-IR and C-peptide), and with lower placental and birth weight (all p\u2009<\u20090.05 to p\u2009<\u20090.001). Placental FASN expression related positively to circulating FASN (p\u2009<\u20090.005) and negatively to placental weight (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Our observations suggest a physiological role of placental FASN in human pregnancy. Future studies will clarify whether circulating FASN of placental origin does actually regulate placental and fetal growth, and (thereby) has a favourable influence on the pregnant mother\u2019s insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.\n", "fulltext": "The multifunctional protein complex FASN (fatty acid synthase) is indispensable in the synthesis of saturated straight-chain fatty acids from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), via malonyl-CoA1. Excess energy intake and increased insulin levels has the effect of upregulating the FASN gene expression23; suggesting this enzyme is implicated in energy homeostasis. Altered FASN activity/expression has been reported in metabolic syndrome and overweight subjects who exhibit obesity, inflammation, hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis, indicating a relationship between FASN and the pathogenesis of hypertension and metabolic dysfunction45. Adipose tissue from hypertensive individuals showed decreased levels of FASN mRNA6. The subcutaneous adipose tissue of the obese subjects also showed decreased FASN expression compared to lean subjects7891011, and has exhibited negative correlation with insulin resistance markers such as glucose, HbA1c and HOMA-IR678. In adipose tissue of insulin resistant type 2 diabetic patients, FASN mRNA expression is markedly decreased in response to reduced insulin signalling12. In vivo, the cellular concentrations of poly-unsaturated fatty acids and sterols are the main factors regulating the expression of FASN, when their concentrations decrease in the cell, the transcription of the FASN gene increases. FASN can be actively removed out of the cell when AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) is activated9. Circulating FASN is thus thought to reflect previous intracellular enzymatic activity9. In normal cells, low levels of FASN are present due to abundant dietary lipids. However, FASN is highly expressed in hepatic, adipose tissue and in neoplastic cells, where FASN expression and the synthesis of new fatty acids are up-regulated as a survival advantage to low-fuel supply1314. The placenta also expresses high amounts of FASN1516. Trophoblastic cells may use de novo lipid synthesis in order to maintain essential placental actions for development. This strategy may also be an evolutionary favoured compensatory mechanism, as the lipid supply from food intake may become limited during pregnancy. The role of FASN in human pregnancy is poorly studied. A recent report indicates that maternal obesity and gestational diabetes are related to less expression of FASN in adipose tissue of subcutaneous and visceral origin17. In mice with a lipid-poor diet during gestation, an augmented expression of FASN in adipose tissue was reported18. Despite the core physiological role of FASN in maintaining normal levels of lipids and glucose, as well as energy homeostasis and its high expression in placenta, the relationship between the circulating form of this molecule, blood pressure and metabolism during human pregnancy has not been characterized. In this work, we studied the associations of circulating FASN with blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters in normal human pregnancy. We also studied whether circulating FASN was related to placental FASN expression. Table 1 summarizes the clinical and laboratory findings of the study subjects. Second- and third-trimester SBP decreased with increasing circulating FASN. Higher circulating FASN was also related to a more favourable metabolic condition, specifically lower fasting glucose and insulin, post load glucose, HbAc1, HOMA-IR and C-peptide (all p\u2009<\u20090.05 to p\u2009<\u20090.001; Table 2). Circulating FASN was inversely related to placental weight and birth weight (p\u2009<\u20090.05 to p\u2009<\u20090.01; Table 2), and directly associated with placental FASN mRNA expression (p\u2009<\u20090.001; Table 2). Placental FASN expression was also inversely related to the weight of the placenta (p\u2009<\u20090.05), however, it was unrelated to blood pressure or to metabolic parameters in pregnant women (data not shown). A threshold association was evident for circulating FASN and BP, metabolic variables and the parameters of newborns, with women in the highest tertile of circulating FASN exhibiting lower SBP in the second and third trimester of gestation, DBP in the third trimester, fasting glucose and insulin, post load glucose HOMA-IR, placental FASN expression, placental weight and birth weight SDS, and higher HMW-adiponectin compared to other tertiles of circulating FASN (Table 3 and Fig. 1 and Suppl Fig. 1). In multiple regression analyses (Table 4), circulating FASN remained independently related to the second- (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.231, p\u2009=\u20090.008) and third- (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.333, p\u2009<\u20090.001) trimester SBP, fasting and post-load glucose (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.204, p\u2009=\u20090.028 and \u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.261, p\u2009=\u20090.004, respectively), HOMA-IR (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.257, p\u2009=\u20090.006), and placental and birth weight (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.214, p\u2009=\u20090.030 and \u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.194, p\u2009=\u20090.015, respectively), even when confounding variables where introduced in the model. Placental FASN expression also remained correlated to placental weight (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.238, p\u2009=\u20090.047) independently of confounding variables in multivariate analyses (Table 5). Higher circulating FASN was associated with a more favourable blood pressure and metabolic profile, with lower placental weight and birth weight and with higher placental FASN expression in healthy pregnant women. The independent associations of circulating FASN with blood pressure and with glucose- and insulin-related markers concur with previous reports in overweight and hypertensive subjects that showed decreased FASN expression in their fat depots619. Additionally, a negative relation between FASN expression and insulin resistance markers, has been reported in adipose tissue of healthy subjects without diabetes68. Evidence, however, exists for an increased FASN expression and higher circulating FASN in obesity-related disorders520. These discrepancies may be explained, at least in part, by the apparently opposing effects of insulin on FASN, causing both long-term upregulation of FASN expression and short-term FASN inactivation; the latter being dependent on the insulinemic state of the individual21. Our study was based on healthy pregnant women with no comorbidities. These associations may vary in patients with chronic insulin resistance including patients with vascular or metabolic comorbidities and long-standing obesity. Although the metabolic regulation of FASN is not yet completely understood, these current results suggest that circulating FASN may be among the factors integrating blood pressure regulation and energy metabolism during gestation. AMPK may provide a plausible molecular mechanism for these associations. Into the cell, FASN activity is limited by the activation of the nuclear AMPK enzyme that removes FASN from the cytosolic milieu into the extracellular space9. AMPK activation is also known to protect mice from developing hypertension22 and metabolic disease. Preeclampsia is a systemic disorder of pregnancy originating in the placenta. Research has demonstrated that several placental antiangiogenic factors are liberated into circulation during pregnancy and cause widespread endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and other systemic manifestations of preeclampsia23. Besides adipose tissue, FASN is highly expressed in normal trophoblastic cells15. FASN provides trophoblasts with an alternative mechanism to maintain a regular supply of fatty acids to keep up with the metabolic demands of this organ. Changes in FASN activity may thus cause trophoblastic cell dysfunction which may, in turn, affect the regulation of blood pressure and energy metabolism during gestation. Recent data indicate that FASN expression in human placenta is influenced by maternal cholesterolemia and glycemia16. We do not exclude the possibility that mRNA FASN levels may be also associated with metabolic parameters in pregnant women with comorbidities, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia. Our present results suggest a better correlation of protein rather than mRNA levels with energy metabolism in healthy pregnant women. Our results showed negative associations of placental weight and/or birth weight with circulating FASN and placental FASN expression. The human placenta is comprised by a trophoblast layer that physically limits maternal and fetal blood flows. Maternal plasma lipoproteins cross the placenta to supply the fetus with lipids24. Fetal tissues and the placenta also synthetize fatty acids and cholesterol to compensate for a possible lipid deficiency during pregnancy25. Therefore, we would suggest that the changes in FASN expression in smaller placentas may be a compensatory mechanism to regulate maternal blood pressure and metabolic parameters in normal pregnancies with lower fetoplacental growth. Increased FASN expression may regulate the fatty acid outflow from other tissues, such as adipose tissue, preventing placentas from being too big or too small, as well as contributing to an improvement in the physiological insulin-resistant state that is observed during pregnancy. In this sense, during pregnancy, to compensate for a poor lipid diet, several adaptations of the maternal metabolism may be the increasing expression of those genes implicated in the synthesis of fatty acids (among them FASN) in the maternal tissues including liver, adipose tissue and the mammary glands18. We are aware of some limitations in our study. A cause-effect relationship cannot be described between circulating FASN and blood pressure or metabolic variables in pregnant women by the present study design. The exact link between circulating FASN and blood pressure in women with pathological conditions, such as preeclampsia or metabolic disorders cannot be discerned in our healthy study population. Moreover, circulating FASN was taken at a single point in the second trimester. Serial measurements of FASN throughout the pregnancy and in maternal hypertensive or dysglycemic conditions would have added greater value to our present results. In conclusion, circulating FASN was associated with a more favourable blood pressure and metabolic profile and with lower placental and birth weight. Circulating FASN and placental FASN expression were closely related. Future studies will clarify whether circulating FASN of placental origin regulates placental and fetal growth, and (thereby) has a favourable effect on blood pressure and insulin sensitivity in the pregnant mother. 115 pregnant Caucasian women experiencing normal pregnancies and delivering normal birth weight infants were included in the study. These infants were included in a prenatal cohort of healthy infants. The women were recruited at the Figueres Hospital26 and none of the women experienced complicated pregnancies or parturition. Women with complications, such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, fetal malformations, asphyxia and multiple pregnancies were excluded from this prenatal cohort of apparently healthy mothers and babies. The Dr. Josep Trueta Hospital\u2019s Institutional Review Board approved the protocol. All the women signed an informed written consent. The methods were implemented according to approved guidelines. All patients were subjected to clinical examinations, ultrasonograms and blood tests. Mothers gave information about socio-demographic characteristics, medical data during pregnancy and at delivery. Anthropometric measurements were derived from standard medical records27. The weight, height, BMI (in Kg/m2) and blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) of the pregnant women were assessed at each trimester of gestation. An electronic sphygmomanometer (Dinamap Pro 100, GE Healthcare, UK) was used on the right arm and with women in the sitting position to determine the blood pressure. All infants were born between 37 and 42 weeks and had normal birth weights (from \u22122.0 to +2.0 DE). Within the first hour after delivery, infants were measured with a measuring board and weighed with a calibrated scale. Birth weight and length were adjusted for gestational age and sex according to regional norms28. All serum samples for assessing circulating FASN and metabolic markers were obtained under fasting conditions between 24 and 28 gestation weeks, when glucose tolerance assessment was carried out. All women were subjected to fasting glucose and oral glucose tolerance test (1\u2009h with 50\u2009g glucose). The hexokinase method was used to analyse serum glucose. To determine HbA1c the ion-exchange HPLC method was used (Bio-Rad Laboratories, S.A. Madrid, Spain). Immuno-chemiluminiscence was used to measure serum insulin (IMMULITE 2000, Siemens Healthcare, Madrid, Spain) with a detection limit of 0.4 mIU/L and coefficients of variability less than 10%. HOMA-IR was calculated according to the formula: fasting insulin (mU/l) \u00d7 fasting glucose (mM)/22.5. High-molecular-weight adiponectin was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Linco Research, Missouri, USA) with a limit of detection of 0.5\u2009ng/mL and coefficients of variability less than 4%. Serum lipids including triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were determined using routine laboratory tests. A quantitatie ELISA was used to measure serum FASN concentrations (FASgen Diagnostics, Baltimore, USA) with a limit of detection of 0.3\u2009ng/ml and coefficients of variability less than 12%. Placental tissue was studied in a representative subgroup (n\u2009=\u200980) of the women studied and who did not differ in clinical or laboratory parameters from the whole group. Placentas were weighed at the moment of delivery. Three fragments of ~1\u2009cm3 of tissue were biopsied on the maternal side for each placenta. The samples were embedded in RNAlater (QIAGEN, Madrid, Spain) into cryotubes and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until RNA extraction. Placental biopsies were each homogenized and total RNA was extracted (RNeasy Mini Kit; QIAGEN, Madrid, Spain) using the standard protocol with DNase. The absorbance at 260\u2009nm was used for assessing RNA concentration (Spectramax Plus 384 Microplate Reader, Molecular Devices, Berkshire, UK). A260/A280 ratio was used to exclude protein contamination. One microgram of RNA was converted to cDNA following the instructions of the manufacturer (High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit, Life Technologies SA, Madrid, Spain). To perform real time PCR 25\u2009\u03bcl mixtures were prepared containing 2xTaqman Universal Master Mix (12.5\u2009\u03bcl) (Applied Biosystems), cDNA (4\u2009ng/\u03bcl), and the following Taqman Gene Expression Assays (1.25\u2009\u03bcl) (Life Technologies SA, Madrid, Spain): FASN (Hs00188012), TBP (Hs99999910) and SDHA (Hs00360422). The cycling protocol was 50\u2009\u00b0C, 2\u2009min; 95\u2009\u00b0C, 10\u2009min; then 40 cycles of 95\u2009\u00b0C, 15\u2009s and 60\u2009\u00b0C, 1\u2009min (ABI PRISM\u00ae 7000 Sequence Detection System; Life Technologies SA, Madrid, Spain). The 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method was used to calculate the relative expression using the Ct values of the housekeeping genes TBP and SDHA27. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistics software (IBM, Madrid, Spain). Logarithmic transformation was used to restore symmetry of non-parametric variables. Pearson correlation test and multiple regression analyses in a stepwise manner were used to analyze the association between quantitative variables. Variables of interest were also analysed by One-Way ANOVA according to tertiles of circulating FASN and p\u2009<\u20090.05 was used as the significance level. The study exhibited a power of 80% and a 0.26 Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient to detect a significant association between serum FASN, blood pressure and metabolic parameters, and a 0.30 Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient between serum FASN and placental FASN expression.

IL-6 and IL-23 are critical cytokines for the differentiation and propagation of Th17 cells, respectively. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are known to stimulate immune cells to produce such inflammatory cytokines. Contrary to Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS, LPS from Spirulina has low toxicity and barely induces in vivo production of IL-6 and IL-23 in mice. We examined the antitumor effects of Spirulina LPS compared to E. coli LPS in an MH134 hepatoma model. Administration of Spirulina LPS suppressed tumor growth in C3H/HeN mice, but not in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mutant C3H/HeJ mice, by reducing serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23, while increasing interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 levels. The antitumor activity and IFN-\u03b3 production were mediated by T cells. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that Spirulina LPS impaired the antigen-presenting function that supports the generation of IL-17-producing cells in a toll-like receptor (TLR)4-dependent manner. Of note, injection of anti-IL-17 antibody in tumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice in the absence of Spirulina LPS markedly suppressed tumor growth and augmented IFN-\u03b3 responses. Thus, our results support the notion that IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17/IL-23 mutually regulate Th17 and Th1 responses in tumor-bearing hosts, and Spirulina LPS modulates the balance of the IFN-\u03b3-IL-17/IL-23 axis towards IFN-\u03b3 production, which leads to tumor inhibition. Furthermore, Spirulina LPS effectively inhibited the spontaneous development of mammary tumors. This study has important implications for the exploitation of TLR-based immunomodulators for cancer immunotherapy.\n", "fulltext": "Although the immune system generally recognizes abnormal proteins on tumor cells as tumor antigens, spontaneous immune responses are too weak to suppress tumor growth. To overcome this problem, a variety of adjuvants, including toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, are investigated to potentiate antitumor immunity. The bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), historically known for its effective adjuvant properties, is often used in the treatment of cancer patients (1). The innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns expressed on microorganisms through corresponding TLRs, and the activation of innate immunity by TLRs produces proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12, leading to the subsequent induction of adaptive immune responses (2,3). IL-12 is produced by macrophages (M\u03a6) and dendritic cells (DC) and dictates the differentiation of CD4 Th1 cells, which produce interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and activate natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic CD8 T cells (4). IFN-\u03b3 plays an important role in the prevention of primary tumor development and intracellular pathogen invasion (5\u20137). Among the different TLR ligands, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria exhibits antitumor activity in addition to marked toxicity (8). The study of the bioactivity of LPS from various species revealed that LPS prepared from Bordetella pertussis and a synthetic analog of the LPS lipid A subunit are less toxic than E. coli LPS, and display antitumor effects (9,10). Recent studies have revealed that IL-23/IL-17 signaling plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in humans and in mice (11\u201316). IL-17 is primarily produced by T cells and acts on tumor cells and tumor-associated stromal cells to induce angiogenesis and the production of IL-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinases. IL-23 is produced by M\u03d5/DC and facilitates the expansion and survival of IL-17-producing CD4 T (Th17) cells and therefore, the production of IL-17 (17,18). Moreover, it has become evident that a combination of IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 induces Th17 differentiation from naive T cells (19,20). Since M\u03d5/DC produces both antitumor (IL-12) and tumor-promoting (IL-6/IL-23) cytokines upon stimulation with TLR ligands (21,22), the regulation of this balance is critical for TLR-based cancer immunotherapy (17,18). Moreover, IL-17 stimulates tumor cells and tumor-surrounding cells to induce IL-6 expression, which in turn leads to the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (16,23). STAT3 is linked to numerous oncogenic signaling pathways and is constitutively activated both in tumor cells and in immune cells under tumor microenvironment-like conditions. Thus, ideal candidate molecules for tumor immunotherapy are TLR-based immunomodulators that do not induce or partially induce IL-6/IL-23. While exploring TLR4 responsiveness of the material extracted from algae and cyanobacteria (24), we found that LPS phenol-water extracts from Spirulina (Arthrospira) were able to induce IL-12. Noteworthy, Spirulina LPS showed a much lower in vitro induction of IL-6 and IL-23 by M\u03d5/DC than E. coli LPS. Spirulina is a gram-negative, oxygenic, photosynthetic, filamentous cyanobacterium (blue-green alga), and since the Aztec civilization in Mexico, it has been widely used as a nutritional and therapeutic supplement (25). Spirulina LPS is reported to be less toxic compared to LPS from Salmonella abortus (26), but its effects on cytokine production or antitumor activities have not been studied extensively. Thus, it would be very interesting to study how Spirulina LPS affects tumor growth and in vivo production of inflammatory cytokines. Although most experiments examined the in vitro production of IL-17-associated inflammatory cytokines thus far, the expression patterns of these cytokines in tumor host tissue remain to be established. We report here that Spirulina LPS did not induce or only partially induced IL-6 and IL-23 and efficiently suppressed the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma MH134 in a TLR4-dependent manner, by reducing the serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23, while increasing those of IFN-\u03b3. Interestingly, anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) clearly suppressed tumor growth as efficiently as Spirulina LPS. Furthermore, Spirulina LPS was quite effective in inhibiting spontaneous development of mammary tumors in an oncogene transgenic mouse model. Female C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice were purchased from CLEA Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). DO11.10 transgenic mice for \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizing ovalbumin (OVA) in the context of I-Ad and transgenic mice carrying an activated rat HER-2/neu oncogene driven by a mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (HER-2/neu mice) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and Charles River Laboratories (Cambridge, MA, USA), respectively. All mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment, and experiments were performed following the ethical guidelines of Kochi Medical School and Osaka Ohtani University. The mouse tumor MH134 (hepatocellular carcinoma; kindly provided by Dr T. Kudo, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan) and YAC-1 (T-cell lymphoma) cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), 5\u00d710\u22125 M 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), and 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich). LPS from Escherichia coli (E. coli) 0111:B4 was purchased from Difco (Detroit, MI, USA). Anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb (R4-6A2, rat IgG1; no. MM701), anti-IL-17 mAb (50104, rat IgG2a; no. MAB421), anti-CD8 mAb (53\u20136.7, rat IgG2a; no. 100735), and rat IgG were obtained from Endogen (Rockford, IL, USA), R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA), BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA), and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Anti-CD4 mAb (GK1.5, rat IgG2b) was kindly provided by Dr F.W. Fitch (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA). S. pacifica was a generous gift from Dr Genrald Cysewski (Cyanotech Corporation, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, USA) and Mr. Nobuyuki Miyaji (Toyo Koso Kagaku Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan). S. pacifica has been selected from a strain of edible S. platensis in 1984 and its enzyme expression profile differs from that of the parental strain. LPS was prepared from S. pacifica freeze-dried cells as previously described (27). Briefly, cells were washed with acetone, suspended in distilled water, and then extracted by addition of 90% phenol-water and vigorous agitation at 68\u00b0C. The crude preparation was dialyzed to remove phenol and residual freeze-dried cells. The sample was dissolved in water, and the insoluble material was eliminated by centrifugation, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 \u00d7 g. The molecular mass of the LPS sample was estimated between approximately 1,000 and 20,000 Da by electrophoresis and mass spectral analysis. Tumor growth was measured 3 times per week after intradermal (i.d.) injection of 1\u00d7106 MH134 cells in the back of C3H/HeN or C3H/HeJ mice. The tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: Volume (mm3) = width2 \u00d7 length/2. In some experimental settings, Spirulina LPS or E. coli LPS in saline solution was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) every week starting 6 days after tumor inoculation. To deplete the T-cell subsets, mice injected with MH134 tumor cells on day 0 were injected i.p. with rat IgG, anti-CD4, or anti-CD8 mAb (150 \u00b5g/mouse on days, \u22121, 0, +3) as previously described (28). T-cell depletion was confirmed to be >95% by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). MH134 tumors were surgically removed 3 weeks after tumor inoculation. Mice were re-challenged i.d. with 1.5\u00d7106 MH134 cells of the same tumor as previously described (29). MH134 tumors taken from C3H/HeN mice treated with saline solution or Spirulina LPS 22 days after tumor implantation were embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetec USA, Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) and frozen. Frozen tumors were sectioned and stained with anti-CD4 (RM4-5, rat IgG2a, no. 100520, BioLegend) or anti-CD8 (53\u20136.7) antibodies using simple stain mouse MAX-PO [F(ab)'2 goat anti-rat Ig and peroxidase coupled to the amino acid polymer] and 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine according to the manufacturer's protocol (Nichirei-Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan). M\u03d5/DC or CD4 T cell fractions were prepared from whole spleen cells by positive selection using a MACS cell separation system (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Anti-CD4 and a mixture of anti-CD11b and anti-CD11c microbeads were used for the fractionation of CD4 T cells and M\u03d5/DC, respectively. The purity was usually demonstrated to be >90% by FACS. Whole splenocytes (5\u00d7106/well) depleted of red blood cells were cultured in 10% FCS RPMI-1640 medium in 24-well culture plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. After 4 days of culture, supernatants were collected to assess cytokine levels by ELISA. Whole spleen cells (8\u00d7105/well) from OVA-specific TCR transgenic (DO11.10) mice were cultured in flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Costar Corning, NY, USA) in 10% FCS RPMI-1640 medium for 5 days. In some experiments, 2.8\u00d7105 CD4 T cells, prepared from C3H/HeJ mice that had been immunized i.p. with 150 \u00b5g OVA and 5 mg Alum approximately 2 months earlier, were cultured with 1.2\u00d7105 splenic M\u03d5/DC cells from C3H/HeN or C3H/HeJ mice in the presence of 20 \u00b5g/ml OVA for 5 days. Spirulina or E. coli LPS was added at the initiation of the culture to evaluate its effect on IL-17 production. The levels of IL-17 in the culture supernatants were evaluated by ELISA. Whole spleen cells (8\u00d7105/well) were cultured in flat-bottomed 96-well plates in 10% FCS RPMI-1640 medium in the presence or absence of graded doses of Spirulina LPS or E. coli LPS. Five days later, the cultured cells were collected and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-B220 mAb (RA3-6B2, rat IgG2a, no. 553088, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). B220+ cells were counted as B cells using a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Briefly, 2.5\u00d7106 target cells were labeled with 25 \u00b5Ci of 51Cr sodium chromate for 60 min at 37\u00b0C in 10% FCS RPMI-1640 medium. After washing, 51Cr-labeled target cells (1\u00d7104) and effector cells were mixed in flat-bottomed 96-well plates at the indicated effector/target (E/T) ratio. After 4 h of incubation, the radioactivity in the cell-free supernatants was measured using a 1470 Automatic Gamma Counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Percentage-specific lysis for 51Cr release was calculated according to the following formula: % specific lysis = [(experimental - spontaneous) release] / [(maximal - spontaneous) release] \u00d7100. Cytokine levels in serum or culture supernatants were quantified by sandwich ELISA. The following pairs of capture and biotinylated detection rat anti-mouse mAbs were used: R4-6A2 (no. 551216) and XMG1.2 (no. 554410) for IFN-\u03b3, TC11-18H10 (no. 555068) and TC11-8H4 (no. 555067) for IL-17, 9A5 (no. 554658) and C17.8 (no. 554476) for IL-12(p35/40), MP5-20F3 (no. 554400) and MP5-32C11 (no. 554402) for IL-6, and A75-2 (no. 555052) and A75-3 (no. 555053) for TGF-\u03b21 (all were purchased from BD Biosciences). For IL-23(p19/40), rat anti-mouse IL-23p19 (G23-8, no. 14-7232-85, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and biotinylated anti-IL-12p40 (C17.8, BD Biosciences) were used. The ELISA assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Differences in mean values between groups were calculated using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fischer's exact test. P-values of the Student's t tests are shown unless otherwise indicated. To examine the antitumor activities of Spirulina LPS in comparison with that of E. coli LPS, we inoculated hepatocellular carcinoma MH134 cells i.d. into syngeneic C3H/HeN and TLR4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice (30), followed by i.p. administration of different doses of Spirulina LPS or E. coli LPS 6 days later. The injection with different doses of Spirulina LPS suppressed the tumor growth in C3H/HeN but not in C3H/HeJ mice, to the same degree as E. coli LPS treatment (Fig. 1A). This suggests that Spirulina LPS as well as E. coli LPS reduced tumor growth in a TLR4-dependent manner. In order to assess the involvement of T cells in the Spirulina LPS-induced antitumor effect, we administered anti-CD4 and/or anti-CD8 mAbs to deplete the T-cell subsets before Spirulina LPS injection. While injection of both anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAbs completely abolished the antitumor activity of Spirulina LPS, anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 mAb alone did not result in a strong effect (Fig. 1B). In accordance with the results of the in vivo T-cell depletion, immunohistochemical examinations revealed the enhancement of infiltration of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the tumor masses upon administration of Spirulina LPS (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that CD4 and CD8 T cells are both involved in the antitumor effect induced by Spirulina LPS. To examine whether Spirulina LPS induces immunity against MH134 tumors, we reinoculated MH134 cells into C3H/HeN mice that had been implanted with an MH134 tumor and were treated with saline, E. coli, or Spirulina LPS, followed by surgical resection of primary tumors 5 days before the re-challenge. The growth rate of the reimplanted tumors reduced even in saline-treated mice, compared with that in untreated mice implanted with only new tumor cells without the first inoculum of MH134 tumor cells (Fig. 2A), implicating the induction of antitumor immunity without LPS administration when the primary tumor was removed. Spirulina LPS induced a stronger resistance to reimplanted MH134 tumors than saline (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the tumor growth rate in E. coli LPS-treated mice was comparable to that in saline-treated mice (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that while Spirulina LPS facilitated the generation of immunity against MH134 tumors, E. coli LPS did not enhance secondary antitumor immune response. Since E. coli LPS was effective in the prevention of primary tumor growth as shown in Fig. 1A and is known to exhibit antitumor activity partly through activation of NK cells, we evaluated the ability of E. coli and Spirulina LPS to activate NK cells. Indeed, spleen cells from C3H/HeN mice injected with E. coli LPS showed remarkable toxicity towards NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells and a weak but significant toxicity towards MH134 cells, whereas Spirulina LPS failed to activate NK cells (Fig. 2B). NK activation was not induced in C3H/HeJ mice, not even when E. coli LPS was administered (Fig. 2B). Thus, this result may explain why E. coli LPS elicited antitumor effects against the primary tumor, regardless of its failure to enhance adaptive immunity to tumors. IFN-\u03b3 plays a crucial role in the prevention of tumor development (6), whereas IL-17 and IL-23 are considered to promote tumor growth by inducing inflammation and by regulating the expansion/survival of Th17 cells, respectively (11,14\u201316). We measured serum levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and IL-23 in tumor-bearing C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice treated with saline, E. coli, or Spirulina LPS. E. coli and Spirulina LPS (100 \u00b5g) markedly increased serum IFN-\u03b3 levels in C3H/HeN mice with a peak response at days 7 and 14 after tumor inoculation, respectively (Fig. 3A). A low dose of Spirulina LPS (20 \u00b5g) induced slight but significant IFN-\u03b3 production from days 7 to 14. However, the serum levels of IFN-\u03b3 were not elevated in C3H/HeJ mice at any time, not even after injection of either LPS. The treatment with anti-CD4 mAb or a combination of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAbs abrogated the increase in serum IFN-\u03b3 in C3H/HeN mice receiving Spirulina LPS, whereas anti-CD8 mAb alone slightly diminished the activity of Spirulina LPS to induce IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23 in saline-treated C3H/HeN mice gradually increased during tumor progression and reached a maximum on day 21 (Fig. 3B and C). However, serum levels of IL-6 only showed an approximately 2-fold increase in saline-treated tumor-bearing mice even on day 21 as compared to non-treated mice (data not shown). Noteworthy, Spirulina LPS significantly reduced IL-17 and IL-23 levels, while E. coli LPS hardly suppressed IL-17 production on day 21 (Fig. 3B and C). On the contrary, E. coli LPS enhanced serum levels of IL-23 in tumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice on day 7 and 14. Taken together, these results support the notion that Spirulina LPS induces antitumor immune responses through the induction of IFN-\u03b3 mostly by CD4 T cells and suppressed serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23, whereas E. coli LPS exerts its antitumor effect primarily through activation of NK cells. We have previously shown that antigen-presenting cells (APCs)-expressing tumor Ag and tumor-reactive T cells are both stimulated in vivo in tumor-bearing mice, and that in vitro culture of spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice at early stages leads to cytokine production without exogenous addition of tumor Ag as a result of the collaboration between antitumor T cells and APCs (29,31). We tested whether in vivo treatment with E. coli or Spirulina LPS affects the in vitro production of IFN-\u03b3 by culturing spleen cells from MH134 tumor-bearing mice. Spirulina LPS clearly enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production in spleen cells of tumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice, whereas E. coli LPS was unable to upregulate IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig. 3D). These results implicate that Spirulina LPS enhances IFN-\u03b3 production through the generation of memory T cells. Since Spirulina LPS reduced serum IL-17 levels in tumor-bearing mice while increasing IFN-\u03b3 levels and because IFN-\u03b3 negatively regulates the generation of Th17 cells (32,33), we investigated whether IL-17 downregulation by Spirulina LPS occurs via inhibition of the induction of IL-17-producing cells by facilitating IFN-\u03b3 production, or alternatively by directly downregulating IL-17-producing cells. To address this question, spleen cells from OVA-specific TCR transgenic DO11.10 mice were stimulated by OVA with or without E. coli or Spirulina LPS and in the presence or absence of anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb. Spirulina LPS significantly suppressed IL-17 production by DO11.10 spleen cells in a dose-dependent manner, regardless of the presence of anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb. However, E. coli LPS augmented IL-17 production (Fig. 4A), possibly because of its ability to induce IL-6 (Fig. 5A). In addition, it is noteworthy that anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb enhanced IL-17 production by DO11.10 spleen cells in response to OVA without the addition of either LPS (Fig. 4A), indicating that IFN-\u03b3 regulates IL-17-producing cells. Thus, Spirulina LPS suppresses the in vivo production of IL-17 with or without involvement of IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, although Spirulina LPS inhibited IL-17 production when CD4 T cells from OVA-primed C3H/HeJ mice were co-cultured with C3H/HeN APCs in the presence of OVA, it failed to suppress IL-17 production when OVA-primed C3H/HeJ CD4 T cells were stimulated with OVA in the context of C3H/HeJ APCs (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that Spirulina LPS acted on APCs to inhibit the generation of Th17 cells in a TLR4-dependent manner. Thus far, our results are consistent with the notion that the antitumor effect of Spirulina LPS is caused by the downregulation of IL-17 production. To examine whether neutralization of IL-17 by anti-IL-17 mAb would result in a reduction of tumor growth in mice in the absence of Spirulina LPS, we injected anti-IL-17 or anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb into C3H/HeN mice 1 day before and 4 days after MH134 tumor implantation, and monitored tumor development. As expected, anti-IL-17 mAb markedly suppressed tumor growth compared to control rat IgG antibodies, whereas anti-IFN-\u03b3 mAb slightly enhanced tumor development (Fig. 4C). Importantly, mice receiving anti-IL-17 mAb exhibited high levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4D). In addition, in vitro culture of spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice treated with anti-IL-17 mAb resulted in the production of large amounts of IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that IL-17 provides an environment suitable for tumor growth partly by inhibiting the generation of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells. It was recently reported that IL-17 is mainly produced by Th17 cells, and that both IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 are indispensable for the generation of Th17 cells (20). To test the ability of Spirulina LPS to induce IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2, normal C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice were injected i.p. with E. coli or Spirulina LPS and serum cytokine levels were measured 4 h later. C3H/HeN mice produced high levels of IL-6 in response to E. coli LPS, but showed only a small response upon stimulation with Spirulina LPS (Fig. 5A). Contrary to IL-6, the substantial TGF-\u03b2 levels present in serum of untreated groups of both strains were not significantly elevated when stimulated with E. coli LPS (Fig. 5A). However, Spirulina LPS slightly reduced TGF-\u03b2 levels, but only in C3H/HeN mice (Fig. 5A). Noteworthy, E. coli LPS elicited a considerable increase in IL-23 levels, only in C3H/HeN mice, while Spirulina LPS showed almost no induction of IL-23 even in C3H/HeN mice (Fig. 5A). Thus, Spirulina LPS seems to be inferior to E. coli LPS in terms of stimulating immune cells. The possibility that Spirulina LPS has a general defect in the stimulation of immune system was excluded, because both E. coli and Spirulina LPS induced B cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Since IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 are known to play a crucial role in the differentiation of IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells (4), we measured the serum levels of IL-12 in tumor-bearing mice that were treated with saline, E. coli, or Spirulina LPS. Spirulina LPS augmented IL-12 production more than E. coli LPS. In contrast to a transient increase of IL-12 by E. coli LPS, the enhanced IL-12 production by Spirulina LPS was still observed after 14 days (Fig. 5C). Of note, these high IL-12 serum levels on day 14 decreased when C3H/HeN mice were injected with anti-CD4, but not anti-CD8 mAb (Fig. 5D), implicating CD4 T cell-dependent IL-12 production. Taken together, these findings support the notion that Spirulina LPS facilitates the priming of CD4 T cells with tumor cells and the subsequent CD4 T cell-dependent activation of APCs, leading to IL-12 production, which in turn induces IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells. We finally examined whether Spirulina LPS is also effective in suppressing the spontaneous development of mammary tumors in female transgenic mice carrying the activated HER-2/neu oncogene. HER-2/neu transgenic mice display apparent hyperplasia in the mammary glands at 10 weeks of age and develop palpable mammary tumors around 24 weeks (28). Female HER-2/neu mice were injected with Spirulina LPS or PBS once per week between 120 and 240 days after birth. Spirulina LPS delayed the appearance of tumors and significantly reduced both tumor incidence and growth (Fig. 6). The IL-12/IFN-\u03b3 pathway is crucial for antitumor immunity by inducing IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells (4,6,7,34). In this context, various adjuvants including microbial products are explored to potentiate antitumor immunity. On the other hand, IL-23/IL-17 signaling plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in humans and mice by inducing angiogenesis and IL-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinase expression (11\u201317). Since most adjuvants induce IL-6, which is indispensable for Th17 differentiation, adjuvants that do not induce or slightly induce IL-6 are desired for tumor immunotherapy. The present study demonstrates that Spirulina LPS is a very poor inducer of IL-6 and IL-23 and that it elicits strong antitumor immunity by suppressing IL-17 induction while enhancing IFN-\u03b3 production through the TLR4 pathway. In a tumor-based mouse model, Spirulina LPS treatment enhanced serum levels of IFN-\u03b3 at early stages of tumor development and decreased serum IL-17 and IL-23 levels at later stages (Fig. 3). Spirulina LPS also induced IL-12 production in a CD4 T cell-dependent manner, probably through CD4 T cell-APC interaction (Fig. 5C and D), and induced IFN-\u03b3 production primarily by CD4 T cells. Based on previous reports on the inhibition of Th17 differentiation by IFN-\u03b3 (32,33), these results can be interpreted as follows: Spirulina LPS facilitates the differentiation of tumor-primed CD4 T cells to Th1 cells. Subsequently, Th1-derived IFN-\u03b3 prevents Th17 differentiation and promotes CD8 T-cell activation. In addition, Spirulina LPS might also suppress IL-17 production through IFN-\u03b3-independent pathways as shown in our in vitro experiments (Fig. 4A). Alternatively, it is possible that although IL-17 elevation during tumor progression could prevent the generation of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells, Spirulina LPS might restore the generation of Th1 cells by reducing IL-17 production (Fig. 3). Recent experiments have revealed IL-17-mediated inhibition of Th1 differentiation (35). It is also conceivable that Spirulina LPS inhibits tumor growth by reducing IL-17-induced angiogenesis, as previously reported (11\u201313,36). Of note, administration of anti-IL-17 mAb into tumor-bearing mice induced marked tumor regression accompanying IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig. 4C and D), consistent with a recent report showing tumor growth inhibition by IL-17 neutralization (15). Regardless of the pathway, Spirulina LPS inhibits tumor growth by skewing the balance between IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 responses toward IFN-\u03b3 production. In this study, Spirulina LPS was shown to inhibit the in vitro generation of IL-17-producing cells through its action on APCs in a TLR4-dependent manner (Fig. 4A and B). There are reports demonstrating that CD86, but not CD80, on APCs plays an important role in the regulation of IL-17 production by T cells (37), and that IL-27 produced by M\u03d5/DC negatively regulates the development of Th17 cells (38). Thus, Spirulina LPS-mediated TLR4 signaling may induce a change in APC status by modulating the expression patterns of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines, leading to the attenuation of Th17 cell development. However, the precise mechanisms by which Spirulina LPS suppresses IL-17 and IL-23 remain to be elucidated. In contrast to the tumor-promoting effects of the IL-17/IL-23 signaling axis, demonstrated in IL-17- or IL-23-deficient mice, several groups have described that Th17 cells or IL-17 promote tumor inhibition by increasing the generation of tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells (39,40). Thus, whether Th17 cells or IL-17 induce tumor progression or antitumor immunity might be dependent on the varied main effector cells in the distinct tumor-host relationship (41). Namely, Th17 cells/IL-17 could activate CD8 T cells, while inhibiting Th1 type of CD4 T cells. Otherwise, the strength of tumor immunogenicity or frequency of tumor-specific effector T cells might cause a discrepancy in the function of Th17 cells/IL-17, because adoptive transfer of tumor-reactive Th17 cells obtained from TCR transgenic mice or from in vitro stimulation with tumor inhibits tumor development (39,40). In either case, IL-17-induced angiogenesis seems to be required to some extent for effector T cells to migrate into tumor tissue. Even in an IL-17-deficient host, IL-17 secreted by tumor cells may contribute to T-cell infiltration. Despite these possible explanations, the paradox in the function of Th17 cells/IL-17 is still unresolved. IL-17 is also produced by certain tumors and IL-17 receptors have been detected in virtually all cells (12). It has been reported that IL-17 stimulates tumor cells to proliferate and upregulates the expression of various cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors, leading to angiogenesis (16,42\u201344). However, we did not detect expression of IL-17 and IL-17 receptor in MH134 tumor cells (data not shown), indicating the importance of IL-17 responses in host-derived cells in MH134 tumor growth. Moreover, although TLR4 was expressed on MH134 tumor cells, E. coli and Spirulina LPS had virtually no effect on the in vitro growth of tumor cells (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that MH134 tumor cells expressed IFN-\u03b3 receptors and that cellular in vitro growth was inhibited by exogenous addition of IFN-\u03b3 (data not shown). Thus, in vivo induction of IFN-\u03b3 by E. coli and Spirulina LPS may partly contribute to the antitumor effects by virtue of the IFN-\u03b3 direct action on the tumor. E. coli LPS induced antitumor effects against a primary tumor, but failed to enhance secondary immune responses in the same tumor after reimplantation (Fig. 2A). E. coli LPS induced high levels of IL-6 and IL-23, favoring the development of Th17 cells, and it considerably activated NK function (Fig. 2B). Thus, it is conceivable that E. coli LPS inhibits primary tumor growth via activation of NK cells, but prevents the generation of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity through IL-17 induction. The effects of E. coli and Spirulina LPS involve TLR4 pathways, but Spirulina LPS was different from E. coli LPS in terms of cytokine induction. The structure of LPS of all gram-negative bacteria consists of a polysaccharide attached to a lipid component, lipid A, which is assumed to be responsible for the induction of cytokines. Although lipid A molecules from different bacteria were initially thought to be similar, recent evidence suggests structural and functional differences among LPS from different species (25,45). Differences in the three-dimensional conformation of lipid A have been proposed to determine the strength of fitness to TLR4-CD14-MD2 complex, leading to the activation of intracellular signaling for cytokines (46,47). LPS fractions from E. coli and Salmonella spp. are more potent cytokine inducers than those from Bordetella pertussis and Bacteroides fragilis (48,49), while lipid A analog and LPS from Rhodobacter spp. have antagonistic properties against cytokine stimulation (47,50). Although the structure of Spirulina LPS remains to be analyzed, the molecular conformation of E. coli LPS seems to be different from that of Spirulina LPS based on its ability to downregulate IL-17 with minimum induction of IL-6 and IL-23. Moreover, Spirulina LPS failed to induce endotoxin shock in contrast to E. coli LPS (20% and 100% survival in mice given 25 \u00b5g of E. coli and Spirulina LPS, respectively, 36 h after administration). Experiments using different Spirulina preparations free of LPS have demonstrated antitumor activity. A calcium-chelating, sulfated polysaccharide from S. platensis suppressed metastasis of murine melanoma (51). Oral administration of hot water extract of Spirulina is reported to suppress tumor growth through IFN-\u03b3-mediated activation of NK cells but not CD8 T cells (52). However, it was not clear whether IL-17 and IL-23 production were involved in the experimental system of that specific study. In contrast to those Spirulina preparations, we used a Spirulina LPS fraction extracted with phenol-water. Differences in the components of the Spirulina extracts may cause distinct bioactivities. In conclusion, Spirulina LPS suppressed tumor growth by downregulating serum IL-17/IL-23 with concomitant induction of IFN-\u03b3 through TLR4. Furthermore, Spirulina LPS showed limited or no induction of IL-6 and IL-23 and altered the cytokine milieu in the tumor-bearing host from the Th17 to the Th1 type. Thus, we confirmed the importance of a balance between IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17/IL-23 levels in the regulation of tumor growth. It is noteworthy that Spirulina LPS was able to suppress spontaneous development of mammary tumors. Our results provide novel insights into the exploitation of TLR-based immunomodulators for cancer immunotherapy."}, "27509880": {"pmid": "27509880", "pmcid": "PMC5022900", "title": "Combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide and 5-fluorouracil upregulates major histocompatibility complex class II and p21 genes and activates caspase-3/7 in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells", "abstract": "\nEpigenetic anticancer drugs such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been combined with existing anticancer drugs for synergistic or additive effects. In the present study, we found that a very low concentration of depsipeptide, an HDAC inhibitor, potentiated the antitumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a human colon cancer cell model using HCT-116, HT29, and SW48 cells via the inhibition of colony formation ability or cellular viability. Exposure to a combination of 5-FU (1.75 \u00b5M) and 1 nM depsipeptide for 24 and 48 h resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in activated caspase-3/7, while 5-FU alone failed to activate caspase-3/7. Microarray and subsequent gene ontology analyses revealed that compared to 5-FU or depsipeptide alone, the combination treatment of 5-FU and depsipeptide upregulated genes related to cell death and the apoptotic process consistent with the inhibition of colony formation and caspase-3/7 activation. These analyses indicated marked upregulation of antigen processing and presentation of peptide or polysaccharide antigen via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class (GO:0002504) and MHC protein complex (GO:0042611). Compared with vehicle controls, the cells treated with the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide showed marked induction (3- to 8.5-fold) of expression of MHC class II genes, but not of MHC class I genes. Furthermore, our global analysis of gene expression, which was focused on genes involved in the molecular regulation of MHC class II genes, showed enhancement of pro-apoptotic PCAF and CIITA after the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide. These results may indicate a closer relationship between elevation of MHC class II expression and cellular apoptosis induced by the combination of depsipeptide and 5-FU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide induces human colon cancer cell apoptosis in a concerted manner with the induction of MHC class II gene expression.\n", "fulltext": "The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reported that colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Drug combinations and administration protocols, and the development of molecular targeted drugs have greatly improved the chemotherapeutic efficiency for CRC. Fluoropyrimidines, especially 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), remain the most important chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of CRC. 5-FU is reported to induce cellular toxicity by inhibiting its target enzyme, thymidylate synthase (TS); it also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the incorporation of fluoronucleotides into RNA and DNA leading to thymidylate depletion (1). 5-FU is the central component in the FOLFIRI regimen with the addition of irinotecan, and the FOLFOX regimen with the addition of oxaliplatin. These combination chemotherapies have resulted in improved response rates and significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival (2,3). However, despite recent advances in CRC chemotherapy, the occurrence of drug resistance hinders effective control of the disease. Moreover, most advanced CRC patients cannot be cured with these refined chemotherapies. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are biological processes that regulate the modification of chromatin structures and are important for gene regulation. Recently, a number of anticancer drugs such as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) have been developed. DNMT and HDAC inhibitors cause DNA demethylation and repressive complex disintegration. This leads to the reactivation of critical genes and the reversal of genome-wide epigenetic alterations in cancer through resetting multiple cellular processes including, lineage commitment, immunomodulation, major cell signaling pathways, cell proliferation, and cell death (4,5). Overexpression or under-expression of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules, such as p53 and bcl-2, can be modulated by various HDAC inhibitors (6). Inhibitors of HDACs are known to exert effects including apoptosis, retardation of cell cycle progression, and cancer cell differentiation, which are specific depending on cancer cell type (7,8). Therefore, a number of HDAC inhibitors have been investigated clinically. Vorinostat, entinostat, panobinostat, valproic acid, depsipeptide, and belinostat have been approved and clinically used. HDAC inhibitors are also used in combination therapy with DNMT inhibitors and other HDAC inhibitors (9). A basic study on combinations of valproic acid and gemcitabine has also been conducted (10). DNMT inhibitors, such as 5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, and zebularine have been studied for various cancers in clinical trials (11). The therapeutic benefits of HDAC inhibitors have been verified as a monotherapy for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and in other malignancies (12). Epigenetic agents are also known to have the ability to reverse the resistance of anticancer drugs (13,14). Furthermore, synergistic or additive effects have been reported when combining epigenetic agents with existing anticancer drugs (15\u201317). Depsipeptide (Dep, also known as FR901228, FK228 and romidepsin), isolated from Chromobacterium violaceum strain WB968, is a unique bicyclic peptide with a non-cysteine disulfide bridge. It is a stable prodrug, which is activated by reduction in cancer cells, to inhibit HDAC class I enzymes, and has been shown to convert H-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells to normal morphology. Thus, Dep is a promising anticancer agent, and indeed, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment for CTCL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (18,19). The glutathione-mediated activation also implicates its clinical usefulness for counteracting glutathione-mediated drug resistance in chemotherapy (20). In addition to their use as monotherapy, there are several studies on the effects and mechanisms of the combination of 5-FU and HDAC inhibitors for CRC treatment. Lee et al reported that trichostatin A enhanced 5-FU cytotoxicity by downregulating the expression of both TYMS mRNA and TS protein in colon cancer cells (21). Tumber et al reported that belinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, synergized with 5-FU to inhibit colon cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and this combination therapy increased DNA fragmentation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and downregulated TYMS in HCT116 cells (22). Di Gennaro et al found that modulation of TYMS and p53 expression by vorinostat resulted in synergistic antitumor effects in combination with 5-FU or raltitrexed (23). Fazzone et al reported that panobinostat suppressed TYMS gene expression and synergized with fluoropyrimidines in colon cancer cells (24). Little is known concerning the combinatorial effects of 5-FU and Dep for CRC, which prompted us to investigate the combination of HDAC inhibitors, namely, Dep, apicidin, and oxamflatin, with 5-FU. We previously found that among these HDAC inhibitors, Dep potentiated the cytotoxicity of 5-FU against human colon cancer cells, HCT-116. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the mode of the combined effect of 5-FU and Dep in HCT-116 cells (i.e., additive or synergistic), and to elucidate the genetic mechanism of the drug-drug interaction in a cell-based model using microarray analysis. Human colon carcinoma HCT-116 (no. CCL-247), HT29 (no. HTB-38) and SW48 cell lines (no. CCL-231) [all from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA] were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; 4.5 g/l D-glucose; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, South Logan, VT, USA) and antibiotics (Gibco) at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. Dep was purchased from Selleck Chemicals LLC (Houston, TX, USA). 5-FU was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). All other chemicals used were of the highest grade available. HCT-116 cells were exposed for 7 days to either vehicle alone, 5-FU alone, Dep alone, or a combination of 5-FU and Dep for assessment of inhibition of colony formation and gene expression analysis. The concentrations used for colony formation analysis were 0.875, 1.25, 1.75 and 2.5 \u00b5M for 5-FU; 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 nM for Dep; and 0.875 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep (0.1 or 1 nM), 1.25 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep (0.1 or 1 nM), and 1.75 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep (0.1 or 1 nM). Concentrations used for gene expression analysis and caspase-3 activation assay were 1.75 \u00b5M for 5-FU; 1 nM for Dep; and 1.75 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep 1 nM. HT29 cells were exposed for 10 days to either vehicle alone, 5-FU alone, Dep alone, or a combination of 5-FU and Dep for assessment of inhibition of colony formation. The concentrations used for colony formation analysis were 0.313, 0.438, 0.625 and 0.875 \u00b5M for 5-FU; 0.125, 0.25, 0.375 and 0.5 nM for Dep; and 0.313 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep (0.375 nM), 0.438 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep (0.375 nM), and 0.625 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep (0.375 nM). SW48 cells were exposed for 7 days to either vehicle-only, 5-FU alone, Dep alone, or a combination of 5-FU and Dep for crystal violet assay. The concentrations used for the crystal violet assay were, 0.438, 0.625, 0.875 and 1.75 \u00b5M for 5-FU; 0.125, 0.25, 0.375 and 0.5 nM for Dep; and 0.438 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep (0.2 nM), 0.625 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep (0.2 nM), and 0.875 \u00b5M 5-FU plus Dep (0.2 nM). HCT-116 cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded for the colony formation assay in 60-mm dishes at 20,000 cells/dish. HT29 cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded for the colony formation assay in 60-mm dishes at 10,000 cells/dish. After incubation for 7 to 10 days, the colonies were stained with crystal violet and the numbers of positive colonies were counted. Colonies containing more than 50 cells were regarded as positive and were scored, and each assay was conducted in triplicate and three separate assays were performed on three different days. We measured cell viability in SW48 cells by direct staining of the cells using crystal violet assay (25) as SW48 cells have poor colony-forming ability. SW48 cells were trypsinized, counted, and seeded for the crystal violet assay in 6-well plate at 50,000 cells/well. After incubation for 7 days, the medium was removed and any adherent cells were fixed to the plate with 10% formaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then stained with an aqueous solution of 0.5% crystal violet followed by elution of the dye with 33% aqueous acetic acid. Absorbance at 550 nm was determined with a micro-plate reader, Infinite F500 (Tecan Group Ltd., M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland). Each assay was conducted in triplicate and three separate assays were performed on three different days. Luminescent caspase-3/7 activation assay was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Caspase-Glo\u2122 3/7 assay; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). HCT-116 cells were inoculated into each well of a white-walled 96-well plate (4,000 cells/well), treatment reagents were added and incubated was carried out for 0, 24 and 48 h. After incubation for 1 h with Caspase-Glo\u2122 reagent, the enzymatic activity of caspase-3/7 was measured using a microplate reader, Infinite F500 (Tecan Group Ltd.). The background luminescence associated with the cell culture and assay reagent (blank reaction) was subtracted from the experimental values. Mean values of four replicates were used to represent caspase-3/7 activity. To enable normalization of data to total cellular protein content, the Lowry assay (26) was conducted for all samples according to the manufacturer's instructions (Protein Assay Lowry kit; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Data are expressed as relative light units (RLU)/\u00b5g of protein. Total RNA was extracted from three independent HCT-116 cell cultures using the Rneasy Mini kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany). Total RNAs (1 \u00b5g) were used for cDNA synthesis using a cDNA synthesis kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Using first-strand cDNA, real-time PCR was performed using a 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). The sequences of amplification primers are shown in Table I. For DNA microarray analysis, total RNA (50 ng) was labeled with cyanine-3 using a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The labeled targets were hybridized to SurePrint G3 Human 8\u00d760K oligo DNA microarrays and hybridized micro-arrays were scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner (both from Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Image analysis and raw array data generation were processed using Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Normalization of the raw array data was performed using GeneSpring software. Following quantile normalization of the raw data, data sets were further reduced by filtering noise of the signal, including gIsSaturated, gIsFeatNonUnifOL, gIsFeatPopnOLg, and gIsWellAboveBG. Finally, we identified gene lists that showed at least 1.5-fold upregulation or downregulation. The PANTHER classification system (www.pantherdb.org/tools/genexAnalysis.jsp) was used for functional classification of genes. Mi et al discussed the procedure for classification of proteins using PANTHER, a web tool for analyzing protein family trees and functions (27). The overall process of PANTHER Protein Library data generation consisted of three major steps: family clustering, phylogenetic tree building, and annotation of tree nodes. The requirements for being family clusters in PANTHER are as follows: The family must contain at least five members among which at least one gene must be listed as a Gene Ontology (GO) reference genome.In order to support phylogenetic inference, the family should be aligned with high quality sequence data.A certain length of aligned sequences stored in at least 30 sites should be aligned across 75% or more of the family members for creation of proper family clusters. A statistical enrichment test was performed for each molecular function, biological process, or cellular component. The genes associated with a particular ontology term were evaluated according to the likelihood of the numerical values of genes that were drawn randomly from the overall distribution of values. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the P-value. A number of genes, which were induced in large extent by our microarray analysis, were classified according to a number of statistical tests that were performed by the PANTHER classification system. As a result, PANTHER classification concluded that induction of a considerable number of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes was a characteristic change in global gene expression caused by the present drug combination of 5-FU and Dep (discussed in Results). The details of using this tool are described in the PANTHER user manual for PANTHER 9.0. Data are represented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM) and analyzed for statistical significance using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey-Kramer test as a post hoc test. A P-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant result. The approximate IC50 value of the HCT-116 cells to 5-FU was 1.90 \u00b5M. However, Dep was almost 2,000-fold active in terms of molar concentration to inhibit colony formation ability of HCT-116 compared with 5-FU. Fig. 1A and B shows the dose-response curves of 5-FU and Dep, respectively. Fig. 1C shows the reduction of survival fraction for the combination of 5-FU and Dep, 5-FU alone, and Dep alone. The combination of 1.75 \u00b5M 5-FU and 1 nM Dep suppressed colony formation to 30% compared with vehicle-only. This combination suppressed colony formation ability with statistical significance compared with 5-FU only (P<0.01). HCT-116 cells became less sensitive to 5-FU in combination with 0.1 nM Dep compared with 5-FU only, which was not marked. The approximate IC50 value of HT29 to 5-FU was 0.68 \u00b5M. However, Dep was almost 2,000-fold active in terms of molar concentration to inhibit colony formation ability of HT29 cells compared with 5-FU. Fig. 1D and E shows the dose-response curves of 5-FU and Dep, respectively. Fig. 1F illustrates the reduction in survival fraction for the combination of 5-FU and Dep, 5-FU alone, and Dep alone. The combination of 0.625 \u00b5M 5-FU and 0.375 nM Dep suppressed colony formation to 35% compared with vehicle-only. This combination suppressed colony formation ability with statistical significance compared with 5-FU-only (P<0.01). The approximate IC50 value of SW48 to 5-FU was 1.15 \u00b5M. However, Dep was almost 5,000-fold active in terms of molar concentration to inhibit cellular viability of the SW48 cells compared with 5-FU. Fig. 1G and H shows the dose-response curves of 5-FU and Dep, respectively. Fig. 1I illustrates the reduction in survival fraction for the combination of 5-FU and Dep, 5-FU alone, and Dep alone. The combination of 0.875 \u00b5M 5-FU and 0.2 nM Dep suppressed cellular viability to 25% compared with vehicle alone. This combination suppressed cellular viability with statistical significance compared with 5-FU alone (P<0.01). As shown in Fig. 2, the time course of caspase-3/7 activation was examined in the HCT-116 cells following treatment with 5-FU (1.75 \u00b5M) alone, Dep (1 nM) alone, and the combination of 5-FU and Dep. At 24 h, the combination of 5-FU and Dep markedly enhanced caspase-3/7 activation compared to the vehicle control (3.8-fold-change, P<0.01). Dep alone also showed a 2.0-fold increase (P<0.01) compared to the vehicle control. At 48 h, the combination of 5-FU and Dep increased caspase-3/7 activation compared to the vehicle control (2.8-fold-change, P<0.01). 5-FU alone and Dep alone slightly increased caspase-3/7 activation compared to the vehicle control (1.4-fold, P<0.05; and 1.5-fold, P<0.01, respectively). To examine the gene expression profile after drug exposure, we conducted a microarray analysis of the cells treated for 7 days with the vehicle control, 5-FU alone, Dep alone, and the combination of 5-FU with Dep as described in Materials and methods. Results of the gene expression profile were analyzed by gene ontology in order to clarify what mRNAs were upregulated (Table II) or down-regulated (Table III) after treatment with each drug alone or with combination of 5-FU and Dep. To indicate the biological significance of cellular processes affected by the combination treatment, we listed the fold enrichment in descending order in Tables II and III. Analysis of PANTHER GO-Slim biological Process and Cellular Component revealed a marked increase in mRNA levels of MHC class-related gene ontologies (GO:000254 and GO:0042611, respectively). We examined levels of mRNAs encoded by various genes in the cells treated with 5-FU or Dep alone, and the combination of 5-FU and Dep by qRT-PCR method (Fig. 3). The levels of TS mRNA encoded by the TYMS gene were decreased by 42% in the cells treated with the combination of 5-FU and Dep with statistical significance (P<0.01). Slight, but statistically significant downregulation was observed for HDAC1 mRNA in the cells treated with the 5-FU and Dep combination. Dep alone and the combination of 5-FU and Dep decreased cellular p16 mRNA levels by 60 and 64%, respectively. Regardless of the presence of Dep, 5-FU induced p21 levels; marked changes in p21 levels by 396% were observed without Dep, and by 764% with combination of 5-FU and Dep with statistical significance (P<0.01). Dep reduced TP53 levels by 75%. 5-FU alone also slightly decreased TP53 levels by 42%. 5-FU considerably decreased the bCL2 mRNA level to 59%, which was apparently restored in the presence of Dep (to 103% in the combination with 5-FU). An unremarkable change was observed in bAK1 mRNA in the cells following treatment with either 5-FU alone or Dep alone (138 and 86%, respectively). The combination of these drugs slightly increased the bAK1 mRNA level to 160%, which was statistically significant compared with the vehicle control (P<0.05), and with Dep only (P<0.01). Regarding BAX, 5-FU increased the BAX mRNA level to 163%. The combination of Dep with 5-FU decreased bAX mRNA to 49% of the vehicle control, which was statistically significant compared with 5-FU only (P<0.01), and with the vehicle control (P<0.05). We examined levels of MHC class II and I mRNA by qRT-PCR in the cells treated with 5-FU or Dep alone, and a combination of 5-FU and Dep (Fig 4). MHC class II genes, including HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1 were markedly upregulated in combination with 5-FU and Dep (P<0.01) to 432, 298, 667 and 847%, respectively, compared to the vehicle controls. Dep alone slightly increased levels of MHC class II genes, including HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1 by 52, 38, 157 and 168%, respectively. Compared with Dep alone, the combination with 5-FU greatly elevated mRNA levels of these MHC class II genes, namely, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1 with statistical significance (P<0.01). In the HT29 and SW48 cells, increased expression level of HLA-DRA (MHC class II gene) was observed with statistical significance in combination of 5-FU and Dep by real-time PCR (data not shown). No change in the levels of MHC class I genes including HLA-A, HLA-B-HLA-C were observed following treatment with 5-FU, Dep, or 5-FU plus Dep. We further analyzed the results of our global analysis of gene expression, which were focused on genes involved in the molecular regulation of MHC class II genes. As described in Table IV, we found the highest degree of increased expression levels of PCAF, CREB3, CREB5, and CIITA after the combination of 5-FU and Dep. PCAF, a histone acetyltransferase, is related to apoptotic cell processes, and CREB3, CREB5 and CIITA are related to MHC class II gene expression. On the contrary, ATF4, a member of the CREB family, was slightly downregulated following treatment with 5-FU or Dep alone, and markedly downregulated by the combination of 5-FU and dep. In the present study, we found the HDAC inhibitor, Dep, potentiated 5-FU cytotoxicity via inhibition of colony formation ability in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells (Fig. 1). The primary findings of our study were that Dep augments the effects of 5-FU in HCT-116 cells, and that activation of caspase-3/7 is the underlying mechanism. Moreover, the importance of MHC class II and p21 (CDKN1A) upregulation (Figs. 4 and 3, respectively) in the effect of the combination of 5-FU and Dep was revealed. Dep was previously reported to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in small cell lung cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway by suppressing the expression of BCL2 family members (28). In contrast, the present study did not show a marked reduction in HCT-116 cells. These results indicated that the sensitization of HCT-116 cells to the combination of 5-FU and Dep was not likely to be mediated by changes in expression of BCL2 family members (28). Exposure of cancer cells to 5-FU elevated the expression of p21 (CDKN1A), and the combination of Dep with 5-FU further enhanced this mRNA expression of p21 (CDKN1A) (Fig. 3). Induction of p21 using a tetracycline-inducible vector system showed that p21 plays an important role in the induction of growth arrest in tumor cells (29). A critical role of p21 has been described as a critical mediator of cytotoxicity of 5-FU (30). These results are consistent with our present results that the 5-FU-induced and Dep-enhanced p21 (CDKN1A) expression are both associated with cell cycle arrest. Our present microarray and the successive gene ontology analyses revealed that combination of 5-FU and Dep markedly increased the mRNA levels of MHC class II genes, namely, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB1 (Fig. 4). This marked activation of MHC class II gene expression, however, was not noted following treatment with 1.75 \u00b5M 5-FU alone, or 1 nM depsipeptide alone. The HCT-116 cells treated with the combination underwent caspase 3/7-associated apoptosis. Therefore, activation of MHC class II expression may have some relationship with the cell apoptotic process. Ting and Trowsdale described positively regulated control of MHC class II expression, which was mediated by DNA binding factors including NF-Y, CREB, and RFX, and the coactivator, CIITA, general transcription factors, and histone acetyltransferases including P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) (31). Among them, PCAF was reported to accelerate cancer cell apoptosis by counteracting the anti-apoptotic cellular process (32). In addition, an HDAC inhibitor was reported to enhance MHC class II expression in both CIITA-dependent and -independent manners (33). Our present results of augmentation of MHC class II gene expression after the treatment with 5-FU combined with an HDAC inhibitor, depsipeptide, may be collateral antitumor events for the induction of cellular apoptosis by 5-FU. Our global analysis of gene expression indicated marked induction of MHC class II members together with PCAF (also called KAT2B), CREB3, CREB5, and CIITA (Table IV), which may be correlated with a number of apoptotic cell processes, by the combination of 5-FU and depsipeptide. In fact, higher 5-FU concentrations revealed dose-dependent MHC class II induction (unpublished data). Collectively, our present results may indicate a closer relationship between the elevation of MHC class II expression and cellular apoptosis induced by antitumor agent, 5-FU. Furthermore, we are investigating whether induction of MHC class II proteins after 5-FU-based chemotherapy is a prognostic marker. On the other hand, previous reports have documented the importance of histone acetylation as a positive regulator of MHC class II transcription and that HDAC inhibitors augment the expression of tumor cell MHC class II (34\u201336). Dep may affect the differentiation of colon cancer cells because of the close correlation already shown between the expression of HLA-DR antigen and the differentiation of tumor cells using gastric carcinoma models (37,38). West et al recently proposed that HDAC inhibitors require the immune system to exert their anticancer effects (39). Downregulation of immune-system-related genes including MHC class II genes was shown to associate cooperatively with the metastatic potential of early stage colorectal carcinoma (40). Our present results are in agreement with concepts raised very recently that immune systems where MHC class II genes are involved have a considerable relationship with successful cancer chemotherapy and/or less cancer cell malignancies. Therefore, our present results imply that 5-FU combined with Dep synergistically enhances the expression of tumor cell surface immunological proteins (i.e., marked inductions of MHC class II genes). This is consistent with what is known concerning the concerted mechanisms of therapeutic drugs and immune systems in cancer chemotherapy. In conclusion, the combination of 5-FU and Dep sensitized human colon cancer HCT-116, HT29, and SW48 cells. The sensitization in the HCT-116 cells likely occurred through apoptosis induction shown by caspase-3/7 activation, induction of cell cycle arrest shown by p21 (CDKN1A) upregulation, and induction of MHC class II gene expression. MHC class II gene induction may render cancer chemotherapy more effective through a possible cooperation of the immune system with cancer chemotherapy. Epigenetic modulation of existing anticancer drugs may be considered for development of novel cancer chemotherapy."}, "28260077": {"pmid": "28260077", "pmcid": "PMC5364980", "title": "Atorvastatin protects against contrast-induced nephropathy via anti-apoptosis by the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro", "abstract": "\nContrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic acute renal failure occurring following the intravascular injection of iodinated radiographic contrast medium. However, the regulatory mechanisms for CIN remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate whether atorvastatin protects against CIN via anti-apoptotic effects by the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether atorvastatin attenuated CIN, the inflammatory response and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, a rat model of iopamidol-induced CIN was used, and human embryonic proximal tubule (HK2) cell damage was assessed. The rats were assigned into four groups (n=10 per group), as follows: Control rats; rats+atorvastatin; rats + iopamidol; rats+iopamidol+atorvastatin. In vitro, the HK2 cells were treated with iopamidol in the presence or absence of atorvastatin, heat shock protein (Hsp)27 small interfering (si)RNA or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27. The renal tissues were examined histopathologically and collected for western blot analysis. The results showed that atorvastatin ameliorated the apoptosis and deterioration of renal function (P<0.05). Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the iopamidol-induced activity of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax)/caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in vivo and in vitro. Notably, following treatment with Hsp27 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27, it was found that iopamidol enhanced or weakened the upregulation of Bax/caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 in the HK2 cells, respectively. The results of the present study suggested that atorvastatin protected against contrast-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis through the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro.\n", "fulltext": "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an acute renal failure, which occurs following the use of contrast medium (CM) for diagnostic imaging and interventional procedures, including angiography. It is the third leading cause of hospital-acquired renal failure worldwide (1). There is no specific therapy or standard preventive procedure, with the exception of hydration and minimizing the dosage of CM, which do not provide optimal prevention (2,3). In previous years, several clinical investigations have been performed, and it has been confirmed that CIN results in increased medical costs, prolonged admissions, disease deterioration, dialysis, long-term decline in renal function and associated mortality rates (4\u20136). Thus, it is important and urgent to improve current understanding of the mechanism by which CIN occurs and develop novel preventive therapies. Apoptosis is considered to be a characteristic of acute kidney injury, including ischemia and anoxia, inflammatory reactions and damage from drug toxicity (3). The apoptosis of renal tubular cells is an important pathological alteration in the pathogenesis of CIN, and the occurrence of apoptosis is expected to be important in therapy for improving nephropathy (7,8). Statins exert several effects through their non-lipid-associated mechanisms. These so-called pleiotropic effects encompass several mechanisms, which modify inflammatory responses, endothelial function, plaque stability and apoptosis (9,10). The effectiveness of statin pretreatment in reducing the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) has been examined in a number of observational and randomized investigations (11\u201312). There is a general consensus that statins merit further investigation for the prevention of CIAKI. The present study investigated whether atorvastatin can ameliorate iopamidol-induced apoptosis in CIN rats and HK2 cells. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are recognized molecular chaperones and function as cytoprotective proteins. HSPs protect other intracellular proteins from denaturation and aggregation, which occur in response to oxidative stress (13). Hsp27 is a ubiquitous HSP, the expression of which is induced in response to a wide variety of unfavorable physiological and environmental conditions (13,14). Classically, the activation of the expression of Hsp27 occurs be due to an increase in the total protein expression of Hsp27 and/or due to increased activation of an upstream kinase, which phosphorylates Hsp27 (13). It has been reported that Hsp27 protect cells from otherwise pathological circumstances, predominantly through their involvement in pathways of cell death, including necrosis and apoptosis (13,14). However, the intracellular signaling modulation of Hsp27 in CIN remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine whether atorvastatin can protect against CIN due to anti-apoptotic effects and to identify the possible mechanisms of Hsp27 regulation. All experimental procedures were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (15) and were in compliance with the guidelines specified by the Chinese Heart Association policy on research in animal use and the Public Health Service policy on the use of laboratory animals. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the present study, which, in addition to the basal diet used, were purchased from Sun Yat-Sen University Laboratory Animal Centre (Guangzhou, China). A total of 40 male rats weighing between 280 and 320 g were used in the experiment. The rats were housed in multiple mouse racks and acclimated for 1 week in groups (five mice per cage) with free access to a mycotoxin-free diet and tap water. The rats were housed at a constant temperature (25\u00b12\u00b0C) and constant humidity (60\u00b15%), with artificial lighting every 12 h. The rats were acclimated for 7 days and then divided into four groups (n=10/group), as follows: Control rats (CR); rats+atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day; CA); rats + iopamidol (CM); rats+iopamidol+atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day; CMA). CIN was induced using nonionic low-osmolar iopamidol, as previously described (16). Following a 16-h dehydration period, the iopamidol (Shanghai Bracco Sine Pharmaceutical Corp. Ltd., Shanghai, China) was administered intravenously into the internal carotid artery for 5 min at a dose of 2.9 g iodine/kg body weight. The control rats received an equal volume of normal saline. The plasma and kidney samples were collected, and the rats were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection with 10% chloral hydrate (300mg/kg) and subsequently sacrificed. 7 days post-iopamidol injection. Atorvastatin was donated by Pfizer, Inc. (New York, NY, USA). Iopamidol was obtained from Bracco S.p.A. (Milan, Italy). The experimental animals received no water for 16 h prior to injection of the left internal carotid artery with contrast agents, 0.3% pentobarbital sodium and 1 ml/100 g anesthesia. The iopamidol 370 (2.9 g iodine/kg; 5-min injection) was injected through the left internal carotid artery, whereas the animals in the control group received saline. The CMA group was treated with atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 2 ml of saline) 1 day prior to CM injection and 3 days following CM injection. The CA group was treated with atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 2 ml of saline) for 4 days without CM injection. Blood was collected from the left femoral artery, and the serum was separated by 12,000 \u00d7 g centrifugation for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to assess renal function. The kidneys were removed for biochemical and histopathological investigations. The concentrations of creatinine (Scr) and urea (BUN) in the serum and urine were analyzed as indicators of injured glomerular function. Creatinine clearance (ml/min) was calculated according to the following formula: UV / P, where U represents creatinine concentration in the urine (mg/dl), V represents urine volume (ml/min) and P represents serum creatinine (mg/dl). The fractional excretion of sodium was calculated according to the following formula: (Urine sodium / serum sodium) \u00d7 (serum creatinine / urine creatinine) \u00d7 100. Urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1) was measured using ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). TUNEL staining for cell apoptosis in renal tissues was used to evaluate the extent of apoptosis according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Tissues were imaged using a fluorescent microscope. The HK2 cells lines were grown in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-F12 mixture (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 2 mmol/l L-glutamine and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The cells were routinely passaged when 80\u201385% confluent. The media, sera and antibiotics for cell culture were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). Prior to treatment, the cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 low glucose (5 mM) for 24 h. Basal (5 mM) glucose culture media was produced as described previously (11). Protein electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (Richmond, VA, USA). The HK2 cells were pretreated with atorvastatin at a dose of 0.2 \u00b5mol/l at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The dose of atorvastatin was selected according to the standard doses used in cell lines. When the cells culture was at ~80% confluence, the cells were serum-starved for 12 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2, following which they were used in the following experiments: i) Time-course experiments. The HK2 cells (~80% confluence) were treated with iopamidol (200 mg/ml) for 0, 4, 8, 16, 24 or 48 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The cells were analyzed using a cell titer proliferation assay and harvested for reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses to determine the expression levels of Hsp27, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved/total caspase-3. The cell activity levels were assessed by cell death quantification. ii) Investigation of the effect of atorvastatin on iopamidol-induced cell apoptosis. The HK2 cells (~80% confluence) were treated in the following groups at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2: Control group; atorvastatin (0.2 \u00b5mol/l); iopamidol (200 mgI/ml); iopamidol (200 mgI/ml) + atorvastatin (0.2 \u00b5mol/l). The cells were harvested for western blot analysis to determine the expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved/total caspase-3 and Hsp27. The levels of apoptosis were assessed using TUNEL staining. iii) Investigation of the role of Hsp27 in mediating iopamidol-induced HK2 cell apoptosis. The HK2 cells (~80% confluence) were treated in the following groups at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2: Iopamidol (200 mgI/ml); iopamidol (200 mgI/ml) + Hsp27 siRNA (400 pmol); iopamidol (200 mgI/ml) + pcDNA3.1-Hsp27 (2 \u00b5g) for 24 h. The expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved/total caspase-3 was analyzed by western blot analysis. The levels of apoptosis were assessed using TUNEL staining. The assay was performed with the use of the Colorimetric CaspACE assay system (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were harvested in caspase assay buffer, and proteins were quantified using a Bradford assay. A 50 \u00b5g quantity of protein was used. A TUNEL kit, purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany) was used to label the apoptotic cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells with brown particles visible in their nuclei were apoptotic cells. Under a high-power microscope (magnification, \u00d7400), five visual fields were randomly collected and analyzed using pathological image software (Motic Med 6.0; Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China), and the positive cells were counted, with the average value of the five visual fields used as the index of cell apoptosis. The cells were transfected with Hsp27 siRNA or nontargeting control siRNA using DharmaFECT siRNA transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) when at ~80% confluence for 24 h. The Hsp27 siRNA oligos consisted of three target-specific siRNAs, and were designed and applied as a pool to knock down the gene expression of Hsp27. The target sequences were as follows: Sense 5\u2032-GAG UGG UCG CAG UGG UUA Gtt-3\u2032, antisense 5\u2032-CUA ACC ACU GCG ACC ACU Ctt-3\u2032; sense 5\u2032-GAC GAG CUG ACG GUC AAG Att-3\u2032, antisense 5\u2032-UCU UGA CCG UCA GCU CGU Ctt-3\u2032; sense 5\u2032-CCA CGC AGU CCA ACG AGA Utt-3\u2032, antisense 5\u2032-AUC UCG UUG GAC UGC GUG Gtt-3\u2032. The medium was then replaced with fresh culture medium containing 10 mmol/l CA for 0.5 or 24 h, and protein expression was examined using western blot analysis. For the luciferase assay, the cells were transfected with p2xARE/Luc vectors (Promega Corporation) prior to CA treatment. PCR was used to amplify the Hsp27 fragment of the pMD-Hsp27 vector. The 5\u2032 primer (5\u2032-AAA GAA TTC ATG ACC GAG CGC CGC GTC-3\u2032) and the 3\u2032 primer (5\u2032-TTT GGA TCC TTA CTT GGC GGC AGT CTC A-3\u2032) were engineered using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. A 50-\u00b5l amplification reaction sample containing each primer (1 mM), 10 \u00b5g pMD-Hsp27 vector and 1 unit Pfu DNA polymerase (Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was subjected to 30 amplification cycles at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 1 min 30 sec. Adenylate was added to the 618-bp amplification product at the 3\u2032-end by Taq DNA polymerase, and the fragment was cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Promega Corporation), termed pMD18-T-Hsp27. The pMD18-T-Hsp27 was digested with EcoRI to obtain the Hsp27 fragment, and then cloned to the pcDNA3.1-puro vector, which was digested with XbaI and NheI through flat-end cloning. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. The resulting plasmid, pcDNA3.1-Hsp27, was subjected to sequence analysis to confirm the integrity of the inserted element. The pcDNA3.1-puro-XbaI-NheI fragment was self-ligated as a comparison plasmid, termed pcDNA3.1. Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used for stable transfection according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA from the cultured cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using a SYBR ExScript RT-PCR kit (Toboyo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. RNA (1 \u00b5g) was converted into cDNA using a PrimeScript\u2122 RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT-qPCR analysis was performed using SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex Taq\u2122 II (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) in the ABI PRISM\u00ae 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). PCR was performed with the cDNA templates in a reaction buffer containing 6.25 pM of each primer with the following standard settings: Denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing for 30 sec at 65\u00b0C or 55\u00b0C and extension for 30 sec at 72\u00b0C. A total of 30 cycles were performed for amplification. \u03b2-actin was used as an endogenous control. Melting curves were used to evaluate non-specific amplification. The relative expression level was calculated using the \u0394\u0394Cq method (17). The primer sequences used are presented in Table I. The western blot analysis was performed as described previously (18). Briefly, 40 \u00b5g proteins of the total cellular extracts were heated at 99\u00b0C for 5 min and loaded onto each lane. Following electrophoresis using 10\u201312% SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked at room temperature for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing 5% skim milk and probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membrane was washed with TBS-T and incubated with a mouse anti-goat monoclonal horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution; cat. no. ab6721; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Danvers, MA, USA). The following primary antibodies obtained from Abcam were used: Bax (1:500 dilution; cat. no. ab32503); Bcl-2 (1:500 dilution; cat. no. ab59348); cleaved caspase-3 (1:1,000 dilution; cat. no. ab13847); total caspase-3 (1:1,000 dilution; cat. no. ab52293); Hsp27 (1:500 dilution; cat. no. ab5579); and \u03b2-actin (1:5,000 dilution; cat. no. ab8227). The results of the various proteins were normalized by the corresponding results of \u03b2-actin and are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation from at least five independent experiments, which were performed with cells from different isolations. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test (SPSS v23.0; IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. In the present study, 10 rats were randomly divided into each group. All the rats survived until the end of the study. Atorvastatin decreased levels of SCr, BUN, urine microprotein and uKIM-1 in the CIN rats. The animals subjected to CIN in the iopamidol groups presented with significantly increased levels of SCr, BUN and uKIM-1, compared with those in the control group. However, the levels of SCr, BUN, urine microprotein and uKIM-1 were all decreased in the rats treated with atorvastatin, as shown in Table II. Thus, atorvastatin attenuated the levels of renal function parameters. As shown in Table III, no significant differences were found between the CR and CA group in the levels of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Compared with the CR group, the CM group had higher serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 (P<0.01), IL-1\u03b2 (P<0.05) and IL-6 (P<0.05). However, compared with the CM group, treatment with atorvastatin reduced the CM-induced increase in TNF-\u03b1 (P<0.05), IL-1\u03b2 (P<0.05) and IL-6 (P<0.05). In the CA group, the serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were lower, compared with those in the CR group, however, this difference was not statistically significant. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 are known inflammatory parameters, which can lead to apoptosis. The findings of the present study suggested that atorvastatin attenuated CM-induced renal damage by modulating inflammatory responses. As shown in Fig. 1Aa and b, renal injury was more severe in the CM group, compared with the CR and CA groups (P<0.01), however, the degree of injury was less severe in the CMA group, compared with the CM group (P<0.05), suggesting that atorvastatin significantly protected the kidney against CIM. The TUNEL staining (Fig 1B) was also more intense in the CM group, compared with either the CR or CA groups. The percentage of apoptotic cells was lower in the CR group, compared with the CM group (P<0.01; Fig. 1C), whereas the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the CM group, compared with the CMA group (P<0.05). As shown in Fig. 2, the RT-qPCR and western blot analyses revealed the expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3. The mRNA levels of Bax were increased in the CM group and decreased in CMA group (Fig. 2A), however, Bcl-2 was negatively correlated with Bax (Fig. 2B). Bax (Fig. 2Ca and b) and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 2Da and b) were significantly increased in the CM group (P<0.01), and decreased in the CMA group (P<0.05). However, the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly decreased in the CM group and increased in the CMA group (P<0.05). The exposure of HK2 cells to iopamidol induced a decrease in cell viability (Fig. 3A). This reaction was evident at 12 h and reached a peak 24 h following iopamidol treatment. It was also found that iopamidol increased the mRNA expression levels of Bax in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B), which was similar with the levels of cell viability. Notably, the mRNA level of Bcl-2 (Fig. 3B) and Hsp27 (Fig.3C), and the protein expression levels of Bcl-2 and Hsp27 (Fig. 3Da and b) decreased at 12 h and reached a peak at 24 h, which was negatively correlated with the levels of cell apoptosis. The protein expression of Bax increased in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, caspase-3 activity was upregulated at 12 h and reached a peak at 24 h (Fig 3E). Exposure of the HK2 cells to iopamidol also induced an increase in the activities of Bax (Fig. 4Aa and b) and caspase-3 (Fig. 4Ba and b), and a decrease in the activity of Bcl-2 (Fig. 4A). Following treatment with atorvastatin, the activities of Bax and caspase-3 decreased, whereas that of Bcl-2 increased (Fig. 4A and B). TUNEL staining (Fig. 4Ca and b) was also more intense in the presence of iopamidol, and was weakened following atorvastatin treatment (P<0.05). In the HK2 cells exposed to iopamidol, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Hsp27 were reduced at 12 h, peaked at 24 h (Fig. 3C and D), and were negatively correlated with the levels of cell apoptosis. Furthermore, although exposure of the HK2 cells to iopamidol induced a decrease in the level of Hsp27, treatment with atorvastatin resulted in an increase in the level of Hsp27 (Fig. 4A), which was negatively correlated with the levels of cells apoptosis in the TUNEL staining (P<0.05; Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 5Aa and b, immunohistochemical staining for Hsp27 was decreased in the CM group, but upregulated in the presence of atorvastatin. In addition, it was shown that CM induced a decrease in the mRNA levels of Hsp27 (P<0.05), and these increased significantly following atorvastatin treatment (P<0.05; Fig. 5B). Similar changes were found in Hsp27 protein via western blot analysis (Fig. 5Ca and b). The upregulation of Hsp27 was accompanied by improvements in levels of cell apoptosis, which was associated with a reduction in inflammatory markers and improvements in renal function (Tables II and III). Following transfection with Hsp27 siRNA or the Hsp27 plasmid, it was found that the expression levels of Bax/caspase-3 (Fig. 5D and E) were increased and reduced by the inhibition and overexpression of Hsp27, respectively, with negative correlation with Bcl-2 (Fig. 5D), as detected using western blot analysis. Iopamidol also induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 5Fa and b). This suggested that the iopamidol-induced downregulation of Hsp27 may be one of the causes for HK2 cell apoptosis. The foundation of the prophylaxis of CIAKI is hydration; however, strategies to prevent CM-induced renal cell apoptosis appear to have indispensable clinical involvement. Previous clinical trials have been performed with the use of various antioxidant compounds with the aim of lowering the occurrence of CIAKI (2,4). The present study showed the protective effect of atorvastatin on CM-induced renal cell damage. CIN is a type of renal injury caused, not only due to the toxicity of contrast media, but also due to renal ischemia, inflammatory reactions and cell apoptosis. According to the results of the present study, atorvastatin ameliorated renal injury, cell apoptosis and the deterioration of renal function. Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the inflammatory reaction, suppressed caspase-3 activity, and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in vivo and in vitro. Notably, the results of the present study suggested that iopamidol-induced HK2 cell apoptosis may be caused by the downregulation of Hsp27. The inflammatory reaction is important in the pathogenesis of CIN. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 are pro-inflammatory cytokines, which recruit numerous mediators associated with endothelial and tissue injury. In a mouse model of nephrotoxicity and in clinical trials, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 have been shown to be central in activation of the inflammatory cytokine response (11,16). The results of the present study further confirmed these previous findings, and demonstrated that the levels of inflammatory markers, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, were increased in the rats with CIN. Our previous studies and clinical investigations have shown that SCr, urine microprotein and uKIM-1 are important indices for CIN prediction (4,6,19). The present study further confirmed that SCr, urine microprotein and uKIM-1 increased following iopamidol treatment. Apoptosis is an important mechanism of acute kidney injury, including CIN. Suppressing apoptotic pathways may attenuate pathological alterations in CIN (7). It has been reported that mitochondrial and intrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved in the tubular injuries of CIN (8). Bax is pro-apoptotic protein, whereas Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, which can inhibit caspase-3. Increased levels of Bcl-2 and decreased levels caspase-3 activity may contribute to reduced apoptosis (7,8,20). In the present study, renal tubular cell apoptosis was observed in the CIN kidney, consistent with previous results. In addition, increased Bax/caspase-3 activity and decreased expression levels of Bcl-2 were detected in the CIN rats and HK-2 cells treated with iopamidol. Thus, iopamidol-induced cell apoptosis may be associated with activation of Bax/caspase-3 and inhibition of Bcl-2. Statins reduce the levels of intracellular pro-inflammatory factors in several cellular systems by acting on the inhibition of producing enzymes (12,21,22). In the rat model used in the present study, pretreatment with atorvastatin reduced the iopamidol-induced release of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and improved renal function, including the levels of SCr, urine microprotein and uKIM-1. In addition, the increased expression of Bax/caspase-3 and decreased expression of Bcl-2 were partially reversed by atorvastatin in the CIN rats and HK2 cells treated with iopamidol. Accordingly, the protective effect of atorvastatin in CIN may be associated with the Bcl-2/caspase-3 anti-apoptotic pathway. Hsp27 is a small HSP, which is important in stress tolerance in several cellular processes. The local tissue expression of Hsp27 reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, and protects cells the against oxidative stress caused by renal tubular cell apoptosis in ischemia-induced acute kidney injury (6,19,23). However, whether Hsp27 has a protective effect in CIN, and the underlying molecular mechanism, remain to be elucidated. In the present study, western blot analysis demonstrated that Hsp27 was upregulated in the CMA rats and downregulated in the CM rats, which was negatively correlated with the expression of Bax/caspase-3 and the levels of apoptosis in the HK2 cells. Hsp27 inhibits the release of caspase-3 and the gene expression of Bax, which leads to reduced apoptosis and organ injury. Following treatment with atorvastatin, Hsp27 was upregulated, together with improvements in HK2 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, through transfection with Hsp27 siRNA and the Hsp27 plasmid, it was found that iopamidol induced cell apoptosis, and that the activity of Bax/caspase-3 was enhanced and reduced by inhibition and overexpression of Hsp27, respectively. These findings suggested that iopamidol aggravated renal tubular injury via the downregulation of activated Hsp27, which weakened its anti-apoptotic effects, resulting in an increase in renal tubular apoptosis. In conclusion, the data obtained in the present study suggested that atorvastatin exhibited renal protection in the CIN model via the anti-inflammatory reaction and upregulation of Hsp27."}, "28260056": {"pmid": "28260056", "pmcid": "PMC5364871", "title": "Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor-mediated cell survival in hypoxia depends on the promotion of autophagy via suppression of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway", "abstract": "\nHypoxia is widely accepted as a fundamental biological phenomenon, which is strongly associated with tissue damage and cell viability under stress conditions. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is known to protect tissues from multiple types of damage, and protect cells from apoptosis. Hypoxia is a regulatory factor of the IGF system, however the role of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in hypoxia-induced apoptosis remains unclear. The present study investigated the potential mechanisms associated with IGF-1R-associated apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibiting disruption or overexpression of IGF-1R (R- cells and R+ cells) were used to examine the level of apoptosis, autophagy, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine was used to assess the effect of autophagy on ROS production and apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. A potential downstream signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/threonine protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was identifiedby western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that hypoxia induced apoptosis, increased ROS production, and promoted autophagy in a time-dependent manner relative to that observed under normoxia. R+ cells exhibited a lower percentage of apoptotic cells, lower ROS production, and higher levels of autophagy when compared to that of R- cells. In addition, inhibition of autophagy led to increased ROS production and a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the two cell types. Furthermore, IGF-1R is related with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and enhanced autophagy-associated protein expression, which was verified following treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These results indicated that IGF-1R may increase cell viability under hypoxic conditions by promoting autophagy and scavenging ROS production, which is closed with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.\n", "fulltext": "Hypoxia is a fundamental biological phenomenon that is strongly associated with tissue damage and cell viability under stress conditions. It is widely accepted that hypoxic foci are present in the microenvironment during ischemic injuries, including neurological (1), intestinal (2), myocardial (3) and liver (4) damage. These affect mitochondrial respiratory chain functions, mitochondrial enzymes and adenosine triphosphate synthesis (5). In addition, hypoxia develops in normal tissues following radiation exposure and is associated with increased inflammatory corpuscle accumulation and activation, oxidative stress, and profibrogenic cytokine activity, thus contributing to radiation-induced normal tissue injury (6,7). Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent apoptosis via attenuation of mitochondrial function and signaling pathways, has been demonstrated to be a major cause of hypoxia-associated tissue injury (8\u201311). Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) functions to promote a survival and proliferation in specific tissues by initiating signaling cascades following binding to extracellular IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which results in IGF-1 activation and phosphorylation (12). IGF-1R is a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor superfamily, which is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (12). A previous study demonstrated that IGF-1R is involved in apoptosis induction through the reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction (13). The protective mechanisms associated with IGF-1R involve preservation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduction of caspase-3 activity (13). A previous study indicated that IGF-1R in the endothelium maintains the endothelial barrier by stabilizing the vascular endothelial (VE)-protein tyrosine phosphatase/VE-cadherin complex (14). Furthermore, decreased IGF-1R expression impairs endothelial function and increases renal fibrosis, which is associated with kidney disease (14). Similarly, IGF-1R is essential in mediating IGF activity during neuronal cell development. IGF-1R in neuronal cells is critically important for their survival following hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) injury (1). IGF-mediated upregulation of the neuronal cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, contribute to IGF/IGF-1R protection against neuronal apoptosis following H/I injury (1). In addition, IGF/IGF-1R have been demonstrated to protect against intestinal and cardiomyocyte ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) injury (2,3). Hypoxia is one of the factors involved in the regulation of the IGF system (15,16). IGF-1R expression and concentration are altered when cells, such as human hepatocytes and growth neuronal cones, are exposed to hypoxic conditions (15,16). Additionally, IGF-1/IGF-1R protect cultured human cells against a variety of injuries, such as oxidative stress and hypoxia, through the activation of associated proteins including nuclear factor-\u03baB and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein (17\u201319). However, the mechanisms associated with its anti-apoptotic effects remains unknown. The present study demonstrates an association between IGF-1R and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/threonine protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR signaling pathway and autophagy. In addition, these results provide evidence supporting the protective role of IGF-1R against oxidative stress under hypoxic conditions. R- and R+ cells were a gift from Dr. Yu Dong (Soochow University, Suzhou, China). R- cells were fibroblast cell lines derived from mouse embryos with targeted disruption of the IGF-1R genes (20). R+ cells were derived from R- cells following co-transfection with a human IGF-1R expression plasmid and a pLHL4 plasmid carrying the hygromycin resistance gene (20,21). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowest, Nuaill\u00e9, France) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P0781; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest) in a free-gas exchange chamber with atmospheric air at 37\u00b0C. Hypoxia treatment (24 or 48 h) was performed in a tri-gas incubator (YCP-50S; Huaxi Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan, China) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 93% N2 and 2% O2. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore) was used for 24 h at 10 \u00b5M. The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA; M9281-100MG; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore) was used at a concentration of 5 \u00b5M for 24 h. R- and R+ cells were grown to a number of 107 and then digested with trypsin. The total RNA was isolated using a High Pure RNA Isolation kit (RNAprep Pure; Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and to eliminate genomic DNA contamination with with DNase I (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (500 ng) was used as a template for reverse transcription reactions using the PrimeScript RT Reagent kit (Perfect Real Time; Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China), followed by qPCR analysis. The PCR procedures were performed as follows: Predenaturing at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of amplifications by denaturing at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, annealing for 30 sec at 64\u00b0C for IGF-1R and 60\u00b0C for GAPDH, then extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Relative expression of target genes was analyzed by the \u2206\u2206Cq method (22). GAPDH was used as an internal control. The following primers were used for quantitative PCR: IGF-1R sense, 5\u2032-TACAACTACGCCCTGGTCATC-3\u2032, and antisense, 5\u2032-CTTCTCACACATCGGCTTCTC-3\u2032; GAPDH, sense, 5\u2032-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGG-3\u2032, and antisense, 5\u2032-ACGACATACTCAGCACCGGCCTCAC-3\u2032. IGF-1R expression was evaluated using the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Cells were grown to a number of 107 and were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics) and total protein was quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal quantities of protein (20 \u00b5g) were separated using SDS-PAGE on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, then were electrotransferred onto a BioTrace NC Membrane (Pall Life Sciences, Port Washington, NY, USA). Blots on NC membrane were blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer consisting of 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Biowest) and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; HyClone; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Logan, UT, USA). The antibodies used for western blotting were as follows: PI3K-110 (#4252S; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), phosphorylated (p)-Akt/Akt (#14293/#12178; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-mTOR/mTOR (#5536S/#2983S; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and autophagy marker light chain 3 (M186-3; LC3; 1:1,000; Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) and \u03b2-actin (#12620; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit (AP187R; 1:10,000; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (GTX26709; 1:10,000; GeneTex, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Protein bands were detected using the ECL Blotting Detection Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and images were quantified using the Chemioscope Mini system (Bioshine, Shanghai, China). Cells were grown to a number of 107, digested and washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4; HyClone; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), centrifuged at 175 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 37\u00b0C, and resuspended in a PBS. The autophagosomes were marked and stained using the Cyto-ID Autophagy Detection kit (Enzo Biochem, Inc., New York, NY, USA) and photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence intensity was detected by flow cytometry (FC 500 MPL; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). Cells were grown to a number of 107, digested with trypsin and washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4; HyClone; GE Healthcare Life Sciences), centrifuged at 112 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 37\u00b0C, and resuspended in PBS. Cells were stained using the Annexin V-Fluorescein Isothiocyanate Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and propidium iodide (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry (FC 500 MPL; Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The intracellular ROS production levels were determined using a spectrofluorimetric method, H2DCFDA (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) assay. R- and R+ cells were grown to a number of 107 and exposed to hypoxic conditions for 24 and 48 h. Cells were then incubated with DCHF-DA (20 mM) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C in a dark room. Subsequently, the cells were harvested in a trypsin-EDTA acid solution. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 175 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 37\u00b0C, then the supernatant was removed. The intensity of DCHF-DA fluorescence was measured and calculated by flow cytometry analysis (FC 500 MPL; Beckman Coulter, Inc.). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t-test with SPSS software, version 22.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA) considering the variances unequal. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. R+ cells exhibited significantly higher levels of mRNA expression compared with that of R- cells (Fig. 1). Following treatment of hypoxia for 24 or 48 h, R+ cells and R- cells all exhibited increased apoptotic ratios compared with that of normoxic treatment, respectively. Further analysis showed hypoxia induced more apoptosis in R- cells compared with that of R+ cells under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2). To investigate whether IGF-1R alters cellular ROS levels under hypoxic conditions, ROS production in R- and R+ cells under hypoxic conditions for 24 and 48 h was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, ROS production levels in R- and R+ cells was increased significantly under hypoxic conditions compared with those under normoxic conditions. Additionally, R+ cells produced significantly lower ROS levels under hypoxic conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, the ROS levels were significantly higher in R- cells than in R+ cells (Fig. 3). As presented in Fig. 4, hypoxia increased the presence of autophagosome in all R- and R+ cells compared with that of normoxic treatment. In addition, R+ cells exhibited higher levels of autophagy when compared with R\u2212 cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, which suggests that IGF-1R may promote autophagy. ROS production and apoptosis were higher in R- cells compared with those in R+ cells. Further investigation indicated that ROS production and apoptosis were increased after autophagy inhibition (3MA) treatment in all R+ cells and R- cells compared with those without autophagy inhibition (3MA) treatment (Fig. 5). These suggested that autophagy may serve a protective role from ROS production and apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 6, the R+ cells displayed lower expression levels of PI3K-110 and mTOR, and higher expression of LC3-II under normoxic and hypoxic conditions relative to R- cells. Further study indicated that p-AKT was decreased in R+ cells compared with that of R- cells under normoxic conditions, however was increased significantly in R+ cells following hypoxia treatment. When treated with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor LY294002, R+ and R- cells displayed lower levels of PI3K/p-Akt/p-mTOR and high LC3-II expression. These results indicated that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway may be involved in autophagy under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, which may be closely associated with IGF-1R. Hypoxia is a toxic factor that induces cell death through mitochondrial dysfunction, which is primarily caused by the production of ROS under hypoxic conditions (23,24). Various pathological conditions, including myocardial I/R, stroke, cancer and irradiation, lead to tissue hypoxia, which alter biological characteristics, including the production of ROS, autophagy and apoptosis. The results of the present study, demonstrated that low concentrations of oxygen induce ROS production and apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In addition, overexpression of IGF-1R may serve a protective role in cell death under hypoxic conditions through altering autophagy levels and ROS production. The role of IGF-1R has received extensive attention due to its protective role in the neuronal system. It protects neural cells from loss and infarcted volume, and increases glial proliferation in the brain in a cerebral ischemia model (25\u201328). In addition, it serves a role in protecting against renal fibrosis-associated kidney disease, intestinal I/R injury and myocardial ischemia (2,3,14). Autophagy is an intracellular lysosomal degradation process that maintains cellular homeostasis via the degradation and recycling of long-lived proteins and intracellular aggregates as well as damaged organelles, in order to generate small reusable molecules (29,30). It is essential for the promotion of cell survival in stress conditions, such as starvation, oxidative stress, and hypoxia; however, unregulated autophagy induces progressive consumption of cellular contents and results in autophagic cell death (31). Autophagy serves a protective role in cell survival in cells through the reduction of ROS. Inhibition of autophagy through chloroquine administration, or via prevention of K63 ubiquitination increases the formation of ROS (32,33). Hypoxia is a known inducer of autophagy (34). The present study demonstrated that the induction of autophagy and ROS production under hypoxic conditions, and autophagy inhibition by 3MA, led to a higher level of ROS production and cell apoptosis in R+ and R\u2212 cells, which is in agreement with a previous study (35). The signaling pathways involved in the progression of autophagy are complex, and the PI3K/Akt pathway has been widely studied (36,37). The anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-1 are mediated by IGF-1R, together with the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and other signaling pathways (38). However, the role of IGF-1 in autophagy remains unknown. An inhibitory effect of IGF-1 on autophagy has been observed in rat cardiomyocytes (39), human fibroblasts (40), and vascular cells from patients with atherosclerotic lesions (41). These effects are associated with rescuing mitochondrial metabolism and controlling the potentially harmful autophagic response. By contrast, IGF-1 promotes autophagy in H9c2 cell lines (42), HeLa cells (43) and Purkinje neurons (44). The depletion of IGF-1R inhibits mTORC2 and reduces the activation of protein kinase C, which decreases the rate of clathrin-dependent endocytosis and impacts autophagosome-precursor formation (43). Furthermore, IGF-1 prevents the accumulation of autophagic vesicles and cell death by increasing the rate of autophagosome-to-lysosome fusion and degradation, thereby contributing to cell survival (44). The current study investigated the effects of the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the progression of autophagy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The results indicated that IGF-1R-overexpressing cells exhibit lower expression of PI3K-110, p-Akt, p-mTOR/mTOR and higher expression levels of LC3-II under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. When treated with the PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor LY294002, these cell types exhibited lower PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling activation and higher autophagy levels, which indicated that IGF-1R-induced cell survival during hypoxia, which may be dependent on autophagy initiation by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR-signaling pathway. The present study demonstrated that overexpression of IGF-1R is correlated with reduced ROS production, increased autophagy and cell viability under hypoxic conditions. It is possible that, binding of IGF-1 to IGF-1R suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which promoted autophagy and scavenging of redundant cellular ROS during hypoxia. These results reveal novel mechanisms for IGF-1R-associated cell survival, which may be good to know I/R- and H/I associated hypoxia-agravated normal tissue injury well."}, "27959382": {"pmid": "27959382", "pmcid": "PMC5179191", "title": "Bach1 siRNA attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by modulating oxidative stress in mice", "abstract": "\nOxidative stress plays an essential role in inflammation and fibrosis. Bach1 is an important transcriptional repressor that acts by modulating oxidative stress and represents a potential target in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). In this study, we knocked down Bach1 using adenovirus-mediated small interfering RNA (siRNA) to determine whether the use of Bach1 siRNA is an effective therapeutic strategy in mice with bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF. Mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were incubated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) and subsequently infected with recombined adenovirus-like Bach1 siRNA1 and Bach1 siRNA2, while an empty adenovirus vector was used as the negative control. The selected Bach1 siRNA with higher interference efficiency was used for the animal experiments. A mouse model of BLM-induced PF was established, and Bach1 siRNA (1\u00d7109 PFU) was administered to the mice via the tail vein. The results revealed that the Bach1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly downregulated by Bach1 siRNA. Furthermore, the MLFs infected with Bach1 siRNA exhibited increased mRNA and protein expression levels of heme oxygenase-1 and glutathione peroxidase 1, but decreased levels of TGF-\u03b21 and interleukin-6 in the cell supernatants compared with the cells exposed to TGF-\u03b21 alone. Bach1 knockdown by siRNA also enhanced the expression of antioxidant factors, but suppressed that of fibrosis-related cytokines in mice compared with the BLM group. Finally, the inflammatory infiltration of alveolar and interstitial cells and the destruction of lung structure were significantly attenuated in the mide administered Bach1 siRNA compared with those in the BLM group. On the whole, our findings demonstrate that Bach1 siRNA exerts protective effects against BLM-induced PF in mice. Our data may provide the basis for the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies for PF.\n", "fulltext": "Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a c\\hronic and progressive disease characterized by diffuse inflammation, interstitial fibrosis and the distortion of the lung architecture, which contributes to extensive damage and dysfunction of the lungs (1). However, the explicit pathogenesis of PF remains inadequately understood, and there is an unmet need for effective treatments. Novel strategies aimed at enhancing the therapeutic effects have gained significant interest. Previous studies have demonstrated that the imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants caused by oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of PF (2\u20134), including bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF (5,6). Thus, the key components involved in oxidative stress have been receiving increased attention and are considered as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of PF. The transcription factor Bach1, which is a member of the cap 'n' collar family of basic leucine zipper, is known to be involved in the regulation of oxidative stress response (7). Bach1 executes transcriptional inhibition via competitive binding to the Maf-recognition element closely related to antioxidant response element (ARE), thus antagonizing the activation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (8,9). Nrf2 functions as one of the most important molecules involved in oxidative stress that promotes the expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes and proteins (10,11). It has been reported that Nrf2 deficiency is associated with the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis in mice and humans (12,13). Nrf2 agonists protect against PF by regulating the lung oxidant levels in mice with BLM-induced lung fibrosis (14). Furthermore, ARE/Nrf2-dependent antioxidants, including glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) may be critical in pulmonary protection (15\u201317). Additionally, the expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidants can be suppressed by the transcriptional induction of Bach1 (8). Although the evidence suggests that Bach1 is a transcriptional repressor of Nrf2, the inhibitory effects of Bachl on Nrf2-dependent antioxidants and fibrotic processes in pulmonary tissue remain still poorly understood. To date, there are no available published studies investigating whether targeting Bachl attenuates BLM-induced lung fibrosis, at least to the best of our knowledge. As BLM causes cell damage, and the emergence of free radicals and the subsequent induction of oxidative stress ultimately results in inflammation and fibrosis (18,19), it is currently the most commonly used animal model to investigate PF (20). It has been demonstrated that multiple factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, interleukin (IL)-1 and -6, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are implicated in the development and progression of PF (21,22). A previous study found markedly increased levels of TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and in the serum of mice following exposure to BLM (23). TGF-\u03b21 has been identified as a key mediator of lung fibrosis, and it induces the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts, as well as the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (24,25). In this context, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 are considered to be useful parameters for observing the progression of PF. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), which can attain target-specific gene silencing, may be a potent tool for gene therapy (26,27). In this study, we focused on Bach1, since it is an important mediator of oxidative stress and may be a critical target for PF therapy. Based on these reasons, we hypothesized that adenovirus-mediated Bach1 siRNA may be effective in silencing Bach1 transcripts in vitro and in vivo, representing a potential means with which to promote the expression of Nrf2-dependent antioxidants and ameliorate fibrotic process in BLM-induced lung fibrosis. For our experiments, Bach1 siRNAs were administered to mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) and to mice with BLM-induced PF in order to monitor the antioxidant and anti-fibrotic effects via the measurement of antioxidant factors, fibrosis-related cytokines and histological changes. Taken together, the findings of our study may provide novel insight into the role of Bach1 in the regulation of oxidative stress involved in the pathogenesis of PF, thus leading to the development of promising strategies for the treatment of PF. Two siRNAs targeting mouse Bach1 mRNA were designed using a software available at www.ambion.com via a cDNA sequence (SEQ ID, XM_006522879), and an empty adenoviral vector was used as a negative control. The specific siRNA coding sequences were designed to contain the target sequences and their reverse complement 19-nucleotide sequences which are separated by 9-nucleotide sequences of stem-loop structure (Table I). The forward and reverse oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and annealed to form a duplex. Two siRNA sequences were cloned into the plasmid vector, pGenesil-1. The siRNA expression cassette was subsequently excised from pGenesil-1 using EcoRI and HindIII, and also ligated into the linearized adenoviral shuttle vector, pShuttle-CMV. The ligation products were transformed into E. coli DH5\u03b1, and positive clones were selected. The recombinant adenovirus vectors were obtained by homologous recombination with pShuttle-CMV-Bach1-siRNA and the skeleton plasmid of pAdeasy-1 in bacteria BJ5183. The recombinant cosmids titled Ad-siBach1 carrying either Bach1 siRNA or adenoviral vector with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were linearized by PacI digestion and then transfected 293A cells (Wuhan Cell Marker Biotechnology, Wuhan, China) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The success of Bach1 siRNA insertion into adenoviral plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing and the titer of each virus stock was determined by plaque assay on 293A cells. Finally, the siRNA adenoviral vector was calculated as 1.1\u00d7109 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml and the empty adenoviral vector was 1.4\u00d7109 PFU/ml. The virus was purified by double CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation used for in vivo experiments. The transfection efficiency was monitored by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The silencing efficiency of target gene and protein were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. The selected siRNA sequence with the highest inhibitory effect was used in the animal experiments. Seven-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (body weight, 18\u201320 g) were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China). The animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and kept for 1 week prior to use. The room temperature was maintained at 22\u00b13\u00b0C, with a 12-h/12-h day/night cycle and relative humidity of 50\u00b110%. All animals had free access to rodent chow and water. The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups as follows: a control with saline (n=5), BLM (n=5), BLM + control siRNA (n=5) and BLM + Bach1 siRNA groups (n=5). For the model of PF, 5 mg/kg BLM (Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in 50 \u03bcl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were administered intratracheally to the mice; the control animals were injected intratracheally with the same volume of sterile saline. BLM and saline were administered only once. The mice in the control siRNA and Bach1 siRNA group were injected with control siRNA or Bach1 siRNA, respectively, via the tail vein (one injection every other day), with a total dose of 1\u00d7109 PFU viruses per mouse after 2 weeks of BLM administration. At the designated time points (28 days post-BLM administration), the mice were humanely sacrificed by an overdose of the anesthesia (inhalation of ether) for serum, BALF and histological measurements. We lavaged the lungs using 0.9% saline using a tracheal cannula for 3 times and collected 1.5 ml BALF in each mouse. The blood of the experimental mice was collected using a capillary through the conjunctiva and into the orbital sinus. Following centrifugation (2000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C), the serum and supernatants were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. In addition, the lungs were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Ethics Committee of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China and complied with guidelines on the Use of Experimental Animals. The left lung tissues from the mice were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After 24 h, the tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin blocks of 3\u20134 \u03bcm thickness were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's reagent (Solarbio, Beijing, China) for the assessment of PF histopathology. The histological severity of pulmonary alveolitis was scored as previously described (28), and PF was scored as described in the study by Ashcroft et al (29). The MLF cell line (MIC-CELL-0040) was purchased from PriCells Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd. (Hubei, China) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were plated at 1\u00d7105 cells/100 mm and cultured at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. We used 0.25% trypsin for digestion and the cells were filled in 2 culture flasks for passage (1:2). All experiments proceeded using cells between 3 and 4 cell passages. For the induction of fibrosis using the recombinant protein, TGF-\u03b21, the cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1\u00d7105 cells/well and starved for 24 h and then incubated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) in complete medium for 24 h. To knockdown Bach1 expression, the MLFs were infected with the Bach1 siRNA at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 for 2 h and were then washed to remove the virus. The cells in in the control group (control siRNA) were transfected with empty vector. The cells were then cultured for a further 48 h and then analyzed for their GFP intensity using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA) and directly observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Total RNA was isolated from the mouse pulmonary tissue samples and the MLFs using the simple Total RNA kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed using the Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Shanghai, China) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China). The initial denaturation step was at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and then PCR amplification was achieved by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The process of RT-qPCR was implemented by ABI Prism 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences of the primers used are listed in Table II. The level of gene expression was quantified using a standard curve and the comparative CT method normalized to GADPH mRNA expression. We used the formula 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT to calculate the relative expression levels of genes. Both samples were examined in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated at least 3 times. Cell pellets or lung tissues were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Applygen Technologies, Inc., Beijing, China) on ice, and the concentration of the sample proteins was tested using the BCA method before being mixed in 5X SDS loading buffer. Following heat denaturation at 100\u00b0C for 5 min, equal amounts of lysate (60 mg) were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Applygen Technologies, Inc.). The membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies against \u03b2-actin (1:500; sc-130301; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Bach1 (1:300; ab49657), HO-1 (1:500; ab13248), GPx1 (1:1,000; ab140883) and NQO1 (1:500; ab28947) (all from Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The following day, the membranes were incubated with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies (1:10,000; 600-101-096; Rockland, Inc., Gilbertsville, PE, USA) for 1 h at room temperature, and the bands were visualized using a double-infrared laser scanning imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Protein expression was analyzed and normalized to that of \u03b2-actin. BALF and blood from the mice were sampled at the end of 4 weeks after the initiation of the animal experiment. The supernatants of MLFs were also collected after 48 h of the transfection of siRNA for measurements. We then used the BALF, serum and cell supernatants to analyze the levels of cytokines in lung fibrosis. ELISA was used to detect TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 using respective ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The supernatants of MLFs, serum and BALF of mice were diluted according to different proportions along with reagents and standard dilutions prepared before the experiment. Standard, control and samples (100 \u03bcl/well) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. They were then washed with wash buffer 5 times and 100 \u03bcl of conjugate was then added for 2 h followed by substrate solution for 30 min away from light. After the addition of 100 \u03bcl of stop solution, the sample concentrations were determined to measure the absorbance at a 450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Both assays were performed in duplicate. Data were analyzed using a statistical software package (SPSS 13.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for multiple group comparisons. A value of P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference and a value of P<0.01 was considered to indicate a marked statistically significant difference. The successful construction of Bach1 siRNA adenoviral vectors was determined by gene sequencing. To demonstrate the transfection efficiency of Bach1 siRNA on MLFs and its targeting in vivo, we used a fluorescent microscope and flow cytometric analysis. After the Bach1 siRNA was transfected into the MLFs, >90% GFP was expressed in the fluorescence states (Fig. 1A), and the results of flow cytometry also suggested that the transfection efficiency of Bach1 siRNA was 93.6% (Fig. 1B). After 2 weeks of siRNA administration, GFPs were observed in the tissue sections of the lungs of mice, suggesting that Bach1 siRNA targeted the lungs (Fig. 1C). The MLFs were incubated with recombinant protein TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for the induction of fibrosis prior to transfection with control siRNA, or Bach1 siRNA#1 and #2 in vitro. Similarly, superior Bach1 siRNA (Bach#1) was injected into the mice with BLM-induced PF in vivo. The inhibitory effects of Bach1 siRNA on Bach1 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mRNA level of Bach1 in the TGF-\u03b21 group was significantly increased compared with that of the blank group (P<0.05), suggesting that TGF-\u03b21 promoted Bach1 generation. The mRNA expression of Bach1 in the MLFs following transfection with Bach1 siRNA#1 or #2 was significantly decreased compared with that of the TGF-\u03b21 group or the control siRNA group (P<0.01), and was also significantly decreased by 15.3 and 22%, respectively (P<0.01) compared with the blank group (P<0.01) (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the results of western blot analysis also revealed that the protein expression of Bach1 in the MLFs following transfection with Bach1 siRNA#1 or #2 was markedly decreased (Fig. 2C). To further characterize Bach1 expression in vivo, we detected Bach1 expression in the lungs of mice and found that Bach1 mRNA and protein expression in the mice was decreased significantly following the administration of BLM and Bach1 siRNA, compared with the control group and the control siRNA group (Fig. 2B and D). To examine the mechanisms through which Bach1 siRNA affects the expression of antioxidant factors, such as HO-1, GPx1 and NQO1, we examined their mRNA and protein expression levels in the MLFs and lungs of mice. The results of RT-qPCR revealed that the mRNA levels of HO-1 and GPx1 were decreased following exposure of the MLFs to TGF-\u03b21 compared with the blank group (both P<0.05; Fig. 3A and B), and the knockdown of Bach1 significantly increased the HO-1 and GPx1 mRNA levels compared with the TGF-\u03b21 group (P<0.01; Fig. 3A and B). The effect of Bach1 siRNA#1 was more prominent than that of Bach1 siRNA#2 in the MLFs. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3D and E, we observed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of HO-1 and GPx1 in the lung tissues of mice following treatment with Bach1 siRNA compared with the BLM group (P<0.05 and P<0.01). Concomitantly, the knockdown of Bach1 significantly increased the protein levels of HO-1 and GPx1 in the MLFs in the blank group or TGF-\u03b21 group, and in the lung tissues from mice in the control group or BLM group (Fig. 3G and H). However, Bach1 siRNA did not alter the mRNA and protein levels of NQO1 neither in the MLFs nor in the lung tissues (Fig. 3C and F). The results of protein expression were similar to those of mRNA expression. All these results suggest that Bach1 siRNA promotes the generation of oxidation resistance factors, and it may thus inhibit the oxidative stress induced by TGF-\u03b21 and BLM. Due to the important role of TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of PF, we analyzed their concentrations in the supernatant of MLFs, and in serum and BALF from mice. The levels of TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 in serum and BALF from mice with BLM-induced lung fibrosis were significantly increased compared with the control group (both P<0.01; Fig. 4A\u2013D). Their concentrations in the supernatant of the MLFs following stimulation with TGF-\u03b21 were significantly increased compared with the blank group (both P<0.01; Fig. 4E and F). Additionally, the levels of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b21 in serum and BALF from the mice in the Bach1 siRNA group were significantly decreased compared with those of the mice BLM treated with control siRNA or in the control group (both P<0.01; Fig. 4A\u2013D). The results of the analysis of the expression of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b21 in the supernatant of MLFs were similar to those obtained from the serum and BALF of mice. These results suggest that the use of Bach1 siRNA suppresses the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and that of related cytokines in BLM-induced fibrosis. For histological analysis, the lung tissues of mice were stained with H&E and Masson's staining. The degree of lung fibrosis was accessed by alveolitis, fibering and the integrity of the structure. Intact alveoli, a normal interstitium and a few inflammatory cells in the lung tissues were observed in the control group (Fig. 5A). Nevertheless, H&E staining of the BLM-adminstered mice (at 28 days) revealed the extensive destruction of alveoli (collapsed and disappeared), the extensive thickening of the lung interstitium, peribronchial and interstitial infiltrations of inflammatory cells, predominant lymphocytes, and multiple focal fibrotic lesions. There were milder inflammatory infiltrations and the destruction of alveoli following treatment with Bach1 siRNA compared with the BLM group and control siRNA group (Fig. 5A). As shown by Masson's trichrome staining, we observed massive fibrosis (blue dye), the accumulation of inflammatory cells and the extensive destruction of alveoli in the BLM group (Fig. 5B). The same change was detected in the control siRNA group. However, treatment with Bach1 siRNA significantly attenuated these fibrosis-related changes in the mice with BLM-induced fibrosis (Fig. 5B). The alveolitis and fibrosis scores indicated that the mice in the Bach1 siRNA group had significantly lower alveolitis and fibrosis scores than those in the BLM group and control siRNA group (P<0.05 and P<0.01; Fig. 5C). Therefore, treatment with Bach1 siRNA potentially inhibits the histopathological progress of BLM-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Oxidative stress is considered a prominent mechanism associated with the pathogenesis of PF (30,31). The decline in antioxidant capacity and the elevated oxidant burden contribute to the progression of lung fibrosis via the activation of inflammation and growth regulatory cytokines, the regulation of related enzymes essential to the induction of antioxidants, and the stimulation of the production of myofibroblasts and ECM (32). Bach1 is involved in the induction of oxidative stress by competing with Nrf2 and negatively regulating ARE-mediated gene expression (33,34). Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of Nrf2 and its antioxidant pathway in PF (12\u201314), suggesting that Bach1 may play a potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression of Bach1 was markedly increased in both MLF following TGF-\u03b21 stimulation and in the lung tissues of mice with BLM-induced fibrosis. It has been established that fibroblasts are associated with PF due to the conversion from fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which is one of the principal characteristics of the pathogenesis of PF (35). TGF-\u03b21 stimulation results in the proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts, and in the increase of matrix synthesis in the lungs related to the subsequent development of PF (36). The use of BLM results in the elevation of TGF-\u03b21 in fibroblasts, advanced inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), subsequent progressive fibrosis, and the exacerbated destruction of pulmonary structure in animal models (37). Furthermore, the model of BLM-induced lung fibrosis is rather an acute lung injury with major oxidative and inflammatory responses (18). The results of the present study supported our hypothesis that the overexpression of Bach1 may be associated with the pathogenesis of PF by affecting the antioxidant/oxidant balance. To suppress a target gene, siRNA is considered a powerful tool due to the same effects as a knockout gene (38). Our data demonstrated that two adenovirus-mediated Bach1 siRNAs were successfully transfected into MLFs and specifically targeted the lungs of mice by custom designing. More importantly, adenovirus-mediated siRNAs effectively suppressed Bach1 expression in MLFs following TGF-\u03b21 stimulation. For in vivo experiments, the superior Bach1 siRNA was systemically administered to mice with lung fibrosis to silence Bach1, and the evidence suggested that the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bach1 were markedly inhibited in the lung tissues of mcie with BLM-induced fibrosis. A key mechanism in the cellular defense against oxidative stress is mediated by the transcriptional induction of ARE-driven genes that include stress-response genes (e.g., HO-1), direct antioxidants (e.g., GPx) and phase 2 detoxifying enzymes (e.g., NQO1) (13). Nrf2 forms a heterodimer with basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors for ARE binding and ARE-driven gene transcription that may be critical in pulmonary protection (13). Bach1 binds to ARE-like sequences, functioning as a competitive antagonist of Nrf2, thus inhibiting the transcriptional activation of ARE-driven genes (8). The inhibition of Nrf2 and ARE-driven antioxidants enhances the oxidative burden and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PF (39). The altered expression of ARE-driven antioxidants in PF also suggests that oxidative stress may contribute to pathogenesis of PF. Among these ARE-driven antioxidants, GPx has been regarded as the direct antioxidant whose functional roles in oxidative tissue stress have been widely defined (40,41). The phase 2 detoxifying enzyme, NQO1, contributes to facilitate the excretion of oxidized, reactive secondary metabolites via xenobiotic detoxification (42). In addition, the stress-response protein, HO-1, protects cells from various oxidant insults (39). A previous study demonstrated that the deficiency of ARE antioxidative signaling in mice exacerbates BLM-induced lung injury and fibrosis (15). It has been found that GPx activity and GPx1 expression are decreased in C57BL/6 mice with BLM-induced fibrosis (17). The downregulation of NQO1 and HO-1 have been observed in the lung tissues of BLM-treated animals (43). Furthermore, Nrf2 siRNA has been shown to decrease NQO1 and HO-1 mRNA expression in fibroblasts, and induces the conversion from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts (44). As previously described, our results demonstrated that the downregulation of antioxidants, such as HO-1 and GPx1 was observed in MLFs following TGF-\u03b21 stimulation and in the lungs of C57BL/6 mice following exposure to BLM. We also investigated whether Bach1 siRNA regulates ARE-driven antioxidants involved in lung fibrosis. Whether Bach1 affects the expression of other ARE-dependent genes remains controversial. Previous studies have reported that Bach1 represses the expression of ARE-dependent genes, such as HO-1 and NQO1 (33,45). However, in studies in which the effects of Bach1 siRNA on ARE-dependent gene expression were examined by microarray analysis or qPCR, little or no effect on the expression of genes other than HO-1 was observed (46,47). In this study, our data demonstrated that the suppression of HO-1 and GPx1 in TGF-\u03b21 and BLM-induced lung fibrosis was alleviated by Bach1 siRNA; however, no effect was observed on the expression of NQO1, thereby indicating that Bach1 siRNA participates in the mechanism of protection in TGF-\u03b21 and BLM-mediated oxidative stress in PF. The complete mechanisms involved are not known, although it has been postulated that Bach1 is involved in regulating the expression of antioxidant genes. The present study further supports the notion that Bach1 siRNA alleviates fibrotic processes in pulmonary tissues. There are several growth factors and fibrogenic cytokines contributing to lung fibrosis, including TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 (21). These molecules result in the proliferation and differentiation of lung fibroblasts that are responsible for remodeling of the ECM (23). Choe et al (23) demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 were upregulated in BALF and serum following the exposure of mice to BLM. In this study, we provide compelling evidence that BLM induced a marked increase in the levels of TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 in both BALF and serum of mice. By contrast, Bach1 siRNA inhibited the expression of fibrosis-related cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 in the serum and BALF of mice with BLM-induced fibrosis. Moreover, the elevation of TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 expression was also found in MLFs following TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, and Bach1 siRNA significantly decreased the expression of these two cytokines. To further explore whether Bach1 siRNA exerted anti-fibrotic effects on lung fibrosis, we determined the pathological changes in lung tissues. The results revealed that the administration of BLM led to the thickness of alveolar septa, narrowing of the alveolar space, the extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells, and the accumulation of collagen deposition in the lungs, which is consistent with results of previous studies (48,49). In addition, Bach1 siRNA markedly attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration, the destruction of alveoli and the accumulation of collagen deposition. On the whole, our findings demonstrated that the silencing of Bach1 attenuated the histopathological changes in the lung tissues from mice with BLM-induced fibrosis and suppressed the expression of fibrosis-related cytokines. On the basis of these findings, we believe that Bach1 represents a crucial molecule in the pathogenesis of PF, thereby highlighting Bach1 as a potential therapeutic target in PF. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the silencing Bach1 inhibited TGF-\u03b21 and BLM-induced PF. This anti-fibrotic effect was associated with the expression of antioxidants and the regulation of antioxidant capabilities. Bach1 siRNA may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PF and may have potential for use in the treatment of lung fibrosis. Further studies on the role of Bach1 may provide further insight into the mechanisms responsible for the development of PF."}, "27840894": {"pmid": "27840894", "pmcid": "PMC5117772", "title": "Seven novel and six de novo PHEX gene mutations in patients with hypophosphatemic rickets", "abstract": "\nInactivating mutations in phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidase on the X chromosome (PHEX) have been identified as a cause of X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH; OMIM 307800). In the present study, we enrolled 43 patients from 18 unrelated families clinically diagnosed with hypophosphatemic rickets and 250 healthy controls. For each available individual, all 22 exons with their exon-intron boundaries of the PHEX gene were directly sequenced. The levels of serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) were measured as well. Sequencing analysis detected 17 different PHEX gene mutations, and 7 of these were identified as novel: 3 missense mutations, including c.304G>A (p.Gly102Arg) in exon 3, c.229T>C (p.Cys77Arg) in exon 3 and c.824T>C (p.Leu275Pro) in exon 7; 2 deletion mutations, including c.528delT (p.Glu177LysfsX44) in exon 5 and c.1234delA (p.Ser412ValfsX12) in exon 11; and 2 alternative splicing mutations, including c.436_436+1delAG in intron 4 at splicing donor sites and c.1483-1G>C in intron 13 at splicing acceptor sites. Moreover, 6 mutations were proven to be de novo in 6 sporadic cases and the probands were all females. No mutations were found in the 250 healthy controls. The serum levels of FGF23 varied widely among the patients with XLH, and no significant difference was found when compared with those of the healthy controls. On the whole, the findings of this study provide new insight into the spectrum of PHEX mutations and provide potential evidence of a critical domain in PHEX protein. In addition, the finding of an overlap of the serum FGF23 levels between the patients with XLH and the healthy controls indicates its limited diagnostic value in XLH.\n", "fulltext": "Inherited hypophosphatemic rickets, characterized by bone mineralization disorders due to hypophosphatemia, secondary to a leak of phosphate from the kidneys, was first introduced by Albright et al (1). The clinical characteristics of the disease include growth retardation, bending of the weight-bearing extremities, and the resistance to vitamin D therapy during early childhood. Subsequently, patients suffer from spontaneous dental abscesses, extensive bone pain and arthropathy with aging. X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH; OMIM 307800), with an occurrence of appproximately 1 in 20,000 live births, is known as the most prevalent form of inherited hypophosphatemic rickets (2,3). The mutation in the phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidase on the X chromosome (PHEX; MIM 300550) was identified in 1995 as the causative gene for the disease (4). Thereafter, the genetic basis of other less prevalent types of inherited hypophosphatemic rickets, such as autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR; OMIM 193100) and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR1; OMIM 241520), was successively clarified (5,6). Nevertheless, the underlying pathogenesis for some sporadic cases without known genetic mutations remains to be determined and the significant findings of key roles of microRNAs (miRNAs of miRs) involved in bone formation may provide potential research issues (7\u20139). The PHEX gene, located on X chromosome Xp22.1, is composed of 22 exons spanning 243 kb and encodes for 749 amino acid proteins (10). It exhibits great homology to the M13 zinc metallopeptidases, a class of type 2 integral membrane glycoproteins that includes neprilysin (NEP), endothelin-converting enzymes 1 and 2 (ECE-1 and ECE-2), as well as the Kell antigen (KELL) (11). These proteins show the common structural traits of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane hydrophobic region and a large extracellular domain. The latter contains 10 highly conserved cysteine residues and two zinc-binding motifs and is involved in the secondary structure conformation or catalytic activity of the protein (11). It has been demonstrated that the tissue-specific expression of the PHEX gene and its mRNA expression is predominantly detected in bone lineage cells; for instance, osteoblasts, osteocytes and odontoblasts (10,12). However, the exact mechanisms through which inactivated PHEX leads to abnormal skeletal and renal manifestations in XLH have not yet been fully clarified. Studies have suggested the existence of phosphatonin that is responsible for the regulation of phosphate homeostasis in the Hyp mouse (13), an animal model of XLH with a 3\u2032 deletion of the PHEX gene. Based on the finding of increased fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) transcripts in the Hyp mouse, FGF23 was then regarded as a leading candidate for phosphatonin downstream of PHEX (14). An extensive mutation analysis of the genetic defects of the PHEX gene only revealed a few cases in China (15\u201321). In the present study, we screened a total of 18 affected families for mutations in the PHEX gene in order to interpret the mutation traits in Chinese patients and potentially provide evidence of a critical domain in PHEX protein. Moreover, the serum FGF23 levels in affected individuals were also measured as this may also contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of XLH. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital (Shanghai, China) and all subjects or their guardians (for the under-aged participants) provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The subjects enrolled in this study were from the Department of Osteoporosis and Bone Diseases in Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China over the past 3 years. A total of 18 unrelated Chinese families with hypophosphatemic rickets was examined and all subjects were of Han ethnicity. The pedigrees of the families with hypophosphatemic rickets are shown in Fig. 1. The diagnosis of hypophosphatemic rickets was mainly based on a history of childhood rickets, clinical manifestations and biochemical tests indicating hypophosphatemia along with elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatases. Patients with secondary rickets due to malnutrition, medication or tumor-induced osteomalacia were excluded. Finally, 65 individuals, including 43 patients, and 250 unrelated healthy controls were recruited and subjected to blood sampling followed by DNA analyses. In addition, another 95 healthy controls with normal serum phosphate and calcium levels and normal renal function were randomly selected to carry out measurements of serum levels of FGF23 in order to derive a reference range. To detect mutations in the PHEX gene, all DNA samples from the probands were initially analyzed. When a PHEX mutation was confirmed, DNA from first-degree relatives, as well as the symptomatic individuals was then screened for the detected mutation. A proband was identified as a sporadic case if the PHEX mutation was not detected in the parents, namely if both were asymptomatic. Mutation analyses of the affected individuals were performed by the direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products amplified from genomic DNA. The DNA was extracted from peripheral white blood cells by proteinase K digestion followed by purification with phenol/chloroform and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. The DNA sequence for the PHEX gene was obtained from the available online database (NCBI Reference Sequence Accession no. NG_007563.2). All the 22 exons with their adjacent intronic sequences of the PHEX gene were amplified by PCR with 21 pairs of sequencing primers designed using Primer 3 software (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/). The primer sequences are presented in Table I. Direct sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit, version 3.1 and the PCR products were directly sequenced using an automated ABI PRISM 3130 sequencer (both from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Simultaneously, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using PolyPhred (http://droog.gs.washington.edu/polyphred/) and novel mutations were identified using HGMD (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/). Mutations were checked using Mutalyzer 2.0 (http://mutalyzer.nl/check). The DNA sequences obtained were aligned with homologous sequences that had been deposited into GenBank using the CluxtalX 1.83 algorithm. To predict the impact of missense mutations on protein structure and function, Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2; http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2) (22) and Sorting Tolerant from Intolerant (SIFT; http://sift.jcvi.org) (23) were used based on sequence alignments. Serum FGF23 leels were measured using an intact human FGF23 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit obtained from Kainos Laboratories Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The detectable concentration ranged from 3 to 800 pg/ml. This assay has been validated in previous studies (16,24). Normally distributed variables are presented as the means \u00b1 SD, and non-normally distributed variables as the median (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles). Comparisons between groups were made using unpaired Student's t-tests for normal data, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-normal data. Values of P<0.05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0 software. The baseline clinical data and PHEX gene mutation analyses of 65 participants originating from 18 families are summarized in Table II. A total of 43 patients was confirmed to have XLH according to their clinical and genetic evidence. All the patients exhibited varying degrees of growth retardation, bending legs, dental anomalies, hypophosphatemia, markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels and normal serum calcium. The median (25th and 75th percentiles) age of the patients was 22.0 (8.3, 29.5) years and the median serum phosphate levels were 0.70 (0.57, 0.80) mmol/l. We identified 17 different mutations in the PHEX gene from 18 unrelated families and the distribution of PHEX mutations were 6 alternative splicing mutations (35.3%), 5 missense mutations (29.4%), 3 nonsense mutations (17.6%), 2 deletion mutations (11.8%) and 1 insertion mutation (5.9%) (Fig. 2). Among these, 7 mutation sites were identified as novel and they were respectively detected from families 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13 and 16: c.1483-1G>C in intron 13 at splicing acceptor sites leading to truncated protein, c.1234delA (p.Ser412ValfsX12) in exon 11, c.436_436+1delAG in intron 4 at splicing donor sites leading to truncated protein, c.824T>C (p.Leu275Pro) in exon 7, c.304G>A (p.Gly102Arg) in exon 3, c.229T>C (p.Cys77Arg) in exon 3 and c.528delT (p.Glu177LysfsX44) in exon 5. PolyPhen\u22122 and SIFT were performed to assess the missense mutational consequence of PHEX, and all 3 missense mutations were predicted to be probably damaging with a score of 0.930 for L275R, 0.917 for G102R and 1.000 for C77R, and a SIFT score of <0.05. Notably, the amino acid residues at p.275, p.102 and p.77 were evolutionarily highly conserved across 12 different species as shown in Fig. 3. In addition, the probands from families 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18 were identified as sporadic cases and the detected PHEX mutations were likely to be de novo, and the 6 probands were all female patients. Serum FGF23 levels were not normally distributed in either the normal controls or the XLH patients. The median value for intact serum FGF23 levels from the 95 healthy individuals aged between 22 to 77 years was 40.6 pg/ml and the reference range (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) was from 24.6 to 136.8 pg/ml (Table III). For the patients with XLH, as shown in Table IV, the serum FGF23 levels were below the reference range in 4 of 11 subjects, within the range in 4 subjects, and mildly elevated in 3 subjects. The serum FGF23 levels exhibited a wide variation in the patients with XLH, and no significant differences were found when compared with those of the normal controls (p>0.05). Based on the PHEX mutation database (http://www.PHEXdb.mcgill.ca), the frequencies of different mutation types were 25% frameshifts, 23% alternative splicing, 22% missense, 18% nonsense, 8% deletion and 4% polymorphisms. The mutations were scattered throughout the gene and the majority would potentially influence the pattern of post-translational modification of the protein and alter its secondary structure, resulting in the loss of PHEX function (25,26). In this study, we identified 17 different PHEX mutations from 18 unrelated Chinese families, and to the best of our knowledge, 7 were novel. Three novel missense mutations, namely, Cys77Arg, Gly102Arg and Leu275Pro, were detected. The residue p.77 was amongst the 10 highly conserved cysteine residues that were critical for disulfide-bond formation and protein folding (25,26). Thus, the single base change at this position would likely alter the secondary structure of the protein and render it out of action. Gly102 has been found to be conserved among NEP, PHEX and ECE-1 according to the multiple sequence alignment analysis in molecular research (27). Additionally, the glycine to arginine exchange was likely to increase the local charge of the PHEX gene product as arginine was positively charged, while glycine had an uncharged polar group. Therefore, it is possible that this base alteration plays a role in a different spatial conformation. The novel missense mutation detected in exon 7 involved a substitution of proline for leucine at residue 275. To date, there are only 14 different mutations confirmed in exon 7 and it is among the rarest mutant exons in line with the PHEX mutation database. Moreover, this site was estimated to be conserved with the replaced leucine occurred in both ECE-1 and PHEX. The 3 novel missense mutations identified in this study were shown to be highly conserved under the protein alignment of the PHEX gene from 12 different species and were verified to be pathogenic by bioinformatics tools (PolyPhen-2 and SIFT), which also rendered the evidence of their potential value for the phenotype in patients with XLH. Three nonsense mutations: Lys432X in exon 11, Arg291X and Gln311X in exon 8 were detected in this study, all of which would cause the translation of truncated protein with accidental loss of C-terminal region. It was demonstrated that the C-terminal region in the large extracellular domain was abundant in conserved cysteine residues and contained the zinc-binding motifs in exons 17 and 19 (10,11). The cysteine residues are responsible for the secondary structure formation and contribute to conformation integrity. The highly conserved zinc-binding motifs among NEP, PHEX, ECE-1 and KELL, are essential for the catalytic activity of the protein. Therefore, these 2 nonsense mutations would inevitably lead to impaired PHEX protein function. Six of the 17 PHEX mutations were identified as alternative splicing mutations, including 3 splice acceptor mutations and 3 splice donor mutations. Among these, 2 were novel mutations: 436_436+1delAG in the splice donor site of exon 4 and an alteration of C to G in intronic sequence 5' to initiate exon 11, -1 bp upstream. These 2 splicing mutations were predicted to result in the skipping of exons 4 and 11, respectively. Notably, both of the 2 affected exons comprised one conserved cyteine residue that was relevant for secondary structure transformation and thus protein function. That is, the newly identified 2\u2248splicing mutations were associated with the onset of XLH. The remaining 3 mutations were 1234delA in exon 11, c.528delT in exon 5 and 1843dupA in exon 18, characterized as frameshift mutations. The mutation occurring in exon 18 was first reported by Gauche et al (28). It caused the replacement of aspartic acid for threonine at residue 615 and opened a new reading frame for 6 amino acids and deemed to disrupt the overall integrity of the PHEX protein. Moreover, the hetero-PHEX protein. Moreover, the heteroprotein. Moreover, the hetero zygous deletion of one adenine nucleotide and one thymine nucleotide in exons 11 and 5 were 2 novel mutations identified in our study. These mutations would result in premature termination of the PHEX protein. No hotspot mutations were found in XLH according to the present study in accordance with previous studies on PHEX mutations in Chinese patients (15\u201321). However, it was valued that exceeding 50% mutations occurred around exons 18 to 22 in the C-terminal region based on the mutation analyses in PHEXdb and it was speculated that this region may be the critical domain for PHEX function (29). We failed to determine the gene dosage effect on disease severity by comparing the phenotypes of hemizygous males to those of heterozygous females from the same family. An evidence-based study also indicated that there was no difference in severity of the disease between genders in mutant Hyp mouse (30). Theoretically, heterozygous females should have a less severe phenotype due to random X-inactivation, the process of transcriptional silencing of one of the X chromosomes bringing about half of the normal alleles, while males have none. Sabbagh et al owed the absence of gene dose effect to a threshold of PHEX activity that was required for maintaining normal protein function (25). In addition to the gender impact, questions remain as to the possibility of correlations among either mutation location or type with phenotype severity. In the present study, the association between genotype and phenotype in patients with XLH was not observed. It has been proposed that there is a trend towards a more severe phenotype with mutations located in the C-terminal region or with truncating mutations (31); however, this has yet to be verified in a larger sample size. The aberrant activity of FGF23 was revealed as a common fundamental mechanism for the development of defects in phosphate and vitamin D metabolism in several hypophosphatemic diseases, including ADHR, XLH and tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) (5,32,33). The Hyp mouse, an animal model of XLH, provided evidence of increased levels of FGF23 transcripts due to the inactivated mutations of PHEX. Furthermore, an injection of FGF23 antibodies or the deletion of Fgf23 from the Hyp mouse has been shown to ameliorate or reverse the phosphate metabolic disorders (14,34). These findings strongly indicate the essential role of FGF23 in the regulation of systemic phosphate homeostasis in the Hyp mouse. However, we failed to observe a significant increase in serum FGF23 levels in all affected individuals compared with the healthy controls. Moreover, 4 of 11 patients with XLH even exhibited serum FGF23 levels below the reference range. Despite of the effect of confounding factors, the wide variation in serum FGF23 levels in XLH, as well as the overlapping FGF23 levels in XLH and healthy controls revealed its limited diagnostic value in patients with suspected XLH. Moreover, it was speculated that other factors, such as parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D, were responsible for hypophosphatemia in patients with XLH with inappropriate low to normal serum FGF23 levels, and for the normal serum phosphorus in healthy subjects with high serum FGF23 levels (33,34). Additionally, it was suggested that hypophosphatemia alone was not entirely responsible for the skeletal phenotype in XLH and the potential direct local effects of FGF23 may be involved in bone mineralization independent of its systematic action in phosphate homeostasis (35,36). In conclusion, we identified 17 different mutations in the PHEX gene in 18 unrelated Chinese families with hypophosphatemic rickets and 7 of these were novel. It should be noted that that 6 of the 17 PHEX mutations have been proven to be de novo, which suggests the frequent occurrence of sporadic cases of XLH in the Chinese population. The findings of the present study highlight the major role of PHEX gene mutations in hypophosphatemic rickets and emphasize the significance of genetic diagnosis in suspected cases to ascertain the clinical diagnosis of XLH, enabling timely intervention. Further studies are warranted in order to perform more extensive mutation analyses in affected individuals in order to elaborate the key domain in PHEX and the identification of unequivocal FGF23 function in the pathogenesis of XLH, subsequently, exploring for more effective treatments, not only for XLH, but also for associated diseases sharing similar molecular mechanism."}, "28101574": {"pmid": "28101574", "pmcid": "PMC5238800", "title": "NEK2 serves as a prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma", "abstract": "\nNever in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 (NEK2) is a microtubule-associated protein that regulates spindle assembly in human cells and is overexpressed in various malignancies. However, the role of NEK2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains undetermined. We performed RNA-seq of the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and the normal liver cell line HL-7702 using the Ion Proton System. NEK2 expression was detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in two cell lines and 5 matched HCC and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. The correlation between survival and NEK2 expression was analyzed in 359 patients with HCC using RNASeqV2 data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). The expression of NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 63 cases of HCC and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. Relationships between protein expression and clinicopathological parameters were assessed, and the correlations between NEK2 with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expressions were evaluated. A total of 610 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were revealed in the transcriptome comparison, 297 of which were upregulated and 313 were downregulated in HCC. NEK2, as the most obviously different DEG in cells and tissues from the RNA-seq data, was listed as an HCC candidate biomarker for further verification. NEK2 was overexpressed in HCC cells and tissues (P=0.002, P=0.013) and HCC patients with a high expression of NEK2 had a poor prognosis (P=0.0145). Clinical analysis indicated that the overexpression of NEK2 in HCC was significantly correlated with diolame complete (P<0.001), tumor nodule number (P=0.012) and recurrence (P=0.004). NEK2 expression was positively correlated with the expression of phospho-AKT (r=0.883, P<0.01) and MMP-2 (r=0.781, P<0.01). Overexpression of NEK2 was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and poor patient outcomes, suggesting that NEK2 serves as a prognostic biomarker for HCC. Alteration of NEK2 protein levels may contribute to invasion and metastasis of HCC, which may occur through activation of AKT signaling and promotion of MMP-2 expression.\n", "fulltext": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most prevalent type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide (1\u20133). Epidemiological studies show that the incidence of HCC is markedly varied across geographical regions, ancestry groups and between genders (4). HCC incidence is highest in East Asia and Africa and rapid increases in prevalence have occurred in Western countries (5). The typical characteristics of HCC include fast infiltrating growth, abnormal cell differentiation, high-grade malignancy, early metastasis and poor prognosis (6,7). Therefore, identifying novel and reliable biomarkers to identify, predict and treat HCC are urgently needed. NEK2 [NIMA (never in mitosis gene A)-related expressed kinase 2], a serine/threonine centrosomal kinase, plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle and mitosis by centrosome splitting during the cell division process (8). Uncontrolled NEK2 activity can result in chromosome instability (CIN) and abnormal chromosome content (9,10). NEK2 overexpression has been demonstrated in several types of human cancers, such as breast (11\u201314), prostate (11), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (15) and colorectal cancer (16). Additionally, some reports have indicated NEK2 as a potential biomarker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer prognosis (17,18), but NEK2 has rarely been investigated with regard to HCC. With the advancements in the next generation of sequencing technologies, RNA-seq has become a powerful tool for deciphering global gene expression patterns, including an unprecedented capability to discover novel genes, alternative transcript variants, chimeric transcripts, expressed sequence variants and allele-specific expressions (19\u201322). RNA-seq has expanded the study of cancer transcriptomics in the areas of gene expression, chimeric events and alternative splicing in search of novel biomarkers for the disease (23). By integrating the RNA-seq data for the cells in the present study and the tissues in the study by Huang et al (24), we found that NEK2 expression was significantly upregulated and associated with a poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Therefore, NEK2 may be a very promising prognostic biomarker for predicting HCC. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms responsible for NEK2 overexpression in HCC also were investigated. A total of 63 patients who were diagnosed with HCC and treated with partial liver resection surgery at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from 2010 to 2013 were enrolled in this study. These patients included 52 males and 11 females, with a mean age of 47.86 years (range, 28\u201371 years) at the time of the operation. The patients were pathologically diagnosed with HCC of histological grade II (n=28), grade III (n=20) and grade IV (n=15) according to the modified nuclear grading scheme outlined by the Edmondson and Steiner system. A summary of the patient characteristics and the pathological characteristics is presented in Table I. For validation using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), HCC tissues and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues from 5 different HCC patients (aged 42\u201368 years) were provided by the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University in 2014. No prior treatments (including chemotherapy or radiotherapy) were conducted before the liver resection surgery. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Guangxi Medical University. All patients provided written informed consent in order to participate in this study. All HCC tissues and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues were obtained immediately after hepatectomy and were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C or collected in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for histopathological analysis. The human HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and primary human normal liver cell line HL-7702 were purchased from the Committee on Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All cell lines were maintained under recommended culture conditions. Cells were incubated in a 37\u00b0C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. For whole transcriptome sequencing, RNA from 1\u00d7107 SMMC-7721 and HL-7702 cells was extracted using the TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and then quantified using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The whole transcriptome RNA-seq procedure was performed using the Ion Total RNA-Seq kit, the Ion PI\u2122 Chip kit, the Ion PI\u2122 Template OT2 200 kit, and the Ion PI\u2122 Sequencing 200 kit based on the protocols of Life Technologies Corp. (Waltham, MA, USA). In brief, mRNA was purified using oligo-dT beads from 100 \u00b5g of total RNAs for each sample and then fragmented. The cleaved RNA fragments were reverse-transcribed into First-Strand cDNA, followed by Second-Strand cDNA synthesis. Then, a single 'A' base was added to the cDNA fragments at the 3\u2032 end. The cDNAs were ligated to adapters and enriched by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate the final cDNA library. After amplifying the sequencing template, RNA-seq was performed using the Ion Proton System (Life Technologies) with the standard protocol. Total RNA was extracted from cell lines and liver specimens using the TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To avoid any DNA contamination, isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) and quantified by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA samples were measured using optical density at 260 nm and then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the M-MLV First-Strand system for the qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. qRT-PCR was performed using the FastStart Universal SYBR-Green Master (Roche Diagnostics, Shanghai, China) and repeated three times in an ABI 7500 system. The primer sequences used to detect mRNA were as follows: NEK2, forward 5\u2032-CTTCCCGGGCTGAGGACTAT-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-TCAGCTTCTGTCATGGAGCC-3\u2032; \u03b2-actin, forward 5\u2032-GGGAAATCGTGCGTGACAT-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-CTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGAG-3\u2032. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial melting at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 5 sec and 60\u00b0C for 64 sec. Analysis of the melting curve for the primers was conducted to confirm the specificity of the PCR product, and the threshold cycle (Ct) value for triplicate reactions was averaged. The relative expression of NEK2 mRNA for each sample was calculated as follows: \u0394Ct = Ct (sample) \u2212 Ct (\u03b2-actin), \u0394\u0394Ct (sample) = \u0394Ct (sample) \u2212 \u0394Ct (calibrator). The fold changes in mRNA were calculated through relative quantification (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct). Immunohistochemical studies on NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections obtained from the aforementioned patients with HCC and were performed according to the standard procedures. Sections were cut at a thickness of 5 \u00b5m and heated in a 60\u00b0C oven. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and boiled in 0.01 mol/l sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven for 10 min for antigen epitope retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Then, the sections were blocked for 30 min using 10% normal goat serum and were separately incubated with the primary antibodies directed against NEK2 (ab55550, 1:1,000 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), phospho-AKT (Ser473) (#4060, 1:50 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) and MMP-2 (ab86607 1:500, dilution; Abcam) at 37\u00b0C for 3 h. After washing, the sections were incubated for 30 min with biotinylated secondary antibody (Envision\u2122 Detection kit; Gene Tech, Shanghai, China) at 37\u00b0C. The staining of the tissue sections was performed using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2. The complex was visualized with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin. The sections were then dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol, cleared in xylene and mounted onto glass slides. The staining was quantified by digital image analysis with Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) according to the method developed by Xavie et al (25). Briefly, an area of interest in each section was first selected at \u00d740 magnification, and 10 digital images at 1360\u00d71024 pixel resolution and \u00d7400 magnification were captured using an AX-70 microscope equipped with a DP70 CCD camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Identical settings were used for each field. The measurement parameter was integrated optical density (IOD). Optical density was calibrated, and the area of interest was set as follows: hue, 0\u201330; saturation, 0\u2013255; and intensity, 0\u2013255. The values were then counted. The TCGA project provides multimodal data on 359 HCC cases, which can be acquired from the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). The dataset was searched for HCC cases based on the RNASeqV2 data. The expression value of the NEK2 gene was collected for each case and was divided into the high-expression and the low-expression groups using the cut-off point. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the survival differences between the high-expression and low-expression subgroups, with P-values calculated using the log-rank test. Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Relationships between the expressions of NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 and the clinicopathological parameters were determined using the two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. Significance among three groups was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Duncan's new multiple range test. The correlations between the NEK2 expression with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expressions were studied using the Spearman's coefficient. Data are shown as the means \u00b1 standard error of the means. P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences. RNA-seq of the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and the normal liver cell line HL-7702 was performed using the Ion Proton System. On average, ~78.1 million 96-bp-long sequencing reads and 7.5 G of raw sequence data were obtained for samples sequenced on one lane. The normalized gene expression was measured as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). To evaluate differential gene expression, the absolute value of the log2-transformed fold change (FC) \u22651 and the q-values <0.05 were used as the criteria to determine the significance of gene expression differences. A total of 610 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were revealed in the transcriptome comparison, 297 of which were upregulated and 313 were downregulated in HCC. Huang et al (24) performed RNA-seq analyses of 10 matched pairs of cancerous and non-cancerous tissues from HCC patients on the Solexa/Illumina GAII platform. The results showed that a total of 1378 DEGs with 808 upregulation and 570 downregulation in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. An integrated analysis was then performed on the RNA-seq data of the cells and tissues. As shown in the Venn diagram in Fig. 1A, 12 common differential genes were found between the HCC cells and the normal cells and between the HCC tissues and the adjacent tissues, 10 of which were upregulated and 2 were downregulated in HCC (Table II). Excitingly, NEK2 exhibited the most significant difference in expression of all the DEGs in the cell and tissue RNA-seq data and was therefore listed as an HCC candidate biomarker for further verification (Fig. 1B and C). NEK2 expression status in the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and the primary HCC tissue samples was assessed using qRT-PCR. The NEK2 mRNA transcript level was 0.024\u00b10.0026 in the HCC cell line SMMC-7721, which was 1.71-fold higher than the NEK2 mRNA level of 0.014\u00b10.0003 in the normal liver cell line HL-7702 (P=0.002) (Fig. 2A), as evidenced by qRT-PCR analysis using \u03b2-actin as a loading control. In 5 matched HCC and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue samples, the NEK2 mRNA level in the HCC tissues was 5.60\u00b13.69, which was 16.47-fold higher than the NEK2 mRNA level of 0.34\u00b10.38 in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (P=0.013) (Fig. 2B). The expression of NEK2 in 63 cases of HCC and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues was examined using immunohistochemical staining. The NEK2 protein is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm, and we quantified its expression using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 digital image analysis software. We found that NEK2 expression presented as positive staining in HCC tissues and negative staining in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the expression of NEK2 protein was significantly higher in the HCC tissues than in the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (P<0.001) (Fig. 2D). To evaluate the clinical significance of NEK2 overexpression, the correlation between the survival and the expression of NEK2 in the cases of 359 patients with HCC was analyzed using RNASeqV2 data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website. According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we defined RPKM=52.73 as the cut-off point to distinguish HCC patients with high and low NEK2 expression levels (Fig. 3A). The sensitivity and specificity of NEK2 in the diagnosis of HCC were 0.98 and 0.82, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of HCC patients was performed based on the expression levels of NEK2. The results revealed that HCC patients with a high expression of NEK2 had a poor prognosis (log-rank test, P=0.0145) (Fig. 3B). Previous studies suggested that the overexpression of NEK2 promotes activation of AKT, a potent and critical oncogene for a variety of malignancies (26,27). Moreover, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays an important role in upregulating MMP expression (28). Therefore, to further investigate the relationship between the NEK2 expression and the expression of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 in HCC, we assessed the expression of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 in 63 cases of HCC and matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues using immunohistochemical staining. The staining for phospho-AKT and MMP-2 was mostly positive in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells (Fig. 4A and C). We found that the expression of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 was increased in HCC tissues compared with matched adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (P=0.048 and 0.027) (Fig. 4B and D). Table I summarizes the relationships between the expression of NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 and the clinicopathological parameters of patients with HCC, including patient age, gender, AFP level, tumor size, portal vein thrombosis, diolame complete, tumor nodule number, Edmondson grade, cirrhosis, HBV DNA and recurrence. The results showed that NEK2, phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expression in the HCC tumor size \u226410 cm group was 1.58-fold (P=0.024), 2.24-fold (P=0.041), and 2.29-fold (P=0.013) higher, respectively, than that in the HCC tumor size >10 cm group (Fig. 5A). NEK2 and MMP-2 expression in the HCC diolame incomplete group was 1.91-fold (P<0.001) and 2.04-fold (P=0.009) higher, respectively, than that in the HCC diolame complete group, but no obvious change was observed in phospho-AKT expression in the HCC diolame incomplete group (P=0.948) (Fig. 5B). NEK2, p-AKT and MMP-2 expression in the HCC multinodular group was 1.62-fold (P=0.012), 2.40-fold (P=0.046), and 2.04-fold (P=0.024) higher, respectively, than that in the HCC uninodular group (Fig. 5C). NEK2 and p-AKT expression in the HCC recurrence group was 2.09-fold (P=0.004) and 3.24-fold (P=0.045) higher, respectively, than that in the HCC non-recurrence group, but no obvious change was observed in MMP-2 expression in the HCC non-recurrence group (P=0.992) (Fig. 5D). Additionally, to explore whether the NEK2 expression level was correlated with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expression, the protein expressions of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 were examined in 63 cases of HCC tissues using immunohistochemical staining. Therefore, the correlations between NEK2 expression with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expression were analyzed. The results showed that there was indeed evident positive correlation between the protein expression level of NEK2 and phospho-AKT (r=0.883, P<0.01) (Fig. 6A). Notably, a significant positive correlation was observed between the protein expression levels of NEK2 and MMP-2 (r=0.781, P<0.01) (Fig. 6B). NEK2 is a serine-threonine protein kinase of the NIMA-related kinase family that localizes to the centrosomes, which are the microtubule-organizing centers of a cell that regulate its separation (8). The NIMA-related kinase (Nek) family consists of eleven members (NEKs 1\u201311) (29). In humans, NEK2 exhibits the greatest sequence identity to NIMA (8). In the process of cell division, NEK2 promotes centrosome splitting at the beginning of mitosis by the phosphorylation of multiple linker components (30). In addition to centrosome separation, NEK2 also regulates the microtubule organization capacity of the centrosome (31,32). Recent studies have shown that an elevated expression of NEK2 induces abnormal tumor proliferation and drug resistance in breast and ovarian cancers (13,33,34). Furthermore, the significant upregulation of NEK2 has been demonstrated to be associated with the progression and poor prognosis of a series of malignant tumors originating in different organs and tissues, such as colorectal carcinoma (35), breast carcinoma (36) and myeloma (27). However, whether NEK2 expression is elevated and associated with the clinicopathological features and prognosis of HCC remains unclear. In this study, we first assessed the expression of NEK2 in cells and tissues and found that NEK2 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC cells and tissues. Additionally, we examined the expression of NEK2 in a relatively large population of patients diagnosed with HCC and correlated it with the clinicopathological parameters and prognosis to verify whether this biomarker could predict HCC outcomes. The present study revealed that the overexpression of NEK2 was significantly correlated with diolame complete, tumor nodule number and recurrence. Thus, these results strongly confirm the intriguing possibility that the alteration of NEK2 protein levels may contribute to the invasion and metastasis of HCC. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis demonstrated that HCC patients with a high expression of NEK2 had a poor prognosis, suggesting that NEK2 may be a potential prognostic factor for HCC patients. Therefore, NEK2 can be used as a novel prognostic biomarker to identify, distinguish, and predict HCC. The main limitation of this analysis is that, due to clinical covariates on HCC cases on TCGA website are not available, the multivariate Cox's regression survival model cannot be performed to assess the relative contribution of the risk group when assessed after adjusting for clinical variables. Despite the important role of NEK2 in centrosome regulation and spindle formation, the mechanism of the abnormal expression and regulation of NEK2 remains unclear. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism that underlies the role of NEK2. Previous studies suggested that NEK2 may be involved in tumor progression through the influence of other tumor pathways. The elevation of NEK2 contributes to the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, a potent and critical oncogene for a variety of malignancies (26,27). Moreover, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays an important role in upregulating MMP expression (28), and aberrant AKT signaling could promote cell proliferation in HCC cells (37). Therefore, we sought to verify whether such a mechanism may contribute to HCC progression induced by NEK2. In this study, we found that the expression level of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 proteins was increased in HCC and positively correlated with NEK2, which indicated that overexpression of NEK2 may result in the high expression of phospho-AKT and MMP-2 proteins in HCC. Furthermore, the AKT signaling pathway has been reported to play a key role in HCC cell invasion and metastasis by promoting the expression of MMP-2 (37), which is a key factor in HCC invasion and metastasis (38). The expression level of MMP-2 significantly reflects the aggressiveness of malignant tumor cells and is associated with poor prognosis in multiple tumor types (37). Combining the above findings with our results, we suggest that the invasion and metastasis effect of NEK2 in HCC may occur through the activation of AKT signaling and promotion of MMP-2 expression. In conclusion, our data revealed that high expression of the NEK2 protein was common in HCC tissue samples and cultured hepatoma cell lines and was significantly associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable clinicopathological factors in HCC. Moreover, the NEK2 expression level was positively correlated with phospho-AKT and MMP-2 expression. Our results suggest that NEK2 is important for the progression, migration and invasion of HCC and may be a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC."}, "27959387": {"pmid": "27959387", "pmcid": "PMC5182011", "title": "Long-term exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to ethanol stimulates oncogenic features", "abstract": "\nAlcohol consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer.

We previously showed that long-term exposure to 2.5 mM ethanol (blood alcohol ~0.012%) of MCF-12A, a human normal epithelial breast cell line, induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oncogenic transformation. In this study, we investigated in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, whether a similar exposure to ethanol at concentrations ranging up to peak blood levels in heavy drinkers would increase malignant progression. Short-term (1-week) incubation to ethanol at as low as 1\u20135 mM (corresponding to blood alcohol concentration of ~0.0048\u20130.024%) upregulated the stem cell related proteins Oct4 and Nanog, but they were reduced after exposure at 25 mM. Long-term (4-week) exposure to 25 mM ethanol upregulated the Oct4 and Nanog proteins, as well as the malignancy marker Ceacam6. DNA microarray analysis in cells exposed for 1 week showed upregulated expression of metallothionein genes, particularly MT1X. Long-term exposure upregulated expression of some malignancy related genes (STEAP4, SERPINA3, SAMD9, GDF15, KRT15, ITGB6, TP63, and PGR, as well as the CEACAM, interferon related, and HLA gene families). Some of these findings were validated by RT-PCR. A similar treatment also modulated numerous microRNAs (miRs) including one regulator of Oct4 as well as miRs involved in oncogenesis and/or malignancy, with only a few estrogen-induced miRs. Long-term 25 mM ethanol also induced a 5.6-fold upregulation of anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of malignant-like features. Exposure to acetaldehyde resulted in little or no effect comparable to that of ethanol. The previously shown alcohol induction of oncogenic transformation of normal breast cells is now complemented by the current results suggesting alcohol's potential involvement in malignant progression of breast cancer.\n", "fulltext": "Excessive chronic alcohol intake is a widely acknowledged risk factor for breast cancer. In a previous study, we summarized the epidemiology and known pathology pertaining to alcohol consumption and breast cancer (1). Briefly, consumption of three or more drinks per day leads to a 40\u201350% increase in risk and there are ~50,000 alcohol-attributable breast cancer cases per year, worldwide (2\u20134). The risk of breast cancer increases with the quantity of alcohol consumed, showing a linear dose-response (5). There is a greater risk for lobular rather than ductal breast cancer (5\u20137), and tumors are more likely to be ER\u2212 and HER2+ in the women with high alcohol consumption (8,9). One proposed mechanism for the putative alcohol carcinogenicity involves stimulation of estrogen levels and/or estrogen responsiveness but other possibilities include effects unrelated to estrogen (2,3,9\u201313) such as inhibition of DNA methylation, interaction with retinoid metabolism, or oxidative stress. Such changes could operate either by direct ethanol effects and/or through the first ethanol metabolite, acetaldehyde. As summarized previously (1), a few studies in mice and rats have shown that ethanol consumption promotes mammary tumors via the estrogen pathway (14). The estrogen dependence was originally shown and partially explained in the widely used MCF-7 cell line, a human breast cancer luminal epithelial cell line which is estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and lacks ERBB2 gene amplification or Her2/neu protein overexpression (15\u201318). It was also shown that ethanol stimulates the in vitro growth, invasiveness and migration of these cells (17\u201324). However, the common denominator of the previous studies on MCF-7 cells is that the ethanol exposure was limited to <1 week, concentrations were >50 mM, and the effects were modest. A similar situation occurred with studies conducted on other types of more malignant breast cancer cell lines, such as T47D and erbB2 transformed cells (25\u201330). Another potential mechanism of ethanol's carcinogenicity is through enrichment of a subpopulation of cancer stem cells, but there are no reports on the effects of ethanol on this type of stem cells (31\u201333). Cancer stem cells are postulated to be involved in the generation of primary breast tumors and their progression to undifferentiated tumors and metastasis, and are claimed to be enriched within mammospheres (34,35). Although ethanol affects the proliferation and differentiation of normal embryonic and adult stem cells (36,37), it is not known whether it activates and/or increases the number of cancer stem cells. The latter process, as well as the regulation of breast cancer genes in general, is partially regulated by microRNAs (miR) (34,38\u201341), particularly with regard to the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) (42,43). Ethanol affects the expression of certain miRs in alcoholic liver injury and other pathologies (44,45), but no reports link this to breast cancer. In contrast, there is a substantial recent literature on miRs in relation to estrogen effects, particularly in MCF-7 cells (46\u201348), but none has been directly linked to ethanol exposure. In our previous study on the non-malignant epithelial human breast cell line MCF-12A (1) we found that ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, induced oncogenic features and EMT, and stimulated the expression of a collection of mRNAs and miRs, including those associated with these processes, and also stimulated certain protein markers for stem-related properties. In this study, the effects of short- and long-term exposures to physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol, and acetaldehyde up to supraphysiological levels were studied using MCF-7 monolayers and mammospheres. Stem cell markers, global transcriptional gene expression signatures including miRs, and in vitro responses in oncogenic assays were carried out to better understand the mechanism of action of alcohol on malignant progression in breast cancer. The aim was to clarify: a) whether the epidemiological relationship between excessive and long-term alcohol consumption and the malignant progression of breast cancer can be elucidated by defining the effects of ethanol on an accepted epithelial breast cancer cell line such as MCF-7 in vitro; b) whether ethanol intensifies some of the MCF-7 malignant features in a dosage- and/or duration of exposure-dependent way; c) the potential mediation of these effects by stem cell enrichment in both monolayers and mammospheres; d) the possible role of acetaldehyde in mediating those changes; and e) the impact of both alcohol and acetaldehyde on the mRNA and miR global signatures, so as to define the more affected pathways and to evaluate putative estrogen mediation. The human adherent epithelial adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line was obtained from ATCC (Catalog HT-22\u2122 Manassas, VA, USA), and routinely cultured on monolayers at \u226480% confluence in MEME (minimum essential medium Eagle's, ATCC), 10% FBS and 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). For most experiments, cells were incubated on 6-well plates with 0-25 mM ethanol (Fisher, molecular grade ethanol) or 0\u201312.5 mM acetaldehyde (Sigma, ACS), using freshly prepared solutions. Medium was replaced 2\u20133 times/week, including addition of ethanol or acetaldehyde, and cultures were maintained for 1 week (short-term incubations), or for 4 weeks (long-term incubations). In the latter case, cells were passaged on average once a week, with a 1:3 splitting. Mammospheres were generated for 1 week experiments by seeding 50,000 cells onto Corning Ultra Low Attachment 6-well-plates with 2 ml/well of MEBM medium (Fisher, mammary epithelial cell growth medium), adding 2% (v/v) of B27 Supplement (B27 serum-free supplement, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin, and then adding ethanol or acetaldehyde. For 4-week incubations, monolayers were cultured for this period with ethanol or acetaldehyde and used for mammosphere generation that were maintained in the presence of these agents for an additional week. Their number and total area were determined by applying quantitative image analysis (QIA) to digital photographs taken with a Nikon digital camera of 0.005% crystal violet stained mammospheres contained in individual wells of a 6-well plate, using ImagePro-Plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). After images were calibrated for background lighting, integrated optical density (IOD = area \u00d7 average intensity) was calculated. Inverted microscopy images were taken under phase contrast at 40\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope and a Leica VCC digital camera. Medium was decanted from wells and cells were washed twice with PBS at pH 7.4. Boiling buffer (1% SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 and protease inhibitors) was added to each well, cells were scraped from each well and passed several times through a 26-gauge needle to reduce viscosity, incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min, then 20\u201340 \u03bcg of protein was run on 4\u201315% gradient polyacrylamide gels, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunodetection using antibodies against: i) Oct-4, (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA); ii) CEACAM-6 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA); iii) NANOG (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000, AVIVA Systems, San Diego, CA, USA) and iv) GAPDH (mouse monoclonal, 1:3,000, Chemicon). Membranes were incubated with secondary polyclonal horse anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000; BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA or 1:5,000; Amersham GE, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), bands were visualized with luminol (SuperSignal West Pico, Chemiluminescent, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). For the negative controls the primary antibody was omitted. Cultures were grown in 8-well-removable-chamber slides, subjected to immunofluorescence detection by quenching in 0.3% H2O2, blocking with goat (or corresponding) serum, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibody for Oct-4 or NANOG. This was followed by a secondary anti-mouse IgG biotinylated antibody (goat, 1:200, Vector Laboratories) and this complex was detected with streptavidin-Texas Red. After washing with PBS, the sections were mounted with Prolong antifade/DAPI (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Negative controls in all cases omitted the first antibodies or were replaced by IgG isotype. Control and 25 mM ethanol-incubated MCF-7 cells were grown in GM-20, washed twice with Hanks buffered salt solution, disaggregated by repeated pipeting in CellStripper (Mediatech, Manassas VA, USA), pelleted, and resuspended in staining buffer consisting of PBS, 3% FBS (SB). Cells were incubated in the presence of antibodies for 30 min on ice, washed twice with SB, and resuspended in SB for flow cytometry on an LSR II (BD Biosciences). Controls included samples without any antibody as well as samples including all combinations of antibodies so as to determine that the Ceacam6 stained cells and the CD44 stained cells were accurately identified. Data analysis and plotting were done using FACSDiva Version 6.1.1 software. Fluorophore-conjugated antibodies and G12-5841 PE (eBiosciences), performed separately, followed cell permeabilization with BD CytoFix/CytoPerm kit. BD CompBeads were used for compensation. RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen) with quality determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Assays were performed by the UCLA DNA microarray core, applying the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array for >30,000 genes. Up- and downregulated genes (by >2-fold) were considered, except where indicated. DNA microarray results are deposited in the GEO library under accession no. GSE72013. The expression of some of the down- and upregulated genes identified by DNA microarray analysis was further examined on triplicate RNA samples. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCr (Life Technologies), and the resulting samples were amplified using PCR. Primers were designed using the NCBI Primer Blast program applied to mRNA sequences and synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich. All primers were designed to include an exon-exon junction except for GAPDH. Negative controls omitted cDNA. PCR results were analyzed by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels in Tris-acetate EDTA buffer followed by photography under ultraviolet illumination in a UVP Biodoc transilluminator. RNA was isolated from cells using the mirVana\u2122 miRNA isolation kit (Ambion), and analysis was carried out by LC Sciences (Houston, TX, USA) for all miR transcripts listed in the Sanger miRBase Release 18.0. The miR results are deposited in the GEO library under accession no. GSE72013. Cells were trypsinized, suspended in 1 ml/well of warm (37\u00b0C) 0.3\u20130.5% agar in MEME-10% FBS-bovine serum albumin (soft agar layer) and 10,000 cells/ml were plated in duplicate or triplicate above a layer of 1 ml of 1% agar in the same medium that had previously been allowed to solidify on 6-well plates at 4\u00b0C (hard layer agar). Cultures were allowed to grow for 3\u20134 weeks and when foci were visible, they were stained with 0.005% crystal violet in Hanks solution for 1 h, wells were photographed as described in 'Cell culture', and colonies were counted, also as described above. Matrigel\u2122 basement membrane matrix was diluted 1:5 with serum free culture medium containing 0.5% BSA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Trypsinized cells were added at 25,000 cells/well to Transwell\u00ae Permeable Support 8.0-\u03bcm inserts containing Matrigel and culture medium, and cultured in a 24-well plate using FBS as the chemoattractant for 40 h. Cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue. MCF-7 cells (control vs 4 weeks 25 mM ethanol) were incubated in estrogen-depletion medium (EDM): phenol red-free DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) containing 5% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (Gibco) for 3 days, washed with Hanks, trypsinized, resuspended in EDM and plated at 1,000 cells/well into a 96-well plate. 4-OH-tamoxifen was added to a concentration of 0, 1, 2, 5 or 10 \u03bcM (6-wells for each concentration). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 4 days, washed once with Hanks, followed by the addition of 100 \u03bcl of EDM. After 30-min additional incubation, each well received 20 \u03bcl of the metabolic activity indicator CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and cells were further incubated (37\u00b0C in 5% CO2) for 30 min. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured using an automated plate reader. Statistical values are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM). The normality distribution of the data was established using the Wilk-Shapiro test. Multiple comparisons were analyzed by a single factor ANOVA, followed by post hoc comparisons with the Newman-Keuls test. Differences among groups were considered statistically significant at p<0.05. To investigate the possibility that ethanol exerts its oncogenic effects through the stimulation of cancer stem cell proliferation, we carried out experiments to ascertain the effects on the key stem cell marker proteins Oct4 and Nanog. MCF-7 monolayer cultures were incubated at 30\u201380% confluence for 7 days with 1\u201325 mM ethanol and subjected to western blot analysis for Oct4 and Nanog (Fig. 1). The highest concentration of ethanol is roughly equivalent to peak serum levels of alcohol in women within 1 h of consumption of 3\u20134 glasses of wine. The stemness-related nuclear Oct4a isoform (45 kDa) was increased after exposure to 1 and 5 mM ethanol, and was reduced at 10 and 25 mM. Triplicate samples of the 25 mM treatment show downregulation. The cytoplasmic Oct4b (33 kDa), unrelated to stemness, was expressed at low levels and remained unchanged. The main 39 kDa Nanog isoform was increased after exposure to 1\u201310 mM ethanol, and analogous to the Oct4 result, was also decreased at 25 mM. The nuclear localization of Oct4a, consistent with its known stemness function, and, in addition, the nuclear localization of Nanog, were confirmed by double immunofluorescence with Texas red for the specific antigen and DAPI for nuclei in MCF-7 cells incubated in the absence of ethanol (data not shown). In order to investigate whether ethanol effects are mediated by its first oxidation product, acetaldehyde, a range of acetaldehyde concentrations was applied to MCF-7 monolayers and the effect on Oct4 expression was analyzed. Acetaldehyde over the range of 0.5\u201312.5 mM and over the same time of incubation did not affect the expression of Oct4 (Fig. 2). These acetaldehyde concentrations, considerably lower than the respective ethanol concentrations, were chosen based on the fact that they are marginally to considerably higher (i.e., approximately one log value) than the acetaldehyde values that would be expected in human serum after substantial drinking. These levels have been measured to be as much as 0.2 mM (49). Even at these levels acetaldehyde had little or no effect on Oct4 levels. Gene expression analysis of MCF-7 cells grown in monolayer in the presence or absence of ethanol (25 mM) for 1 and 4 weeks was carried out by subjecting RNA samples to DNA microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST system. The longer exposure was intended to better model the situation that exists in vivo in chronic drinkers. In order to determine the global transcriptional signature that differentiates the malignant MCF-7 cells from a normal counterpart, we compared the MCF-7 cell line with the spontaneously immortalized but otherwise benign breast epithelial line MCF-12A (1). For each gene sequence, the ratio of MCF-7 expression to MCF-12A expression was determined from duplicate samples. We refer to the collection of MCF-7/MCF-12A gene expression ratios shown in Table I as the MCF-7 oncogenic signature. Some genes related to oncogenic processes were substantially changed, being up- or downregulated by a factor \u22652.0. This transcriptional signature was characterized by 15 genes upregulated by a factor \u22652.4, and 3 oncogenesis-related genes downregulated to a factor of \u22640.27, including some associated with oncogenic transformation and some associated with growth-related hormone receptors. We then investigated whether an oncogenic signature reflected the effects of ethanol treatment on MCF-7 by itself. Short-term ethanol incubation for 1 week had little or no effect on the expression of this group of 18 genes (Table I), whereas 4-week exposure increased CEACAM5, CEACAM6, and progesterone receptor (PGR) gene expression (Table I). Neither 1-nor 4-week exposures to ethanol or acetaldehyde affected the transcriptional expression of Oct-4 or Nanog (Table II). In view of the interesting results on the transcriptional expression of the malignancy related CEACAMs, we evaluated by western blot analysis the effects of long-term ethanol exposure on Ceacam6, an oncogenic protein associated with breast cancer (50), along with the Oct4 and Nanog proteins. Fig. 3 shows that 25 mM ethanol upregulates the expression of these proteins, with particularly strong upregulation in Oct4 and Ceacam6, and a visible but non-significant increase of Nanog. In the case of Oct4, this suggests a post-transcriptional modulation induced by ethanol (see Discussion). These results potentially may also indicate the induction of higher stem cell number or the selection of a subpopulation of cells with some stem-like features. In order to determine whether Ceacam-6 upregulation represented a global increase or was restricted to a subpopulation of cells, untreated control MCF-7 monolayers and monolayer cells exposed to 25 mM ethanol for 4 weeks were analyzed by flow cytometry. Fig. 4 (center) shows that a fraction of the cells did show enrichment of Ceacam-6 following ethanol treatment, from 2.11% in controls to 8.18% in ethanol-treated cells, consistent with levels of upregulation observed in western blot analyses and PCRs. The control forward- and side-scattering (Fig. 4, left) indicate that the ethanol treatment did not appreciably affect cell size or internal complexity, as shown by the lack of observed changes. In view of the assumption that mammospheres are enriched in stem cells, we investigated whether ethanol affects mammosphere formation and composition. MCF-7 cells were maintained in monolayer culture in the presence or absence of ethanol, following which mammospheres were prepared from each sample. The mammospheres derived from control and ethanol treated cultures were maintained for an additional week in control medium or ethanol medium respectively. The number of mammospheres and their morphology did not visually appear to be modified by ethanol exposure (data not shown). Despite the observed increase in Oct4a and Nanog proteins induced by long-term 25 mM ethanol treatment in MCF-7 monolayers, it is of interest that these effects were not replicated in mammospheres obtained from these cultures and maintained for an additional week in the presence of ethanol. Fig. 5 shows that the previously observed increase in Oct4a and Nanog in monolayer was not observed in mammospheres where stem cells should be enriched, but Ceacam6 did remain upregulated. More surprisingly, taking into account our original assumption, when mammospheres were quantitated by determining both size and number, long-term exposure to ethanol did not significantly increase their yield, as judged by their relative area (29,352 control vs. 33,889 ethanol-treated), or by their numbers either by counting stained mammospheres under the microscope (1,337 control vs. 1,295 ethanol) or as determined using quantitative image analysis (1,314 control vs. 1,357 ethanol-treated). RNA was isolated from the mammospheres obtained under 1-week exposure to ethanol or acetaldehyde and subjected to DNA microarray analysis. Table II shows that mammospheres were not enriched in the expression of a collection of stem cell genes. Neither ethanol nor acetaldehyde stimulated the expression of these genes in mammospheres or their original monolayers, which is noteworthy since some are related to breast cancer, such as: ALDH2, SOX4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, HEY1, JAG1, DNER or Dll1 (51). No parallel assay was conducted in the mammospheres exposed long-term to ethanol. As stated above, CEACAM6 protein upregulation induced by long-term ethanol exposure as shown on western blot analyses was in general agreement with mRNA upregulation, so we investigated whether other CEACAM mRNAs or those from other gene families were also upregulated. Table III shows that gene expression of the CEACAMs, cytokines and HLAs were all stimulated by 25 mM ethanol, by factors ranging from 1.7 to 8.1. Long-term incubation with ethanol also induces other changes of oncogenic relevance, as confirmed by the substantial upregulation of a series of genes related to breast cancer such as STEAP4, SERPINA3, SAMD9, GDF-15, TP63, PGR, and others, with the transcriptional expression of 13 genes being increased \u22652.0 in two experiments (Table IVA). To confirm the DNA microarray results, selected RNAs from the second of the two experiments were subjected to RT-PCR for some genes in the families mentioned above (Fig. 6). The correspondence between the RT-PCR and DNA microarray values was good to excellent (Table IVB), thus showing that ethanol indeed upregulated these cancer-related genes, and validating in general the DNA microarray data. Of particular interest, a family of genes, the metallothioneins (MTs), is known to be induced by ethanol (52,53). Short-term 25 mM ethanol upregulated the mRNA expression of multiple members of this family (MT1F, MT1X, and MT2A, by a factor of \u22652) (Table V). This effect was specific to ethanol, as it was not seen in response to treatment with 2.5 mM acetaldehyde. The upregulation detected by DNA microarray analysis was also confirmed by RT-PCR, as for example MT1X (Fig. 7). However, this significant upregulation seemed to be short-lived, since after the 4-week exposure, it declined to only a marginal increase (not shown) suggesting the adaptation of MCF-7 to ethanol in terms of metallothionein expression. MicroRNAs (miRs) function by suppressing the activities of specific target mRNAs. Although it is possible for multiple miRs to affect a specific mRNA, sometimes an inverse relationship is observed between the expression level of a particular miR and the prevalence of the polypeptide coded by its target mRNA. Therefore, identifying the global miR transcriptional signature in response to ethanol exposure is important in clarifying the mechanism(s) of action of ethanol on breast cancer, particularly in evaluating its putative estrogen-like effects. We therefore carried out 4-week incubations of MCF-7 monolayers with and without 25 mM ethanol in duplicate experiments to investigate changes in miR prevalence. Changes in the global expression signature of miRs induced by ethanol are presented in Table VI, showing that out of 1,904 miRs analyzed, 18 miRs were consistently upregulated in two separate assays by a factor of >2.0 and another 24 were downregulated by at least an equivalent factor (to \u22640.5). Of these, 4 miRs showed substantial upregulation (by >3.0) and 9 miRs were substantially downregulated (to \u22640.33). Within the group of 4 upregulated genes, 3 are linked to cancer, namely miR-3170 which is downregulated in Merkel cell carcinoma (54), miR-335-5p which is linked to fibrosarcoma (55) and colorectal cancer but was negative in at least one study in MCF-7 (56), and miR-424-5p which is increased in breast cancer through an estrogen stimulated pathway (57) but is anti-invasive in another system (58). Within the group of 9 downregulated miRs, 5 are also related to cancer: miR-2861 is upregulated in thyroid carcinoma with lymph node metastases (59) but has been suggested as one element in a circulating miR screen for cervical cancer (see Discussion), miR-3185 for chordoma (60), miR-1915 whose downregulation would predict an antiapoptotic effect (and therefore potential oncogenicity) mediated through Bcl-2 (61), miR-4492 potentially linked to breast cancer (62), and miR-1469 downregulation linked to lymphatic metastasis in gastric cancer (63) but a stimulatory factor for apoptosis in lung cancer cells (64). In Table VII, we group other miRs affected by long-term ethanol exposure of MCF-7, focusing on whether these miRs may be related to two additional important issues that may underlie the observed intensification of MCF-7 malignant features: a) the finding of upregulation of Oct4 and Ceacam6 protein expression; and b) the putative mediation of alcohol effects by estrogen-like mechanisms. In Table VII, miRs whose expression was affected in general by a factor of >2 are listed based on a relationship with one or more of these issues. In terms of the Oct4 regulation, Let-7 has been reported to repress Oct4 protein expression (65) and after ethanol treatment it is substantially downregulated from high levels seen in the non-exposed control. Considering the observed lack of OCT4 gene transcriptional upregulation in the presence of ethanol, concomitant with the observed stimulation of Oct4 protein, this miR change is very pertinent in this context. In turn, with respect to possible miRs targeting Ceacam6, only one likely miR was downregulated (149-3P) (66) which would be consistent with Ceacam6 upregulation, although three (15a-5P, 16-5P and 195-5P) were upregulated, but their relationship with Ceacam6 is less clear. In terms of a possible relationship with estrogen pathways, Table VII shows several miRs affected by long-term ethanol exposure that are known to modulate or be modulated by estrogen-mediated processes or estrogen responsiveness, specifically 6 that are upregulated (16, 27a, 27b, 200a, 203, and 342) and 3 downregulated (let7b, 7c and 7d) (see Discussion). In order to determine whether long-term exposure to ethanol or acetaldehyde stimulates anchorage-independence, an in vitro marker of oncogenic transformation, incubations with 2.5\u201325 mM ethanol or 2.5 mM acetaldehyde were carried out for 4 weeks followed by 3\u20134 weeks growth in the clonogenic soft agar assay. Fig. 8 shows that 25 mM ethanol treatment substantially and significantly increases the number of anchorage-independent foci by 5.6-fold (4 separate experiments, each in triplicate), which agrees with the protein expression and transcriptional signature changes related to stem cell and oncogenic features. In addition, after exposure to a lower ethanol concentration (10 mM), there was a substantial and significant increase in anchorage-independence of 3.85-fold (p=0.014) for triplicate ethanol wells and duplicate control wells. However, exposure to further ethanol dilutions, 2.5 or 5 mM, had no significant effect. As in the case of 1-week incubation, long-term treatment with 2.5 mM acetaldehyde did not stimulate foci formation (data not shown). In contrast to the clonogenic assay, incubation of 25,000 cells with 25 mM ethanol for 4 weeks was not associated with the stimulation of invasiveness in the Matrigel assay (data not shown). It should be noted that the MCF-7 cell line is not invasive per se. There were only trace numbers of positive cells (mean of 4 samples each: control mean 11.25\u00b12.4 SE; ethanol mean 14.5\u00b12.9 SE) and there was no statistical significance (p=0.68, two-tailed t-test). Moreover, there was no induction of tamoxifen resistance after incubation for 4 weeks with 25 mM ethanol as analyzed by cellular metabolism in the presence of increasing levels of the drug (data not shown). To our knowledge this is the first report on the in vitro long-term effects of ethanol on breast cancer cells at doses comparable to peak exposures in humans, and describing multiple targets of potential cancer-related impact. These effects are not exerted by acetaldehyde, and are largely inconsistent with respect to estrogen-mediated effects. Therefore, our results do not support the prevalent hypothesis that ethanol action in cancer-related processes functions mainly through estrogenic or acetaldehyde mediation, although future, more mechanistic work is needed to test this assumption, particularly in relation to the potential estrogen mediation. In a previous study (1), we investigated the effects of ethanol exposure on a non-malignant, spontaneously immortalized breast epithelial cell line, MCF-12A. We found that relatively low doses of ethanol stimulated markers for epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), as shown by changes in mRNAs and miRs. We also found some upregulation in the stem-related proteins Oct4 and Nanog, as well as in the oncogenic marker Ceacam6. The results with respect to these phenomena are remarkably similar in this study of MCF-7, although the levels of ethanol necessary to achieve the observed changes differed. Ethanol incubation induced a gene expression signature in MCF-12A that includes short-term upregulation of one gene family in particular, the metallothioneins, similar to that observed in MCF-7. In this study, we have shown that: i) an exposure as short as 1 week to 25 mM ethanol stimulates the transcriptional expression of the metallothionein gene family in MCF-7, showing that even in an established cancer cell line, the effect of ethanol on MT expression occurs; this short-term ethanol treatment does not, however, induce any substantial change in the global transcriptional signature related to the expression of stem cell or oncogenic markers in monolayers or mammospheres; ii) in contrast, longer (4-week) exposure of MCF-7 monolayers to 5\u201325 mM ethanol leads to upregulation of the key stem cell proteins Oct4 and Nanog, and of a key oncogenic protein, Ceacam6, demonstrating that phenomena previously observed in MCF-12A are maintained in the established cancer line MCF-7; iii) in MCF-7 mammospheres incubated long-term with ethanol, only Ceacam6 remains upregulated, and there is no effect on mammosphere number or size; iv) changes in Ceacam6 protein expression are reflected in RNA expression, but the same phenomenon is not observed for Oct4 or Nanog protein expression, suggesting their regulation at the translational level. In addition, of even more significant pathological relevance, we showed that: v) in MCF-7 monolayers, long-term effects induced by 25 mM ethanol include substantial changes in the global transcriptional signature, including upregulation of immune-related genes, HLAs, and in particular, a series of genes involved in breast cancer; vi) this long-term oncogenic intensification of the transcriptional signature by ethanol is associated with the stimulation of anchorage-independence, a marker of increased malignancy; vii) this putative transformation exerted by ethanol is not associated with induction of tamoxifen resistance, potentially related to estrogen effects, or of invasiveness; viii) ethanol effects on miR expression are largely inconsistent with the hypothesis that ethanol effects are entirely or even largely mediated through estrogenic pathways; rather, there are conflicting effects such that some miR expression follows this pattern and other miR expression goes in the direction that is opposite to what would be expected under the estrogenic hypothesis; ix) most of the alterations we observed following ethanol treatment do not appear to be mediated by acetaldehyde. We do not have a conclusive explanation for the temporal pattern showed by oncogenic effects due to long-term exposure to ethanol, but speculate as to two possible mechanisms: i) ethanol effects on gene expression may result from a cascade of regulatory events that requires multiple cell divisions to complete; or ii) longer term exposure to ethanol not only affects gene expression, it selects for a subset of cells within the original population; thus the partially toxic effects of ethanol might be reflected in gene expression changes that accumulate over the course of several cell division cycles. Before analyzing the mechanistic significance of these alterations, it is important to stress the limitations of this study, in that it is essentially an in vitro proof-of-concept approach, based on the cell line, MCF-7, similar to what we cautiously stated regarding our previous study on the normal MCF-12A cell line (1). The malignant MCF-7 cell line was derived from a metastatic site of a breast cancer tumor and is widely used as a model for breast cancer studies. Our results need to be confirmed and extended in vitro using lower concentrations of ethanol and by examination of the interconnections between observed gene expression alterations. It should be noted that in our previous study on MCF-12A cells, considerably lower levels of ethanol led to substantial effects on protein, mRNA, and miR prevalence, and that their long-term exposure to high 25 mM levels arrested their growth and ultimately was toxic to the cells. In a simplistic comparison, this would mean that the stimulation of malignant features (MCF-7) requires a higher concentration of ethanol than their induction (MCF-12A). To better extrapolate these MCF-7 results to the human, in vivo confirmation is required in experimental animals. Although the in vitro exposure to ethanol concentrations of 5\u201325 mM, roughly equivalent in women to peak human serum concentrations after 0.6\u20133 glasses of wine taken during a 2-h period, was maintained continuously, its duration of only 4 weeks is certainly much shorter than the cumulative years of exposure that a human drinker experiences in a lifetime. There is no easy calculation of the equivalence between cell culture incubations and breast tumor tissue exposures, particularly because MCF-7 cultures may not reflect the complex stromal/epithelial interactions involved in breast cancer progression. Despite the above limitations, this study calls attention to the existence of molecular alterations in breast tumor cells induced by ethanol that may open up directions to further investigations on breast cancer in women. It is of interest that the metallothioneins are members of a family of genes known to be induced by ethanol (52) and comprising members such as MT-I and MT-II that are antiapoptotic, proliferative, angiogenic, and oncogenic (53). The expression of MT-I and MT-II is increased in breast cancer and other tumors, correlating with higher tumor grade/stage, increased recurrence and poor survival in the highly malignant invasive ductal breast carcinomas, and predicting poor prognosis in estrogen receptor-negative patients. Although the stimulation of metallothionein gene expression is indicative of gene expression effects beginning as soon as a few days after the administration of alcohol, the stimulation of metallothionein gene expression did not persist in our model system, so the long-term effect of these gene changes with respect to oncogenesis remains uncertain. As noted above, the temporal course of action in MT genes are similar for both the malignant MCF-7 cells and the non-malignant MCF-12A cells. A consistent pattern of changes induced by long-term ethanol, but not acetaldehyde, is the correlation between the upregulation of the key stem cell proteins Oct4a and Nanog (67) and an important cancer marker, Ceacam6 (50), in addition to the induction of anchorage-independence evidenced by soft agar growth. OCT4 is well known as a key gene responsible for the stemness network, and the main factor in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). More recently, OCT4 has emerged as a key oncogenic factor related to the role of cancer stem cells (68). For instance, expression of the Oct4 protein is higher in cancerous tissues than in adjacent-tumor tissues, is related to histological type, lymph node status and molecular type of breast cancer, and together with Her-2, is an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer (69,70), although it seems to occur later than SOX2 activation (71,72). In MCF-7 cells, estrogen stimulates and metformin reduces the size and number of mammospheres and their expression of Oct4 (73). However, our current results must be viewed as speculative as to whether they connect the observed upregulation of Oct4 to increased malignancy, since in another study, silencing OCT4 promoted invasion and metastasis in MCF-7 cells by inducing EMT (74). The very low expression of Oct4 detected by us in MCF-7 monolayers in the absence of ethanol is consistent with observations from other studies (75,76), and the potentially oncogenic upregulation by ethanol has not been previously reported. As to NANOG, there is extensive evidence linking it to breast cancer directly or through its activation by SOX2, alone or in conjunction with KLF4 (77), and it is known that ethanol induces Nanog in embryonic stem cells and hepatic carcinogenesis (78). The upregulation of CEACAM6 after long-term 25 mM ethanol exposure is consistent with a more aggressive phenotype of MCF-7 cells in vitro (75). Ceacam6, a membrane-associated cell adhesion protein, is overexpressed in breast cancer and a variety of other tumors, and is considered to be a marker of invasiveness and metastasis, a predictor of breast cancer recurrence, and specifically of invasive breast cancer in women with atypical ductal hyperplastic tissues (79\u201382). There are no previous reports of ethanol effects on CEACAM6, or on a link between CEACAM6 and OCT4 expression in any other context save our previous study on non-malignant cells (1), and the correlation of this upregulation to the intensification of anchorage-independence has not been reported previously except in our previous report (1), thus showing that this phenomenon is observed in both malignant and non-malignant cells derived from breast epithelium. Similarly, the stimulation of MCF-7 growth in soft agar due to exposure to ethanol at a dose as low as 10 mM has not been described before except in the previous report (1), since previous studies (20\u201326) used high concentrations of ethanol (90\u2013110 mM), short periods of exposure (48 h), and in some cases, breast cancer cell lines other than MCF-7. The stimulation by long-term ethanol of the expression of Ceacam6 protein is in agreement with the observed transcriptional upregulation of CEACAM6 and CEACAM5 and with other CEACAMs. The observed stimulation is also paralleled by the increase in mRNA levels for a series of oncogenesis-related genes, STEAP4 (83,84), SERPINA3 (84), SAMD9 (85), GDF-15 (86), KRT15 (87), TP53INPI (88), IF16 or G1P3 (89), and HLA-G (90) as well as other members of the HLA family, all of which have in common their breast cancer-related expression and the fact that none has been reported as being upregulated by ethanol. Some of these genes (SERPINA3, GDF15, IFI6) are also modulated by estrogen, but only one, GDF15, was previously studied in MCF-7. Surprisingly, no reports are available on the relationship of any of these genes with either OCT4 or CEACAM6. No evidence of preferential stimulation of stem cell accumulation following ethanol treatment in either MCF-7 monolayers or mammospheres could be found by gene expression analysis, as judged by the lack of meaningful changes in the transcriptional expression of a series of stem cell genes, including OCT4 and Nanog. This finding is in agreement with the similarity between the transcriptional signatures of mammospheres and monolayers in the absence of ethanol. This is puzzling within the framework of the significant upregulation of Oct4 and Nanog protein expression induced by long-term ethanol. OCT4 and NANOG are key stem cell genes in a network of other genes involved in stemness, but which are expressed transcriptionally in this study at only a low level, and not changed by ethanol treatment. A possible explanation could involve translational regulation mediated by miRs (see below). It is also conceivable that OCT4 and NANOG act as oncogenic factors per se, unrelated to stem cell activation, or speculatively may be due to the failure of stem cells to form mammospheres, but no supporting data exist in these in respect of other than OCT4 overexpression in breast cancer and other tumors. The seeming contradiction between Oct4 protein upregulation in the absence of detectable Oct4 mRNA increase suggests a model in which untreated cells exist in a state of translational repression of Oct4 due to some miR or combination of miRs. According to this hypothesis, some miRs such as Let-7A-5P (which is reduced in prevalence by ethanol exposure) allows the induction, by its partial absence, of overexpression of the Oct4 protein. Other Let-7 family members are also substantially expressed in control cells and reduced by ethanol. Let-7A has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in head and neck cancers and in their associated tumor initiating cells, where it is significantly decreased when OCT4 expression was increased (65). However, it is not clear that this is only translational repression and NANOG is also affected, so it is possible that Let-7 might not be responsible by itself for the selective upregulation of Oct4 protein, and it works in conjunction with the opposite effects of Lin 28b. Another miR, miR-145 functions as a protective miRNA in tumor tissues of lung adenocarcinoma patients and binds to the OCT4 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) thus blocking protein expression correlated with anti-oncogenic action (91\u201393), but we did not detect significant changes in this miR. The same uncertainty applies to the putative interaction between the downregulation of miR-149-3p by long-term ethanol, that would be consistent with the observed upregulation of CEACAM6 mRNA and protein, and the counterintuitive upregulation of miR-15A-5p, 16-5p, and 195-5p that could potentially oppose this effect. However, these are inferences based purely on sequence analogies in the miRBase 18.0 (94) and without mechanistic proof as yet. Therefore, the roles of the changes in miR levels in relation to the upregulation of Oct4, Nanog, and Ceacam6 induced by long-term ethanol in MCF-7 require further study. The molecular signature of miRs related to estrogen responsiveness is key to understanding whether ethanol may act via estrogenic pathways on luminal-like breast tumor cells, such as the MCF-7, to induce or stimulate their proliferation, survival, and functional status through the estrogen receptor \u03b1. Alcohol is assumed to increase sex hormone levels in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women (6) by: a) increased aromatase activity; b) decreased hepatic catabolism of androgens; c) modulation of adrenal steroid production; and d) by increasing the expression or transcriptional activity of ER\u03b1. Alcohol may also preferentially enhance cellular proliferation and ER\u03b1 content in ER-positive cell lines (15\u201318). Therefore, it might be expected that long-term ethanol effects on miRs in MCF-7 would mimic those exerted by estrogen or those related to estrogen responsiveness, but no reports are available on ethanol effects on any miR profile except in our recently published study on non-malignant cells (1). One of the miRs we found upregulated in MCF-7, miR-424, was also shown to be induced by 17-\u03b2-estradiol in at least two (95,96) of the multiple studies conducted in MCF-7. In some cases, ethanol induced upregulation is also seen after estrogen treatment, such as in miR-27a and b (96). The fact that ethanol affected any particular miR in this study did not necessarily coincide with affects on other miRs that would be expected to change comcomitantly if ethanol action were limited to one specific pathway such as the estrogenic pathway: thus upregulated miRs such as miR-107, miR-424, miR-570, miR-618, and miR-760 (95), miR-21 (28), miR-34b (97), miR-98 (98), miR-19A and miR-24 (96), miR-26a and b (99), miR-17 (100,101), miR-7 (102), or miR-190a (103); or downregulated miRs such as miR-16, miR-143, or miR-203 (104). Interestingly, the latter is the opposite of what we observed with ethanol. Although there are 4 miRs where both ethanol and estradiol induce the same changes in MCF-7, there are at least 18 miRs known to be affected by estrogen that can target a significant number of transcripts belonging to one or more estrogen-responsive gene clusters, but were not modified by ethanol in this study. In turn, 5 of our ethanol responsive changes have not been reported in global miR transcription studies conducted with estrogen or estrogenic compounds in MCF-7. The scope of this report does not cover the elucidation of how these miRs may act in terms of oncogenic or tumor suppressor effects. However, it is worth mentioning that out of the miRs whose levels have previously been shown to be regulated by estrogen and/or to modulate its receptor, and that were found in our work to be changed by ethanol, only the miR-27a and miR-27b levels were modulated as predicted by their role in estrogen responsiveness. It is also known that miR-27a is oncogenic in the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, and indirectly regulates E2-responsiveness in MCF-7 cells through suppression of ZBTB10, thereby enhancing expression of ER\u03b1 (47,48). In turn, miR-27a is upregulated in endometrial adenocarcinoma and precancerous lesions in response to estrogen overexposure. However, let-7 behaves similarly in the hyperplastic endometrium (98,105) and most members of this family (b, c and d) are considered to be pro-estrogenic. In this study they were uniformly reduced. The lack of consistency between the ethanol modulation of miR levels and their relationship with estrogen responsiveness is confirmed by our results with miR-16 (106), miR-200a (47), miR-203 (47), and miR-342 (107), which, as in the case of let-7a, b, and c, are opposite to what could be expected from an estrogen-like effect. However, since miRs exert pleiotropic effects, a mere association with estrogen-mediated pathways is not sufficient to conclude that those may not be involved in the observed ethanol effects on MCF-7 cultures. It should be emphasized that many of these miRs also affect other processes different from estrogenic effects, as described in a large and growing literature. For example, the Let-7 family is highly conserved and is involved in development, stem cell modulation, oncogenesis, and the cardiovascular system among other things (108), while the miR 15/107 group containing miR-15 and miR-16 affects BRCA1 expression (109), and miR-195 and miR-29 have been linked to aortic aneurism (110). Regarding the ethanol/estradiol comparison of miR signatures, we note the limitation that our study was long-term, whereas the previous estrogen studies varied in duration, but we propose that estradiol effects do not seem to define more than a small proportion of the changes in the global miR transcriptional signature of MCF-7 induced by ethanol. The ethanol induced changes are specific and at least partially different from estrogen-induced changes. Thus this study does not provide strong support for the hypothesis that estrogen mediates ethanol effects. Further studies are needed, vis-\u00e0-vis ethanol and estrogen, and with anti-estrogenic agents, to clarify the estrogenic mediation of long-term ethanol effects on MCF-7. A recent review lists a large number of miRs that are involved in cancer-related processes ranging from tumor suppression to various oncogenic features (111). We note that several miRs listed in that review show ethanol effects in this study, including miRs 15a, 16, the Let-7 family, 27a, 148a, and 149. We should also point out that ethanol does not necessarily promote oncogenesis in every case, for example tumor suppressors miR-15a and miR-16 are upregulated in response to ethanol treatment. However, the same two miRs were found to be upregulated in a biomarker test distinguishing sepsis from systemic inflammatory response (112). In this study, we found that exposure of MCF-7 cells to ethanol results in detectable changes in the expression of miRs such as miR-29a associated with inflammation (113). Interestingly, miR-15a upregulation is found in the serum of humans exposed to particulate air pollution (114). In another study, it was found that miR-29a is potentially able to stimulate the conditions for metastasis by binding to Toll-like receptors (115). Some miRs that have been proposed for inclusion as circulating cancer markers in the clinical setting show changes in expression levels in response to ethanol. This suggests that such markers should be considered carefully with regard to the ethanol intake status of the patient. For example, miR-424 has been proposed for inclusion in a group of circulating biomarkers for breast cancer (116), and miR-2861 is upregulated in thyroid carcinoma with lymph node metastases (59) but has been suggested as one element in a circulating miR screen for cervical cancer, where it has been shown to be decreased (117). In conclusion, our overall results suggest that prolonged exposure to ethanol may lead to the intensification of a series of novel oncogenic features in breast cancer by mechanisms that are not directly related to acetaldehyde and which do not strongly indicate estrogen mediation. These features require further clarification, with the caveat that the in vitro incubations using a breast cancer cell line are not directly extrapolatable to alcohol consumption in women. Our results may suggest some kind of stem cell involvement, but one which so far shows contradictory transcriptional and translational aspects. However, in conjunction with our findings on the induction of oncogenic features in a normal breast epithelial cell line (1), the current data may constitute the first comparison of global transcriptional signatures elicited by long-term ethanol exposure on normal and cancer breast cells, and the defining of potentially oncogenic features exacerbated by alcohol. Moreover, miRs in circulation are now being proposed as a diagnostic tool for both carcinomas and metatatic carcinomas (118). Therefore, the observation that ingested ethanol affects miR levels may have clinical significance, particularly with respect to miR values measured in heavy drinkers."}, "27860244": {"pmid": "27860244", "pmcid": "PMC5345686", "title": "Role of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in inflammation and migration of fibroblast\u2010like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis", "abstract": "\nAbstract\nTo probe the role of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in regulating inflammation, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of fibroblast\u2010like synoviocytes (FLSs) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). FLSs were separated from synovial tissues (STs) from patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). An inhibitor of PRMT5 (EPZ015666) and short interference RNA (siRNA) against PRMT5 were used to inhibit PRMT5 expression. The standard of protein was measured by Western blot or immunofluorescence. The excretion and genetic expression of inflammatory factors were, respectively, estimated by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Migration and invasion in vitro were detected by Boyden chamber assay. FLSs proliferation was detected by BrdU incorporation. Increased PRMT5 was discovered in STs and FLSs from patients with RA. In RA FLSs, the level of PRMT5 was up\u2010regulated by stimulation with IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1. Inhibition of PRMT5 by EPZ015666 and siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown reduced IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 production, and proliferation of RA FLSs. In addition, inhibition of PRMT5 decreased in vitro migration and invasion of RA FLSs. Furthermore, EPZ015666 restrained the phosphorylation of I\u03baB kinase\u03b2 and I\u03baB\u03b1, as well as nucleus transsituation of p65 as well as AKT in FLSs. PRMT5 regulated the production of inflammatory factors, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of RA FLS, which was mediated by the NF\u2010\u03baB and AKT pathways. Our data suggested that targeting PRMT5 to prevent synovial inflammation and destruction might be a promising therapy for RA.\n", "fulltext": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease, which is characterized by the hyperplasia of synovial tissues (STs) and progressive destruction of articular cartilage, bone and ligaments 1. Inflammatory factors were essential in the initiation and development of synovial inflammation in RA 2. Moreover, fibroblast\u2010like synoviocytes (FLSs) in the synovial intimal lining played a central role in RA pathogenesis 3. Stable, activated RA FLSs exhibited tumour\u2010like characteristics 4, 5 and were critical in the development of pannus through migrating and invading to the cartilage and bone 6, 7, 8. Therefore, modulation of synovial inflammation and the aggressive behaviours of activated FLSs was a novel therapeutic strategy for RA. Arginine methylation is an abundant post\u2010translational modification that occurs in mammalian cells and is catalysed by proteins of the arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family. PRMT5, a member of PRMT family, is localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of mammalian cells 9, 10. PRMT5 participates in many cell processes, including transcriptional repression 11, RNA splicing 12, signal transduction 13 and piRNA pathway activation 14. Overexpression of PRMT5 has been found in many kinds of tumours, including leukaemia 15, lymphoma 16, lung cancer 17, colorectal cancer 18 and breast cancer 19. The overexpression of PRMT5 was associated with tumour cell growth. Recent studies also indicated that PRMT5 was a key enzyme in regulating endothelial cell inflammation, cell proliferation as well as differentiation 20. However, it was still unclear whether PRMT5 was involved in RA. We hypothesized that PRMT5 might regulate the inflammation and invasive behaviours in RA FLSs. To investigate the validity of the hypothesis, we first examined the expression of PRMT5 in STs and FLSs. We then used a PRMT5 inhibitor and siRNA to study the influence of PRMT5 on the inflammation, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of RA FLSs. Finally, we verified the signal pathway involved in this process. STs were gained from RA patients or osteoarthritis (OA) patients, who went through synovectomy or joint arthroplasty. Briefly, STs were incised into pieces by pieces, then digested with collagenase I (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 3 hrs at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. After centrifugation, the cells were fostered in DMEM/F12 medium that containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml strep at 37\u00b0C in a constant humidified incubator of 5% CO2, 21% O2 and 75% N2. The cells were trypsinized when the cells reached assemble and transited. The cells at passages of 3\u20137 were used in this study. Normal control FLSs were isolated from STs obtained by arthroscopic biopsy from patients that had menisci injuries without history of acute or chronic arthritis, which were kind gifts from Prof. Hanshi Xu in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat\u2010Sen University. The study was sanctified by the Medical Ethical Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, SYSU, China, and executed on the basis of the Declaration of Helsinki. STs were placed in 10% formalin overnight, paraffin\u2010imbed, incised into 5\u2010\u03bcm sections and put to 3\u2010aminopropyltriethoxysilane\u2010coated slides. Then, the sections were deparaffinized by xylene and ethanol which was rehydrated, and using microwave heating with antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase activity was then inhibited by hatching the parts in 1% hydrogen peroxide about 30 min. The segment were then fostered with main antibodies against PRMT5 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Then, the samples was washed three times with PBS for 5 min. each and hatched with the respective horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies, substrates and counterstained with haematoxylin. For the transfection of PRMT5 siRNA (Santa Cruz, California, USA), FLSs were fostered in six\u2010well plates; 100 nM siRNA and 10 mg/ml lipofectin in serum\u2010free medium as a transfection mixture was added to medium\u2010aspirated cells for 6 hrs. Then, the cells before experiments were incubated with total including 10% FBS DMEM/F12 for 48 hrs. Chemotaxis analysis of FLSs was preformed through the transwell (Corning, New York, NY, USA) migration assay. Filled with DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS, the bottom chambers were used as a chemical enticement. The top chambers were cultured in 200 \u03bcl DMEM/F12 medium (without FBS) and FLSs with PRMT5\u2010specific inhibitor EPZ015666 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, USA) or FLSs transfected with PRMT5 siRNA for 48 hrs. After 12 hrs, through a cotton swab, the cells which had not migrated were removed from the filter top. The migrated cells, on the bottom of the membrane, were immersed in methanol and dyed with 0.1% Crystal Violet. Through the ZEISS digital microscope dealing with images, we counted the stained cells for each analysis via the mean number of cells per five random areas. The in vitro invasion test was performed by inserting a Matrigel basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Under a microscope, numbers of invaded cells were randomly selected and counted in 10 high\u2010power fields. These experiments were performed three times. Wounding migration assays were performed as described previously 21. Briefly, RA FLSs were plated to confluence on 35\u2010mm culture dishes at a density of 2 \u00d7 105 cells/ml, where 90% confluence allowed one parallel wound. The following day, wounds were created in a cell monolayer using 1\u2010ml sterile micropipette tips. Then starving media were used to wash detached cells, and RA FLSs were treated with or without 10% FBS. After 24 hrs of incubation, migration was quantified with Image J software by counting the cells that moved beyond a reference line. 5\u2010Ethynyl\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyuridine (EdU) is a thymidine analogue; when cells are dividing, it is incorporated into replicating DNA and then applied to sign proliferating cells. RA FLSs were trypsinized, seeded into 96\u2010well plates and then calculated with a density of 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well. Then, RA FLSs were grown to 80% confluence and were pre\u2010treated with or without EPZ015666 or transfected with siRNA for 48 hrs and then treated with TNF\u2010\u03b1 or IL\u2010\u03b2 for 24 hrs. The cell multiplication was detected through a Cell\u2010Light EdU DNA Cell Proliferation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Each test was replicated three times according to the manufacturer's recommendation. RA FLSs or OA FLSs were seeded on sterile cover glass in 35\u2010mm dishes at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/ml. When became approximately 60% confluent, the FLSs were stimulated with IL\u20101\u03b2 or TNF\u2010\u03b1 for 24 hrs. Then, they were disposed with paraformaldehyde and infiltrated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X\u2010100. The cells were hatched with anti\u2010PRMT5 antibody all night to measure PRMT5. The cells were then incubated with DAPI, and the coverslips were put on the glass slides with antifade equipment media and then examined by a confocal fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM710, Wetzlar, Germany). After the designated treatments with EPZ015666 or transfected with siRNA for 48 hrs and then treated with TNF\u2010\u03b1 or IL\u20101\u03b2 for 12 hrs, total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) and were reverse\u2010transcribed to cDNA using miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (TaKaRa Biomedical Technology, Kusatsu, Japan ). The mRNA expression of PRMT5, IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 was analysed by real\u2010time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) which was performed on cDNA using QuantiTect SYBR Green RT\u2010PCR Kit on StepOnePlusTM Instantaneous analyse PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The expression of relative mRNA was more normalized to the GAPDH. The used RT\u2010PCR primers were listed in Table S1. For each Western blot experiment, 2 \u00d7 105 cells were seeded. When subconfluence (~80%) was reached, RA FLSs were pre\u2010processed with EPZ015666 for 24 hrs or transfected with siRNA for 48 hrs. Then, RA FLSs were stimulated with or without TNF\u2010\u03b1 for 10 min. Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (CST) in an ice bath for 15 min., and then, the lysates were centrifuged at 14000 g for 15 min. at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were incubated with 2\u00d7 laemmli sample buffer (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) for 5 min. at 100\u00b0C. The samples with same amounts were then separated with SDS\u2010PAGE gel and shifted to NC membranes and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies: antiphosphor\u2010AKT (Cell signal transduction), anti\u2010AKT (Cell signal transduction), anti\u2010NF\u2010\u03baB p65 (Cell signalling), antiphosphor\u2010IKB\u03b1 (Cell signal transduction), anti\u2010IKB\u03b1 (Cell signal transduction) and antiphosphor\u2010IKK (Cell signal transduction). After the designated treatments with EPZ015666 or transfected with siRNA for 48 hrs and then disposed with TNF\u2010\u03b1 for 12 hrs, RA FLSs' (1 \u00d7 105 cells/ml, 80% cell confluence) culture supernatants were collected for the measurement of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), through employing a commercial tool on the basis of the guidance of the manufacturer (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). RA FLSs were pre\u2010processed with EPZ015666 at different concentrations (0.1, 1 and 5 \u03bcM) for 48 hrs. The supernatants were removed. The adherent cells were cultured with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium salt solution (1 mg/ml in PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Dark blue formazan was melted in acidified isopropanol, and formazan quantification was performed at a trial wavelength of 570 nm. The wavelength of 620 nm was used as a reference. The software of SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was utilized. Data were present as means \u00b1 standard deviation of the mean (S.E.M.). The differences between each group were detected by t\u2010test or anova. P values less than 0.05 were significant. We first investigated the expression of PRMT5 in STs. Positive stained cells of anti\u2010PRMT5 antibody were more prominent in STs from RA when compared with OA patients (Fig. 1A). We next examined the expression of PRMT5 in FLSs by IF staining. As a result, RA FLSs exhibited a markedly enhanced staining for PRMT5 and localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Whereas, expression of PRMT5 protein was much less prominent in normal samples and in OA FLSs (Fig. 1B). The constitutive expression of PRMT5 in FLSs was further confirmed by Western blotting. A higher level of PRMT5 expression was detected in RA FLSs than that in OA FLSs or in FLSs from normal controls (Fig. 1C). RA FLSs were stimulated with TNF\u2010\u03b1 or IL\u20101\u03b2. As shown in Figures 2A and B, PCR and Western blotting indicated that TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u03b2 significantly enhanced the PRMT5 mRNA expression and the protein level of PRMT5, respectively. The overexpression of PRMT5 in RA FLSs stimulated by proinflammatory mediators was also confirmed by IF staining (Fig. 2C). To investigate the role of PRMT5 on inflammatory response in RA FLSs, a specific PRMT5 inhibitor (EPZ015666) or transfected with PRMT5 siRNA were used. As shown in Figure 3A, TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced mRNA expression and secretions of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 were reduced by treatment with different concentrations of EPZ015666 (0.1~5 \u03bcM). Transfection with PRMT5 siRNA also decreased TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced mRNA and secretions of IL\u20106 as well as IL\u20108 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010induced mRNA expression of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 was reduced by treatment with different concentrations of EPZ015666 or transfection with PRMT5 siRNA (Fig. S1A). Recent studies indicated that inhibition of PRMT5 suppressed proliferation in tumour cell lines. Therefore, we explore whether PRMT5 regulates proliferation of RA FLSs, which was measured by EdU incorporation. We showed that pre\u2010treatment with EPZ015666 and PRMT5 siRNA reduced TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced proliferation of RA FLSs (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, pre\u2010treatment with EPZ015666 and PRMT5 siRNA also reduced IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010induced proliferation of RA FLSs (Fig. S1B). MTT test was used to evaluate the toxic effect of EPZ015666 on RA FLS viability. Up to 5 \u03bcM, EPZ015666 did not reduce the viability of RA FLSs, which indicated that the inhibitory effects of EPZ015666 were not as a result of drug cytotoxicity (data not shown). Then, we explored the role of PRMT5 in the invasion and migration of RA FLSs using a specific PRMT5 inhibitor (EPZ015666) or PRMT5 siRNA transfection. Treatment with EPZ015666 and PRMT5 siRNA markedly inhibited FBS\u2010induced migration of RA FLSs (Fig. 4A). Wound closing was significantly slowed in RA FLSs pre\u2010treated with EPZ015666 and transferred with PRMT5 siRNA (Fig. 4B). We also observed that treatment with EPZ015666 and PRMT5 siRNA suppressed invasion of RA FLSs (Fig. 4C). The above results revealed that PRMT5 played a crucial role in regulating RA FLSs migration and invasion. Under proinflammatory stimulation, activation of NF\u2010\u03baB pathway required the activation of I\u03baB kinase (IKK). Activated IKK promoted the phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB (I\u03baB), and phosphorylation of p65. We further explore the association between PRMT5 and NF\u2010\u03baB. As shown in Figure 5A, a specific inhibitor of PRMT5 decreased phosphorylated IKK (pIKK), as well as phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010stimulated RA FLSs. We then observed EPZ015666 decreased p65 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we observed that transfection with PRMT5 siRNA suppressed the TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced pIKK and phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 (Fig. 5C). These data suggested that inhibition of PRMT5 suppressed NF\u2010\u03baB activation through IKK signalling. Because AKT was an important factor in regulating inflammation and migration of RA FLSs, we further investigated the relationship between PRMT5 and AKT. It was observed that EPZ015666 treatment inhibited phosphorylation of AKT in TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010treated RA FLSs (Fig. 6A). We also observed the similar results from RA FLSs transfected with PRMT5 siRNA (Fig. 6B). These data suggested that AKT might be involved in PRMT5\u2010mediated inflammation and migration of RA FLSs. Our results demonstrated that RA FLSs constitutively express PRMT5, which was up\u2010regulated by stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, inhibition of PRMT5 suppressed the production of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 and prevented cell proliferation, migration and invasion by attenuating the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB and AKT in RA FLSs. Taken together, the data suggested a crucial role of PRMT5 in regulating inflammation and the maintenance of an activated FLSs phenotype in patients with RA. Inhibition of PRMT5 might be a hopeful target for the therapy of RA. Pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines initiated synovial inflammation in RA. However, the mechanisms that modulated the production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines in RA remained to be identified. Here, we demonstrated that PRMT5 inhibition decreased TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced expression of IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 in RA FLSs. Recent studies suggested that PRMT5\u2010mediated post\u2010translational modifications might be associated with inflammatory. PRMT5 methylated a key transcriptional factor HOXA9 of endothelial cell inflammatory responses, which was critical in up\u2010regulation of endothelial\u2013leucocyte adhesion molecules 22, 23. PRMT5\u2010medicated arginine methyltransferase was indicated as an important step for CXCL10 transcription in TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010activated human endothelial cells inflammation. Our data indicated one of the mechanisms of PRMT5 in the maintenance of the activated phenotype of RA FLSs via regulation the inflammatory response. The invasive behaviours of RA FLSs to the cartilage and bone were essential steps in the aggravation of RA 6, 24, 25. PRMT5 was the major enzyme responsible for arginine dimethylation, which was associated with tumour cell growth in different types of cancer 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. In this study, we found that inhibition of PRMT5 strongly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Consistent with our findings, Zhang et al. and Guo et al. 26, 27 reported that treatment with a PRMT5 inhibitor decreased migratory activity in several tumour cell lines. As abnormal migration and invasion of RA FLSs were critical in destruction of joints, our results provided new evidence on the association between PRMT5 and the aggressive nature of RA FLSs. We observed that PRMT5 inhibition suppressed TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced phosphorylation of IKK\u03b2 and I\u03baB\u03b1, as well as translocation of nuclear NF\u2010\u03baB. These data indicated that PRMT5 regulated the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway by interfering in early cytoplasmic IKK signalling. Similar findings were also indicated in other studies. According to Wei et al. 28 , PRMT5 methylated Arg\u201030 (R30) residues of the p65 subunit, and consequently regulated NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent gene expression, such as IL\u20101\u03b1 and TNF receptor\u2010associated factor 1. Additionally, it has also been reported that R35 as well as R30 at p65, which was methylated by PRMT5, participated in transcription of TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced pro\u2010inflammatory genes in endothelial cells 22. Simulated by TNF\u2010\u03b1, phosphoinositide AKT was crucial in regulating cell proliferation and inflammation in RA 29. We found that inhibition of PRMT5 leaded to decreased expression of p\u2010AKT, without affecting total AKT. Our results were also supported by studies from tumour cells. Wei et al. 30 demonstrated that inhibition of PI3K/AKT activity could block PRMT5\u2010induced cell proliferation in lung cancer cell lines, including A549 and H1299. Our finding identified a new pathway linking PRMT5 to AKT activation. In conclusion, we showed that PRMT5 played an important role in inflammatory response, cell proliferation, migration and invasion of RA FLSs through NF\u2010\u03baB and AKT pathway. Thus, inhibition of PRMT5 might be a potential therapeutic agent to attenuate pathological progression in rheumatoid arthritis. The authors confirm that there are no conflict of interests."}, "27491646": {"pmid": "27491646", "pmcid": "PMC5192955", "title": "Gartanin induces cell cycle arrest and autophagy and suppresses migration involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signalling pathway in human glioma cells", "abstract": "\nAbstract\nIn central nervous system, glioma is the most common primary brain tumour. The diffuse migration and rapid proliferation are main obstacles for successful treatment. Gartanin, a natural xanthone of mangosteen, suppressed proliferation, migration and colony formation in a time\u2010 and concentration\u2010dependent manner in T98G glioma cells but not in mouse normal neuronal HT22 cells. Gartanin, at low micromole, led to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase accompanied by inhibited expression level of G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1, while increased expression level of cyclin\u2010dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. In addition, the secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 (MMP\u20102/\u20109) were significantly suppressed in T98G cells treated with gartanin, and it might result from modulating mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling pathway in T98G glioma cells. Moreover, gartanin significantly induced autophagy in T98G cells and increased GFP\u2010LC3 punctate fluorescence accompanied by the increased expression level of Beclin 1 and LC3\u2010II, while suppressed expression level of p62. Gartanin treatment resulted in obvious inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, which is important in modulating autophagy. Notably, gartanin\u2010mediated anti\u2010viability was significantly abrogated by autophagy inhibitors including 3\u2010methyladenine (3\u2010MA) and chloroquine (CQ). These results indicate that anti\u2010proliferation effect of gartanin in T98G cells is most likely via cell cycle arrest modulated by autophagy, which is regulated by PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, while anti\u2010migration effect is most likely via suppression of MMP\u20102/\u20109 activity which is involved in MAPK signalling pathway.\n", "fulltext": "Glioma is aggressive and common primary tumour in central nervous system (CNS) 1. Their main characteristics are rapid proliferation and extensive migration. Surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are effective therapies for gliomas. Despite these treatments, the median survival time of glioblastoma patients is still about 15 months 2, 3. The effectiveness of glioma therapy was influenced by many factors including rapid tumour growth and highly infiltrative nature of glioma cells 4, 5, 6. Therefore, suppressing proliferation and inhibiting glioma cells migration would be a promising therapeutic strategy. Mangosteen, Garcinia mangostana L., a common Southeast Asia tropical fruit, has been consumed as food and medicine for centuries 7. Xanthones are characterised by one or more hydroxy and prenyl groups in their tricyclic ring system. Cumulative evidence indicates that xanthones regulate diverse biologic processes such as antioxidation 8, anti\u2010tumour 9, anti\u2010inflammation 10, anti\u2010allergy 11, anti\u2010bacteria, anti\u2010fungi and anti\u2010virus 12. Recently, there has been reported that tumours could be suppressed by several kinds of xanthones isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen including gartanin 13, 14, \u03b1\u2010mangostin 15, 16 and \u03b3\u2010mangostin 17, 18, and were recognised as potential anti\u2010cancer drugs. \u03b1\u2010Mangostin and \u03b3\u2010mangostin have been extensively studied in a variety of neoplasm. By now, there was no report on the effects of gartanin on glioma development yet. In this research, we found that gartanin, at lower micromole, potently inhibited the migration and viability abilities in T98G cells. Further studies showed that the anti\u2010tumour effects of gartanin might involve cell cycle arrest in G1, increased protein expression level of p27Kip1, suppressed protein expression level of cyclin D1 and inhibited secretion and activity of MMP\u20102/\u20109. Moreover, the anti\u2010viability effect of gartanin was also associated with autophagy. Further studies indicated that PI3K/Akt/mTOR was associated with gartanin\u2010induced autophagy and mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling pathways were involved in the suppressed expression level and activity of MMP\u20102/\u20109. In summary, results indicate that gartanin might be a promising anti\u2010tumour drug against gliomas. Gartanin, \u03b3\u2010mangostin, garciniafuran, garcinone C, 8\u2010deoxygartanin, \u03b1\u2010mangostin and garcinone D isolated from the fruit hulls of mangosteen were kindly provided by Professor Rongbiao Pi (Zhongshan University) and their purity was tested to be over 99% via high\u2010performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Antibodies against cyclin D1, p27Kip1, p\u2010Erk (thr202/tyr204), p\u2010JNK (thr183/tyr185), p\u2010p38 (thr180/tyr182), p\u2010Akt (ser473), Akt, Erk, p\u2010GSK\u20103\u03b2 (ser9), LC3, Beclin 1, p62, GAPDH, \u03b1\u2010tubulin and \u03b2\u2010actin were purchased from Sigma\u2010Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). U87, U251, T98G human malignant glioma cells and HT22 murine hippocampal neuronal cells were kindly provided by Professor Rongbiao Pi (Zhongshan University). Cells mentioned above were maintained in DMEM (Hyclone, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin (Sigma, USA). Cells were maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2. Gartanin, \u03b3\u2010mangostin, garciniafuran, \u03b1\u2010mangostin, 8\u2010deoxygartanin, garcinone D and garcinone C were dissolved in DMSO. MTT assay was used to test cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was used to evaluate cytotoxicity. Briefly, cells were planted in 96\u2010well plates. After 50% confluence was reached, cells were treated with gartanin at various concentrations for various time spans, and then MTT (10 \u03bcl) was added into every well after that maintained in the incubator for 2 hr. Finally, DMSO (100 \u03bcl) was added into every well after the removal of MTT solution. A microplate reader (Bio\u2010Tek, Winooski, VT, USA) was used to test the value of optical density (OD) at 570 nm. As for colony formation, cells at a density of 60 cells/well were planted in six\u2010well plates. After cultured in incubator for 7 days, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution and then dyed with 1.0% crystal violet. An inverted microscope (XDS\u20101B, COIC, Chongqing, China) was used to count the number of colonies. LDH release in the supernatant was determined with a cytotoxicity assay kit (Shenggong, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A microplate reader (Bio\u2010Tek) was used to test the value of OD at 490 nm. Cells were planted in 96\u2010well plates. After 50% confluence was reached, cells were treated with gartanin at various concentrations for various time spans. After treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for half an hour and then dyed with DAPI for another half an hour and photographed with a fluorescence microscope (IX71, Chongqing, China). Apoptotic cells were characterised by morphological alternation as condensed nuclei and cell shrinkage. The cell cycle phase distribution was determined via flow cytometry analysis of DNA content of cells with a cell cycle assay kit (Nanjing, China) according to the instructions. In brief, T98G was planted in six\u2010well plates and treated with gartanin at various concentrations for the indicated time. After treatment, cells were trypsinised and fixed with 65% ethanol for 12 hrs. Cells were then incubated with DNA\u2010binding dye propidium iodide (PI, 50 \u03bcg/ml) and RNase (1.0 mg/ml) for another 1 hr in the incubator. Finally, a flow cytometry (Beckman, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to analyse the red fluorescence, and a peak fluorescence gate was used to discriminate aggregates. T98G cells were planted in six\u2010well plates and cultured in incubator. When the cells reached confluence, would healing assay was performed. In brief, a 200\u2010\u03bcl pipette tip was used to manually scrape the cell monolayer. The floating cells were washed away with PBS. Cells were then maintained in DMEM. Cell migration was observed at three indicated time points (0, 12 and 24 hrs) in three different microscopic fields for each concentration of gartanin. Images were acquired with a phase\u2010contrast microscope (IX71, Chongqing, China) and were processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. The wound width at time 0 minus the wound width at different time points is the distance migrated by the cells. The values were expressed as a migration percentage, and setting the 0 hr group as 0%. XCELLigence real\u2010time cell analysis (RTCA) DP system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used to perform cell migration experiments. Real\u2010time cell analysis was allowed by the xCELLigence system on the RTCA DP Instrument equipped with a CIM\u2010Plate 16. In brief, T98G cells were trypsinised and resuspended in DMEM. Each upper chamber was planted with 3 \u00d7 104 cells to allow cells attachment, the CIM\u2010Plate was maintained in incubator for another 30 min. The xCELLigence system automatically monitored the impedance value of each well for duration of 24 hrs, and a CI value was obtained. A gelatin zymography assay kit (Applygen, Beijing, China) was used to measure the activity of MMP\u20102 and MMP\u20109 in the supernatant. In brief, cells were planted in six\u2010well plates and treated with gartanin at various concentrations for 24 hrs. Ten microlitre supernatant of each well was collected and was mixed with 10 \u03bcl sample buffer. An equal volume of sample (20 \u03bcl) was then loaded in each lane of 8% SDS\u2010PAGE containing gelatin as a substrate. Using pre\u2010cooled electrophoresis running buffer, electrophoresis was carried out at 20 mA for 60 min. After washing with 2% Triton X\u2010100, gels were dipped into the developing buffer containing 0.02% NaN3, 50 mM Tris and 10 mM CaCl2 for 42 hrs at 37\u00b0C. R\u2010250 of Coomassie brilliant blue was used to dye the gels, and 25% methanol mixed with 10% glacial acetic acid was used to destain the gels. After this, the bands were visualised. A transparent band on a blue background indicates the proteolytic activity of each sample. Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), version 1.46r, was used to perform quantitative analysis. Plasmid, GFP\u2010LC3, was kindly provided by Professor Rongbiao Pi (Sun Yat\u2010Sen University). T98G cells (2 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were planted on a glass coverslip in the six\u2010well plates and cultured in incubator. After reaching 60% confluence, Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) was used to perform transient transfection in accordance with the instructions. After 8 hrs, the supernatant was removed and complete medium was added. After the sample was incubated for 1 day, cells were treated with gartanin at various concentrations for another 7 hrs after which it was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for half an hour at 37\u00b0C. Confocal laser microscopy (Zeiss LSM710, Jena, Germany) was used to analyse the cells. After treatment, cells were collected, washed and then lysed in 100 \u03bcl lysis buffer (10 mM NaF, protease inhibitor cocktail, 20 mM Tris\u2010HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM Na3VO4 and 1% Triton X\u2010100, pH 7.5). BCA assay kit (Thermofisher Pierce, Rockford, AL, USA) was used to determine the protein concentration. An equal amount of protein (20 \u03bcg) was loaded into lanes. After separated by electrophoresis, proteins were electrically transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After the membrane blockage, specific antibodies were used to immunodetect the target proteins. After incubated with corresponding secondary antibody, target proteins were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique. The experimental data were presented as mean \u00b1 S.D. Differences among groups were analysed by one\u2010way analysis of variance (anova). Following anova analyses, the Tukey's test was used. Differences between two groups were analysed by unpaired Student's t\u2010test. Experiments described in this study were repeated at least three times. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. In our preliminary experiments, we tested the anti\u2010viability effects of seven xanthones isolated from the shells of Garcinia mangostana L. (Fig. 1A) and found that the potency of gartanin was by far the greatest in T98G cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, all subsequent experiments were focused on gartanin. As shown in Fig. 1C, three malignant glioma cell lines including T98G, U87 and U251 were all sensitive to the anti\u2010viability effect of gartanin, and T98G was the most sensitive one. So, we did the subsequent experiments in T98G cells to uncover the characters of gartanin's anti\u2010cancer activity as well as the underlying mechanisms. Active mitochondria within cells are required in the process of conversing MTT to a blue formazan. Thus, cellular activity could be measured by MTT scores. Figure 2A and B indicated that gartanin suppressed the cell viability of T98G cells in a dose\u2010 and time\u2010dependent manner. A 46.5% inhibition rate (P < 0.001, n = 3) was observed in cells treated with gartanin (10 \u03bcM) for 24 hrs. The IC50 of gartanin on the growth of T98G was 10.8 \u03bcM. However, the IC50 on that of normal mouse neuron HT22 cells was 54.2 \u03bcM (Fig. 2E). Either cell death or reduced viability could result in the reduction of MTT score. To determine whether gartanin caused necrosis or apoptosis, LDH assay and DAPI staining were used. No significant difference was observed in the number of apoptotic bodies stained with DAPI between gartanin\u2010treated group and control group (Fig. 2D). No obvious difference was observed in LDH release between gartanin\u2010treated group and control group (Fig. 2C). Therefore, reduction in MTT score was not resulted from cytotoxicity. Thus, significantly reduced MTT score in gartanin\u2010treated group most likely resulted from decreased viability. Consistently, colony formation assay showed that, compared with control group, cells treated with gartanin (10 \u03bcM) formed significantly smaller and fewer colonies (Fig. 2F and G; ***P < 0.001). To preliminarily reveal the mechanism of viability suppression in gartanin\u2010treated group, flow cytometry was used to determine cell cycle distribution in T98G cells. Results showed that gartanin led to G1 phase accumulation in a dose\u2010dependent manner to reach 47.87% and 71.89% of gartanin at 3 and 10 \u03bcM, respectively, while 45.22% was observed in control group. Concomitantly, gartanin decreased the cells in S fraction from 36.57% of control group to 10.17% of gartanin (10 \u03bcM) group (P < 0.001). Moreover, the change in the G2/M phase did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3A and B). These results indicate that gartanin caused cell viability suppression in T98G cells possibly because of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. To explore the molecular basis of the cell cycle arrest in gartanin\u2010treated group, Western blot was used to investigate the expression of some cell cycle regulatory proteins. As the checkpoint of G1/S phase, the expression of cyclin D1 was investigated. Figure 3C and D showed that the protein expression level of cyclin D1 was significantly reduced in gartanin\u2010treated group in a time\u2010 and concentration\u2010dependent manner. Additionally, as an important negative regulatory factor of cell cycle, the expression level of cyclin\u2010dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p27Kip1, was investigated. Figure 3E and F indicated that the protein expression of p27Kip1 was significantly increased in gartanin\u2010treated group in a time\u2010 and concentration\u2010dependent manner. Data indicated that inactivation of cyclin D1 accompanied by activation of p27Kip1 attributed to arrest cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, further resulted in viability suppression in gartanin\u2010treated group. Malignant gliomas are not only characterised by infinite proliferation ability but also by highly migration ability. Wound healing assay was performed to determine the possible effects of gartanin on migration. Figure 4A showed that the scratched area was completely re\u2010colonised after 24 hrs in the control group. However, this process was significantly impaired in a dose\u2010dependent manner in gartanin\u2010treated group. As a matter of fact, cells treated with 10 \u03bcM gartanin rarely invaded the scratched area. Moreover, there was statistically significant difference in the migration distance between treated group and the control group 12 hrs after scratch (Fig. 4A). Quantitative analysis of wound closure clearly showed that 10 \u03bcM gartanin group closed 10.1% and 15.2% of the wound after 12 and 24 hrs respectively. Conversely, the control group closed 63.2% and 96.3% of the wound after 12 and 24 hrs respectively (Fig. 4B). Results indicated that migration of T98G malignant glioma cells could be significantly suppressed by gartanin. To eliminate interference factors including invasion and proliferation, RTCA assay was performed. The migration of T98G cells from the upper chambers to the lower chamber was monitored by the electrodes. Data indicated that T98G cells treated with 10 \u03bcM gartanin migrated significantly slower when compared with the controls (Fig. 4C). To explore the molecular basis of anti\u2010migration in gartanin\u2010treated group, the activities of MMP\u20102 and MMP\u20109 were determined by gelatin zymography assay. Figure 4D indicated that the activities of MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20102 were significantly suppressed by gartanin. As shown in Figure 4E, quantitative analysis suggested that MMP\u20102 activity reduced by 27.5% and 71.5% and MMP\u20109 activity reduced by 22.5% and 75.0% when cells were treated with 3 \u03bcM or 10 \u03bcM gartanin respectively. To gain insight into the signalling pathway involving the modulation of MMP\u20109 and MMP\u20102, we assessed the effects of gartanin on MAPK signalling pathway. Specifically, the activation of several different downstream MAPK including p\u2010ERK1/2 (thr202/tyr204), p\u2010JNK (thr183/tyr188) and p\u2010p38 (thr180/tyr182) were assessed. Figure 5 showed that gartanin (10 \u03bcM) time dependently suppressed the expression level of p\u2010p38 and p\u2010ERK. And the expression level of total ERK did not change. Moreover, no changes in the phosphorylated forms of JNK were observed. To determine whether autophagy was induced in glioma cells treated with gartanin, the protein expression levels of p62, LC3\u2010II and Beclin 1, which are important regulatory factors of autophagy, were detected by Western blot. Figure 6A and B showed that gartanin significantly increased the expression levels of Beclin 1 and LC3\u2010II, while significantly suppressed the expression level of p62 in a time\u2010dependent manner. Moreover, punctate structure, representing autophagosomes, could visualise the formation of LC3\u2010II. Thus, after transiently transfected with GFP\u2010LC3, cells were treated with gartanin at various concentrations for 8 hrs. Analysis was performed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 6C). Figure 6D showed that, compared with the control group (2.7%) and gartanin (3 \u03bcM) group (3.2%), the number of GFP\u2010LC3\u2010positive puncta per cell in gartanin (10 \u03bcM)\u2010treated group (16.5%) was significantly higher. To gain insight into the signalling pathway involving the regulation of autophagy in T98G malignant glioma cells, we assessed the effects of gartanin on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway which was involved in inducing autophagy. Specifically, we detected three key proteins, p\u2010mTOR (ser2448), p\u2010PI3K (tyr458) and p\u2010Akt (ser473). As shown in Figure 7, gartanin (10 \u03bcM) time dependently suppressed the expression levels of p\u2010PI3K, p\u2010Akt, p\u2010mTOR and LC3\u2010II, while no changes were found in the content of total Akt. We tested the cell viability with or without autophagy inhibitors, chloroquine (CQ) or 3\u2010MA, to assess the effects of autophagy on the anti\u2010viability of gartanin. In brief, after pre\u2010treated with CQ (8 \u03bcM) or 3\u2010MA (2 mM), cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM gartanin. Western blot was used to investigate the expression level of LC3\u2010I/II, and MTT assay was used to investigate the cell viability. Figure 8B and C showed that expression level of LC3\u2010II was decreased by 3\u2010MA, while increased by CQ. Figure 8A showed that the cell viability of T98G was increased from 54% to 75.8% and 77%, respectively, by pre\u2010treatment with 3\u2010MA or CQ. Further study showed that cells in G0/G1 phase decreased from 66.65% of 10 \u03bcM gartanin group to 48.34% of 3\u2010MA+10 \u03bcM gartanin group (P < 0.001), and cells in S phase increased from 10.19% of 10 \u03bcM gartanin group to 32.58% of 3\u2010MA+10 \u03bcM gartanin group (P < 0.001), although the change in the G2/M phase did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 9A and B). Regulatory proteins of G1 phase including cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 were investigated. Figure 9C and D showed that the decrease in cyclin D1 and increase in p27Kip1 were abolished by pre\u2010treatment with 3\u2010MA. However, the anti\u2010migration effect of gartanin could not be abrogated by autophagic inhibitor, 3\u2010MA. Figure 9E and F showed that there was no significant restore of cell migration by pre\u2010treatment with 3\u2010MA. We tested the cell viability with or without GSK\u20103\u03b2 inhibitor, LiCl, to assess the effects of GSK\u20103\u03b2 signalling pathway on the anti\u2010viability of gartanin. In brief, after pre\u2010treated with LiCl (0.5 mM), cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM gartanin. Western blot was used to investigate the expression level of GSK\u20103\u03b2, and MTT assay was used to investigate the cell viability. Figure 10A and B showed that gartanin suppressed the expression levels of p\u2010GSK\u20103\u03b2 in a time\u2010dependent manner. Figure 10C showed that there was no significant restore of cell viability by pre\u2010treatment with LiCl. Malignant gliomas are characterised by local migration and aggressive proliferation 19. Cell migration takes an important role in tumour invasiveness, metastasis and spreading. The infinite proliferative activity and infiltration nature of tumour cells are important factors in preventing the intact tumour resection, and thus resulting in tumour recurrence and therapeutic failure 20. In this study, results showed that gartanin could potently suppress migration and viability of T98G glioma cells (Fig. 1). It was worth to note that gartanin, at such concentrations, did not cause significant cytotoxicity in mouse normal neurons HT22 cells (Fig. 2E), indicating that gartanin might be a tumour\u2010specific agent. Besides, gartanin also has mighty neuroprotective effect against glutamate\u2010induced cell death in HT22 cells (data not shown and will be reported in another paper of our laboratory). A fundamental reason for aberrant proliferation of tumour cells is dysregulation of cell cycle progression 21. In process of cell cycle, the first critical restriction point is the G1/S phase checkpoint. Cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclins, CDKs and cyclin CDK inhibitors, play a key role in the G1/S transition 22. In particular, the cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 are essential for the regulation of cells to enter S phase. Previous studies showed that xanthones could induce G1 phase arrest in prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and hepatoma 23, 24, 25, 26. Consistently, this study showed that gartanin\u2010induced T98G cell G1 phase arrest accompanied by S phase proportion decreased (Fig. 3A and B). We also found that gartanin increased the expression level of p27Kip1, while decreased the expression level of cyclin D1 (Fig. 3C\u2013F). Thus, anti\u2010viability effect of gartanin could be preliminary explained by cell cycle arrest because of the down\u2010regulation of positive cell cycle regulator and up\u2010regulation of negative cell cycle regulator. In addition, there has been reported that gambogenic acid, a polyprenylated xanthone, induced degradation of cyclin D1 via triggering dephosphorylation of GSK\u20103\u03b2 which is required for cyclin D1 turnover 23, 27. We have also found that gartanin suppressed the expression levels of p\u2010GSK\u20103\u03b2. However, inactivation of GSK\u20103\u03b2 by LiCl cannot abrogate the anti\u2010viability effect of gartanin (Fig. 10). Therefore, the anti\u2010viability effect of gartanin might be irrelevant to GSK\u20103\u03b2 signalling pathway. Besides GSK\u20103\u03b2 signalling pathway, proliferation of cancer is closely related to autophagy 28, 29. Autophagy, degrading cellular macromolecules or organelles, is an evolutionarily highly conserved catabolic pathway 30. The capacity of autophagy to maintain cellular metabolism improves the survival of cells. Paradoxically, autophagy has also been implicated in cell death called autophagic or type II programmed cell death 30. Previous studies have showed that xanthones, including \u03b1\u2010mangostin, gambogenic acid and gartanin, could induce protective autophagy or autophagic cell death in chronic myeloid leukaemia cells 23, human urinary bladder cancer cells 14, lung cancer cells 31, hepatocellular carcinoma cells 13 and glioblastoma cells 29. In this research, we also found that gartanin, a polyprenylated xanthone, obviously induced autophagy that was determined by the conversion of LC3\u2010I to LC3\u2010II, the degradation of p62, the increase in Beclin 1 and GFP\u2010LC3 punctate fluorescence (Fig. 6). Moreover, anti\u2010viability effect of gartanin was significantly abolished by CQ or 3\u2010MA, two autophagy inhibitors (Fig. 8). Further study showed that accumulation in G1 phase of gartanin group was significantly abrogated by pre\u2010treatment with 3\u2010MA (Fig. 9). Concomitantly, the decrease in cyclin D1 and increase in p27Kip1 were abolished by pre\u2010treatment with 3\u2010MA (Fig. 9). Accordingly, to some degree, the anti\u2010viability effect of gartanin on T98G cells involves cell cycle arrest which was regulated by autophagy. It is well known that PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway has been frequently implicated in regulating autophagy 32. Gartanin, here, inhibited key points of PI3K pathway, such as p\u2010PI3K, p\u2010Akt and p\u2010mTOR, in a time\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 7). Data suggest gartanin is a potentially effective anti\u2010viability agent against glioma, and this anti\u2010viability effect involves autophagy which is induced by inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Local migration is another malignant phenotype of glioma. Although distant metastasis is pretty rare, the characteristic of the glioma cells that migrating into adjacent brain tissue makes intact resection impossible 4, 5, 6. Hence, interruption of the migration process is an effective approach for the treatment of glioma. Previous studies showed that \u03b1\u2010mangostin suppressed metastasis in melanoma cells 16, PC\u20103 human prostate carcinoma cells 33, MCF\u20107 human breast adenocarcinoma cells 34 and pancreatic cancer cells 35. Consistently, our research found that gartanin displayed obvious inhibition of motility in a concentration\u2010dependent manner via wound healing assay and RTCA (Fig. 4). The first step of tumour cells migration is the breakdown of the basement membrane by the activated type IV collagen\u2010degrading enzymes including MMP\u20102 and MMP\u20109 36. It has been reported that \u03b1\u2010mangostin suppressed invasion by inhibiting MMP\u20102/\u20109 33. We also found that gartanin suppressed the proteolytic activities of MMP\u20102/\u20109 in T98G cells via gelatin zymographic assay. To the best of our knowledge, MAPK pathway is one of the most important signalling pathways regulating the synthesis of MMP\u20102 and MMP\u20109 37, 38. It is reported that activated ERK1/2 or p38 could increase the production of MMPs 39. On the contrary, inhibition of ERK signalling pathway might result in decreased expression of MMP\u20102 and MMP\u20109 in human breast adenocarcinoma cells 34. To explore the mechanism, we investigated the expression level of p\u2010ERK, p\u2010JNK and p\u2010p38 in T98G cells. Gartanin (10 \u03bcM) significantly decreased the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 (Fig. 5). As for p\u2010ERK, its expression level was increased at the time\u2010point of 3 hrs (Fig. 5A). Besides anti\u2010tumour activity, it is also reported that gartanin possessed neuroprotective activity against stress injury 40. In this study, cells were in stress state in the early stage. Gartanin might exert transitorily protective effect against injury through the activation of ERK. However, more studies are needed to reveal the exact mechanism(s). What's more, autophagy had nothing to do with anti\u2010migration effect of gartanin (Fig. 9). Thus, anti\u2010migration effect of gartanin could be preliminary explained by down\u2010regulation of MMP\u20102/\u20109 as a result of the suppressed MAPK signalling pathway (Fig. 5). In summary, gartanin, at low micromole, effectively inhibits viability and migration ability of malignant glioma cells mainly by cell cycle arrest and suppression of MMPs. Gartanin, the natural xanthone isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen fruit, might be a promising drug for the treatment of gliomas, alone or combined with other conventional chemotherapy drugs. However, further studies are needed to reveal the exact mechanism(s) and confirm these effects in vivo.

The renin\u2013angiotensin system is involved in tumor growth and metastases. This study was designed to evaluate the role of angiotensin II subtype receptor 1a (AT1a) in the formation of liver metastasis in CRC. A model of liver metastasis was developed by intrasplenic injection of mouse colon cancer (CMT\u201093) into AT1a knockout mice (AT1aKO) and wild\u2010type (C57BL/6) mice (WT). Compared with WT mice, the liver weight and liver metastatic rate were significantly lower in AT1aKO. The mRNA levels of CD31, transforming growth factor\u2010 \u03b21 (TGF\u2010\u03b21), and F4/80 were suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT. Double immunofluorescence analysis showed that the number of accumulated F4/80+ cells expressing TGF\u2010\u03b21 in metastatic areas was higher in WT than in AT1aKO. The AT1aKO bone marrow (BM) (AT1aKO\u2010BM)\u2192WT showed suppressed formation of liver metastasis compared with WT\u2010BM\u2192WT. However, the formation of metastasis was further suppressed in WT\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO compared with AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT. In addition, accumulated F4/80+ cells in the liver metastasis were not BM\u2010derived F4/80+ cells, but mainly resident hepatic F4/80+ cells, and these resident hepatic F4/80+ cells were positive for TGF\u2010\u03b21. Angiotensin II enhanced TGF\u2010\u03b21 expression in Kupffer cells. Treatment of WT with clodronate liposomes suppressed liver metastasis by diminishing TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ cells accumulation. The formation of liver metastasis correlated with collagen deposition in the metastatic area, which was dependent on AT1a signaling. These results suggested that resident hepatic macrophages induced liver metastasis formation by induction of TGF\u2010\u03b21 through AT1a signaling.\n", "fulltext": "Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer\u2010related death in Japan that is associated with changes in lifestyle toward a Western diet.1 Approximately 20% of patients with a diagnosis of CRC already have metastasis.2 Liver metastasis is a common complication of CRC that has an impact on outcomes. The mechanisms of early metastasis formation remain unclear. Resident and tumor\u2010infiltrating cells form tumor microenvironments that have an important role in cancer initiation and progression.3 These cells regulate the release of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and pro\u2010angiogenic factors.4, 5 Transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b21 is one of the major cytokines that induces phenotypic changes such as EMT of tumor cells, thereby facilitating their extravasation and dissemination to distant sites during metastasis.6 Transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b21 is also known to be a promoter of tumor progression and profibrotic agent associated with the ability of EMT activator.6 The RAS plays an important role in the cardiovascular system and regulation of blood pressure.7 Angiotensin II is converted to mediator Ang 1\u20108 by ACE.8 The activation of Ang II has been shown to stimulate the expression of VEGF, SDF\u20101, and TGF\u2010\u03b21.9, 10 Angiotensin II is known to be mediated by seven transmembrane receptors, and two major subtypes have been identified, AT1 and AT2.11 AT1 consists of two isoforms, AT1a and AT1b.11 Previous studies showed that the genetic depletion of AT1a inhibits tumor cell growth.12 We have also reported that the AT1 receptor antagonist TCV\u2010116 or the genetic depletion of AT1a suppresses tumor growth and lung metastasis formation.9 Previous studies have reported that the RAS inhibits growth of CRC liver metastasis in the regenerating liver.13, 14, 15 The expressions of AT1 receptor in KCs and macrophages are increased in metastatic liver.16 Blockade of AT1 receptor inhibits liver metastasis.16 However, the precise mechanism of the contributions of AT1a receptor signaling to liver metastasis remains to be clarified. A recent study showed that uptake of tumor cell\u2010derived exosomes by KCs induces TGF\u2010\u03b21 secretion and formation of a premetastatic niche.17 These findings led us to hypothesize that the development of liver metastasis is facilitated by TGF\u2010\u03b21 secreted from KCs through AT1a signaling. The present study was thus designed to investigate the role of AT1a signaling in liver metastasis and to explore the underlying mechanisms of metastasis regulated by AT1a signaling. Male C57BL/6 mice, 6\u20138 weeks old and weighing 20\u201325 g, were obtained from the CLEA Japan Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center (Fuji, Japan). AT1a knockout mice (AT1aKO) with a C57BL/6 hybrid background were generated by our research group. The mice were kept continuously on a 12:12\u2010h light:dark cycle. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for animal experiments of Kitasato University School of Medicine (Kanagawa, Japan). Mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) throughout the experiments. The adequacy of anesthesia was monitored on the basis of disappearance of the pedal withdrawal reflex. The hair was shaved from the left flank, and the skin was rubbed with ethanol pads. A 0.5\u2010cm incision was made in the left flank adjacent to the spleen, as described previously.18 CMT\u201093 (CCL\u2010223; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), a murine colorectal cancer cell line, was maintained in DMEM (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) and RPMI\u20101640 medium (Sigma), containing 10% FBS. These cancer cells (2.0 \u00d7 106) in 200 \u03bcL PBS were slowly injected into the spleen of WT and AT1aKO using a 27\u2010G needle. Five minutes after the injection, the spleen was removed, and the wound was closed with surgical clips. Two weeks after injection of CMT\u201093 cells, the mice were killed with an i.p. overdose of pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg). Liver metastases were identified macroscopically. The rate of hepatic metastases was expressed by dividing the number of mice with hepatic metastases by the total number of mice. The total numbers in WT and AT1a KO were 20, respectively. The livers were resected and weighed. Sections (4\u2010\u03bcm thick) were prepared from paraffin\u2010embedded tissue and stained with H&E. Images of H&E\u2010stained sections were captured under a fluorescence microscope (Biozero BZ\u20109000 Series; Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The area of liver metastasis was measured using ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD, USA). Transcripts encoding AT1a\u2010R, AT1b\u2010R, AT2\u2010R, F4/80, TGF\u2010\u03b21, SDF\u20101 (CXCL12), VEGF\u2010A, CD31, MCP\u20101 (CCL2), Col1a1, and GAPDH were quantified by real\u2010time PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from liver tissues with TRIzol reagent (Gibco\u2010BRL; Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) and single\u2010stranded cDNA was generated from 1 \u03bcg total RNA by RT with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, New York, NY, USA). Quantitative PCR was carried out with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The real\u2010time PCR primers were designed using Primer 3 software (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/) based on data from GenBank. The DNA sequences of mouse primers used for real\u2010time PCR are described in Table 1. Data were normalized to the level of GAPDH in each sample. Liver tissue was immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde. After fixation, the tissue was dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and then embedded in paraffin. Each section (4 \u03bcm) of the paraffin\u2010embedded tissue was mounted on a glass slide and either stained with H&E or processed for immunohistochemistry. For the latter, sections were activated using Histo VT One (Nacalai Tesque, Yokohama, Japan) and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with one of the following primary antibodies: (a) anti\u2010mouse F4/80 antibody (1:200, rat monoclonal, sc52664; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); (b) anti\u2010mouse TGF\u2010\u03b21 antibody (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, ab92486; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); (c) anti\u2010mouse GFP antibody (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, ab290; Abcam); (d) anti\u2010mouse Ang II type 1A receptor antibody (1:100, rabbit polyclonal, bs\u20102132R; Bioss, Boston, MA, USA); (e) anti\u2010mouse desmin antibody (1:100, goat polyclonal, ab80503; Abcam); (f) anti\u2010mouse type I collagen antibody (1:100, rabbit polyclonal, ab21286; Abcam); or (g) anti\u2010mouse CD31 antibody (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, ab28364; Abcam). For primary antibodies (a\u2013f), after washing in PBS, the sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated donkey anti\u2010rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated donkey anti\u2010rat IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), and Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated donkey anti\u2010goat IgG (Molecular Probes). For primary antibodies (f, g), after immersion in a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 30 min, the sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with N\u2010Histofine Simple Stain Mouse MAX PO (Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) and were immersed in 0.02% 3,3\u2032\u2010diaminobenzine and 0.3% nickel ammonium sulfate in 50 mM Tris\u2010HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.005% H2O2 for 3 min. Images were captured with a light microscope and a fluorescence microscope (Biozero BZ\u20109000 Series; Keyence). For primary antibodies (a\u2013e), the numbers of positive cells in metastases in the whole fields (\u00d7200 magnification) were counted. For primary antibody (f), the positive area in the whole fields (\u00d7200 magnification) was calculated with the use of ImageJ image analysis software. The KUP5 KC line19 was seeded on 12\u2010well chamber glass slides (354 118; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well with the growth medium. Three different concentrations of Ang II (0.001, 0.1, and 10 \u03bcM) were added to serum\u2010free media for 6 and 12 h. For the BM transplantation experiments, transgenic mice expressing GFP against a C57BL/6 background (a gift from Dr. M. Okabe, Genome Information Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) were used to confirm BM chimerism. AT1aKO and GFP+ mice were crossed to obtain GFP+ AT1aKO. Bone marrow transplantation experiments were carried out as described previously.20 In brief, donor BM was obtained by flushing the cavities of AT1aKO and WT/GFP transgenic mice with PBS. The flushed BM cells were dispersed and resuspended in PBS at a density of 1.0 \u00d7 106 cells/100 \u03bcL. Both WT and AT1aKO were lethally irradiated with 10 Gy using an MBR\u20101505 R X\u2010ray irradiator (Hitachi Medico, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a filter (copper, 0.5 mm; aluminum, 2 mm). The cumulative radiation dose was monitored. The BM mononuclear cells of GFP mice (2.0 \u00d7 106 cells/200 \u03bcL) were transplanted into irradiated WT and AT1aKO through the tail vein. After 8 weeks, blood was collected and analyzed by FACS. Mice in which more than 90% of peripheral leukocytes were GFP\u2010positive were used in the experiments. Protein levels of type I collagen in the liver at day 0 and day 14 after injecting cancer cells were measured using a specific ELISA kit (Mouse Type I collagen detection kit, 6012; Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA). To deplete KCs, mice were injected i.v. with 200 \u03bcL clodronate liposomes (F70101C\u2010N; FormuMax Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, USA) or control liposomes (F70101\u2010N) 2 days before cancer cell injection into the spleen. Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SD. All statistical analyses were undertaken using GraphPad Prism software, version 5.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Student's t\u2010test or the Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test were used for comparisons between two experimental groups with or without normal distribution, respectively. Comparisons between multiple groups were carried out using one\u2010way anova. The results of survival experiments were analyzed using log\u2013rank tests and are presented as Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves. P\u2010values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. We determined the expression of AT receptors in the metastatic livers from WT (C57BL/6) mice. Compared with PBS injection, the expression of AT1a in the metastatic liver was enhanced after injection of CMT\u201093 cells, whereas there were no significant differences in the expression of AT1b (P = 0.057) or AT2 (P = 0.114; Fig. 1a). These results suggested that AT1a signaling is related to liver metastasis formation. To examine the effect of endogenous AT1a signaling on liver metastasis formation, we compared the liver weight and the rate of metastasis between AT1aKO and WT (Fig. 1b,c). Compared with WT, the liver weight (WT 1.32 \u00b1 0.04 g vs AT1aKO 1.03 \u00b1 0.01 g; P < 0.05; Fig. 1b) and rate of metastasis (WT 87.5 \u00b1 8.5% vs AT1aKO 17.1 \u00b1 5.7%; P < 0.05; Fig. 1c) were significantly suppressed in AT1aKO. The colon cancer cell line CMT\u201093 substantially formed liver metastases in WT mice, whereas liver metastasis formation was less in AT1aKO mice (Fig. 1d,e). We also confirmed that AT1aKO mice injected with another colon cancer cell line, Colon 38, significantly suppressed liver metastasis formation (Fig. S1). The metastatic areas in the liver in macro (WT 2.64 \u00b1 0.33 cm2 vs AT1aKO 0.07 \u00b1 0.07 cm2; Fig. 1f) and in micro (WT 1.60 \u00b1 0.56 mm2 vs AT1aKO 0.08 \u00b1 0.03 mm2; Fig. 1g) were significantly suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT. Furthermore, 60 days after the injection of CMT\u201093 cells, the survival rate of WT was 30%, while that of AT1aKO was 90% (Fig. 1h). These results suggested that AT1a signaling facilitates not only liver metastasis formation but also serves as a prognostic factor for liver metastasis. AT1a has been suggested to be expressed in KCs16 and HSCs.21 To further examine the cellular source of AT1a in liver metastatic areas, dual immunofluorescence was carried out 14 days after CMT\u201093 injection. Immunofluorescence double staining of liver sections of WT with antibodies against AT1a and F4/80 or desmin, a marker for HSCs,22 indicated that AT1a was expressed mainly in KCs (F4/80\u2010positive cells; Fig. S2a), and partly in HSCs (desmin\u2010positive cells; Fig. S2b). These results suggest that AT1a is derived mainly from KCs, and partly from HSCs, during the progression of CRC liver metastasis. Tumor metastasis formation is related to angiogenesis.23 Therefore, we investigated the expressions of CD31, VEGF\u2010A, SDF\u20101, and TGF\u2010\u03b21 in the liver 14 days after CMT\u201093 injection. The expression of CD31 mRNA was significantly suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT (Fig. 2a). In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 showed that more CD31\u2010positive cells were located in metastatic areas in WT than in AT1aKO (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, we examined the expression of angiogenesis\u2010stimulating factors, including VEGF\u2010A, SDF\u20101, and TGF\u2010\u03b21. The expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 in the liver was significantly lower in AT1aKO than in WT, but there were no significant differences in VEGF\u2010A or SDF\u20101 expression between the two groups (Fig. 2c\u2013e). It is commonly accepted that macrophages are related to liver metastasis formation.24 Macrophages secrete angiogenesis\u2010stimulating factors to regulate metastasis formation. We therefore examined the expression of macrophage markers by means of real\u2010time PCR analysis. The mRNA levels of F4/80 in livers from AT1aKO were significantly suppressed compared with the levels in livers from WT (Fig. 2f). The mRNA levels of MCP\u20101 in AT1aKO were also reduced (Fig. 2g). These results suggested that AT1a signaling is involved in the recruitment of macrophages, which has an important role in tumor growth. Kupffer cells are the resident macrophages of the liver and contribute to the metastatic process.25, 26 To elucidate the role of hepatic macrophages in liver metastasis, we determined the numbers of hepatic macrophages by immunofluorescence analysis. As shown in Figure 3(a), F4/80+ cells markedly accumulated into the metastatic tumors in WT compared with AT1aKO. Infiltrated F4/80+ cells in metastatic areas were significantly increased in WT (5019 \u00b1 699 cells/mm2) compared with AT1aKO (1870 \u00b1 656 cells/mm2; Fig. 3b). A previous study showed that TGF\u2010\u03b21 released from KCs induces tumor cell adhesion.17 The number of TGF\u2010\u03b21+ cells in WT (3655 \u00b1 439 cells/mm2) was larger than in AT1aKO (1291 \u00b1 414 cells/mm2; Fig. 3c). To investigate whether F4/80+ KCs in metastatic tumors express TGF\u2010\u03b21, we carried out double immunofluorescent analysis against TGF\u2010\u03b21 and F4/80 (Fig. 3a). The expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 was colocalized with F4/80+ cells. Accumulation of F4/80+TGF\u2010\u03b21+ cells in the metastatic areas in WT (2962 \u00b1 363 cells/mm2) was enhanced compared with AT1aKO (1064 \u00b1 333 cells/mm2; Fig. 3d). To further focus on the expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 from KCs, we estimated the expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 in mouse clonal KCs (KUP5) under Ang II stimulation. KUP5 expressed AT1 receptors, AT1a and AT1b (Fig. 3e). The expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 was enhanced 6 h after stimulation with Ang II compared with the control (Fig. 3f). There was no significant difference in the expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 at 12 h (Fig. 3f). To determine whether BM\u2010derived macrophages affect liver metastasis formation, we transplanted GFP\u2010expressing BM cells to irradiated mice: BM cells from GFP+ WT or GFP+ AT1aKO were transplanted\u2192WT or AT1aKO. Eight weeks after BM transplantation, CMT\u201093 cells were intrasplenically implanted in chimeric mice (Fig. 4a). In AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT, tumor area (1.97 \u00b1 0.11 cm2) was significantly suppressed compared with that in WT\u2010BM\u2192WT (2.94 \u00b1 0.16 cm2; Fig. 4b). Moreover, tumor area in WT\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (0.72 \u00b1 0.15 cm2) showed a significant increase compared with that in AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (0.17 \u00b1 0.12 cm2; Fig. 4b). These results suggested that AT1a signaling in BM cells is involved in liver metastasis. Interestingly, the tumor area in WT\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO did not increase, but further decreased compared with that in AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT. These results suggested that resident liver cells expressing AT1a rather than BM\u2010derived cells expressing AT1a would induce metastatic formation. To further examine the contribution of BM\u2010derived macrophages or host\u2010derived macrophages to the formation of liver metastasis, immunofluorescence was carried out (Fig. 4c). The numbers of accumulated GFP+ cells in AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT (5917 \u00b1 461 cells/mm2), WT\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (6018 \u00b1 622 cells/mm2) and AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (5891 \u00b1 825 cells/mm2) had a tendency to be suppressed compared with those in WT\u2010BM\u2192WT (8269 \u00b1 422 cells/mm2; Fig. 5a). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance. This result suggested that AT1a signaling in BM cells did not make a significant contribution to the accumulation of BM\u2010derived cells (GFP+ cells) into metastatic areas. The numbers of accumulated F4/80+ cells in WT\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (3902 \u00b1 451 cells/mm2) were suppressed compared with WT\u2010BM\u2192WT (6172 \u00b1 635 cells/mm2; Fig. 5b). However, there were no significant differences in accumulated F4/80+ cells between WT\u2010BM\u2192WT and AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT. Similarly, the numbers of accumulated F4/80+ cells in AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (2622 \u00b1 409 cells/mm2) were suppressed compared with AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT (4754 \u00b1 242 cells/mm2; Fig. 5b). However, the numbers of F4/80+ cells did not differ between AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT and AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO\u2010BM. These results showed that hepatic resident cells expressing AT1a signaling, but not BM\u2010derived cells, contributed to accumulation of F4/80+ cells into liver metastatic lesions. In order to examine whether F4/80+ cells derive from BM or not, we counted the numbers of GFP+F4/80+ cells (Fig. 5c) and GFP\u2212F4/80+ cells in metastatic areas (Fig. 5d). There were no significant differences in the numbers of GFP+F4/80+ cells among four groups (Fig. 5c). By contrast, the changes in numbers of GFP\u2212F4/80+ cells in metastatic areas from each group were basically similar to those of F4/80+ cells in each group (Fig. 5d). The numbers of GFP+F4/80+ cells in WT\u2010BM\u2192WT were approximately 23% of the total numbers of F4/80+ cells in WT\u2010BM\u2192WT, whereas the numbers of GFP\u2212F4/80+ cells were approximately 77% of the total numbers of F4/80+ cells (Fig. 5e). In addition, in another three groups, the percentages of GFP+F4/80+ cells were approximately 20%\u201330%, whereas those of GFP\u2212F4/80+ cells were approximately 70%\u201380% (Fig. 5e). These results indicated that accumulated F4/80+ cells in metastatic areas were mainly derived from resident hepatic macrophages (KCs) and partly from BM, and that resident KCs were mainly involved in tumor metastasis. These findings also suggested that AT1a signaling in resident KCs would contribute to liver metastasis formation. As indicated in Figure 3(a), we examined whether accumulated F4/80+ cells expressed TGF\u2010\u03b21 in the BM transplantation model (Fig. 6a). F4/80+ cells were also positive for TGF\u2010\u03b21 (Fig. 6a). The numbers of accumulated TGF\u2010\u03b21+ cells in the metastatic livers from chimeric mice correlated with the numbers of accumulated F4/80+ cells from respective chimeric mice (Fig. 6a,b). The total population of TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ cells in WT\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (2056 \u00b1 171 cells/mm2) was significantly reduced compared with that in WT\u2010BM\u2192WT (3268 \u00b1 396 cells/mm2; Fig. 6c). In addition, the total population of TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ cells in AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (1735 \u00b1 277 cells/mm2) had a tendency to be suppressed compared with that in AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT (2233 \u00b1 231 cells/mm2; Fig. 6c). These results suggested that AT1a signaling accumulated host\u2010derived TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+KCs in metastatic areas. Because AT1a was expressed in HSCs (Fig. S2b), and type I collagen deposition produced by HSCs27 is associated with an increased risk of liver metastasis,28 we examined the cellular source of collagen deposition in metastatic areas. Double immunofluorescence revealed that the expression of type I collagen was colocalized with desmin+ cells (Fig. S3a), but not F4/80+ cells (Fig. S3b). Next, we determined the expression of type I collagen in metastatic areas 14 days after injection of CMT\u201093 cells in WT and AT1aKO. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of type I collagen in metastatic areas was diminished in AT1aKO (Fig. 7a). Quantitative analysis revealed that the total type I collagen\u2010positive area in the liver from AT1aKO (0.05 \u00b1 0.01 mm2/mm2) was suppressed compared with WT (0.19 \u00b1 0.03 mm2/mm2; Fig. 7b). The mRNA expression of Col1a1 in AT1aKO was significantly reduced compared with that in WT (Fig. 7c). Moreover, the protein levels of type I collagen in the livers in AT1aKO (0.42 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcg/mL) was suppressed compared with those in WT (0.76 \u00b1 0.13 \u03bcg/mL; Fig. 7d). These results suggested that HSCs produced type I collagen through AT1a signaling in liver metastatic areas. Bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that the area occupied by type I collagen\u2010positive cells was significantly increased in WT\u2010BM\u2192WT (0.15 \u00b1 0.02 mm2/mm2) compared with WT\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (0.08 \u00b1 0.01 mm2/mm2). Similarly, those cells had a tendency to an increase in AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT (0.09 \u00b1 0.01 mm2/mm2) compared with AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192AT1aKO (0.04 \u00b1 0.01 mm2/mm2; Fig. 7e,f). These results suggested that the expression of type I collagen depended on AT1a signaling in host liver cells. To further elucidate the role of KCs in liver metastasis formation, KCs from WT mice were deleted by injection of clodronate liposomes 2 days before injection of cancer cells. The metastasis area in WT with clodronate liposomes (1.15 \u00b1 0.45 cm2) was reduced compared with that in WT with control liposomes (3.30 \u00b1 0.19 cm2; Fig. 8a). The mRNA expression levels of F4/80, TGF\u2010\u03b21, Col1a1, and CD31 were significantly suppressed in WT with clodronate liposomes compared with WT with control liposomes (Fig. 8b\u2013e). The numbers of TGF\u2010\u03b21+ cells, F4/80+ cells, and TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ cells were suppressed in clodronate liposome\u2010treated WT (1267 \u00b1 472, 1959 \u00b1 596, and 970 \u00b1 378 cells/mm2, respectively) compared with controls (5205 \u00b1 401, 6399 \u00b1 520, and 4192 \u00b1 402 cells/mm2, respectively; Fig. 8f\u2013i). The area occupied by type I collagen\u2010positive cells was suppressed in clodronate liposome\u2010treated mice (0.11 \u00b1 0.02 mm2/mm2) compared with control liposome\u2010treated mice (0.33 \u00b1 0.04 mm2/mm2; Fig. 8j,k). These results suggested that the accumulation of KCs expressing TGF\u2010\u03b21 induces liver metastasis formation associated with production of type I collagen. The focus of this study was to elucidate the role of AT1a signaling in the metastatic progression of CRC in the liver. The genetic depletion of AT1a significantly suppressed liver metastasis. Enhanced mRNA expression of F4/80 and TGF\u2010\u03b21 in the liver metastatic area was associated with the accumulation of F4/80+ cells expressing TGF\u2010\u03b21. Bone marrow transplantation experiments showed the presence of mainly host\u2010derived F4/80+ cells (KCs), but BM\u2010derived F4/80+ cells, to a lesser degree, participated in liver metastasis formation. These results suggested that AT1a signaling promotes liver metastasis formation by accumulated resident hepatic macrophages in association with TGF\u2010\u03b21. Angiotensin II is one of the major components of the RAS that is essential for blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance.6 Angiotensin II binds two receptors, AT1 and AT2. AT1 has two subtypes, receptor AT1a and AT1b.11 Angiotensin II, one of the factors of the RAS, promotes tumor growth with expression of VEGF\u2010A, angiopoietin 2, fibroblast growth factor, and platelet\u2010derived growth factor.3, 4, 29 The expression of AT1 is especially enhanced in cancer.30, 31, 32 In fact, it is reported that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers inhibit the risk of cancer and cancer\u2010related death.33 We have shown that AT1 signaling induces tumor growth and metastasis formation in a lung metastasis model.9 Neo et al.34 reported that treatment with ACE inhibitors suppressed angiogenesis in a mouse model of CRC liver metastasis. These findings led us to focus on the role of AT1a signaling in liver metastasis formation. To examine whether endogenous AT1a signaling has an effect on liver metastasis formation or not, we used AT1aKO. The present study showed suppression of liver metastasis formation in AT1aKO after injection of CMT\u201093 cells. We found that AT1a is expressed mainly in KCs during the progression of CRC liver metastasis, which is consistent with the findings by others.16 Liver metastasis formation is enhanced by angiogenesis\u2010stimulating factors, including TGF\u2010\u03b21, VEGF\u2010A, and SDF\u20101.4, 5 Transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b21 plays important roles in embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and wound healing.35, 36 Furthermore, it is well known to be an immune and inflammation regulator. Upregulation of TGF\u2010\u03b21 induces EMT, a key step in processing metastasis formation, and this creates a microenvironment conducive to infiltration of the target organ by cancer cells.37 The present study showed that the expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 in the metastatic liver was suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT. This finding suggested that the expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 in the metastatic liver was dependent on AT1a signaling. Taken together, AT1a signaling promotes liver metastasis with enhancement of TGF\u2010\u03b21. The TGF\u2010\u03b21 signaling pathway is a key player in tumor development. Angiotensin II activates TGF\u2010\u03b21 signaling.38 In the current study, we showed that F4/80+ KCs coexpressed TGF\u2010\u03b21 in metastatic areas and the expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 depended on AT1a signaling. We also revealed that Ang II enhanced TGF\u2010\u03b21 expression in cultured KCs. Although these findings suggest that Ang II/AT1a activates the TGF\u2010\u03b21 signaling pathway, we further need to elucidate the relative importance of AT1a for activation of TGF\u2010\u03b21 signaling in a liver metastasis model. Macrophages are characterized by high functional plasticity for forming tumor microenvironments that are associated with angiogenesis or facilitation of immune response.39 Resident liver macrophages, KCs, play critical roles in development of microenvironments in primary cancer and liver metastasis formation.40 Our present study showed that the expression of macrophage\u2010related markers, including F4/80 and MCP\u20101, was enhanced in areas of metastasis. These results support the hypothesis that macrophages are related to metastasis formation. Pancreatic cancer exosomes initiate premetastatic niche formation by KCs through TGF\u2010\u03b21 secretion.17 Previous studies have shown that KCs express the RAS components ACE and AT1R. Wen et al.16 reported that the RAS regulates KCs in CRC liver metastasis formation. In the present study, we showed that KUP5 cells, murine KCs, enhanced the expression of TGF\u2010\u03b21 under Ang II stimulation. In this experiment, immunofluorescence against F4/80 was used to detect accumulated macrophages in the metastatic livers. Our results indicated that resident KCs had an important role in liver metastasis formation. We previously reported that AT1a signaling is important for the recruitment of BM cells to metastatic areas.9 The present study showed that recruitment of GFP+ cells infiltrated in liver metastasis was suppressed in AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT compared with WT\u2010BM\u2192WT. Regardless of whether WT\u2010BM or AT1aKO\u2010BM was transplanted, the number of GFP+F4/80+ KCs was suppressed in AT1aKO. Interestingly, the same phenomenon was seen in the numbers of TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ KCs in WT\u2010BM\u2192WT and AT1aKO\u2010BM\u2192WT. Even after transplantation of WT\u2010BM, the total population of GFP+F4/80+ KCs was not elevated. Moreover, the number of accumulated TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ KCs in the metastasis area was much higher than that of GFP+F4/80+ KCs in WT\u2010BM\u2192WT. These results indicated that tissue resident TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ KCs play a role in metastasis formation through AT1a signaling, and that the number of TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ KCs correlated with liver metastasis formation. Regarding the role of KCs in the formation of liver metastasis, conflicting results have been reported. Wen et al.41 showed that KC depletion with gadolinium chloride before tumor induction was associated with an increased tumor burden in metastatic liver, suggesting that KCs show an antitumor effect. Kruse et al.42 reported that KC depletion with clodronate liposomes before tumor induction led to a significant reduction of liver metastasis, which was consistent with our results. These suggest that KCs promote the formation of metastases in the liver. Despite divergent roles of KCs in liver metastasis, KC infiltration appears not to be the result of liver metastasis but the cause of initiation of liver metastasis. As the precise correlation between KCs and liver metastasis still remains unclear, further experiments are needed. Tumor progression and fibrosis are pivotal aspects of malignant tumors. Several factors, including TGF\u2010\u03b21, VEGF\u2010A, SDF\u20101, and Ang II, are regarded as candidate factors involved in cross\u2010talk between tumor cells and stromal cells. As mentioned above, Ang II induces fibrosis in many organs. We previously reported that host\u2010derived AT1a\u2010positive cells, fibroblasts, induce tumor growth.12 The present study suggested that TGF\u2010\u03b21 derived from resident KCs induced liver metastasis formation. We also showed that attenuated expression of host\u2010derived TGF\u2010\u03b21 in AT1aKO was associated with suppressed metastasis formation. In the early stage of metastasis, tumor cell invasion into the extra\u2010sinusoidal space seems to recapitulate this tissue repair process: KCs trigger HSCs and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell activation. This was observed in experimental models and is also evidenced by the increased production of collagen in hepatic metastases in clinical specimens.40 Okamoto et al.43 showed that the Ang II/AT\u20101 axis induced tumor progression and fibrosis in intrahepatic cholangiosarcoma through an interaction with HSC. The present study indicated that the expression of type I collagen, a fibrosis marker, was also suppressed in AT1aKO. We showed that resident F4/80+ KCs expressed TGF\u2010\u03b21 in metastatic tumor areas, in which type I collagen was significantly expressed. Transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b21 mediates fibrogenesis, including collagen deposition, by induction of activated HSCs. Bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that AT1a signaling in host cells accumulated TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ KCs as well as type 1 collagen\u2010productive cells. Further studies are needed to disclose the interaction between accumulated host\u2010derived TGF\u2010\u03b21+F4/80+ KCs and fibrosis formation. In conclusion, AT1a signaling in resident F4/80+ KCs promotes liver metastasis formation by enhancing TGF\u2010\u03b21 expression. Highly selective AT1a antagonists may become a useful treatment for CRC. The authors have no conflict of interest."}}
